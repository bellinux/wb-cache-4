40|$|The author {{explored}} {{the meaning of}} <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community according to a purposeful sample of 60 <b>Black</b> adults in <b>the</b> mid-Atlantic United States. Purposeful stratified sampling resulted in equal numbers of participants {{along the lines of}} locale (Brooklyn, New York; Wilmington, Delaware; and Washington, D. C.), gender, and generational affiliation (older adults, middle-aged adults, and young adults). Content analysis of responses to a single open-ended survey question resulted in 11 emergent themes around the meaning of <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community: <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as cultural, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as residential, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as global, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as supportive, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as visibly distinctive, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as socioeconomic, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as nonactualized, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as nondifferential, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as nihilistic, <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as nondefinable, and <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> community as other. Gender and generational variations in thematic endorsement were analyzed, and implications of these findings as they pertain to research, mental health programs, and policies for Blacks are discussed...|$|R

5|$|There is a socio-political {{cycle of}} order and {{disorder}} where, regardless of who is in power, the same injustices take place: when <b>the</b> <b>blacks</b> take control, they betray their own traditions and {{follow the example of}} European states.

But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he never said a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant {{in the landscape}} are mostly blends of blue and yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes.

The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. <b>The</b> <b>blacks</b> are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
50|$|The {{first book}} in the series, {{published}} in 1941, is titled <b>The</b> <b>Black</b> Stallion. <b>The</b> subsequent novels are about the stallion's three main offspring: his firstborn colt, Satan; his second colt, Bonfire; and his firstborn filly, Black Minx; as well as about <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> himself.

5|$|The {{second section}} of the Fourteenth Amendment punished, by reduced {{representation}} in the House of Representatives, any states that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this signaled to the states that they still possessed the right to deny ballot access to blacks. Northern states were generally as averse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed blacks to vote. In the South, blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through {{the intervention of the}} occupying Union Army. Congress had granted suffrage to <b>the</b> <b>blacks</b> in the territories in 1867 by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act.|$|E
5|$|Although {{based on}} reality, Chain Gang changes the facts {{slightly}} {{to appeal to}} Depression-era audiences by making Allen's return home one to {{a country that is}} struggling economically, even though Burns returned to the roaring twenties. The film's bleak, anti-establishment ending shocked audiences. Laughter in Hell, a 1933 film directed by Edward L. Cahn and starring Pat O'Brien, was inspired in part by I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang. O'Brien plays a railroad engineer who kills his wife and her lover in a jealous rage, and is sent to prison. The dead man's brother ends up being the warden of the prison and torments O'Brien's character. O'Brien and several others revolt, killing the warden and escaping with his new lover (Gloria Stuart). The film, rediscovered in 2012, drew controversy for its lynching scene in which several black men were hanged. Reports vary if <b>the</b> <b>blacks</b> were hanged alongside other white men, or by themselves. The New Age (an African American weekly newspaper) film critic praised the filmmakers for being courageous enough to depict the atrocities that were occurring in some Southern states.|$|E
5|$|Lenormand de Mezy's {{second wife}} has {{died and the}} city has made {{remarkable}} progress. Henri Christophe is a master chef. Twenty years have gone by and Ti Noel has fathered twelve children {{by one of the}} cooks. He has told these children many stories of Macandal and they await his return. A secret gathering of trusted slaves takes place: Bouckman, the Jamaican, speaks of possible freedom for <b>the</b> <b>blacks</b> emerging in France and also mentions the opposition from the plantation landowners. An uprising is planned; {{as a result of this}} meeting, conch-shell trumpets sound and slaves, armed with sticks, surround the houses of their masters. Upon hearing the conch-shells Lenormand de Mezy is frightened and manages to hide. The slaves kill the white men and drink much alcohol. Ti Noel, after drinking, rapes Mademoiselle Floridor, who is Lenormand de Mezy's latest mistress. The uprising is defeated and Bouckman is killed. The governor, Blanchelande, advocates for the complete extermination of the colony's black population, as they pose a threat with their voodoo and secret religion. Several of the rebels are gathered to be publicly executed, but Lenormand de Mezy secures the release of his slaves, including Ti Noel, intending to sell them in the slave markets in Cuba. Lenormand de Mezy takes Ti Noel and other slaves to Cuba, where he becomes lazy, conducts no business, enjoys the women, drinks alcohol, and gambles away his slaves. Pauline Bonaparte accompanies Leclerc, her army general husband, to Haiti. On the way there, she enjoys sexually tempting the men on the ship. Solimán, a black slave, massages her body and lavishes loving care on her beauty. Leclerc develops yellow fever, and Pauline trusts in the voodoo and magic of Solimán to cure him. Leclerc dies, and Pauline returns to Paris while the Rochambeau government treats <b>the</b> <b>blacks</b> very poorly. However, there is the emergence of black priests who allow the slaves to conduct more business internally.|$|E

5|$|The {{most egregious}} episode during the Red Summer was a vicious attack on blacks in Elaine, Arkansas, in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered. Reports {{coming out of}} the South blamed <b>the</b> <b>blacks,</b> alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with the distortions, Du Bois {{published}} a letter in the New York World, claiming that the only crime the black sharecroppers had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities.The sharecroppers were working with the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America. Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as Moore v. Dempsey. Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes. Although the victory had little immediate impact on justice for blacks in the South, it marked the first time the Federal government used the 14th amendment guarantee of due process to prevent states from shielding mob violence.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel {{has been}} {{won in a}} card game by a {{plantation}} owner based in Santiago, and Lenormand de Mezy dies in abject poverty shortly afterwards. Ti Noel saves {{enough money to buy}} his passage, and as a free man, he discovers a free Haiti. Now much older, he realizes that he has returned to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy. Haiti has undergone great development, and the land has come {{under the control of the}} black man. Ti Noel is abruptly thrown into prison and once again made to work as a slave among children, pregnant girls, women, and old men. Henri Christophe, formerly a cook and now king due to the black uprising, is using slaves to construct lavish statues, figures, and a magnificent fortress. Ti Noel considers slavery under a fellow black man worse than that endured at the hands of Lenormand de Mezy. In times past, the loss of a slave would be a financial loss, but as long as there are black women to continue supplying slaves, their deaths are insignificant. Ti Noel escapes and returns to the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy, where he remains for some time, and later returns to the city to find it gripped by fear of Henri Christophe's regime. King Christophe is tormented by thunder strikes and ghosts of formerly tortured subjects, and eventually he and Sans-Souci Palace are overrun by <b>the</b> <b>blacks</b> and by voodoo. Left alone, he commits suicide and his body is taken by the remaining African pages to the magnificent fortress where they bury him in a pile of mortar. The entire mountain becomes the mausoleum of the first King of Haiti.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Sea {{is one of}} the most {{degraded}} seas in the world.
