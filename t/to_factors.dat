5|$|In addition, {{drugs such}} as NMDA {{receptor}} antagonists to halt neurochemical cascades such as excitotoxicity showed promise in animal trials but failed in clinical trials.

50|$|A tool called yafu {{can be used}} to {{optimize}} this process. The automation within YAFU is state-of-the-art, combining factorization algorithms in an intelligent and adaptive methodology that minimizes the time <b>to</b> find the <b>factors</b> of arbitrary input integers.

The time taken <b>to</b> <b>factor</b> n using yafu on the same computer was reduced to 103.1746 seconds. Yafu requires the GGNFS binaries <b>to</b> <b>factor</b> N that are 320 bits or larger.

After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic elements of a work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E

The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist; she has suggested that the popularity of Dawkins's work is due <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have a {{reputation}} with patients and doctors for causing a severe and traumatic withdrawal; however, this is in large {{part due to the}} withdrawal process being poorly managed. Over-rapid withdrawal from benzodiazepines increases the severity of the withdrawal syndrome and increases the failure rate. A slow and gradual withdrawal customised to the individual and, if indicated, psychological support is the most effective way of managing the withdrawal. Opinion as to the time needed to complete withdrawal ranges from four weeks to several years. A goal of less than six months has been suggested, but due <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> such as dosage and type of benzodiazepine, reasons for prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental stresses, and amount of available support, a year or more may be needed to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|In towns, the Cape sparrow {{competes with}} both the native {{southern}} grey-headed sparrow and house sparrow, which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19thcentury. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, {{as it has in}} parts of Europe, declines which are attributed <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E

5|$|The Poor Law system {{fell into}} decline at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century owing <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> such as the introduction of the Liberal welfare reforms and the availability of other sources of assistance from friendly societies and trade unions, as well as piecemeal reforms which bypassed the Poor Law system.

5|$|The house martins nest in colonies on cliffs or buildings, {{constructing}} feather- or grass-lined mud nests. The typical clutch is two {{or three}} white eggs; both parents build the nest, incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. These martins are aerial hunters of small insects such as flies and aphids. Despite their flying skills the Delichon martins are sometimes caught by fast-flying birds of prey. They may carry fleas or internal parasites. None of the species are considered threatened, although widespread reductions in common house martin numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe. This decline is due <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites.|$|E
5|$|The {{numbers of}} the two Asian species are unknown, but both can be locally common or abundant, and the Asian house martin is {{extending}} its range in southern Siberia. The lowland breeding common house martin has greatly benefited from forest clearance, creating the open habitats it prefers, and from human habitation which has given it an abundance of safe man-made nest sites, although widespread declines in its numbers have been reported from central and northern Europe since 1970. This is due <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> including poor weather, poisoning by agricultural pesticides, lack of mud for nest building and competition with house sparrows for nest sites. Despite this, the huge geographical range and large {{numbers of the}} common house martin mean that its global status is secure.|$|E
5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E

5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due <b>to</b> <b>factors</b> such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation important factors in the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
