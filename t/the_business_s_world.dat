40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the first commercial computer into <b>the</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>business</b> <b>world</b> in <b>the</b> early 50 s, the use of computers has grown tremendously. Technology has been advancing at an unbelievable speed, which, on one hand, improves computer capability greatly, and on the other, lowers costs to the extent that even small businesses can afford one. Thus today, computer systems are being used in large and small organizations alike. Along with increases in computer usage, however, have come problems like invasion of privacy and computer-related crime. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the average loss for each reported computer crime is about $ 500, 000 compared with an average loss of $ 3, 200 for bank robberies and $ 23, 500 for bank frauds and embezzlement without computers. 1 But what's more striking is that only one percent of computer crimes are detected and of those detected, only 12 percent are reported to law enforcement authorities. ...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} suggests {{that as much as}} 1 / 3 of <b>the</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>business</b> cycle is due to nominal shocks. We calibrate a multi-sector menu cost model using new evidence on the cross-sectional distribution of the frequency and size of price changes in the U. S. economy. We augment the model to incorporate intermediate inputs. We show that the introduction of heterogeneity in the frequency of price change triples the degree of monetary non-neutrality generated by the model. We furthermore show that the introduction of intermediate inputs raises the degree of monetary non-neutrality by another factor of three, without adversely affecting the model's ability to match the large average size of price changes. Our multi-sector menu cost model with intermediate inputs generates variation in real output in response to calibrated aggregate nominal shocks that can account for roughly 23 % of <b>the</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>business</b> cycle. ...|$|R

40|$|The United States Bureau of the Census creates {{official}} poverty {{rates for}} most economically vulnerable populations, {{but not for}} working-age people with disabilities. We create a comparable poverty measure for working-age people {{with and without disabilities}} using March Current Population Surveys (1980 - 2005) and find that the poverty rate of working-age people with disabilities relative to working-age people without disabilities has grown considerably. While the poverty rate of working-age people without disabilities fell by over 20 percent over the period 1983 to 2004 (trough years of the 1980 s and 1990 <b>s</b> <b>business</b> cycles), <b>the</b> poverty rate of those with disabilities remained about the same. Using shift-share analysis we show that the increase in the poverty rate of working-age people with disabilities over <b>the</b> 1980 <b>s</b> <b>business</b> cycle was not greatly affected by compositional changes, but almost two-thirds of the decline in their poverty rate over <b>the</b> 1990 <b>s</b> <b>business</b> cycle was do to composition changes. When we control for compositional change, we find that the underlying poverty rate of working-age people with disabilities was greater in 2004 than in 1983. When we adjust for compositional changes in both groups, we find that the uncontrolled increase in the relative poverty risk of working-age people with disabilities is slightly reduced over the 1980 s, but rises even more over <b>the</b> 1990 <b>s</b> <b>business</b> cycle. But on net, the underlying relative poverty rate of working-age people with disabilities is far higher in 2004 than in 1983. The first step in reversing these socially unacceptable outcomes is for the United States government to provide an official poverty rate measure of the working-age population with disabilities, both to better track the progress of this economically vulnerable and little understood population and to determine the causes for the increase in their risk of poverty...|$|R

40|$|After {{the recent}} banking crisis in 2008, {{financial}} market conditions {{have turned out}} to be a relevant factor for economic fluctuations. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the impact of financial frictions on <b>the</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>business</b> cycle. <b>The</b> analysis compares the original Smets and Wouters model (2003, 2007) with an alternative version augmented with the financial accelerator mechanism 0 la Bernanke, Gertler and Gilchrist (1996, 1999). Both versions are estimated using Bayesian techniques over a sample extended to 2012. The analysis supports the role of financial channels, namely the financial accelerator mechanism, in transmitting dysfunctions from financial markets to the real economy. The Smets and Wouters model, augmented with the financial accelerator mechanism, is suitable to capture much of the historical developments in U.

The model can account for the output contraction in 2008, as well as the widening in corporate spreads and supports the argument that financial conditions have amplified <b>the</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>business</b> cycle and <b>the</b> intensity of the recession...|$|R
