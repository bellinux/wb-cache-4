Indigenous people comprise 33% of the state population, of which only 5% ever attain an education beyond the primary grade levels. In addition, 90% of all indigenous <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> not have satisfactory academic backgrounds.|$|E

It {{has been found that}} a significant share of (university) <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> not use detection methods such as using text-matching software. A few more try to detect plagiarism by reading term-papers specifically for plagiarism, while the latter method might be not very effective in detecting plagiarism – especially when plagiarism from unfamiliar sources needs to be detected.|$|E

25|$|Child-directed speech also {{catches the}} child's attention, and in {{situations}} where words for new objects are being expressed to the child, this form of speech may help the child recognize the speech cues and the new information provided. Data shows that children raised in highly verbal families had higher language scores than those children raised in low verbal families. Continuously hearing complicated sentences throughout language development increases the child's ability to understand these sentences and then to use complicated sentences as they develop. Studies have shown that students enrolled in high language classrooms have two times the growth in complex sentences usage than students in classrooms where <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> not frequently use complex sentences.|$|E
25|$|Charter {{schools are}} state funded schools which operate {{outside of the}} normal state system. They began in 2014 with 5 small schools. Charter schools {{do not have to}} operate with any {{registered}} or trained teachers. <b>Teachers</b> <b>do</b> not have to have current practicing certificates. They do not have to have a principal. They are allowed to benefit from profit making. They do not have to follow the national curriculum. They receive approximately 3 times the level of funding per student than normal state schools. If the charter school roll drops during the year, the school keeps the extra funding, unlike normal state schools, where funding is matched to students actually attending. If a charter school fails the management/owners are allowed to keep the land and buildings and other capital assets. Charter schools have less compliance with regulations than State schools although teachers must undergo police vetting.|$|E
25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E

500|$|Of the Central Atlas Tamazight {{speakers}}, 40–45% are monolingual, {{while the}} others use Arabic as a second language. Monolingual speakers consist mostly of older generations and children. Women {{are more likely to}} be monolingual than men, since they typically stay in the village while the men go to work in the cities. [...] Since Tamazight is the language of the home, girls grow up speaking Berber languages and pass them on to their children — this gender stratification helps to preserve the language. Bilingual Berber speakers have learned Moroccan Arabic via schooling, migration, media, or through the government. Most rural Berber children are monolingual. [...] They struggle to succeed in schools where the <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> not speak Berber, and require them to learn both Arabic and French.|$|E
2500|$|The popular western {{understanding}} sees kōan as {{referring to}} an unanswerable question or a meaningless statement.

30|$|In brief, the {{findings}} {{revealed that the}} <b>teachers</b> <b>did</b> not have the writing proficiency and writing assessment ability that they needed.

Most of the <b>teachers</b> <b>did</b> not ask for revisions while the research findings underscore the positive effect of revision on improving learners’ writings. They did not use technology and software in teaching writing and giving WCF. These issues should be researched thoroughly to reach a conclusion and try to change teachers’ WCF practice.|$|R

25|$|Second-language {{acquisition}} classroom {{research is}} an area of research in second-language acquisition concerned with how people learn languages in educational settings. There is a significant overlap between classroom research and language education. Classroom research is empirical, basing its findings on data and statistics wherever possible. It is also more concerned with what the learners do in the classroom than with what the <b>teacher</b> <b>does.</b> Where language teaching methods may only concentrate on the activities the teacher plans for the class, classroom research concentrates on the effect the things the <b>teacher</b> <b>does</b> has on the students.|$|R
2500|$|Yet, though {{freedom and}} {{happiness}} {{is a part}} of the Buddhist teachings, these words refer to something different in traditional Asian Buddhism. According to Fronsdal, [...] "when Asian <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> talk about freedom, it is primarily in reference to what one is free from—that is, from greed, hate, delusion, grasping, attachment, wrong view, self, and most significantly, rebirth". Nibbana is the final freedom, and it has no purpose beyond itself. In contrast, freedom in the creative modern interpretation of Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path means living happily and wisely, [...] "without drastic changes in lifestyle". Such freedom and happiness is not the goal of Four Noble Truths and related doctrines within traditional Buddhism, but the vipassana teachings in the West make no reference to traditional Theravada doctrines, instead they present only the pragmatic and experiential goals in the form of therapy for the audience's current lives. The creative interpretations are driven in part because the foundational premises of Buddhism do not make sense to audiences outside of Asia. According to Spiro, [...] "the Buddhist message is not simply a psychological message," [...] but an eschatological message.|$|E
2500|$|Standardized testing {{places a}} lot of stress and {{pressure}} on children and teachers. Teachers are put under {{a lot of}} stress because the better students do on the test the more federal funding that school and district will receive. This causes teachers to teach to the test rather than teach to the life skills children will [...] use and need. In some cases, schools have shortened or removed recess so that more time can be spent preparing and practicing for the standardized tests. The pressure of this and the removal of a stress outlet, recess, means that children, along with teachers, are going to become depressed and sleep-deprived. Being depressed and sleep-deprived causes children to act out more than usual which places more stress on the teachers. <b>Teachers</b> <b>do</b> not get the results back {{until the end of the}} summer which means they will not be able to use those results to help those children because they will already be on to the next grade. Standardized tests place an unnecessary amount of stress on teachers and students without yielding any information in a timely manner.|$|E

40|$|This {{is a mixed}} methods {{research}} into the different perspectives of those teaching dance, who are physical education (P. E.) and dance teachers. It established the dance teaching background and different perspectives of those teaching National Progression Award Dance and/or Higher Dance Practice in secondary schools in Scotland about teaching dance. There has been little research carried out in Scotland on the subject. The main research carried out to date comes from the Delivering Dance in the Curriculum for Excellence (Blanche, 2007), Dance in Scotland (FST, 2011) and the Expressive Arts Excellence Group (2011) reports. Questionnaires were used and the return rate was 41 % of which 75 % {{of the respondents were}} P. E. teachers and 25 % were dance teachers. Analysis showed there were seven different perspectives between those teaching. P. E. <b>teachers</b> <b>did</b> not teach dance elsewhere or have dance qualifications, dance <b>teachers</b> <b>did.</b> Dance <b>teachers</b> believed dance qualifications were necessary to teach, 80 % of the P. E. <b>teachers</b> <b>did</b> not. Most dance teachers auditioned pupils for entry onto the courses, P. E. <b>teachers</b> <b>did</b> not. Dance teachers’ pupils received better Higher Dance Practice examination results and were satisfied with these results. 70 % of the P. E. teachers were not. Finally, no dance teacher received training from their school, while 50 % of P. E. <b>teachers</b> <b>did.</b> The author suggested the following recommendations regarding dance in secondary schools in Scotland; 1. An improved dance unit on the B. Ed P. E. teacher training course. 2. Improved continuing professional development sessions for both P. E. and dance teachers on different dance techniques, as well as sessions with dance specialists and companies. 3. The formulation of a Post Graduate Diploma in Education, centred on dance. 4.

A child, who is studying Geography, or History, or Natural Science, is learning facts,--gaining information; on the other hand, the one who is learning to write, or to read, or to calculate, may be adding little or nothing to his stock of knowledge. He is acquiring skill, which, at some future time, he may make the means of increasing his knowledge, to any extent.|$|E

Oh! that there were men who could believe this, and come out unconditionally, placing themselves in the Bishop's hands unreservedly.

Did Titus ever think of saying to St. Paul, [...] "Mind I must be an elder, or bishop, or whatever he was, of Crete?'

60|$|There are these, {{and more}} than these {{diseases}} of thought, which our ordinary <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> not attempt to remove. Now shall we, because a good nature inclines us to virtue's side, say, There are no doubts,--and lie for the right? Is life to be led in a brave or in a cowardly manner? and is not the satisfaction of the doubts essential to all manliness? Is the name of virtue to be a barrier to that which is virtue? Can you not believe that a man of earnest and burly habit may find small good in tea, essays, and catechism, and want a rougher instruction, want men, labor, trade, farming, war, hunger, plenty, love, hatred, doubt, and terror, to make things plain to him; and has he not a right to insist on being convinced in his own way? When he is convinced, he will be worth the pains.|$|E
60|$|If <b>teachers</b> <b>do</b> universally confine {{themselves}} to limits, which I have been attempting to define, they may accomplish within these limits, {{a vast amount}} of good. By attempting however, to exceed them, the confidence of parents is destroyed or weakened, and the door is closed. In this way, injury to a very great extent has been done in many parts of our country. Parents are led to associate with the very idea of religion, indirect and perhaps secret efforts to influence their children, in a way which they themselves would disapprove. They transfer to the cause of piety itself, the dislike which was first awakened by exceptionable means to promote it; and other teachers, seeing these evil effects, are deterred from attempting what they might easily and pleasantly accomplish. Before therefore, attempting to enforce the duty, and to explain the methods of exerting religious influence in school, I thought proper, distinctly to state, with what restrictions, and within what limits, the work is to be done.|$|E
