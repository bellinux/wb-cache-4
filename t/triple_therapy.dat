Unfortunately, no current therapy regimen {{is able to}} cure the infection in all treated patients. The efficacy of the widely recommended <b>triple</b> <b>therapies</b> is decreasing, and a novel 10 -day sequential therapy has been proposed. Data of 3 previous meta-analyses showed a significantly higher eradication rate following the sequential {{as compared to the}} 7 - 10 days <b>triple</b> <b>therapies.</b> The sequential therapy achieved significantly better results than <b>triple</b> <b>therapies</b> in children, elderly patients, non-ulcer dyspepsia patients, and in those infected with resistant strains towards either clarithromycin or metronidazole. We identified further 10 randomized trials.

40|$|Studies {{concerning}} {{the eradication of}} Helicobacter pylori {{have resulted in a}} proliferation of meta-analyses.

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{guidelines}} recommend dual anti-platelet therapy, {{aspirin and}} clopidogrel, for patients treated with drug-eluting stent for coronary heart disease. In {{a few small}} trials, addition of cilostazol on dual anti-platelet <b>therapy</b> (<b>triple</b> anti-platelet <b>therapy)</b> showed better late luminal loss. In the real-world unselected patients with coronary heart disease, however, the effect of cilostazol on platelet reactivity and ischemic vascular events after drug-eluting stent implantation has not been tested. It is also controversial {{whether there is a}} significant interaction between lipophilic statin and clopidogrel. Methods/Design CILON-T trial was a prospective, randomized, open-label, multi-center, near-all-comer trial to demonstrate the superiority of <b>triple</b> anti-platelet <b>therapy</b> to dual anti-platelet therapy in reducing 6 months' major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, composite of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, target lesion revascularization and ischemic stroke. It also tested whether <b>triple</b> anti-platelet <b>therapy</b> is superior to dual anti-platelet therapy in inhibiting platelet reactivity in patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent. Total 960 patients were randomized to receive either dual anti-platelet <b>therapy</b> or <b>triple</b> anti-platelet <b>therapy</b> for 6 months and also, randomly stratified to either lipophilic statin (atorvastatin) or non-lipophilic statin (rosuvastatin) indefinitely. Secondary endpoints included all components of major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, platelet reactivity as assessed by VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 assay, effect of statin on major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events, bleeding complications, and albumin-to-creatinine ratio to test the nephroprotective effect of cilostazol. Major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events will also be checked at 1, 2, and 3 years to test the 'legacy' effect of <b>triple</b> anti-platelet <b>therapy</b> that was prescribed for only 6 months after percutaneous coronary intervention. Discussion CILON-T trial will give powerful insight into whether <b>triple</b> anti-platelet <b>therapy</b> is superior to dual anti-platelet therapy in reducing ischemic events and platelet reactivity in the real-world unselected patients treated with drug-eluting stent for coronary heart disease.

40|$|Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is {{a common}} {{gastrointestinal}} bacterial strain {{closely associated with the}} incidence of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. A current research and clinical challenge is the increased rate of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori, which has led to a decreased H. pylori eradication rate. In this article, we review recent H. pylori infection and reinfection rates and H. pylori resistance to antibiotics, and we discuss the pertinent treatments. A PubMed literature search was performed using the following keywords: Helicobacter pylori, infection, reinfection, antibiotic resistance, bismuth, proton pump inhibitors, vonoprazan, susceptibility, quintuple therapy, dual therapy, and probiotic. The prevalence of H. pylori has remained high in some areas despite the decreasing trend of H. pylori prevalence observed over time. Additionally, the H. pylori reinfection rate has varied in different countries due to socioeconomic and hygienic conditions. Helicobacter pylori monoresistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole or levofloxacin was common in most countries. However, the prevalence of amoxicillin and tetracycline resistance has remained low. Because H. pylori infection and reinfection present serious challenges and because H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole or levofloxacin remains high in most countries, the selection of an efficient regimen to eradicate H. pylori is critical. Currently, bismuth-containing quadruple therapies still achieve high eradication rates. Moreover, susceptibility-based therapies are alternatives because they may avoid the use of unnecessary antibiotics. Novel regimens, e. g., vonoprazan-containing <b>triple</b> <b>therapies,</b> quintuple therapies, high-dose dual <b>therapies,</b> and standard <b>triple</b> <b>therapies</b> with probiotics, require further studies concerning their efficiency and safety for treating H. pylori...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Triple</b> <b>therapies</b> with proton pump inhibitor/ranitidine {{bismuth citrate}} (RBC), {{clarithromycin}} (C) and either amoxicillin (A) or a nitroimidazole (I) are widely accepted as treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. However, {{it is not}} clear which of these antibiotic combinations should be preferred. AIM: To evaluate whether there is a difference in efficacy between <b>triple</b> <b>therapies</b> with proton pump inhibitor/RBC, clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or a nitroimidazole. METHODS: The literature was examined for randomized trials comparing proton pump inhibitor/RBC-C-A and proton pump inhibitor/RBC-C-I. Studies were grouped according to the type of acid inhibitor used (proton pump inhibitor or RBC) and differences between pooled cure rates were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were identified: seven using RBC, 39 using proton pump inhibitor, one using both. RBC-C-I was somewhat superior to RBC-C-A, although this difference only reached statistical significance in intention-to-treat analysis. Overall, proton pump inhibitor-C-I and proton pump inhibitor-C-A were equally effective, but in nitroimidazole-susceptible strains, proton pump inhibitor-C-I performed better, in nitroimidazole-resistant strains, proton pump inhibitor-C-A performed better. No serious side-effects were reported and pooled drop-out rates were equal. CONCLUSIONS: In general, proton pump inhibitor-C-I and proton pump inhibitor-C-A are equally effective and therefore other factors such as local prevalence of resistant strains, cost of therapy and options for second-line treatment should determine which regimen should be preferred. When using RBC, the RBC-C-I combination is somewhat superior to RBC-C-A...|$|R

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in two Southern Brazilian centers that used two instruments (a generic and a specific one) for measuring the quality of life in patients with chronic hepatitis C: the Short Form- 36 (SF- 36); and the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ) for liver disease. We included patients from two centers without any treatment (control group), or receiving medication (peginterferon + ribavirin ± telaprevir or boceprevir, i. e., respectively, dual, and <b>triple</b> <b>therapies).</b> Results: One hundred and forty-seven patients were included. Patients under treatment (n = 86) had a lower score in 7 of the 8 SF- 36 domains, with statistical significance (p< 0. 05) only for the emotional function domain. Patients who were not treated (n = 58) had higher scores in 4 of the 6 (p< 0. 05) CLDQ domains. A comparison of patients, receiving dual or <b>triple</b> <b>therapies</b> for both questionnaires, was only significant in the Vitality domain from CLDQ. Conclusions: Treatment can affect the subjective perception of patients regarding quality of life. Due to the complexity of the disease, each patient must be evaluated in multiple dimensions.

The patients received follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and/or 13 C-urea breath test 12 – 16 weeks later to define H. pylori status. Their personal and medical history, compliance and side effects were obtained by using a standardized questionnaire. Intention-to-treat analysis revealed that the eradication rate was 87. 84 % in the RAC group and 85. 96 % in the LAC group (p= 0. 56).
