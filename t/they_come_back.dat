25|$|Legal {{recognition}} of same-sex unions in Australia takes {{a variety of}} forms depending on the jurisdiction. Under Australian federal law, same-sex couples can be recognised as de facto relationships, but have no access to marriage, civil unions or other federal relationship registration. Australian states and territories are entitled to create their own laws with respect to same-sex relationship registers and same-sex partnership schemes, with most offering civil unions or other forms of domestic partnership to same-sex couples. Same-sex couples are prevented from marrying by amendments to the Marriage Act 1961, passed in 2004 by the Howard Government and Mark Latham-led Australian Labor Party. Additionally, same-sex couples who are married in countries where same-sex marriage is legal cannot divorce within Australia when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> due to the same-sex marriage ban.|$|E

500|$|When {{predicting}} {{what would}} be in store for season four, Scott Bakula suggested {{that he would like}} to see the crew come to terms with the emotional scars of the mission they had against the Xindi in the third season. He wanted several questions to be covered, such as [...] "How do <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> into society, how do they re-adjust their behaviors? What has happened to them will always be inside of them, every time they're confronted with new situations." [...] Following the resolution of the mission in [...] "", he wanted the crew to receive [...] "a great reception" [...] on their return to Earth. He was pleased with how this was handled in the series, describing [...] "Home" [...] as [...] "a great episode". When actress Jolene Blalock revealed that her character would be getting married in [...] "Home", she joked that she wouldn't need to fight someone – a reference to the [...] episode [...] "Amok Time".

2500|$|A new {{proposal}} links {{military experience}} to anger and aggression, developing aggressive reactions and investigating these effects on those possessing the traits of a serial killer. Castle and Hensley state, [...] "The military provides {{the social context}} where servicemen learn aggression, violence, and murder." [...] Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also a serious issue in the military, also believed to sometimes lead to aggression in soldiers who are suffering from what they witnessed in battle. <b>They</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> to the civilian world and may still be haunted by flashbacks and nightmares, causing severe stress. In addition, it has been claimed that in the rare minority who are claimed to be inclined toward serial killing, violent impulses may be reinforced and refined in war, possibly creating more effective murderers.|$|E
2500|$|To combat visa run, some {{countries}} have limits {{as to how}} long visitors can spend in the country without a visa, {{as well as how}} much time they may have to stay out before [...] "resetting the clock". For example, Schengen countries impose a maximum limit for visitors of 90 days in a 180-day window.

Some other countries, e.g. Thailand, allow visitors who arrive by land from neighbouring countries a shorter length of stay than those who arrive by air.|$|E
2500|$|In The Shrew, {{these lines}} are spoken by Katherina {{near the end}} of the play. Petruchio's {{response}} is to beat her and anally rape her as his [...] "gang" [...] hold her down. As she is being raped, a high-pitched whistle sounds, with Katherina's mouth open as if the noise is her scream. At this point, the lights go down, and when <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> up, Katherina is dressed in an institutional gown. She delivers her final speech as if she has learned it, without any emotion or inflection, and requiring frequent prompting by Petruchio. As she finishes, she is flanked by the modern day couple, one on each side of her, both in wedding attire, posing for imaginary photographers, [...] "a juxtaposition suggesting that marriage legitimates psycho-social and psycho-sexual abuse." [...] The final image of the play is Katherina in a wedding gown, chained to the ground, as a funeral bell tolls. Foregrounding the themes of sadism and brain washing, in this version, the happy ending of Shakespeare's play thus takes on a disturbing irony. Marowitz described his intention in The Shrew as [...] "a head-on confrontation with the intellectual substructure of the play, an attempt to test or challenge, revoke or destroy the intellectual foundation which makes a classic the formidable thing it has become [...] combat the assumptions of a classic with a series of new assumptions, and force it to bend under the power of a new polemic." [...] Due to the extreme nature of the production, the play divided critics and audiences, but it was a huge box office success.|$|E
