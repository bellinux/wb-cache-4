Fred is very entertaining, and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever knew--except Laurie, whose manners are more charming.

60|$|To {{begin with}} this matter of education. You {{probably}} have nearly all seen the admirable lecture lately given by Captain Maxse, at Southampton. It contains a clear {{statement of the}} facts at present ascertained as to our expenditure in that respect. It appears that of our public moneys, for every pound <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> on education we spend twelve either in charity or punishment;--ten millions a year in pauperism and crime, and eight hundred thousand in instruction. Now Captain Maxse adds to this estimate of ten millions public money spent on crime and want, {{a more or less}} conjectural sum of eight millions for private charities. My impression is that this is much beneath the truth, but at all events it leaves out of consideration much the heaviest and saddest form of charity--the maintenance, by the working members of families, of the unfortunate or ill-conducted persons whom the general course of misrule now leaves helpless to be the burden of the rest.|$|E
6000|$|Everyone {{nowadays}} seems demanding increased expenditure upon war preparation. I {{will follow}} the fashion. I will suggest {{that we have the}} courage to restrain and even to curtail our monstrous outlay upon war material and that we begin to spend lavishly upon military and naval education and training, upon laboratories and experimental stations, upon chemical and physical research and all that makes knowledge and leading, and that we increase our expenditure upon these things {{as fast as we can}} up to ten or twelve millions a year. At present we spend about eighteen and a half millions a year upon education out of our national funds, but fourteen and a half of this, supplemented by about as much again from local sources, is consumed in merely elementary teaching. So <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> only about four millions a year of public money on every sort of research and education above the simple democratic level. Nearly thirty millions for the foundations and only a seventh for the edifice of will and science! Is it any marvel that we are a badly organised nation, a nation of very widely diffused intelligence and very second-rate guidance and achievement? Is it any marvel that directly we are tested by such a new development as that of aeroplanes or airships we show ourselves in comparison with the more braced-up nations of the Continent backward, unorganised unimaginative, unenterprising? ...|$|E

5000|$|Recently, {{the press}} has been filled with reports of {{sightings}} of flying saucers. While we need not give credence to these stories, they allow our imagination to speculate on how visitors from outer space would judge us. I am afraid they would be stupefied at our conduct. They would observe that for death planning we spend billions to create engines and strategies for war. They would also observe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> millions to prevent death by disease and other causes. Finally they would observe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> paltry sums for population planning, even though its spontaneous growth is an urgent threat to life on our planet. Our visitors from outer space could be forgiven if they reported home that our planet is inhabited by a race of insane men whose future is bleak and uncertain.There is no human circumstance more tragic than the persisting existence of a harmful condition for which a remedy is readily available. Family planning, to relate population to world resources, is possible, practical and necessary. Unlike plagues of the dark ages or contemporary diseases {{we do not yet}} understand, the modern plague of overpopulation is soluble by means we have discovered and with resources we possess.What is lacking is not sufficient knowledge of the solution but universal consciousness of the gravity of the problem and education of the billions who are its victims...|$|E
5000|$|King Gizzard's next {{full-length}} album, Sketches of Brunswick East, {{a collaboration}} with Alex Brettin's psychedelic jazz project Mild High Club, {{was released on}} 18 August 2017. Taking inspiration from Miles Davis' 1960 album Sketches Of Spain, {{as well as the}} band's base recording location of Brunswick East in Melbourne, it is a jazz-improvisational album. Mackenzie described the record as [...] "perhaps representing greater changes that are happening in the wider world, and (this is) our attempt to find beauty within a place <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> so much time", referring to the constant changes in their neighbourhood.|$|E

5000|$|The Latin phrase Pereunt et Imputantur, a {{favourite}} motto for clocks and sundials, {{was written}} by the Latin poet Martial.

5000|$|It's {{in fact in}} this {{beautiful}} desperation <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> our days, that we face the pretty grim prospect of new ones, that we go and come and talk and pretend, that we consort, so far as in our deep-dyed hypocrisy we do consort, {{with the rest of}} the Family, that we have Sunday supper with the Parents and emerge, modestly yet virtuously shining, from the ordeal; that we put in our daily appearance at the Works—for a utility nowadays so vague that I'm fully aware (Lorraine isn't so much) of the deep amusement I excite there, though I also recognize how wonderfully, how quite charitably, they manage not to break out with it: bless, for the most part, their dear simple hearts! ...|$|E

Granted, <b>that</b> {{whenever}} <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> {{money for}} whatever purpose, we set people to work; and passing by, for the moment, {{the question whether}} the work we set them to is all equally healthy and good for them, <b>we</b> will assume <b>that</b> whenever <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> a guinea <b>we</b> provide {{an equal number of}} people with healthy maintenance for a given time. But, by the way in which <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> it, <b>we</b> entirely direct the labour of those people during <b>that</b> given time. <b>We</b> become their masters or mistresses, and we compel them to produce, within a certain period, a certain article. Now, that article may be a useful and lasting one, or it may be a useless and perishable one--it may be one useful to the whole community, or useful only to ourselves. And our selfishness and folly, or our virtue and prudence, are shown, not by our spending money, but by our spending it for the wrong or the right thing; and we are wise and kind, not in maintaining a certain number of people for a given period, but only in requiring them to produce during that period, the kind of things which shall be useful to society, instead of those which are only useful to ourselves.|$|R

50|$|The {{prevailing}} use {{of social}} media {{and its impact}} on mediated relationships also requires further study of PSI (Branch, Wilson, & Agnew, 2013). Different social media platforms provide channels through which celebrities communicate with their followers easily, making parasocial interaction/relationships seem less unidirectional and perhaps more satisfying and intense (Labrecque, 2014). As such, whether social media has made PSI more a part of everyday life needs further exploration. Baek, Bae, and Jang (2013) also mentioned that technological development have been raising questions regarding the role of PSI in our social lives, as media content is available in more places and times. Our mediated friends are never too far away, instead, they actually rest in our pockets and sleep in our beds. Whether this means <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> more time and effort on cultivating these relationships and will be less dependent on real social relationships, needs further exploration (Labrecque, 2014).|$|E
5000|$|In 2016, Pinstripe was {{a finalist}} {{at the third}} SXSW Gaming Awards under the {{category}} 'Gamer’s Voice Award (single player)'. [...] Upon its release, the reviews were mixed. Jeremy Winslow, writing at GameSpot awarded the game 5/10, criticising the narrative as pedestrian, and [...] "failing to inspire emotional attachment in its characters". For Winslow, this, and flaws in its puzzle design, combat and platforming overpowered the game's rich atmosphere. [...] At Time, Matt Peckham was much more positive, awarding the game 5/5. Peckham described the game's depiction of hell as [...] "a melange of beauty and horror" [...] and compared it to the works of Bosch, Bruegel and Dante. He concluded the review, by reflecting on the themes raised by the game, [...] "What does loss resemble? How does it sound? What if the museums to mistakes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>spend</b> lifetimes assembling in our minds were a physical space?" ...|$|E
