5|$|Adams would {{sometimes}} accept challenge matches at his performances. For example, at an exhibition held in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1889, Adams played against twenty {{of the best}} players in the city.

5|$|As {{for every}} match in the 2010–11 FA Cup, {{the ball for}} the final was {{provided}} by Nike-owned, Manchester-based sports equipment company Umbro. The Umbro Neo Pro features a 14-panel design, and is patterned in blue and red. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> {{to be used in}} the game arrived on the previous Wednesday, while the ball to be used at kick-off was delivered to the stadium on the day of the game.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ball</b> can {{be thrown}} in several ways. Throwing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while running causes <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{to move in}} the {{direction}} faced. Throwing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while standing still allows a 360 degree aim, with better tracking. Throwing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> while jumping increases the force at which <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> hits.|$|R
40|$|An {{actuator}} {{includes a}} ball nut, a ball screw, and a <b>ball</b> screw stop. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> nut {{is adapted to}} receive an input torque and in response rotates and supplies a drive force. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> screw extends through <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> nut and has a first end and a second end. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> screw receives <b>the</b> drive force from <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> nut and in response selectively translates between a retract position and a extend position. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> screw stop is mounted on <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> screw proximate <b>the</b> first end to translate therewith. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> screw stop engages <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> nut when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> screw is in the extend position, translates, with compliance, a predetermined distance toward the first end upon engaging <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> nut, and prevents further rotation of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> screw upon translating the predetermined distance...|$|R
25|$|Play {{begins at}} the start of each half with one team place-kicking <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from its own 35-yard line.

5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after {{completing}} objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} door of the house that appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house in order to get to Louis suggests to Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
40|$|An {{actuator}} {{includes a}} housing assembly, a ball nut, a ball screw, and a <b>ball</b> screw stop. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> nut is rotationally {{mounted in the}} housing assembly, is adapted to receive an input torque, and is configured, upon receipt thereof, to rotate and supply a drive force. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> screw is mounted within the housing assembly and extends through <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> nut. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> screw has a first end and a second end, and is coupled to receive the drive force from <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> nut. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> screw is configured, upon receipt of the drive force, to selectively translate between a stow position and a deploy position. <b>The</b> <b>ball</b> screw stop is mounted on <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> screw to translate therewith and is configured to at selectively engage the housing assembly while <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> screw is translating, and engage <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> nut when <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> screw is in the deploy position...|$|R
50|$|The game {{presents}} a top-down {{view of a}} simple version of soccer (there are no fouls, substitutions, or strategies). Players must dribble and pass <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> towards {{one end of the}} field and try to score a goal by forcing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into <b>the</b> opposing team's net. When the player's team has <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> he or she can either dribble <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> across <b>the</b> field, kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> towards <b>the</b> goal, pass <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in <b>the</b> air to another team member, or kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> forward in <b>the</b> direction that the player is currently facing. When the opposing team has <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>the</b> player can switch between different team members on the field, or slide kick their opponent to dislodge <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from their control.|$|R
25|$|By putting {{backspin}} on <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>the</b> Magnus effect {{results in}} air travelling {{over the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> quickly and cleanly whilst air travelling under <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is turbulent. <b>The</b> lift produced means that <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> drops slower and travels further than a normal delivery. The slower descent also results in <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> bouncing lower.|$|R
5|$|Another style {{the dance}} {{industry}} created {{in response to}} hip-hop was jazz-funk. This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color. The resident dance troupe, The Fly Girls, opened and closed every show with a hip-hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez. Jazz-funk (also called street-jazz) is a hybrid of hip-hop and jazz dance. R singer Beyoncé uses this style. Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style. They have choreographed for K-pop singers Jay Park and G.NA {{as well as for}} K-pop boy bands 2PM and B2ST. Although jazz-funk borrows from hip-hop dance, it is not considered a style of hip-hop because the foundational movements are jazz. In hip-hop—even in lyrical hip-hop—there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on relevé (on <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> of the feet). However, these methods are used in jazz-funk and in jazz dance in general.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Adams {{created the}} concept of the shortstop position, {{according}} to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved toward the infield, since the distance <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> could travel increased. Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving empty space in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.|$|E
5|$|Australia and England {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Following his unbeaten 159 in {{the previous}} match and Brown's struggles when playing in the middle-order, Loxton took Brown's position. Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 in the middle-order in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests. As fast bowling all rounder Keith Miller had been struggling with a back injury that prevented him from bowling from time to time, Loxton {{was seen as a}} necessary reinforcement for the frontline bowlers. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and Loxton bowled first change, sending down seven overs for the loss of 18 runs. The Australians themselves opened with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and needed to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over, his first in Ashes cricket. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant George Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> pass.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{impacting}} the ground, some translational {{kinetic energy}} {{can be converted}} to rotational kinetic energy and vice-versa depending on <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> impact angle and angular velocity. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> moves horizontally at impact, friction will have a 'translational' component in the direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> motion. In <b>the</b> figure, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is moving to the right, and thus it will have a translational component of friction pushing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to <b>the</b> left. Additionally, if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is spinning at impact, friction will have a 'rotational' component in the direction opposite to <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> rotation. On <b>the</b> figure, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is spinning clockwise, and the point impacting the ground is moving to the left with respect to <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> center of mass. The rotational component of friction is therefore pushing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> to <b>the</b> right. Unlike the normal force and the force of gravity, these frictional forces will exert a torque on <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> and change its angular velocity (omega&).|$|R
50|$|The nearest {{official}} typically blows his whistle after <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> becomes dead {{to alert}} the players that the down has already ended. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is alive and the official sounds an inadvertent whistle, then <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> still becomes dead, but the team in possession of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> may elect to have the down replayed or take the spot where <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was declared dead. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was loose from a fumble, then <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> can be put into play at the spot of the fumble. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> was in flight from a kick or a pass, then the down is always replayed.|$|R
50|$|Curl or bend in {{association}} football is spin on <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{which will make}} it change direction, called a 'screw shot' in the 19th century. When kicking <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>the</b> inside of the foot {{is often used to}} curl <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> but this can also be done by using the outside of the foot. Similar to curl, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> can also swerve in the air, without the spin on <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> which makes <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> curl.|$|R
5|$|However, {{his career}} turned sour in a match against Victoria in January 1930. After {{contributing}} three not out in Western Australia's first innings of 187, Halcombe opened the bowling for Western Australia from the pavilion {{end of the}} Melbourne Cricket Ground. He delivered the first three balls to Clive Sindrey who took a single from the third ball. Leo O'Brien then faced Halcombe and umpire Andrew Barlow no-balled Halcombe six times in succession from square leg. One of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> struck O'Brien in the hand and forced him to retire with a burst blister on the palm, while another went for four byes. After the first two no ball decisions, the Western Australian captain Richard Bryant conferred with Barlow, but when Halcombe resumed, the umpire continued to call him for throwing. After the sixth no ball, Halcombe threw the ball to his skipper in disgust. After another discussion, he bowled at significantly reduced pace and completed his over. Victoria took a lead of 22, before Western Australia compiled 311, with Halcombe scoring 10 not out. With Halcombe out of the attack, Victoria {{went on to win}} by four wickets.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to playing the game, Adams {{was involved in}} the production of early baseball equipment. He personally manufactured baseballs for a period of time, supplying many New York City-based clubs. Adams found that when the ball was more tightly stitched, it traveled further when batted or thrown. According to author Peter Morris, Adams' ball-manufacturing efforts helped to keep the Knickerbockers in operation during their first few years, as they would otherwise have had difficulty finding balls. In later years Adams gathered rubber from old galoshes for the insides of baseballs. A tanner then used horsehide to create <b>the</b> <b>balls.</b> As late as 1863, Adams was one of the three most prominent makers of baseballs in New York, continuing to produce them by hand. Adams also played a role in producing baseball bats, choosing which wood to use and overseeing the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|In reply, Australia {{were still}} more than 100 runs behind when Johnston joined Lindwall with the score at 8/355, late on the third day. Lindwall hit out, scoring 77 in an innings marked by {{powerful}} driving and pulling, dominating the stand of 48 with Johnston, who made only 13. Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes, before the injured Ernie Toshack survived the last 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston running for him. Despite Toshack and Johnston’s lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so he faced most of <b>the</b> <b>balls.</b> Johnston able to survive against the English pacemen with relative ease when he was batting, leading O’Reilly to lament the absence of leg spinner Doug Wright, whose guile and flight was held in high regard by the Australians. Lindwall was the last man out on the fourth morning with the total on 458, leaving Australia 38 runs in arrears on the first innings.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{is out of}} the hot, the hotwatches (scrum-halves) try to get <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> past <b>the</b> hot, {{either to}} kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into Worms, or to kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into Ropes. Alternatively, they can choose to knock <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{backwards}} to a better placed 'kick', remembering that the kick must play <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> down. If at any stage during <b>the</b> game <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> enters Ropes, it is usually the job of the hot to go in and retrieve it, by getting the other hot out of the way.|$|R
5000|$|Holding <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{deeper in}} <b>the</b> fingers. Typically, quick bowlers hold <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at their fingertips. Holding <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> deeper within <b>the</b> fingers slows {{the release of}} <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Brett Lee is an {{exponent}} of this method.|$|R
50|$|In both games it is {{permitted}} {{to bring down the}} player in possession of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and prevent him or her from making forward progress. In rugby, unlike in American football, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is still in play.

5|$|Limnoperdon is a fungal genus in the {{monotypic}} family Limnoperdaceae. The genus is also monotypic, as {{it contains}} a single species, the aquatic fungus Limnoperdon incarnatum. The species, described as new to science in 1976, produces fruit bodies that lack specialized structures such as a stem, cap and gills common in mushrooms. Rather, the fruit bodies—described as aquatic or floating puffballs—are small balls (0.5–1mm diameter) of loosely interwoven hyphae. <b>The</b> <b>balls</b> float {{on the surface of}} the water above submerged twigs. Experimental observations on the development of the fruit body, based on the growth on the fungus in pure culture, suggest that a thin strand of mycelium tethers the ball above water while it matures. Fruit bodies start out as a tuft of hyphae, then become cup-shaped, and eventually enclose around a single chamber that contains reddish spores. Initially discovered in a marsh in the state of Washington, the fungus has since been collected in Japan, South Africa, and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{fly around}} the school {{regarding}} the Chamber of Secrets' history. Harry and his friends discover from Cuthbert Binns, the ghostly professor of History of Magic, that it houses a terrible monster and was created {{by one of the}} school’s founders, Salazar Slytherin, after a fundamental disagreement with the other founders (Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, and Rowena Ravenclaw). Slytherin believed that students of non-magical parentage should be refused entry to the school. When a Bludger, one of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> involved in Quidditch, chases after Harry instead of zigzagging toward any player it can hit, breaking his arm, Dobby returns {{in the middle of the}} night to visit Harry in the hospital wing, revealing that it was he who charmed the Bludger and sealed the gateway at King’s Cross and that the Chamber of Secrets had been opened before. Another attack occurs, this time to a first-year Gryffindor named Colin Creevey who idolises Harry, and the school enters panic mode, setting up a dueling class for the students (led by Lockhart and Potions master/Head of Slytherin House Severus Snape), during which it is revealed that Harry is a 'Parselmouth', meaning he has the rare gift to speak to snakes.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} England's opening pair {{did not result}} in an {{improvement}} on the scoreboard. A run out was narrowly avoided following a mix-up on the first ball, and Cyril Washbrook and Emmett appeared to be uncomfortable on a surface that offered early assistance to the bowlers. The Australians themselves started with Ray Lindwall and Bill Johnston taking the new ball, but Bradman had misjudged the breeze and had to swap his bowlers' ends. For this purpose, Loxton bowled a solitary over. He was erratic in his length and bowled three long hops outside leg stump at the debutant Emmett, who ignored the opportunity to attack and let <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> pass. At the other end, Washbrook also played watchfully and avoided any horizontal bat shots, apart from a missed cut against Johnston's bowling. Overall however, the English openers appeared comfortable in the first half hour of play.|$|E

50|$|In classic play, carrying, catching, {{or holding}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> during play is not allowed, {{although}} putting spin on <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is allowed {{as long as}} carrying does not occur.

2500|$|The {{rules of}} polo are written {{and used to}} provide for the safety of both players and horses. The rules are {{enforced}} in the game by the umpires who blow whistles when a penalty occurs. Strategic plays in polo are based on the [...] "line of the ball", an imaginary line created by <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> as it travels down the field. This line traces <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> path and extends past <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> along that trajectory. The line of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> defines rules for players to approach <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> safely. <b>The</b> [...] "line of the ball" [...] changes each time <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> changes direction. <b>The</b> player who hit <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> generally has <b>the</b> right of way, and other players cannot cross the line of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in front of that player. As players approach <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> they ride {{on either side of the}} line of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> giving each access to <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> A player can cross the line of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> when it does not create a dangerous situation. Most fouls and penalty shots are related to players improperly crossing the line of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> or <b>the</b> right of way. When a player has the line of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on his right, he has the right of way. A [...] "ride-off" [...] is when a player moves another player off the line of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> by making shoulder-to-shoulder contact with the other players’ horses.|$|R
5|$|The {{first known}} game {{incorporating}} graphics that updated in real time, rather than {{only when the}} player made a move, was a pool game programmed by William Brown and Ted Lewis specifically for {{a demonstration of the}} University of Michigan-developed MIDSAC computer at the University of Michigan in 1954. The game, developed over six months by the pair, featured a pool stick controlled by a joystick and a knob, and a full rack of 15 balls on a table seen in an overhead view. The computer calculated the movements of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> as they collided and moved around the table, disappearing when they reached a pocket, and updated the graphics continuously, forty times a second, so as to show real-time motion. Like previous video games, the pool game was intended primarily to showcase the computing power of the MIDSAC computer.|$|E
5|$|Victoria was, however, less {{enthusiastic}} about fulfilling her public role. She avoided answering letters, put off visits to elderly relations whose company {{she did not}} enjoy, and talked to people who amused her at official functions while ignoring people of higher standing whom she found boring. Victoria's inattention to her duties provoked quarrels with Ernst. The young couple had loud, physical fights. The volatile Victoria shouted, threw tea trays, smashed china against the wall, and tossed anything that was handy at Ernst during their arguments. Victoria sought relief in her love for horses and long gallops over the countryside on a hard-to-control stallion named Bogdan. While she was in Russia for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II, Victoria's affection for Kirill was also rekindled. She enjoyed flirting with him at <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> and celebrations that marked the coronation.|$|E
5|$|In July the French {{team was}} {{challenged}} by the United States team in the 1929 Davis Cup three-day final. On 26 July 12,000 people watched {{the first day of}} the encounter at the Roland Garros stadium. The French squad took the lead when Borotra beat George Lott. The second match was scheduled between Cochet and Tilden. The American started off poorly; he was not able to win one single point in the first game, hit many unforced errors, especially in the longer rallies, and Cochet pulled away and took the set. In the second Tilden forced a backhand game, but it did not pay off, and he lost that set as well, six games to one. Tilden relied on his serves but was only capable of winning six games in the whole match when he lost the third set six to two. According to contemporary statistics Cochet did not hit any unforced errors of faults during the match. The next day French captain Pierre Gillou sent Cochet and Borotra for the doubles rubber. Cochet was exhausted and showed the opposite form compared to the previous day. Despite all efforts by his partner Borotra, Cochet hit most of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> out or into the net. The American duo of Wilmer Allison and John Van Ryn took a three-set win. The third day Tilden saved the hopes for his team when he beat Borotra in front of a capacity crowd of 15,000. The deciding rubber was between Cochet and George Lott. Cochet won in four sets and claimed the Cup for France for the third time.|$|E
