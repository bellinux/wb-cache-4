5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the <b>Turing</b> <b>test,</b> created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the <b>Turing</b> <b>test,</b> an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can identify what is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the <b>Turing</b> <b>test</b> like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E

25|$|A {{derivative}} of the <b>Turing</b> <b>test</b> is the Completely Automated Public <b>Turing</b> <b>test</b> to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA).

In contrast to the standard <b>Turing</b> <b>test,</b> CAPTCHA is administered by a machine and targeted to a human {{as opposed to being}} administered by a human and targeted to a machine. A computer asks a user to complete a simple test then generates a grade for that test. Computers are unable to solve the problem, so correct solutions are deemed {{to be the result of}} a person taking the test. A common type of CAPTCHA is the test that requires the typing of distorted letters, numbers or symbols that appear in an image undecipherable by a computer.|$|E

50|$|To allow {{comparison}} with human performance, artificial intelligence can be evaluated on constrained and well-defined problems.

25|$|Here Descartes {{notes that}} automata {{are capable of}} {{responding}} to human interactions but argues that such automata cannot respond appropriately to things said in {{their presence in the}} way that any human can. Descartes therefore prefigures the <b>Turing</b> <b>Test</b> by defining the insufficiency of appropriate linguistic response as that which separates the human from the automaton. Descartes fails to consider the possibility that future automata might be able to overcome such insufficiency, and so does not propose the <b>Turing</b> <b>Test</b> as such, even if he prefigures its conceptual framework and criterion.|$|E

The dialogues occurred during interactions between human Judges/Interrogators and hidden entities in practical <b>Turing</b> <b>tests</b> implemented at Bletchley Park in June 2012. The authors focus on the interactions that left the Interrogator unable to say whether they were talking to a human or a machine after five minutes of questioning; the hidden interlocutor received an â€˜unsure' classification. In cases where the Judge has provided post-event feedback the authors present their rationale from three viva voce one-to-one <b>Turing</b> <b>tests.</b> The authors find that emoticons and other visual devices used to express feelings in text-based interaction were missing in the conversations between the Interrogators and hidden interlocutors...|$|R

25|$|The {{term was}} coined in 2003 by Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas J. Hopper, and John Langford. The {{most common type}} of CAPTCHA was first invented in 1997 by two groups working in parallel: (1) Mark D. Lillibridge, Martin Abadi, Krishna Bharat, and Andrei Z. Broder; and (2) Eran Reshef, Gili Raanan and Eilon Solan. This form of CAPTCHA {{requires}} that the user type the letters of a distorted image, sometimes with the addition of an obscured sequence of letters or digits that appears on the screen. Because the test is administered by a computer, in contrast to the standard <b>Turing</b> <b>test</b> that is administered by a human, a CAPTCHA is sometimes described as a reverse <b>Turing</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arguments such as Searle's {{and others}} {{working on the}} {{philosophy}} of mind sparked off a more intense debate {{about the nature of}} intelligence, the possibility of intelligent machines and the value of the <b>Turing</b> <b>test</b> that continued through the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

40|$|Internet service {{providers}} have resisted deploying Denial-of-Service (DoS) protection mechanisms despite numerous research {{results in the}} area. This is so primarily because ISPs cannot directly charge users {{for the use of}} such mechanisms, discouraging investment in the necessary infrastructure and operational support. We describe a pay-per-use system that provides DoS protection for web servers and clients. Our approach is based on WebSOS, an overlay-based architecture that uses reverse <b>Turing</b> <b>tests</b> to discriminate between humans and automated processes that are part of an attack. We extend WebSOS with a credential-based micropayment scheme that combines access control and payment authorization in one operation. Contrary to WebSOS, we use Graphic <b>Turing</b> <b>Tests</b> (GTTs) to prevent malicious code, such as a worm, from using a users' micropayment wallet. Our architecture allows ISPs to accurately charge web clients and servers. Clients can dynamically decide whether to use WebSOS, based on the prevailing network conditions...|$|R

40|$|We present WebSOS, a novel overlay-based {{architecture}} that provides guaranteed {{access to a}} web server that is targeted by a denial of service (DoS) attack. Our approach exploits two key characteristics of the web environment: its design around a humanâ€“centric interface, and the extensibility inherent in many browsers through downloadable "applets. " We guarantee access to a web server for {{a large number of}} previously unknown users, without requiring pre-existing trust relationships between users and the system, by using reverse Graphic <b>Turing</b> <b>Tests.</b> Furthermore, our system makes it easy for service providers to charge users, providing incentives to a commercial offering of the service. Users can dynamically decide whether to use the WebSOS overlay, based on the prevailing network conditions. Our prototype requires no modifications to either servers or browsers, and makes use of Graphical <b>Turing</b> <b>Tests,</b> web proxies, and client authentication using the SSL/TLS protocol, all readily supported by modern browsers. We then extend this system with a credential-based micropayment scheme that combines access control and payment authorization in one operation. <b>Turing</b> <b>tests</b> ensure that malicious code, such as a worm, cannot abuse a user's micropayment wallet. We use the WebSOS prototype to conduct a performance evaluation over the Internet using PlanetLab, a testbed for experimentation with network overlays. We determine the end-to-end latency using both a chord-based approach and our shortcut extension. Our evaluation shows the latency increase by a factor of 7 and 2 respectively, confirming our simulation results...|$|R
