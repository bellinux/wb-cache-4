25|$|The {{first part}} of the name Skarstind is one of the Norwegian words for {{mountain}} pass, although it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> pass has given its name to the mountain. It might be the pass to the south or it might be the pass between the summit itself and the pinnacle, Nåle. Nåle, the Needle, has got its name from the local word for pinnacle, which describes the shape of it.|$|E
25|$|But {{cooperation}} {{within the}} Committee of Public Prosperity, since April 1793 {{the de facto}} executive government, started to break down. On 29 June 1794, three colleagues of Robespierre at 'the Committee' called him a dictator in his face – Robespierre baffled left the meeting. This encouraged other Convention members to also defy Robespierre. On 26 July, a long and vague speech of Robespierre wasn't met with thunderous applause as usual but with hostility; some deputies yelled that Robespierre should have the courage <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> deputies he deemed necessary to be killed next, what Robespierre refused to do.|$|E

25|$|First, Archie is not {{a friend}} but a paid employee, who acts as secretary, chauffeur, and legman to the mountainous and {{sedentary}} Wolfe. Then they differ in all important respects—age, background, physique, and education. Finally, it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> is the more interesting and admirable of the two. They are complementary in the unheard-of ratio of 50-50. … Archie has talents without which Wolfe would be lost: his remarkable memory, trained physical power, brash American humor, attractiveness to women, and ability to execute the most difficult errand virtually without instructions. Minus Archie, Wolfe would be a feckless recluse puttering in an old house on West 35th Street, New York.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{necropolis}} of Sekhemkhet {{was never}} finished, {{it is hard}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> planned cultic building had already existed. The pyramid courtyard {{was surrounded by a}} niched enclosure wall facing north-west. It was 1.850ft long, 607ft wide and 33ft high. The only archaeologically preserved cultic building is the Southern Tomb, its base measurement is estimated to be 105ft x 52ft. The subterranean structure included a tight corridor, beginning at the western site of the tomb and ending in a double chamber. In this chamber in 1963 Jean-Philippe Lauer excavated the burial of a 2-years-old toddler. The identity of this child remains a mystery, the only for sure known fact about it is that it cannot be king Sekhemkhet himself, since the king was always depicted as a young man.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary William Joseph Snelling, in his 1831 {{biography}} of Jackson, strongly criticizes Eaton. Of Eaton's Jackson biography, he wrote, [...] "it is hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> is more disgraced, the hero [...] or the historian. The book contains scarcely {{a period of}} good English, but makes amends by abundance of fulsome adulation, by the admission of many disgraceful acts and the palliation of others." [...] By 1831, Snelling says, he had become [...] "the laughing-stock of the nation." [...] Remini says that [...] "the entire Eaton affair might be termed infamous. It ruined reputations and terminated friendships. And {{it was all so}} needless." ...|$|E

500|$|Madvillainy also {{attracted}} positive reviews from several publications with infrequent coverage of hip hop music. David Segal of The Washington Post called the album [...] "hysterical, [...] perplexing, arresting, thought-provoking {{or just plain}} silly". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it [...] "a delirious collaboration" [...] and hailed MF DOOM as a rapper who [...] "understands the deformative power of rhyme" [...] and [...] "delivers long, free-associative verses full of sideways leaps and unexpected twists". Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker praised the album, noting that [...] "the point of Madvillainy is largely poetic—celebrating the language of music and the music of language" [...] and that while album's beats are based on samples of records, it's [...] "hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> ones, even in a general way".|$|E
500|$|Another major feud {{featured}} at {{the event}} was between Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty, who had teamed for several years as The Rockers. The team split up in December 1991, however, when Michaels attacked Jannetty during an episode of Brutus Beefcake's interview segment, [...] "The Barber Shop". Michaels became a singles wrestler and won the WWF Intercontinental Championship on October 27, 1992 from Davey Boy Smith. On the October 31, 1992 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Jannetty returned to the WWF after a lengthy absence and confronted Michaels. He attempted to hit Michaels with a mirror, but Michaels pulled his valet, Sensational Sherri in front of him. Sherri was hit with the mirror, which caused friction between her and Michaels. Michaels and Jannetty were scheduled to face {{each other for the}} Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble 1993. Leading up to the match, Sherri announced that she would be in the corner of one of the men, but she refused <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> one.|$|E
500|$|Asch's {{conformity}} {{experiment was}} conducted using 123 male {{participants who were}} told that they would be part of an experiment in visual judgment. Each subject was put into a group with 5 to 7 confederates (people who knew the true aims of the experiment, but were introduced as participants to the naive [...] "real" [...] participant). The group was shown a card with a line on it, followed by another card with 3 lines on it labeled a, b, and c. The participants were then asked <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> line matched in length the line on the first card. Each line question was called a [...] "trial". The [...] "real" [...] participant answered last or penultimately. For the first two trials, the subject would feel at ease in the experiment, as he and the other [...] "participants" [...] gave the obvious, correct answer. However, after the fourth trial, all of the confederates respond with the clearly wrong answer at certain points such that in 12 of the 18 trials they all gave the wrong answer. The 12 trials in which the confederates answered incorrectly were the [...] "critical trials". [...] The participant could thus either ignore the majority and go with his own senses or he could go along with the majority and ignore the clearly obvious fact. The aim was to see whether the real participant would change his answer and respond {{the same way as the}} confederates or stick with what his eyes plainly told him.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Sarah {{discovered}} fiancé Craig Dean's (Guy Burnet) {{affair with}} best friend John Paul McQueen (James Sutton), in the storyline dubbed [...] "McDean". The storyline reached its climax as {{the truth is}} revealed [...] "dramatically" [...] at her engagement party. Sarah walked in on the pair kissing, A Hollyoaks spokesperson stated {{in an interview with}} Digital Spy, [...] "John Paul's sick of all the lies and decides enough is enough. He sends a text from Craig's phone asking Sarah to come upstairs to see him. Safe in the knowledge that Sarah is on her way, JP sets about seducing Craig. When she walks in, she can't believe what she's looking at..." [...] Sarah tried to recover from this and Batley said: [...] "I don't think she got over Rhys, either. Craig more so, though. He absolutely destroyed her happiness and belief in men. Her relationship with Craig was going to be her life and she put so much effort into it, emotionally and physically, and it completely destroyed her." [...] Batley said Sarah could not handle the fact he cheated on her with another man. She opined this was the reason her storyline with Zoe and Lydia worked well. However John Paul's betrayal also had impact on Sarah's life because he was one of her best friends. Batley said: [...] "John Paul was her confidante and she thought they were best friends - it's hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> part made more of an impact on her. It was all just one horrible experience. It was the betrayal from both of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Kitty Kelly of The Chicago Tribune wrote, [...] "Two more {{attractive}} artists never collaborated {{in a single}} production than this star baby and this star dog. Of them it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> is the more so, though one demonstrates the maximum of naturalness while the other is an exponent of the maximum of training. ... As a general thing, I disapprove of the agonies of film mortality and its frequent projection of cemetery scenes, {{but this is one}} of the situations that must be handed the label 'exception'. ... The picture is a miniature masterpiece." [...] Contained within her review Kelly, also mentioned that baby Helen was placed in front of the camera so that even as she lay [...] "dying" [...] that she was still shown to be breathing. Kelly stated that no person would wish for a person to stop breathing for the sake of the film, but noted that it was not the best point of vision, but noted that the scene was well-managed. In Britain, The Bioscope reviewer agreed with other reviewers in finding the film to be, [...] "...a perfectly delightful little film. Although it is true that its plot, what there is of it, contains nothing very new, it is not merely a conventional dog and child picture of the ordinary type. It is, rather, an exquisite pictorial fancy, charmingly conceived for the most part and charmingly executed throughout. ... The picture is perfectly done, and not even in the ghost scenes toward the end is there anything banal or insincere in it. A film so full of tender sentiments and natural beauty should meet with the warmest of welcomes everywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Randall Jarrell gave Lord Weary's Castle high praise, writing, [...] "It {{is unusually}} {{difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> {{are the best}} poems in Lord Weary's Castle: several are realized past changing, successes that vary only in scope and intensity--others are poems that almost any living poet would be pleased to have written ... {{one or two of}} these poems, I think, will be read as long as men remember English." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{distance}} {{and timing of}} the measurements can be chosen {{so as to make}} the interval between the two measurements spacelike, hence, any causal effect connecting the events would have to travel faster than light.

It is not even possible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>which</b> of the measurements came first. For two spacelike separated events [...] and [...] there are inertial frames in which [...] is first and others in which [...] is first. Therefore, the correlation between the two measurements cannot be explained as one measurement determining the other: different observers would disagree about the role of cause and effect.|$|E
