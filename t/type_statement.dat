The results reveal three asymmetries: statement and question intonation identification; effects of the sentence-final Tone 2 and Tone 4 on question intonation identification; and effects of the final focus on statement and question intonation identification. These asymmetries suggest that: 1. Statement intonation is a default or unmarked intonation type whereas question intonation is a marked intonation type. 2.

40|$|In this paper, a {{fuzzy logic}} {{controller}} for dynamic positioning of drilling vessels {{in deep water}} is presented. The core of the fuzzy controller {{is a set of}} fuzzy associative memory (FAM) rules that correlate each group of fuzzy control input sets to a fuzzy control output set. A FAM rule is a logical if-then <b>type</b> <b>statement</b> based on one’s sense of realism and experience or can be provided by an expert operator. The design of the fuzzy controller is very simple and does not require mathematical modeling of the complicated nonlinear system based on first principles. The fuzzy controller uses measured vessel heading, yaw rate, distance and velocity of the vessel relative to the desired position (location and heading) to generate the control outputs to bring the vessel to and maintain it in the desired position. The control outputs include the rudder angle, propeller thrust and lateral bow thrust. The effectiveness and robustness of the fuzzy controller are demonstrated through numerical time-domain simulations of the dynamic positioning of a drill ship of Mariner Class hull with use of nonlinear ship equations of motions. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{unpublished}} notes, Pila discussed some theory {{surrounding the}} modular function $j$ and its derivatives. A {{focal point of}} these notes was the statement of two conjectures regarding $j$, $j'$ and $j"$: a Zilber-Pink <b>type</b> <b>statement</b> incorporating $j$, $j'$ and $j"$, which was an extension of an apparently weaker conjecture of Andre-Oort type.

Altogether, 24 males and females of different statures participated in the experiment. In addition to three-finger grip, index fingertip reach and five finger grip were also compared.

40|$|If ϕ is a {{scattered}} order type, µ a cardinal, {{then there}} exists a scattered order type ψ such that ψ → [ϕ] 1 µ,ℵ 0 holds. In this note we prove a Ramsey <b>type</b> <b>statement</b> on scattered order types. A trivial fact on ordinals implies the following statement. If µ is an infinite cardinal, then µ+ → (µ+) 1 µ. It is less trivial but still easy to show that if ϕ is an order type, µ a cardinal then there is some order type ψ that ψ → (ϕ) 1 µ holds. One can say that these {{results show that the}} classes of ordinals and order types are both Ramsey classes in the natural sense; given a target element and a cardinal for the number of colors, there is another element of the class, which, when colored with the required number of colors, always has a monocolored copy of the target. One can wonder which other classes have similar Ramsey properties. A natural, and well investigated, class in between is the class of scattered order types. For this class, the Ramsey property fails for the following well known and simple reason. There is some scattered order type ψ that for every scattered ϕ one has ϕ ̸ → [ψ] 1 ω. See Lemma 1. In this paper we show that this is the most in the negative direction, that is, for every scattered order type ϕ and cardinal µ {{there exists a}} scattered order type ψ such that ψ → [ϕ] 1 µ,ω holds. Notation. We use the standard axiomatic set theory notation. If ϕ, ψ are order types, then ϕ ≤ ψ denotes that there is an order preserving embedding of ϕ into ψ, that is, every ordered set of order type ψ has a subset of order type ϕ. If ϕ is an order type, then ϕ ∗ denotes the reverse order type, that is, if ϕ is the order type of (S, ). ω is the ordinal of the set of natural numbers, (N, <). η is the order type of the set of rational numbers, (Q, <).
