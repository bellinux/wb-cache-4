25|$|Importantly, however, Canada revived Third Option {{ideals of}} {{political}} and economic distinctiveness that was briefly lost to Joe Clark’s Progressive Conservatives from June 1979 to February 1980. Diversification and distinctiveness of Canadian policy were evident in Trudeau’s creation of the National Energy Program, the extension of the Foreign Investment Review Agency, and the formulation of specific Central American policy in 1982. Such advancements in Canadian policy were almost immediately contested by the United States. At any rate, Canada had good reason to be optimistic in the international sphere. Unfortunately, just as Trudeau’s policies of peace and diplomacy in Latin America began to peak the Latin American debt crisis retarded any potential growth beginning in 1982. In fact, in a four-year period between 1980 and 1984 Canadian exports to Latin America were cut in half. Despite this setback, Canadian investment in the region remained high and the government of Canada remained committed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pursuit</b> <b>of</b> mutually beneficial relations between the two regions.|$|E

500|$|Like many {{contemporary}} alternative bands, the Smashing Pumpkins utilized shifts in song dynamics, going from quiet to loud and vice versa.

The novel's reception was even warmer than that of its predecessor; Waugh {{was one of the few}} critics to qualify his praise—he thought the descriptions were good but the conversations poor. In 1950 she translated and adapted André Roussin's play La petite hutte ("The Little Hut"), in preparation for its successful West End début in August, The Timess critic noted the [...] "habit of speech at once colloquial and unexpected which instantly declares itself the creation of Miss Mitford." [...] The play ran for 1,261 performances, and provided Mitford with a steady £300 per month in royalties. The same year The Sunday Times asked her to contribute a regular column, which she did for four years. This busy period in her writing life continued in 1951 with her third postwar novel, The Blessing, another semi-autobiographical romance this time set in Paris, in which an aristocratic young Englishwoman is married to a libidinous French marquis. Harold Acton deems it her most accomplished novel, [...] "permeated with her joyous love of France". This time Waugh (to whom the book was dedicated) had no criticism; he found the book [...] "admirable, deliciously funny, consistent and complete, by far the best of your writings".|$|E
