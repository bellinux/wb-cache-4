25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> {{stated that}} BHRT is {{unsupported}} by medical evidence, and its administration is considered false and misleading by the agency. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> {{expressed concern that}} unfounded claims like these mislead women and health care professionals. Traditional therapy has been researched to quantify these risks and benefits, and are produced by manufacturers with stringent purity and potency standards.|$|E

5000|$|In May 1973, in {{an attempt}} to {{restrict}} off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive to emergency situations such as rape, a FDA Drug Bulletin was sent to all U.S. physicians and pharmacists that said <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> approved, under restricted conditions, postcoital contraceptive use of DES. (In February 1975, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> Commissioner testified that the only error in <b>the</b> May 1973 <b>FDA</b> Drug Bulletin was that <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> not approved postcoital contraceptive use of DES.) ...|$|R
50|$|By mid 2016 <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> {{approved}} one PD-L1 inhibitor (atezolizumab) and two PD-1 inhibitors (nivolumab and pembrolizumab).|$|R
25|$|In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> {{approved}} LASIK for age 18 and over. More {{importantly the}} patient's eye prescription should be stable {{for at least}} one year prior to surgery.|$|E
25|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> {{reported}} on life-threatening drug interactions {{that may be}} possible when co-administered with triptans and other drugs acting on serotonin pathways leading to increased risk for serotonin syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} only very few {{reported}} cases and epidemiological data, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> set an action limit of 50 ppb in cider due to its potential carcinogenicity and other reported adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|As of December 2011, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>have</b> {{not given}} {{approval}} {{for the use of}} bazedoxifene in the US.|$|R
5000|$|As at 30 April 2012, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> {{reported}} no Class I, II, or III recalls by Royal Canin since <b>the</b> <b>FDA's</b> multi-brand-affecting [...] "Melamine in Pet Food Recall" [...] of March/April 2007.|$|R
50|$|Pulsed {{electromagnetic}} field therapy (PEMFT) uses {{electromagnetic field}}s {{in an attempt}} to heal non-union fractures and depression. By 2007 <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> cleared several such stimulation devices.|$|R
25|$|The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) action {{levels for}} {{aflatoxin}} present in food or feed is 20 to 300 ppb. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> {{had occasion to}} declare both human and pet food recalls as a precautionary measure to prevent exposure.|$|E
25|$|In the U.S., <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> banned {{import of}} any donor sperm, {{motivated}} by a risk of CreutzfeldtJakob disease, inhibiting the once popular import of Scandinavian sperm. Despite this the scientific consensus is that the risk is negligible, {{as there is no}} evidence Creutzfeldt–Jakob is sexually transmitted.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> {{received}} {{criticism for}} its approval of certain coal tar derived food dyes such as FDC yellow 5 and 6, which are banned in most European countries. On September 6, 2007, the British Food Standards Agency revised advice on certain artificial food additives, including tartrazine.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that {{antimicrobial}} hand soaps containing triclosan provide a slightly greater bacterial reduction on the hands compared to plain soap. , <b>the</b> US <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> found clear benefit to health for some consumer products containing triclosan, but not in others; for example <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> no evidence that triclosan in antibacterial soaps and body washes provides any benefit over washing with regular soap and water.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was first}} {{approved}} in Europe in 1997 and was provisionally approved by <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> in 1999. In 2001 <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> issued Pfizer a [...] "not approvable" [...] letter based on clinical trials <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> required when it issued the preliminary approval letter.|$|R
50|$|On December 24, 2008, AstraZeneca {{notified}} shareholders that <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> {{asked for}} additional information on the company's application to expand the use of sustained-release quetiapine for treatment of depression.|$|R
25|$|Some critics {{believe that}} <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> been too to {{overlook}} safety concerns in approving new drugs, and is slow to withdraw approved drugs once evidence shows {{them to be}} unsafe. Rezulin (troglitazone) and Vioxx (rofecoxib) are high-profile examples of drugs approved by the FDA which were later withdrawn from the market for posing unacceptable risks to patients.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, {{the debate}} {{received}} media attention in California, where {{limits on the}} bacterial counts legally allowed in commercial raw milk came up for legislative review. Reuters named the raw milk debate as first {{on a list of}} the top eight health issues of 2008. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> also offered financial assistance to state departments of health to help reduce raw milk consumption.|$|E
25|$|Cases of hepatosplenic T-cell {{lymphoma}} – a rare type of lymphoma – {{have been}} reported in patients treated with azathioprine. The majority occurred in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Adolescents and young adult males were the majority of cases. They presented with a very aggressive disease course and, with one exception, died of the lymphoma. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> required changes to the labeling to inform users and clinicians of the issue.|$|E
50|$|On December 1, 2008, Biovail {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> accepted <b>the</b> company's ANDA to market {{its own version}} of sustained-release quetiapine. Biovail's sustained-release tablets will compete with AstraZeneca's Seroquel XR.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> {{approved}} Synercid, a drug containing streptogramins A and B in a 7:3 ratio respectively. This intravenously-injected drug is used {{to treat}} patients with bacteremia caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.|$|R
2500|$|On March 23, 2014, USA Today {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> decided to permit [...] "a handful" [...] of cancer patients to receive Burzynski's treatment {{provided that the}} patients did not receive the treatment directly from him.|$|R
25|$|DMSO is {{marketed as}} an {{alternative}} medicine. Its popularity {{as an alternative}} cure is stated to stem from a 60 Minutes documentary featuring an early proponent. However, DMSO is an ingredient in some products listed by the U.S. FDA as fake cancer cures and <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> had a running battle with distributors. One such distributor is Mildred Miller, who promoted DMSO {{for a variety of}} disorders and was consequently convicted of Medicare fraud.|$|E
25|$|Substances {{which the}} FDA regulates as food are {{subdivided}} into various categories, including foods, food additives, added substances (man-made substances {{which are not}} intentionally introduced into food, but nevertheless end up in it), and dietary supplements. The specific standards which the FDA exercises differ from one category to the next. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> been granted a variety of means by which it can address violations of the standards for a given category of substances.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> {{approved}} imatinib for use {{in adults}} with relapsed or refractory Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), myelodysplastic/ myeloproliferative diseases associated with platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene rearrangements, aggressive systemic mastocytosis without or an unknown D816V c-KIT mutation, hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia who have the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase (CHIC2 allele deletion) or FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase negative or unknown, unresectable, recurrent and/or metastatic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. On 25 January 2013, Gleevec was approved {{for use in}} children with Ph+ ALL.|$|E
50|$|As of 2014 <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> {{approved}} SCS as {{a treatment}} for failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), chronic pain, Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, Intractable angina, as well as visceral abdominal and perineal pain and pain in the extremities from nerve damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{move towards}} {{imposing}} user fees {{to pay for}} the regulatory review of new medicines was the result of dissatisfaction among consumers, industry, and <b>the</b> <b>FDA.</b> All three groups felt that drug approvals were taking far too long. Pharmaceutical companies had to wait to begin to recoup the costs of research and development. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> estimated that a delay of one month in a review’s completion cost its sponsor $10 million. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> argued that it needed additional staff to end its back-log of drugs awaiting approval for market. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> not received sufficient appropriations from Congress to hire them. For decades <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> asked for permission to implement user fees and the pharmaceutical industry generally opposed them, fearing that the funds would not be used to speed drug review. The 1992 law became possible when <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> and industry agreed on setting target completion times for reviews and the promise these fees would supplement federal appropriations instead of replacing them.|$|R
25|$|On December 23, 2015, Tom Angell {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> finally issued a recommendation to the DEA regarding both the 2009 and 2011 petitions. Requests {{have been made}} to both <b>the</b> DEA and <b>FDA</b> under <b>the</b> Freedom of Information Act to determine the details of that recommendation.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> {{approved}} cryoablation of a fibroadenoma as a safe, {{effective and}} minimally-invasive alternative to open surgical removal in 2001. In the procedure, ultrasound imaging {{is used to}} guide a probe into the mass of breast tissue. Extremely cold temperatures are then used to destroy the abnormal cells, and over time the cells are reabsorbed into the body. The procedure can be performed as an outpatient surgery using local anesthesia only, and leaves substantially less scarring than open surgical procedures and no breast tissue deformation.|$|E
25|$|Compounding {{pharmacies}} use {{commercially available}} bulk drugs {{to create new}} formulations which differ (in form or dosage) from those manufactured {{on a large scale}} by pharmaceutical companies. Custom-compounded BHRT is almost wholly restricted to the United States, where pharmacy compounding is governed at the state level while <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> regulatory authority over the compounded product. Some internet-based compounding pharmacies understate harm and claim benefits of compounded BHRT beyond what can be proven by evidence-based medicine, and many of their claims exceed those made by other, more mainstream, BHRT practitioners.|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} of hydroxyzine in large amounts by ingestion or intramuscular administration during {{the onset of}} pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities—when administered to pregnant rats, mice and rabbits, hydroxyzine caused abnormalities such as hypogonadism with doses significantly above that of the human therapeutic range. In humans, a significant dose {{has not yet been}} established in studies, and by default, <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>has</b> introduced contraindication guidelines in regard to hydroxyzine. Similarly the use in those at risk from or showing previous signs of hypersensitivity is also contraindicated. Hydroxyzine is contraindicated for intravenous (IV) injection, as it has shown to cause hemolysis.|$|E
50|$|To date, {{there have}} been two pre-market {{notifications}} filed with <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> announcing intent to market 7-keto-DHEA as a dietary ingredient. These notifications had to demonstrate to FDA’s satisfaction that there is no issue with the safety of the subject ingredient. <b>The</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> no objection, in each of these notifications, to the marketing and sale of 7-keto-DHEA.|$|R
25|$|To obtain {{statistically}} significant results <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>had</b> to combine <b>the</b> results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants for psychiatric indications. As suicidal ideation and behavior {{in clinical trials}} are rare, the results for any drug taken separately usually do not reach statistical significance.|$|R
50|$|The most {{frequently}} practiced procedure is the lateral minimally invasive approach. One leading {{explanation for this}} involves <b>the</b> <b>FDA</b> <b>having</b> made possible a Premarket notification (510(k)) for instrumentation that has a predicate preceding 1976. Several lateral minimally invasive instrumentation systems have acquired this designation.|$|R
