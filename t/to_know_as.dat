5|$|The US {{casualty}} count at Yongsan is also difficult <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>as</b> the division's scattered {{units were}} engaged {{all along the}} Naktong Bulge without communication and total casualty counts in each area could not be ascertained. The US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at the Second Battle of Naktong Bulge. This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of Naktong Bulge the previous month. American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter. The division had numbered 17,498 on September 1, but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter, most of which probably occurred at Yongsan.|$|E

Instead, those who hold to this interpretation usually see the demand <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> demanding the right to interrogate the strangers.|$|E
25|$|Genealogy of Grigoriy Zhukovsky, Odessa citizen, {{attributed}} to the poet Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky (1783-1852). The verses and fairy-tale of this poet were included in school program in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and could be earlier and up today. Also biography of Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky the pupils had <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>As</b> per Soviet school program from the 1950s and up to {{second part of the}} 1980s or beginning of the 1990s the father of this poet was the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky (died in 1817) and as per legend his father was the landlord Afanasiy Ivanovich Bunin (1716—1791) and the mother was the captive Turkish girl Salha, she was named by Christian name Yelizaveta Dementiyevna Tutchaninova. Their illegitimate boy, as per legend, was adopted by the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky and named Vasiliy Andreyevich Zhukovsky. Turkey joined the NATO in 1952 and in the 1960s or earlier the NATO was able to watch and listen to the Northern part of the Black Sea, including Odessa. It is why Turkish girl Salha was included in the legend. The landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky, the father of poet, had Polish family name Zhukovsky and the landlords with this family name left in the Eastern Prussia before Swedish and then German invasion in the Eastern Prussia. It is why Soviet Intelligence wished to present Zhukovsky family in Odessa as representatives of Prussian Zhukovsky family branch. To avoid any person of Zhukovsky family in Odessa began thinking about the Royal title, the legend of the Bunin family was introduced. And it was done successfully. During the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev this legend was presented as the correct version to stop this Intelligence activity.|$|E

[...] "He did this {{with a combination of}} efficiency, high standards, humour and compassion." [...] From 1957 until his death, Larkin's secretary was Betty Mackereth.

500|$|Divine {{was unable}} to appear in Waters's next feature, Desperate Living (1977), {{despite the fact that}} the role of Mole McHenry had been written for him. This was because he had {{returned}} to working in the theater, this time taking the role of the scheming prison matron Pauline in Tom Eyen's comedy Women Behind Bars. Performed in New York City's Truck and Warehouse Theater, the play proved popular and was later taken to London's Whitehall Theater next to Trafalgar Square. Containing a new cast, it proved less successful than it had in New York. It was in this city that Divine met a group of people whom he would come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> his [...] "London family": fashion designer Zandra Rhodes, photographer Robyn Beeche, sculptor Andrew Logan and the latter's partner, Michael Davis. While in London in 1978, Divine attended as the guest of honour at the seventh annual Alternative Miss World pageant, a mock event founded by Logan in 1972 in which drag queens – including men, women and children – competed for the prize. The event was filmed by director Richard Gayer, whose subsequent film, entitled Alternative Miss World, premiered at the Odeon in London's Leicester Square as well as featuring at the Cannes Film Festival, both events which were attended by Divine.|$|E

The wood cut-out was constructed by Ament. Ament said, [...] "The original concept was about really being together as a group and entering into the world of music as a true band...a sort of all-for-one deal." [...] Ament is credited for the album's artwork and art direction, Lance Mercer receives credit for photography, and both Lisa Sparagano and Risa Zaitschek are credited for design. Ament stated, [...] "There was a bit of headbutting going on with the Sony art department at that time. The version that everybody got <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> the Ten album cover was pink and it was originally intended to be more of a burgundy color and the picture of the band was supposed to be black and white." [...] Pearl Jam's original name was taken from the professional basketball player Mookie Blaylock. It was changed after the band signed to Epic Records, as record executives were concerned about intellectual property and naming rights following Blaylock's inking of an endorsement deal with Nike. In commemoration of the band's original name, the band titled its first album Ten after Blaylock's jersey number.|$|E

The Greyhound gave the song a negative review and believed that [...] "with a lackluster hook and the repetition of the name 'Wale,' the airplay and sales of this single will depend greatly upon the vocals of Lady Gaga." [...] Wilson McBee from Slant Magazine criticized both [...] "Chillin" [...] and the follow-up single, [...] "World Tour", as [...] "tepid Cool & Dre productions in which Wale seems to be attempting Black Eyed Peas-style halftime-show rap."

500|$|Tony Norman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{praised the}} episode, {{which he said}} [...] "has wandered {{into the heart of}} Dostoyevsky {{territory}} with its storylines". He particularly praised the episode for going outside its normal conventions by portraying lead characters like Pembleton and Gee as being so reluctant to do the right thing. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News gave the episode four out of five stars; he particularly praised the performances of Thorne and Gerety, and said the show did an impressive job of introducing the new cast members. Michael Storey of Arkansas Democrat-Gazette said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] lived up to the high standards he said the show had set for itself. Ron Miller of Fort Worth Star-Telegram praised [...] "Blood Ties", although he said he does not always enjoy Homicide: Life on the Street. He said the episode [...] "starts fast and gets better and more intense by the minute", and described the climactic argument in the second episode as [...] "the most turbulent internal dispute we've ever seen among the detectives". Rocky Mountain News writer Dusty Saunders praised the main story-line and said the subplots were well juxtaposed into the episode. He also said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] could serve as a good introduction to the series for new viewers. Alan Sepinwall, television critic for The Star-Ledger, criticized the addition of [...] "silly" [...] action-oriented scenes the traditionally more intelligent show, but praised [...] "Blood Ties" [...] and the addition of the new cast members. Sepinwall particularly praised the acting of Andre Braugher: [...] "Pitted against a powerhouse like James Earl Jones, he not only holds his own, but at times is so dramatically forceful that the former voice of Darth Vader sounds intimidated." [...] Not all reviews of [...] "Blood Ties" [...] were positive. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post said the series benefited from the new characters, but that the episode [...] "asks viewers to believe rather too strongly in the inherent racism of certain characters we've come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> heroes in seasons past". Ostrow also thought Pembleton's clashes with the new detectives was predictable.|$|E

[...] The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and there is more to it than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next. There is more to it than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{construction}} of the Carnegie libraries the condition of libraries in small town Illinois can be described as poor, at least based on the descriptions in correspondence to Bertram regarding the grants.

King William III sent an ambassador to Algeria to demand the release of any and all British subjects who were enslaved in that country, which at the time would have included Richard Joyce. After fourteen years, Joyce was released and returned to Galway and brought along with him the ring he had fashioned while in captivity: what we've come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>as</b> the Claddagh.
