2500|$|Automotive {{trends in}} the early middle 1960s had all the US {{automakers}} looking at making compact sporty cars. The Valiant was a natural choice of basis for Chrysler's efforts in this direction. Ford's Mustang gave this type of vehicle its common [...] "pony car" [...] moniker, but in fact Chrysler beat Ford to market by two weeks with the April 1, 1964 release of the Barracuda fastback. The Barracuda used the Valiant's [...] wheelbase and the Valiant hood, headlamp bezels, windshield, vent windows, quarter panels and bumpers; all other sheet metal and glass was new. This hybrid design approach significantly reduced the development and <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> and time for the new model. Unfortunately, the Barracuda was as similar to the Valiant as the Mustang {{was different from the}} Falcon, and its introduction was, at first, barely noticed by most buyers.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{horizontal}} {{injection molding}} machines {{have been used}} since the mid-1980s, however loading and unloading [...] cores are difficult so two robots are required. Moreover, the cycle time is quite long, approximately 28 seconds. These problem are overcome by using rotary or shuttle action injection molding machines. These types of machines only require one robot to load and unload cores and have a 30% shorter cycle time. However, these types of machines cost approximately 35% more than horizontal machines, require more space, and require two bottom molds (because one is in the machine during the cycle {{and the other is}} being unloaded and loaded with a new core), which adds approximately 40% to the <b>tooling</b> <b>cost.</b> For small parts, horizontal injection molding machines are still used, because the core does not weigh enough to justify the use of a rotary machine.|$|E

50|$|The {{economics}} of plastics processing {{is determined by}} the type of process. Plastics can be processed with the following methods: machining, compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, extrusion, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, casting, forging, and foam molding. Processing methods are selected based on equipment cost, production rate, <b>tooling</b> <b>cost,</b> and build volume. High equipment and <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> methods are typically used for large production volumes whereas low - medium equipment cost and <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> methods are used for low production volumes. Compression molding, transfer molding, injection molding, forging, and foam molding has high equipment and <b>tooling</b> <b>cost.</b> Lower cost processes are machining, extruding, rotational molding, blow molding, thermoforming, and casting. A summary of each process and its cost is displayed figure 1.|$|E
5000|$|Manufacturing of {{a complex}} {{cross-section}} is difficult and expensive, it involves <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> as a die of that cross section has to be manufactured. There are some standard shapes available from extrusion shops and metal supplier, a designer can choose any of these shapes if it serves his purpose. This saves the <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> associated with manufacturing a complex die for the profile and simplifies the manufacturing.|$|E

50|$|Welded bellows (also called edge-welded, or {{diaphragm}} bellows) {{are manufactured}} by welding {{a number of}} individually formed diaphragms to each other. The comparison between the two bellows types generally centers on cost and performance. Hydroformed bellows generally have a high <b>tooling</b> <b>cost,</b> but, when mass-produced, may have a lower piece price. However, hydroformed bellows have lower performance characteristics due to relatively thick walls and high stiffness. Welded metal bellows are produced with a lower initial <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> and maintain higher performance characteristics. The drawback of welded bellows is the reduced metal strength at weld joints, caused by the high temperature of welding.|$|E

50|$|Molded plastic {{cases and}} {{structural}} parts {{can be made}} by a variety of methods, offering tradeoffs in piece part cost, <b>tooling</b> <b>cost,</b> mechanical and electrical properties, and ease of assembly. Examples are injection molding, transfer molding, vacuum forming, and die cutting. Pl can be post-processed to provide conductive surfaces when confused.|$|E

5000|$|Castability is {{the ease}} of forming a quality casting. A very {{castable}} part design is easily developed, incurs minimal <b>tooling</b> <b>costs,</b> requires minimal energy, and has few rejections. [...] Castability can refer to a part design or a material property.|$|R
50|$|Electroformed bellows are {{produced}} by plating (electroforming) a metal layer onto a model (mandrel), and subsequently removing the mandrel. They can be produced with modest <b>tooling</b> <b>costs</b> and with thin walls (25 micrometres or less), providing such bellows with high sensitivity and precision in many exacting applications.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} keep the <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> as low as possible, trim {{components}} from the 1956 Clippers were used. This was done to make the 1957 model differ in appearance from the President; outside, this included a narrower Packard-style front bumper and 1956 Clipper tail lamps and wheel covers. Inside, the cars' dashboards were fitted with the same basic instrument cluster as used in the previous two years.|$|E
50|$|With this in mind, Nash Motors {{negotiated}} with several European companies. On October 5, 1952, they {{announced that they}} had selected the Austin Motor Company (by then part of BMC) and Fisher & Ludlow (which also became part of BMC in September 1953, later operating under the name Pressed Steel Fisher), both English companies based in Birmingham, England and vicinity. Fisher & Ludlow would produce the bodywork, while the mechanicals would be provided, as well as final assembly undertaken, by the Austin Motor Company. This {{was the first time}} an American-designed car, to be exclusively marketed in North America, had been entirely built in Europe. It became a captive import - a foreign-built vehicle sold and serviced by Nash (and later by American Motors) through its dealer distribution system. It is believed that the first pre-production prototype was completed by Austin on December 2, 1952. In all, five pre-production prototypes were built by Austin Motors and tested {{prior to the start of}} production. The total <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> amounted to US$1,018,475.94, (Austin: US$197,849.14; Fisher & Ludlow: US$820,626.80) which was a fraction of the <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> for a totally U.S.-built vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The {{remarkable}} {{disparity in}} <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> and {{lead time is}} a result of the expensive and time-consuming machining required to produce the precision metal molds (dies) used with die-casting and plastic injection molding. However, the precision tooling and resilient nature of the machined metal die translates to an extremely longer-lasting mold (die) and slight improvements to casting tolerances. Furthermore, thermoplastics and die casting metal alloys are in wider use than their specialized spin casting analogs, and as a result are typically cheaper.|$|E

50|$|Transistor {{models are}} used for almost all modern {{electronic}} design work. Analog circuit simulators such as SPICE use models to predict {{the behavior of a}} design. Most design work is related to integrated circuit designs which have a very large <b>tooling</b> <b>cost,</b> primarily for the photomasks used to create the devices, and there is a large economic incentive to get the design working without any iterations. Complete and accurate models allow a large percentage of designs to work the first time.|$|E
50|$|The Barracuda {{used the}} Valiant's 106 in {{wheelbase}} and the Valiant hood, headlamp bezels, windshield, vent windows, quarter panels, doors, A-pillar, and bumpers; {{the trunk and}} some of the glass was new. Utilizing the same hybrid design approach as Ford did turning its Falcon into the Mustang significantly reduced Plymouth's development and <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> and time for the new model. The greatest effort was put into creating its distinguishing 14.4 ft² (1.33 m²) rear window, a collaboration between Pittsburgh Plate Glass (PPG) and Chrysler designers that created the largest ever installed on a standard production car to that time.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the closure}} of the Detroit, Michigan Packard plant, Studebaker-Packard entered into a {{management}} contract with the Curtiss-Wright Company. Under C-W's president, Roy T. Hurley, S-P's new president Harold Churchill approved production of a new Packard, to be built in Studebaker's South Bend, Indiana plant. The new Packards, originally to continue the Packard Executive nameplate, were to share the Studebaker President four-door sedan body and new four-door station wagon body as well. The total <b>tooling</b> <b>cost</b> of the new Packard was estimated at roughly $1 million. At some point, however, the Executive name was dropped, as all of the Packards produced for 1957 carried the Packard Clipper name.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{simulated}} annealing algorithm {{has been developed}} to optimize machining parameters in turning operation on cylindrical workpieces. The turning operation usually includes several passes of rough machining and a final pass of finishing. Seven different constraints are considered in a non-linear model where {{the goal is to}} achieve minimum total cost. The weighted total cost consists of machining <b>cost,</b> <b>tool</b> <b>cost</b> and <b>tool</b> replacement <b>cost.</b> The computational results clearly show that the proposed optimization procedure has considerably improved total operation cost by optimally determining machining parameters...|$|R
