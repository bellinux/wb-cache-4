5|$|A {{hydrostatic}} test involves pressurising the cylinder to its <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> (usually 5/3 or 3/2 {{of the working}} pressure) and measuring its volume {{before and after the}} test. A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means the cylinder fails the test and must be permanently removed from service.|$|E
5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. <b>Test</b> <b>pressure</b> is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E

25|$|Flow bench <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> are {{typically}} conducted at 10 to 28inches of water (2.5 to 7 kPa) while a real engine may see 190inches of water (47 kPa) pressure difference.|$|E
25|$|The {{air pump}} used {{must be able}} to deliver the volume {{required}} at the pressure required. Most flow testing is done at 10 and 28inches of water pressure (2.5 to 7 kilopascals). Although other test pressures will work, the results would have to be converted for comparison to the work of others. The pressure developed must account for the <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> plus the loss across the metering element plus all other system losses. The greater the accuracy of the metering element the greater is the loss. Flow volume of between 100 and 600 cubic feet per minute (0.05 to 0.28 m³/s) would serve almost all applications {{depending on the size of}} the engine under test.|$|E

40|$|The lean limit {{flames of}} H 2 -CH 4 -air {{mixtures}} stabilized inside tubes in a downward flow are experimentally and numerically investigated at elevated pressures ranging from 2 to 5 bar. For {{the shapes of}} lean limit flames, a change from ball-like flame to cap-like flame is experimentally observed {{with the increase of}} pressure. This experimentally observed phenomenon is qualitatively predicted by numerical simulations. The structure of ball-like and cap-like lean limit flames at all <b>tested</b> <b>pressures</b> is analysed in detail based on the numerical predictions. The results show that the lean limit flames are located inside a recirculation zone at all <b>tested</b> <b>pressures.</b> For the leading edges of the lean limit flames at all <b>tested</b> <b>pressures,</b> the fuel transport is controlled by both convection and diffusion. For the trailing edge of the ball-like lean limit flame at 2 bar, the fuel transport is dominated by diffusion. However, with increasing pressure, the transport contribution caused by convection in the trailing edges of the lean limit flames increases. Finally, the influence of transport and chemistry on the predicted ultra lean flames and lean flammability limit is analysed at elevated pressures...|$|R

25|$|The {{agent is}} emptied and {{depressurized}} and the valve is removed. After a thorough {{internal and external}} visual inspection, the cylinder is filled with water, placed inside a safety cage, and pressurized to the specified <b>test</b> <b>pressure</b> (varies with the type, age, and cylinder material) for the specified time period. If no failure, bulges, or leaks are detected, the cylinder passes. The cylinder is then emptied of water and thoroughly dried, and labeled with the test date and company that performed the test. CO2 types have the test information stamped on the cylinder, all other types get a sticker {{on the back of}} the cylinder. Once dry, the units are recharged. Unlike the UK, the US does not rebuild extinguishers and replace valves at specific intervals unless parts are found to be defective, with the exception of halon. Halon types are often given new o-rings and valve stems at every internal maintenance to minimize any leakage potential.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between high-stakes <b>testing</b> <b>pressure</b> and student achievement across 25 states. Standardized portfolios were created for each study state. Each portfolio contained a range of documents that told the “story” of accountability implementation and impact in that state. Using the “law of comparative judgments,” over 300 graduate-level education students reviewed one pair of portfolios and made independent evaluations as to which of the two states’ portfolios reflected a greater degree of accountability pressure. Participants’ judgments yielded a matrix that was converted into a single rating system that arranged all 25 states on a continuum of accountability “pressure” from high to low. Using this accountability pressure rating we conducted a series of regression and correlation analyses. We found no relationship between earlier pressure and later cohort achievement for math at the fourth- and eighth-grade levels on the National Assessment of Educational Progress tests. Further, no relationship was found between <b>testing</b> <b>pressure</b> and reading achievement on the National Assessment of Education Progress tests at any grade level or for any ethnic student subgroup. Data do suggest, however, that a case could be made for a causal relationship between high-stakes <b>testing</b> <b>pressure</b> and subsequent achievement on the national assessment tests—but only for fourth grade, non-cohort achievement and for some ethnic subgroups. Implications and directions for future studies are discussed...|$|R
