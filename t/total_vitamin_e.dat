5000|$|The {{discovery}} of tocotrienols was first reported by Pennock and Whittle in 1964, describing {{the isolation of}} tocotrienols from rubber. [...] The biological significance of tocotrienols was clearly delineated in the early 1980s, when its ability to lower cholesterol was first reported by Qureshi and Elson in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry. During the 1990s, the anti-cancer properties of tocopherols and tocotrienols began to be delineated. The current commercial sources of tocotrienol are rice and palm. Other natural tocotrienol sources include rice bran oil, coconut oil, cocoa butter, barley, and wheat germ. Tocotrienols are safe and human studies show no adverse effects with consumption of 240 mg/day for 48 months. Tocotrienol rich fractions from rice, palm, or annatto, used in nutritional supplements, functional foods, and anti-aging cosmetics, {{are available in the}} market at 20%, 35%, 50%, and 70% <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> content.

The aim {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of consuming a 1 -ounce serving of fortified breakfast cereal on vitamin E dietary intake as well as serum tocopherol concentrations among healthy adults. Forty-two adults completed a 6 -week randomized, controlled, parallel-arm, open-label design (2 -week usual diet run-in period followed by a 4 -week control versus treatment period). The control group (n= 21) consumed and recorded their usual diet while the intervention group (n= 21) consumed and recorded their usual diet with the addition of a 1 -ounce serving of fortified breakfast cereal during the 4 -week treatment period. Diet diaries for the 6 -week study period were assessed for accuracy and analyzed using Nutrient Data System for Research version 2010.

The {{aim of this study}} was to test the effect of dietary supplementation with vitamin C on total and lipid standardised vitamin E concentrations in fasting plasma, the hypothesis being that increased vitamin C intake leads to improved vitamin E levels. In this single-blinded study, 12 apparently healthy adults (seven men, five women) took 1 g/day vitamin C for 28 days, with a 28 -day placebo-controlled run-in cycle and a 28 -day placebo-controlled washout cycle.

Design: Observational study. Setting: Hong Kong. Subjects: One hundred and fifty randomly selected Chinese subjects. Interventions: Fasting plasma concentrations of ascorbate, <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> and lipid standardised vitamin E (Vit E(LS), expressed as μmol vitamin E/mmol total cholesterol plus triglycerides) were measured. Results: <b>Total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> concentrations ranged from 6 - 53 μmol/l (mean 24; s. d. 8. 5), and Vit E(LS) from 0. 85 - 7. 09 μmol/mmol (mean 3. 62; s. d. 1. 19). Plasma Vit E(LS) concentrations in women were higher (P = 0. 02) than in men: mean (median) concentrations 3. 82 (3. 88) and 3. 37 (3. 28) μmol/mmol, respectively.

In the theoretical part is mentioned botanical characterization of wheat, barley and tritordeum, vitamin E and its chemical and biological aspects and basics of chromatography with a focus on the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analysis to quanify vitamin E was performed in the experimental part of the thesis. The analysis was conducted with samples of winter and spring wheat, spring barley and spring tritordeum from harvests of 2014 and 2015. These were varieties with unusual coloring of the grain. The evaluation was conducted by variety (winter wheat, spring wheat, spring barely, spring tritordeum) and {{by the color of}} the kernels (blue aleuron, purple pericarp, yellow pericarp). Subsection part of the thesis is dedicated to a quantification of vitamin E during long-term storage. Based on the determination of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> amount in all analyzed varieties of cereal grains with a different color is not statistically significant difference in the values of the total amount of vitamin E. The difference between the content of vitamin E in the samples of the same varieties of different cereals harvest from a year 2014 and a year 2015 were not statistically significant. All varieties of wheat were quantified four vitamers: alpha-tocopherol, beta-tocopherol, alpha-tocotrienol and beta-tocotrienol. The amount of other vitamers was below the limit of detection. The total content of vitamin E and contents of individual vitamers coincide with the data given in the literature for wheat varieties with standard color of grain.

40|$|Vegetable oils are {{important}} sources of food, feed and fuel. The value and usage {{can be enhanced}} by increased production of vitamin E and wax esters in the oil. To this end, this thesis explored the vitamin E and wax ester biosynthetic pathways in oil seed crops like soybean and camelina. Vitamin E consists of tocopherols, tocotrienols and provides oxidative stability to vegetable oils. Due to high antioxidant nature and limited occurence, production of tocotrienols in dicotyledonous oil seeds is expexted to improve oil functionality. Also, high alpha tocochromanols in vegetable oils enhances nutritional value. We generated soybean seeds with 6. 5 - to 7. 1 - fold increases in vitamin E, mainly through tocotrienols production by transgenic expression of barley homogentisate geranylgeranyl transferase (HGGT). Also, generated seeds with 5. 4 - and 16 -fold increase in <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> and alpha tocochromanols respectively by co-expressing soybean γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT/VTE 4) with barley HGGT. Further, introgression of high vitamin E trait into stearidonic rich soybean had improved oxidative stability of oil. We also, addressed the limitation of homogentisate production for increased vitamin E, using metabolic engineering strategies in camelina. Seed specific expression of down regulated homogentisate oxygenase (HGO) and de-regulated synthesis genes, Arabidopsis hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxigenase (HPPD) and Eschericia coli bi-functional chorismate mutase/prephenate dehydrogenase (TyrA) alone or in combination resulted drastic increase in homogentisate with limited increase in vitamin E content. Where as, in presence of HGGT expression, tremendous increase in homogentisate and <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> content suggests that homogentisate is not a limiting factor for vitamin E synthesis, except in lines expressing HGGT and HGGT/HGO RNAi where free HGA was not accumulated. ^ Similarly, by exploring wax biosynthetic pathway we generated camelina lines producing novel wax esters with reduced chain length, mainly C 42 and C 44 consisting of C 20 and C 22 fatty acids and fatty alcohols, by co-expressing fatty acid reductase (FAR), wax synthase (WS) from jojoba with fatty acid elongase (FAE 1) from carmbe. In summary, we conclude that enhanced vitamin E increaed the oxidative stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids and increased alpha forms improves nutritional value of soybean oil. Also, wax esters with reduced chain length improve stability and functionality. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) {{is a major}} forage legume for {{livestock}} and a target for improving their dietary quality. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>E</b> is an essential vitamin that animals must obtain from their diet for proper growth and development. γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT), which catalyzes the conversion of δ- and γ-tocopherols (or tocotrienols) to β- and α-tocopherols (or tocotrienols), respectively, is the final enzyme involved in the <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> biosynthetic pathway. The overexpression of M. sativa L. ’s γ-TMT (MsTMT) increased the α-tocopherol content 10 – 15 fold above that of wild type Arabidopsis seeds without altering the <b>total</b> content of <b>vitamin</b> <b>E.</b> Additionally, in response to osmotic stress, the biomass and the expression levels of several osmotic marker genes were significantly higher in the transgenic lines compared with wild type. Overexpression of MsTMT in alfalfa led to a modest, albeit significant, increase in α-tocopherol in leaves and was also responsible for a delayed leaf senescence phenotype. Additionally, the crude protein content was increased, while the acid and neutral detergent fiber contents were unchanged in these transgenic lines. Thus, increased α-tocopherol content occurred in transgenic alfalfa without compromising the nutritional qualities. The targeted metabolic engineering of <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> biosynthesis through MsTMT overexpression provides a promising approach to improve the α-tocopherol content of forage crops...|$|R

40|$|Benzoyl {{peroxide}} (BPO) is {{a commonly}} used {{drug in the}} treatment of acne vulgaris, but it induces unwanted side effects related to stratum corneum (SC) function. Since it has been recently shown to oxidize SC antioxidants, it was hypothesized that antioxidant supplementation may mitigate the BPO-induced SC changes. To test this, 11 subjects were selected to be topically supplemented with alpha-tocotrienol (5 % w/vol) for 7 d on defined regions of the upper back, while the contralateral region was used for vehicle-only controls. Starting on day 8, all test sites were also treated with BPO (10 %) for 7 d; the alpha-tocotrienol supplementation was continued throughout the study. A single dose of BPO depleted 93. 2 % of the <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E.</b> While continuing the BPO exposure for 7 d further depleted vitamin E in both vehicle-only and alpha-tocotrienol-treated sites, significantly more vitamin E remained in the alpha-tocotrienol-treated areas. Seven BPO applications increased lipid peroxidation. Alpha-tocotrienol supplementation significantly mitigated the BPO-induced lipid peroxidation. The transepidermal water loss was increased 1. 9 -fold by seven BPO applications, while {{there was no difference between}} alpha-tocotrienol treatment and controls. The data suggest that alpha-tocotrienol supplementation counteracts the lipid peroxidation but not the barrier perturbation in the SC induced by 10 % BPO...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Fatty acid, tocopherol, {{tocotrienol}} and carotene contents {{were assessed}} in four oil palm species from the National Centre of Agronomical Research of Cote d'lvoire, {{two of which}} were the basal Lame (HP 1) and Deli (HP 2) collections and two of which resulted from crossings between HP 1 and HP 2 varieties of Eleais guineensis, HP 3 and HP 4 being identified as {{the first and second}} cycle selection, respectively. RESULTS: Palm oil species were characterized by the richness in polyunsaturated fatty acids composition (48 - 60 %) compared to saturated fatty acids (40 - 52 %), especially the first variety, which was from the base collection, and the two hybrids ensuing from crossing. Total carotene content of those varieties was higher and accounted for 832 - 3575 mu g g(- 1), and the beta-carotene level (580 - 2390 mu g g(- 1)) was predominant. <b>Total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> content was 864 - 1124 mu g g(- 1), with a notable higher content of tocotrienols, especially gamma-and alpha-tocotrienol, ranging from 400 to 515 mu g g(- 1) and from 238 to 350 mu g g(- 1), respectively. CONCLUSION: Crossing seemed to be useful in improving the performance and analytical characteristics of the base collection materials...|$|E
40|$|<b>Vitamin</b> <b>E</b> is an {{essential}} nutrient for human health, with an established function as a lipid-soluble antioxidant that protects cell membranes from free radical damage. Low <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> status {{has been linked to}} multiple health outcomes, including <b>total</b> mortality. With <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> being identified as a 'shortfall nutrient' because > 90 % of American adults are not consuming recommended amounts of <b>vitamin</b> <b>E,</b> we aimed to determine the prevalence of both clinical <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> deficiency (serum α-tocopherol concentration < 12 μmol/L) and failure to meet a criterion of <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> adequacy, serum α-tocopherol concentration of 30 μmol/L, based on the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) and lowest mortality rate in the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene (ATBC) study. The most recent nationally-representative cross-sectional data (2003 - 2006) among non-institutionalized US citizens with available serum concentrations of α-tocopherol from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were analyzed. Serum α-tocopherol distributions were compared between those reporting consumption of food without supplement use (FOOD) and food and supplement use (FOOD+DS) by sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Only 1 % of the US population is clinically deficient. FOOD consumers have lower average α-tocopherol levels (24. 9 ± 0. 2 μmol/L) than FOOD+DS users (33. 7 ± 0. 3 μmol/L), even when adjusted for total cholesterol. Using a criterion of adequacy of 30 μmol/L, 87 % of persons 20 - 30 y and 43 % of those 51 +y had inadequate <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> status (p< 0. 01). A significant greater prevalence of FOOD compared to FOOD+DS users did not meet the criterion of adequacy which was based on the EAR and low ATBC mortality rate consistently across age, sex, and race/ethnic groups. The prevalence of inadequate <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> levels is significantly higher among non-users of dietary supplements. With declining usage of <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> supplements, the population should be monitored for changes in <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> status and related health outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Low {{antioxidant}} {{system may}} contribute to the severity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The aim of this research was to explore the relationship between plasma <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> and C levels and the severity of hyperbilirubinemia in full-term neonates with normal glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) activities. Methods: A total of 130 full-term healthy live birth neonates of healthy mothers with normal G 6 PD activity were included in this study. In addition to routine blood analysis, plasma <b>total</b> bilirubin, <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> and C levels and G 6 PD activity were measured {{on the first day of}} life. None of the neonates was ABO incompatible or anemic. Results: Neonates who did not develop hyperbilirubinemia (n= 119) had a mean plasma bilirubin level of 65 ± 24 µmol/l (median 58. 1), while neonates who developed significant hyperbilirubinemia (n= 11) had a mean plasma bilirubin level of 238 ± 56 µmol/l (median 246. 2) on the first day of life. Mean plasma vitamin C levels of neonates who developed hyperbilirubinemia were significantly lower than those who did not develop hyperbilirubinemia (87 ± 22 µmol/l (median 89. 4) vs. 132 ± 36 µmol/l (median 127. 7), respectively, P= 0. 0001). Similar results were observed for plasma <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> levels in neonates who did or did not develop hyperbilirubinemia (7. 5 ± 2 µmol/l (median 6. 3) vs. 10. 4 ± 5 µmol/l (median 9. 1), respectively, P= 0. 001). Hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly lower in neonates who developed hyperbilirubinemia (P= 0. 0002 and P= 0. 0003, respectively), although gestational age and birth weight for the two groups showed no significant difference. Conclusion: The results of the present work indicate that low level of plasma <b>vitamins</b> C and <b>E</b> are associated with significant hyperbilirubinemia in full-term neonates...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of the apolipoprotein A 5 (APOA 5) 1131 T>C gene variant on vitamin E status and lipid profile. The gene variant was determined in 297 healthy nonsmoking men aged 20 - 75 years and recruited in the VITAGE Project. Effects of the genotype on vitamin E in plasma, LDL, and buccal mucosa cells (BMC) as well as on cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) concentrations in plasma and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apoB, apoE, apoC-III, and plasma fatty acids were determined. Plasma malondialdehyde concentrations as a marker of in vivo lipid peroxidation were determined. C allele carriers showed significantly higher TG, VLDL, and LDL in plasma, higher cholesterol in VLDL and intermediate density lipoprotein, and higher plasma fatty acids. Plasma alpha-tocopherol (but not gamma-tocopherol, LDL alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, or BMC <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E)</b> was increased significantly in C allele carriers compared with homozygote T allele carriers (P = 0. 02), but not after adjustment for cholesterol or TG. Plasma malondialdehyde concentrations did not differ between genotypes. In conclusion, higher plasma lipids in the TC+CC genotype are efficiently protected against lipid peroxidation by higher alpha-tocopherol concentrations. Lipid-standardized vitamin E should be used to reliably assess vitamin E status in genetic association studies...|$|E
40|$|A new vitamin E {{constituent}} {{having an}} unusual methylene unsaturation at the isoprenoid-chain terminus of α-tocopherol (α-Toc) was isolated from chum salmon eggs {{and was found}} to have identical antioxidant activity as does α-Toc in methanol or liposomal suspension at 37 °C. Here we report that this marine-derived tocopherol (MDT) is broadly distributed with α-Toc in the tissue of marine fish, and that the MDT composition of <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> is greater in the flesh of cold-water salmon (12 – 20 %) than in that of tropical fish (≤ 2. 5 %). Vitamin E analysis of cultured masu salmon maintained on a MDT-deplete diet showed substantially less MDT content than native masu salmon, suggesting a trophic origin of MDT. This contention is supported by the finding of MDT in marine plankton from the cold waters of Hokkaido. We found that MDT inhibited peroxidation of cholesterol-containing phosphatidylcholine liposomes {{to a greater extent than}} did α-Toc at 0 °C. Furthermore, the ratios of the rate constants for MDT and α-Toc to scavenge peroxyl radicals increased with decreasing rates of radical flux in liposomes and fish oil at 0 °C, indicating that the enhanced activity of MDT at low temperature is attributed to its greater rate of diffusion in viscous lipids. These results suggest that MDT production, or its trophic accumulation, may reduce lipid peroxidation in marine organisms functionally adapted to cold-water environments...|$|E
40|$|Whole rice {{contains}} several fat-soluble phytochemicals such. as tocopherols, tocotrienols, and gamma-oryzanol {{which have}} been reported to possess beneficial health properties. This study was conducted to determine whether brown rice belonging to indica and japonica subspecies were distinguishable from each other regarding the concentration of these compounds by analyzing 32 genotypes. The fat-soluble compounds were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC in a single run. The variability of the compounds analyzed was high, but the mean content of gamma-oryzanol across all samples was significantly higher (P < 0. 01) in japonica (246. 3 mg/kg) than in indica rice (190. 1 mg/kg). Similar differences were found for <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> contents which were 24. 2 mg/kg injaponica and 17. 1 mg/kg in indica rice, respectively. In japonica rice, alpha-tocopherol, alpha-tocotrienol, and gamma-tocotrienol were the most abundant homologs, while in indica rice the most abundant were gamma-tocotrienol, alpha-tocopherol, and alpha-tocotrienol. A significant Pearson coefficient (0. 80, P < 0. 001) between alpha-tocopherol and alpha-tocotrienol levels was found, independent of the subspecies. Both compounds were positively correlated to total tocols and gamma-oryzanol contents. Although more studies are needed to evaluate the interference of growing rice in different environments and multiple years, the present study provided information on natural variations of the vitamin E isomers and the gamma-oryzanol contents in different rice genotypes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{evaluated}} the nutritional and total phenolic contents {{of leaves and}} fruit of Breynia retusa to study the inhibitory potentials against free radicals, α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes. Proximate composition and anti-nutrient content were investigated in the powdered samples of leaf and fruit. <b>Total</b> phenolic, flavonoid, <b>vitamin</b> C and <b>E</b> contents were measured by spectrophotometric methods. Antioxidant activity was estimated by employing various in vitro assays. The α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitors were studied to determine the anti-diabetic potential of B. retusa. Nutritional composition of fruit showed higher starch, total proteins, total free amino acids and mineral contents as compared to leaves. Anti-nutrient contents of fruit and leaves exhibited a minimum amount of trypsin inhibiting activity and tannin contents. Further, higher contents of <b>total</b> phenolics and <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> were found in leaf methanol extracts. The leaf extract also showed higher antioxidant activity in DPPH, FRAP, metal ion chelating and lipid peroxidation inhibition assays. B. retusa leaf and fruit methanol extracts inhibited α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes. In conclusion, nutritional composition, antioxidant and anti-diabetic activities of B. retusa are suitable and promising for the development as a safe food product or natural additive...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{antiinflammatory}} and antioxidant {{effects were}} recently ascribed to naturally occurring micronutrients. The extent and magnitudes of their differential {{effects on the}} metabolic syndrome (MetS) are still unknown. We examined the association between serum antioxidant status and MetS. NHANES 2001 – 2006 cross-sectional data among adults aged 20 – 85 y were analyzed (n = 3008 – 9099). MetS was defined with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) and also by elevated homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and hyperuricemia. Serum antioxidants included retinol, retinyl esters, carotenoids [α-carotene, β-carotene (cis+trans), β-cryptoxanthin, lutein+zeaxanthin, <b>total</b> lycopene], <b>vitamin</b> <b>E,</b> and <b>vitamin</b> C. MetS (NCEP ATP III) prevalence in U. S. adults was 32. 0 % among men and 29. 5 % among women. Adults with MetS had consistently lower serum carotenoid concentrations compared with those without MetS, even after controlling for total cholesterol and TG among other potential confounders. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>E</b> had no significant relationship with MetS in the full multiple logistic regression model, whereas retinol+retinyl esters {{were inversely related to}} MetS among men only. The latter were also inversely related to elevated CRP and positively associated with hyperuricemia. Vitamin C exhibited a similar pattern to serum carotenoids with an inverse linear association with MetS (binary), HOMA-IR, and hyperuricemia. Future intervention studies of dietary and lifestyle change must be conducted to assess the utility of modifying serum antioxidant concentrations, especially carotenoids, given their suboptimal levels among U.

Epidemiologic studies that have examined this relation produced conflicting results. Objective: We examined the association between antioxidant vitamin intakes and death from stroke. Design: This was a prospective cohort study of 34 492 post-menopausal women. Results: During follow-up, 215 deaths from stroke were docu-mented. <b>Total</b> <b>vitamin</b> A, carotenoid, and <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> intakes were not associated with death from stroke after multivariate adjustment. Relative risks (RRs) and 95 % CIs of the highest compared with the lowest category were 0. 79 (0. 45, 1. 38; P for trend = 0. 33) for vitamin A, 0. 80 (0. 45, 1. 40; P for trend = 0. 40) for carotenoids, and 0. 91 (0. 55, 1. 52; P for trend = 0. 86) for vita-min E. The test for trend for <b>total</b> <b>vitamin</b> C intake was signifi-cant, although the association appeared somewhat U-shaped, not monotonic. An inverse association was seen between death from stroke and <b>vitamin</b> <b>E</b> intake from food. RRs (and 95 % CIs) of death from stroke from the lowest to highest intake categories were 1. 0, 0. 80 (0. 51, 1. 26), 0. 93 (0. 58, 1. 49), 0. 67 (0. 39, 1. 14), 0. 40 (0. 20, 0. 80); P for trend = 0. 008.
