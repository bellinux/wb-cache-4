50|$|In the {{alternate}} continuity of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie, Goldar serves Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, but when Ivan Ooze shows up, Mordant and he switch sides almost automatically after Ooze traps both Rita and Zedd in a snowglobe, depriving {{them of their}} powers. He thinks Kimberly is cute, and when the time comes, he flies away as Ivan takes Angel Grove Tower out of the Ground. In this film, he is portrayed as a bumbling sidekick, very similar <b>to</b> <b>Squatt</b> in the main series. At the very end following Ivan Ooze's destruction, Goldar {{had taken over the}} palace and calls himself King Goldar. Soon a furious Rita and Lord Zedd shows up to punish both him and Mordant.|$|E
5000|$|Squatt and Baboo {{disappear}} {{during the}} Power Rangers Zeo series, when fleeing from the Machine Empire with his masters. Squatt {{was seen in}} [...] "Countdown <b>to</b> Destruction". However, <b>Squatt</b> was never actually seen reduced to sand or purified by Zordon's wave. It can be assumed that Baboo met the same fate as Squatt.|$|R
5000|$|Goldar is a griffin/manticore-themed knight {{who is the}} second-in-command {{for both}} Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd. In season one, he {{sometimes}} fights alongside Scorpina, whom {{he may have been}} in love with, but not developed well unlike the Grifforizer/Lami relationship in Zyuranger. In season three and later on, he is often partnered with Rito Revolto. Spin describes him as a [...] "big freak with wings". Goldar would often fight giant against the Megazord if the episode's monster or device had already been dispatched by the small Rangers. Scorpina (and later, Rito) would aid Goldar in these Megazord battles. Sometimes they would assist the monster in battle. Unlike the monsters they would fight alongside, Goldar would know to retreat to safety when the Rangers called for their finisher, at one point barely escaping without being hit by the Megazord's sword slash finisher (although it is debatable whether it would have even defeated Goldar given his survival of the Thunder Megazord slash). Goldar's role draws parallels as the first born oldest brother <b>to</b> Scorpina, <b>Squatt,</b> and Baboo.|$|R
