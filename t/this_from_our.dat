I observe that several weeds--and most frequently a plant that stains the fingers with its yellow juice--have survived and retained their freshness and sap throughout the winter. One knows not how they have deserved such an exception from the common lot of their race. They are now the patriarchs of the departed year, and may preach mortality to the present generation of flowers and weeds.|$|E

60|$|Acclimatisation.--Habit is {{hereditary}} with plants, as in {{the period}} of flowering, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate, in the time of sleep, &c., and this leads me {{to say a few words}} on acclimatisation. As it is extremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot and very cold countries, and as I believe that all the species of the same genus have descended from a single parent, if this view be correct, acclimatisation must be readily effected during long-continued descent. It is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home: species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a tropical climate, or conversely. So again, many succulent plants cannot endure a damp climate. But the degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which they live is often overrated. {140} We may infer <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant will endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals brought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health. We have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much as, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates. But whether or not the adaptation be generally very close, we have evidence, in the case of some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent, naturally habituated to different temperatures, or becoming acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed collected by Dr. Hooker from trees growing at different heights on the Himalaya, were found in this country to possess different constitutional powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites informs me that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon, and analogous observations have been made by Mr. H. C. Watson on European species of plants brought from the Azores to England. In regard to animals, several authentic cases could be given of species within historical times having largely extended their range from warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes.|$|E

50|$|This {{represented}} {{the most significant}} threat to the century-old political order that had kept the Greek world in relative stability, and in particular represented {{a major threat to}} the smaller Greek kingdoms which had remained independent. As Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire were the problem, and Egypt the cause of the problem, the only place to turn was Rome. This represented a major change, as the Greeks had recently shown little more than contempt towards Rome, and Rome little more than apathy towards Greece. Ambassadors from Pergamon and Rhodes brought evidence before the Roman Senate that Philip V of Macedon and Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire had signed the non-aggression pact. Although the exact nature of this treaty is unclear, and the exact Roman reason for getting involved despite decades of apathy towards Greece (the relevant passages on <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> primary source, Polybius, have been lost), the Greek delegation was successful. Initially, Rome didn't intend to fight a war against Macedon, but rather to intervene on their behalf diplomatically.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{retiring}} from Stars and Stripes in 1969, the Fontaines moved to Guadalajara, Mexico. Of course, {{his approach to}} the canvas changed immeasurably upon relocating to a new environment and having an entirely different makeup of paint available to work with. Fontaine’s forms became gauzier and larger, while his palette became significantly brighter. Instead of grays, black, dark blues, gold, and brown, Fontaine embraced crimson, azure and verdant green, his whites less dirty and blacks less sooty. Upon leaving Darmstadt and Europe, writer Robert d’Hooge noted the following in Schlosskeller: “Since he has discovered his problems and his way of translating and expressing those in his paintings, Fontaine has gone without hesitation, his own way. It was always the intrinsic value of color, the improvement in their comparison and contrast, the vision {{of light and dark}} that was moving to Fontaine. Now the evolution has arrived at the Stadium of Wisdom, where the sonorous double-sound of two colors creates complete harmony in the smallest space. We do not know how the bright light of Mexico will affect the development of Fontaine’s painting. What is a loss for us can be gain for him.

Drawing on Star Trek and nomadic space, we theorise a participatory, situative approach to engaging disciplinary academic teams in the internationalisation of the curriculum process.

40|$|The dwarf {{spheroidal}} {{galaxy in}} Ursa Minor is apparently dark-matter dominated, and is of very low surface brightness, with total luminosity only {{equal to that}} of a globular cluster. Indeed its dominant stellar population is old and metal-poor, very similar to that of a classical halo globular cluster in the Milky Way Galaxy. However, the environment in which its stars formed was clearly different from that in the globular clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy – what was the stellar IMF in this external galaxy a long time ago? The fossil record of long-lived, lowmass stars contains the luminosity function, derivable from simple star counts. This is presented here. The mass function requires a robust mass-luminosity relation, and we describe the initial results to determine <b>this,</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> survey for eclipsing low-mass binaries in old open clusters. The massive star IMF at early times is constrained by elemental abundances in low-mass stars, and we discuss the available data. All data are consistent with an invariant IMF, most probably of Salpeter slope at the massive end, with a turnover at lower masses...|$|E
30|$|Dolomite is {{the main}} {{carbonate}} in CI chondrites and decomposes at 600 – 800  °C (Fig.  1 c). The dolomite abundance in the Ivuna samples (Ivu- 1 and Ivu- 2) is ~ 2  wt.% (King et al. 2015). Dolomite occurs in the Orgueil powders (Org- 2 and Org- 3) at < 1  wt.%, although its abundance {{could be as high}} as ~ 5  wt.% (Endress and Bischoff 1996). If we assume an upper limit of 5  wt.% dolomite, its thermal decomposition would cause a mass of loss of 1.2  wt.%. Subtracting <b>this</b> <b>from</b> <b>our</b> average mass loss between 200 and 800  °C for Ivuna and Orgueil gives values of 17.5 and 17.1  wt.%, values that still overestimate the H 2 O abundance. An additional source of mass loss in this temperature region could be the release of H 2 O, CO 2 and SO 2 from the insoluble organic matter (IOM) present at ~ 2  wt.% in CI chondrites (Alexander et al. 2007). The IOM is refractory but has a complex and heterogeneous composition that probably causes it to decompose over a broad temperature range rather than as a single mass loss event (Court and Sephton 2014).|$|E
