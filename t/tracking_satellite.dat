Wolverine's sense confirmed Shadowcat's suspicions that Xavier was an impostor. It was Cerebro, who had gained sentience, and was going to catalog every mutant on Earth by storing them in cryogenic chambers. If the satellite was launched, then Cerebro wouldn't be able to collect mutants before humans found them. The real X-Men fought and defeated Cerebro's team, and prevented the satellite from exploding. Cerebro escaped, and revealed that his X-Men were nano-tech lifeforms created from the power and personality templates stored in Cerebro's own mutant database. Deeming them failures, he absorbed them into his body, becoming a cybernetic monster. However, the real Charles Xavier was able to subdue Cerebro, and purge a virus from its systems, destroying the robotic body it had created.|$|E
50|$|The main {{mission of}} ATS-6 was to {{demonstrate}} the feasibility of direct-to-home (DTH) television broadcasting. To this end, {{in addition to the}} high-gain antenna, the spacecraft payload was able to receive in any of the VHF, C, S and L-bands, and to transmit in S-band (2 GHz) through a 20-W solid state transmitter, in L-band (1650 MHz) at 40W, in UHF (860 MHz) at 80W (which was used for the Satellite Instructional Television Experiment (SITE)), and with a TWTA-based transmitter of 20 W in C-band (4 GHz). The antenna produced two spots on earth of 400,000 km² each, in which the TV broadcast could be received with 3 meters diameter antennas. This payload was first used over the United States for tele-education and tele-medicine experiments, from August 1974 to May 1975 as part of the HET, or Health, Education, Telecommunications experiment developed jointly by NASA and the US Department of Health, Education, & Welfare (now DHHS). The spacecraft was then moved over the geo-stationary arc from 94 °W to 35 °E, in collaboration with the Indian Space Agency (ISRO), who had deployed in India more than 2500 receive ground stations. A tele-education programme was started - Satellite Instructional Television Experiment or SITE - and run for one year. During the experiment, a receive station was offered by the Indian Government to Arthur C. Clarke, who was living in Sri Lanka. This experiment was highly successful, and encouraged ISRO to start building an operational program, with the Indian spacecraft INSAT IB (launched 1983). After the SITE experiment, the satellite was brought back over the United States, and served notably as a data-relay and <b>tracking</b> <b>satellite</b> for low-orbit spacecraft such as Nimbus 6, and for the Apollo-Soyuz flight.|$|E

40|$|For the {{determination}} of the earth" s gravity field many types of observations are available nowadays, e. g., terrestrial gravimetry, airborne gravimetry, satellite-to-satellite <b>tracking,</b> <b>satellite</b> gradiometry etc. The mathematical connection between these observables {{on the one hand and}} gravity field and shape of the earth on the other hand, is called the integrated concept of physical geodesy. In this paper harmonic wavelets are introduced by which the gravitational part of the gravity field can be approximated progressively better and better, reflecting an increasing flow of observations. An integrated concept of physical geodesy in terms of harmonic wavelets is presented. Essential tools for approximation are integration formulas relating an integral over an internal sphere to suitable linear combinations of observation functionals, i. e., linear functionals representing the geodetic observables. A scale discrete version of multiresolution is described for approximating the gravitational potential outside and on the earth" s surface. Furthermore, an exact fully discrete wavelet approximation is developed for the case of band-limited wavelets. A method for combined global outer harmonic and local harmonic wavelet modelling is proposed corresponding to realistic earth" s models. As examples, the role of wavelets is discussed for the classical Stokes problem, the oblique derivative problem, satellite-to-satellite <b>tracking,</b> <b>satellite</b> gravity gradiometry, and combined satellite-to-satellite tracking and gradiometry...|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} {{of a model}} of the earth's gravitational potential from satellite observations is an illposed problem in the sense that a small change in the data may result in a large change in the solution. A stable solution is obtained by adding a priori information to the system of normal equations. One way to describe the quality of the solution is to assess how much the observations contribute to the solution and how much the a priori information. The redundancy number, which is associated with internal reliability, is sometimes used as a measure of this contribution. It is shown here that this is not strictly correct and an alternative method is developed. Moreover, a contribution measure for biased estimators is given. 1 Introduction Suppose one wants to determine {{a model of the}} earth's gravitational field from satellite methods, e. g. satellite <b>tracking,</b> <b>satellite</b> gravity gradiometry, etc. It is then well known that the determination is an inverse or ill-posed problem requir [...] ...|$|E
