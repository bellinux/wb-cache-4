5|$|The British then {{articulated}} <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> of Washington and his army; on August 23, 1775, Britain {{issued a}} Royal proclamation labeling American Patriots as traitors.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> of the world, and that there was bound to be a war within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|Louis XIV of France {{sought to}} knock Emperor Leopold {{out of the}} war by seizing Vienna, the Habsburg capital, and gain a {{favourable}} peace settlement. The dangers to Vienna were considerable: the Elector of Bavaria and Marshal Marsin's forces in Bavaria threatened from the west, and Marshal Vendôme's large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the Brenner Pass. Vienna was also under pressure from Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the Duke of Marlborough resolved to alleviate <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> to Vienna by marching his forces south from Bedburg and help maintain Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.|$|E

5|$|In the {{resulting}} Cabinet meeting on naval deployments on 7 September, Thorneycroft and Mountbatten argued {{the case for}} the forcing of the Strait with the task force, acknowledging that though the carrier would be at risk of severe damage or loss, preventing Sukarno from achieving a victory of brinkmanship was worth <b>the</b> <b>peril.</b> Though Foreign Secretary R.A. Butler strongly represented Begg's argument that the Victorious was too valuable an asset to lose, Thorneycroft's arguments won out. The Cabinet concurred that the ship should not be diverted, as a blockage of the carrier would increase Sukarno's prestige to no end, and approved preparations for Operation Althorpe, a plan to wipe out the Indonesian air force in retaliation for an attack. Although no precipitous decision was made, and though the Cabinet had agreed to examine the matter further.|$|E
5|$|In the story, Tyrion {{uses his}} status as a Lannister to {{mitigate}} the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his family. Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence. As the peaceful rule of King Robert Baratheon begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are to hold everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful Catelyn Stark and her sister Lysa Arryn, then is sent by his father Tywin to impose order on the capital of King's Landing, as well as his nephew Joffrey, the new king, as civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister Cersei. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without the Lannister resources.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August, Godwin-Austen {{realized}} <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> of his situation, with XV Brigade nearly {{able to cut}} him {{off from}} behind, his troops exhausted, and his artillery completely deficient and running low on ammunition, and informed General Henry Maitland Wilson, who was in command at Cairo while Wavell was absent in England, that retreat from Tug Argan and evacuation from British Somaliland was now a necessity. If his forces could be evacuated, perhaps 70 percent of them might be removed. Otherwise, he {{would be forced to}} fight to the death, with his entire command destroyed. Wilson agreed to Godwin-Austen's request the next day, and preparations were made to flee after dark on 15 August. During that day, Observation Hill was attacked for the final time by De Simone's forces. De Simone had decided to doggedly press his attack in the gap, in lieu of completing the flanking maneuver, and finally this proved successful. By 7:00pm XIII Brigade had seized Observation Hill, and the British retreated from it in disarray. After sundown, the defenders of the remaining hills were withdrawn, along with the Punjab troops, who departed just as II Brigade was able to make inroads through their abandoned positions. British resistance had collapsed, and as Godwin-Austen and his forces fled towards Berbera, the Italians were in control of Tug Argan.|$|E

25|$|The {{coast of}} Canvey Island was {{host to the}} Chapman Lighthouse as briefly {{described}} in Joseph Conrad's novel Heart of Darkness. It is believed that <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> of the mudflats below such shallow waters off the Canvey Island coast prompted the Romans to devise some form of beacon as a warning in the area. In 1851 a hexagonal lighthouse was constructed by the engineer James Walker, a consultant lighthouse engineer at Trinity House at the time. This all-iron lighthouse replaced a lightship which had been moored {{in the area for}} the preceding four years. The lighthouse was demolished in 1957-1958 due to its poor condition.|$|E
25|$|Papebroch, the Bollandist {{editor of}} the Acta Sanctorum, was {{answered}} by the Carmelite Sebastian of St. Paul, who made such serious charges against the orthodoxy of his opponent's writings that {{the very existence of}} the Bollandists was threatened. <b>The</b> <b>peril</b> was averted, however. In 1696 a decree of Juan Tomás de Rocaberti, archbishop of Valencia and inquisitor-general of the Holy Office, forbade all further controversies between the Carmelites and Jesuits. Two years later, on November 20, 1698, Pope Innocent XII issued a brief that definitely ended the controversy on pain of excommunication, and placed all writings in violation of the brief on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.|$|E

25|$|Marlovians {{suggest it}} is {{significant}} that every person involved in the incident seems to have been associated {{in one way or another}} either with his friend and patron Thomas Walsingham (Frizer and Skeres) or with his employers the Cecils (Poley, Bull and Danby). They point to the lengthy period (10 hours) in which the four men remained together at Eleanor Bull's house that day, and suggest this seems unnecessary if the intent had been simply to dispose of Marlowe. The most likely reason for the get-together, they say, would have been to save him in some way from <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> facing him. They claim that the faking of his death fits more of the facts as known than any other scenario. That Poley, Frizer and Skeres all made a living from being able to lie convincingly may have been relevant too.|$|E
25|$|In May–June 1993, when, as {{a result}} of a crisis in the government, the country was on the verge of a civil war and faced <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> of losing independence, the people of Azerbaijan demanded to bring Heydar Aliyev to power, and the then leaders of Azerbaijan were obliged to officially invite Heydar Aliyev to Baku. On 24 June 1993, amidst the {{advancement}} of insurgent forces under Huseynov's control towards Baku, Elchibey fled from the city to his native village of Keleki in Nakhchivan. Earlier, on 15 June 1993, Aliyev had been elected Chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, and after Elchibey's flight he also assumed temporary presidential powers. In August 1993, Elchibey was stripped of his presidency by the nationwide referendum, and in October 1993, Aliyev was elected President of Azerbaijan. In May 1994, Aliyev entered into a ceasefire agreement that still remains in force to this very day. However, the conflict remained unresolved, with Armenian control over Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E
25|$|Noteworthy is {{that while}} {{organizing}} assistance to the Estonian mission, Pope Alexander III was also closely following the situation in Finland, something that no previous Pope {{is known to have}} done. Eskil and Stefan, the Archbishop of Uppsala, who had also been appointed to his high office by Eskil in 1164, were both close acquaintances with the Pope, having met in France while the Pope had been exiled there in the 1160s. In Pope's letter to Stefan in 1171 (or 1172), he complains how Finns only turned to God at the time of war, harassing preachers as soon as <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> was over. No Diocese or Bishop of Finland is mentioned in the papal letter, and no information survives, whether it prompted any actions. In the apparent shortage of missionaries, it can be speculated that the frustrated Pope may have organized Fulco to deal with the Finns as soon as his assistant Nicolaus could have taken over the missionary work in Estonia.|$|E

25|$|One {{theory of}} Europe's rise holds that Europe's {{geography}} {{played an important}} role in its success. The Middle East, India and China are all ringed by mountains and oceans but, once past these outer barriers, are nearly flat. By contrast, the Pyrenees, Alps, Apennines, Carpathians and other mountain ranges run through Europe, and the continent is also divided by several seas. This gave Europe some degree of protection from <b>the</b> <b>peril</b> of Central Asian invaders. Before the era of firearms, these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the Eurasian continent and, as they broke out into the plains of northern India or the valleys of China, were all but unstoppable. These invasions were often devastating. The Golden Age of Islam was ended by the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. India and China were subject to periodic invasions, and Russia spent a couple of centuries under the Mongol-Tatar yoke. Central and western Europe, logistically more distant from the Central Asian heartland, proved less vulnerable to these threats.|$|E
500|$|A lot of {{the special}} was more [...] "edgy" [...] and dark than {{what had been done}} {{previously}} on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.
