[...] After arriving in London, she said, “It’s been overwhelming, definitely, I wasn’t expecting it to be like this. I {{knew it was going to}} be big but this was more than I expected. But I’ve got all my team-mates to settle me down and <b>talk</b> <b>me</b> through things. Being in the village has been the best bit – how big it is, and seeing other athletes, great athletes, walking around. The others have tried to calm me down.” ...|$|E

Jackson stated, [...] "The record company tried to <b>talk</b> <b>me</b> {{out of it}} because it's directed toward a girl. I love the song the way it is, and it's reality {{for a lot of}} people." [...] "I Get Lonely" [...] evokes lush sensuality as Jackson speaks of abandonment over a sparse backing. [...] "Rope Burn" [...] evokes bondage and sadomasochism, as Jackson requests to be tied down and pleasured with candle wax. It was declared [...] "the first R trip-hop ballad, retro-fitted with a lazy, jazzy beat and a spare, slap bass-heavy backing track." [...] Jackson regarded it as a [...] "soft instrument of extended pleasure," [...] saying, [...] "The expression of sexual fantasies can be beautiful if there's trust, love and understanding." [...] "Anything" [...] is a ballad invoking [...] "feverish dimensions" [...] of satisfaction.|$|E

2500|$|So Jason Clarke is my {{public defender}} {{at the time}} and he's warning me. He's saying, [...] "Lindsey don't take drug court. I'm telling you, you won't make it."

2500|$|In March 2007, Warner Bros. {{chose to}} produce, seeing {{similarities}} in the concept with Batman Begins. Arthur Conan Doyle's estate had some involvement in sorting out legal issues, although the stories are {{in the public domain}} in the United States.

When a child at boarding school, Ritchie and other pupils listened to the Holmes stories through dormitory loudspeakers. [...] "Holmes used to <b>talk</b> <b>me</b> to sleep every night when I was seven years old," [...] he said. Therefore, his image of Holmes differed from the films. He wanted to make his film more [...] "authentic" [...] to Doyle, explaining, [...] "There's quite a lot of intense action sequences in the stories, [...] sometimes that hasn't been reflected in the movies." [...] Holmes' [...] "brilliance will [...] into the action", and the film will show that his [...] "intellect was as much of a curse as it was a blessing". Ritchie sought to make Sherlock Holmes a [...] "very contemporary film as far as the tone and texture", because it has been [...] "a relatively long time since there's been a film version that people embraced".|$|E
