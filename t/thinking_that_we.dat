2500|$|In November 2005, 28 biogerontologists {{published}} {{a statement of}} criticism in EMBO reports, [...] "Science fact and the SENS agenda: what can we reasonably expect from ageing research?," [...] arguing [...] "each one of the specific proposals that comprise the SENS agenda is, at our present stage of ignorance, exceptionally optimistic," [...] {{and that some of}} the specific proposals [...] "will take decades of hard work , if [...] ever prove to be useful." [...] The researchers argue that while there is [...] "a rationale for <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might eventually learn how to postpone human illnesses to an important degree," [...] increased basic research, rather than the goal-directed approach of SENS, is presently the scientifically appropriate goal. This article was written in response to a July 2005 EMBO reports article previously published by de Grey and a response from de Grey was published in the same November issue. De Grey summarizes these events in [...] "The biogerontology research community's evolving view of SENS," [...] published on the Methuselah Foundation website.|$|E
2500|$|... "Please Please Me" [...] has {{a diverse}} history. [...] George Martin {{has stated that}} the {{original}} version of this song was [...] "rather dreary", was too slow and consequently had little prospect of being the big hit the band were looking for. Martin said, [...] "I was still <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should release their [...] recording of 'How Do You Do It?'", a previously taped Mitch Murray composition that Martin insisted the Beatles record which he had seriously considered as an alternative debut single instead of [...] "Love Me Do". The group replied that they were only interested in recording their own material. McCartney said: [...] "It was symptomatic of our group that we turned down 'How Do You Do It?'." [...] Ringo Starr commented: [...] "I remember us all being ready {{to stand up for}} the principle of, 'We have written these songs and we want to do them'". George Martin was ultimately sympathetic to their appeals, but said later: [...] " [...] would still have issued [...] "How Do You Do It?" [...] had they not persuaded me to listen to another version of [...] "Please Please Me".|$|E
2500|$|He {{initially}} {{refrained from}} visiting the shrine as a sitting Prime Minister. He did not visit at all {{during his first}} term from September 2006 to September 2007, unlike his predecessor Koizumi, who had visited yearly while in office. Abe's not visiting the shrine prompted a Japanese nationalist named Yoshihiro Tanjo to cut off his own little finger in protest and mail it to the LDP. While campaigning for {{the presidency of the}} LDP in 2012, Abe said that he regretted not visiting the shrine while Prime Minister. He again refrained from visiting the shrine {{during the first year of}} his second stint as Prime Minister in consideration for improving relations with China and Korea, whose leaders refused to meet with Abe during this time. He said on 9 December 2013 that [...] "it is natural that we should express our feelings of respect to the war dead who sacrificed their lives for the nation... but it is my <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should avoid making [...] political and diplomatic issues." [...] In lieu of visiting, Abe sent ritual offerings to the shrine for festivals in April and October 2013, as well as the anniversary of the end of World War II in August 2013.|$|E

2500|$|The MRF {{had both}} a [...] "defensive" [...] {{surveillance}} role and an [...] "offensive" [...] role. MRF operatives dressed like civilians and were given fake identities and unmarked cars equipped with two-way radios. They patrolled {{the streets in}} these cars in teams of two to four, tracking down and arresting or killing suspected IRA members. They were armed with Browning pistols and Sterling sub-machine guns. Former MRF members admitted that the unit shot unarmed people without warning, both IRA members and civilians, knowingly breaking the British Army's Rules of Engagement. Former MRF members claim they had a list of targets they were ordered to [...] "shoot on sight", the aim being to [...] "beat them at their own game" [...] and to [...] "terrorise" [...] the republican movement. According to Cursey, the unit was told that these tactics had British Government backing, [...] "as part of a deeper political game". He said his section shot at least 20 people: [...] "We opened fire at any small group in hard areas [...] armed or not – it didn't matter. We targeted specific groups that were always up to no good. These types were sympathisers and supporters, assisting the IRA movement. As far as we were concerned they were guilty by association and party to terrorist activities, leaving themselves wide open to the ultimate punishment from us". Cursey mentions two occasions where MRF members visited pubs and [...] "eliminated" [...] IRA members. One member interviewed for the BBC's Panorama, Soldier F, said [...] "We were not there {{to act like a}}n army unit, we were there to act like a terror group". Soldier H said [...] "We operated initially with them <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were the UVF", to which Soldier F added: [...] "We wanted to cause confusion". Another said that their role was [...] "to draw out the IRA and to minimise their activities". They said they fired on groups of people manning defensive barricades, on the assumption that some might be armed. The MRF member who made a statement in 1978 opined that the unit's role was one of [...] "repression through fear, terror and violence". He said that the unit had been trained to use weapons favoured by the IRA.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, I am {{with you}} there, Dave!" [...] cried the senator's son, quickly. [...] "I was <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>we</b> would warn this Mr. Fordham without Haskers knowing {{anything}} about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should say}} it was--to me. Don't be in a hurry. You're <b>thinking</b> <b>that,</b> now <b>we</b> {{know all about}} you, your utility as a sleuth has waned to some extent. Is that it?' ...|$|R
60|$|Very austere and admirable they looked, almost painfully {{conscious}} of their superior virtue. But I {{could not help}} <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> had <b>we</b> not been spectators the chenar trees might have witnessed the triumph of reason over religious prejudice.|$|R

5000|$|... "The {{bands are}} {{starting}} to kind of merge together. <b>We</b> wrote <b>that</b> song together and we liked it so we're <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> maybe <b>we</b> should write some more songs together. I think that is where it's leading to now." ...|$|R
60|$|Jacob's eyes twinkled with {{satisfaction}} {{when he heard}} this proposition, and I believed he was <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> lay in hiding a full day {{in front of the}} fortification, he might have opportunity to learn something concerning his father.|$|R
50|$|In this era, {{in which}} the keyword is innovation, we cannot be {{satisfied}} with simply attaining information. We also need to attain built-in tools {{in order to develop}} our <b>thinking</b> so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can create, not only respond.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no secret,--none {{at least}} from you, or from mamma; and, indeed, none from him. We were both very foolish, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> knew each other and our own hearts, when we knew neither." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{hope you}} are right in <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall meet again. Once I wished not to live, but the faculty of life seems to {{have sprung up in}} me again, from under the {{crushing}} foot of heavy grief.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis as well we {{have found}} {{overhead}} protection, Massey," [...] said the doctor, when our coxswain {{led him to the}} spot, [...] "for I have been <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> as <b>we</b> have no blankets, we shall be obliged to use our tarpaulin as a quilt rather than an umbrella." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this proved}} very entertaining, and I {{was glad to}} laugh with the crowd, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> after all <b>we</b> were taking a very mild revenge on our hated enemies, the tyrants of the roads.|$|R
6000|$|... "We need lose no {{time about}} the mast, sir. We {{stripped}} the gear off and got it on board the Spartane, and towed her mast behind her, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> perhaps <b>we</b> might not get a suitable spar here. Of course the lower mast will be short, but that will matter comparatively little. What is more serious is that her rudder is smashed." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jarndyce got up, {{rubbing his}} head, {{and began to}} walk about. Mr. Skimpole played the melody of one of Ada's {{favourite}} songs. Ada and I both looked at Mr. Jarndyce, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> knew what was passing in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{may be all}} fancy, Tom," [...] Peter said, [...] "but I can't help <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are followed. There {{are three}} follows who have passed us twice, and I am pretty sure they are {{particularly}} noticing us. Keep your hand on your pistol." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> {{were about}} to be taken up under the act for the {{suppression}} of vagrancy, we flew out of the house, sprang into a canoe before the door, and paddled with might and main over to {{the opposite side of the}} lake.|$|E
6000|$|... "And a royal gift it is," [...] {{said the}} {{grinning}} subaltern, {{who made the}} explanation. [...] "The major gives us an entertainment in honor of our victory, {{and you see the}} principal expense is borne as it should be, by the enemy. Zounds! I am <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> after <b>we</b> have primed with such stuff, we could charge through Sir Henry's headquarters, and carry off the knight himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, darling; yes, of course,--there's {{nothing to}} forgive. No, I was only <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> when <b>we</b> talked on Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday about my absence to-day, and I was {{so sorry for}} it, you said, Fancy, so were you sorry, and almost cried, {{and said it would}} be no {{pleasure}} to you to be the attraction of the church to-day, since I could not be there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good heavens!" [...] he cried, [...] "you are <b>thinking</b> of <b>that</b> play <b>we</b> saw at Rome! Are we on the stage? Are you {{performing}} {{the part of}} the Marquis--and am I the Count?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't suppose any of {{them had}} an idea of what had happened, until the sentry shouted to them that we had got over the wall. Then they rushed up, and fired at random from the top, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be running {{straight}} from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad to {{hear you}} say so," [...] {{observed}} Nigel, [...] "for although the sight is extremely magnificent and very interesting, both from a scientific and artistic point of view, I cannot help <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should be safer away from this island at present--at least while the volcano is active." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Shut the gates,' I shouted, <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might perhaps catch Sorais so, and {{not being}} troubled {{with the idea of}} {{committing}} sacrilege. But the order came too late, her guards were already passing through them, and in another minute the streets echoed with the furious galloping of horses and the rolling of her chariots.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} truth {{has been made}} more, and more {{subjective}} and relative in the Western train of <b>thinking,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can speak of a crisis {{of the idea of}} truth. On the other hand there are numerous efforts nowadays to understand the meaning of truth in a new way. Theology is interested in these things too. [...] . Zie: Summar...|$|R
