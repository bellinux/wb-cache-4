40|$|Recent {{developments}} in <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>recording</b> holograms and advancements in automated image digitalization and analysis make real-time {{laser holographic interferometry}} feasible for two-dimensional flows such as airfoil flows. Typical airfoil measurements would include airfoil presssure distributions, wake and boundary layer profiles, and flow field density contours. This paper addresses {{some of the problems}} and requirements of a real-time laser holographic interferometer...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a dual plate holographic interferometer using <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>recording</b> devices is described. The operational characteristics of the thermoplastic devices are investigated and optimized for fringe contrast and signal-to-noise ratio. The dual plate device was demonstrated in a transonic wind tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center. The interferograms derived from the thermoplastic device are compared with those derived from conventional photographic emulsions. The fringe contrast achieved with the optimized thermoplastic device {{is equivalent to the}} contrast achieved with conventional techniques...|$|E
40|$|Thermoplastic-photoconductor optical {{recording}} plates were fabricated, in which fairly thick thermoplastic layers of about 10 Î¼m thickness formed active layers. The method for processing the thermoplastic plates was a sequential one, in which charge, exposure and heat development proceeded sequentially. The spatial frequency {{response of the}} plates was measured {{in the following way}} : the interference fringes of various spatial frequencies exposed the plates and real-time digital differentiation of the diffracted light output from the <b>recorded</b> <b>thermoplastic</b> plates detected their peak diffraction efficiencies during heat development. The spatial frequency response measured had a band-pass region, whose center was located at the spatial frequency of about 100 lines/mm rather than several hundred lines/mm in the case of usual thermoplastic plates...|$|R
40|$|The first {{exact method}} for the {{evaluation}} {{of the effects of the}} finite, band-limited spatial resolution of the <b>thermoplastic</b> - photoconductor <b>recording</b> materials on the reconstructed holographic image is presented in this paper. This new method is based on substitution of the amplitude modulation transfer function (i. e. the square root of the MTF) of the recording material into the double Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral describing the complex amplitude of the reconstructed image. The contrast of the reconstructed image as a function of various recording parameters such as the centre and width of the amplitude modulation transfer function of the recording material, the object position and the reference beam angle have been computed. Numerical calculations have been carried out for thin holograms of microline objects in two recording geometries, one with a tilted object plane...|$|R
40|$|Laser {{transmission}} welding is {{an established}} joining process for thermoplastics. A close-to-reality simulation of the heating process {{would improve the}} understanding of the process, facilitate and shorten the process installation, and provide a significant contribution to the computer aided component design. For these reasons a thermal simulation model for simultaneous welding was developed which supports determining the size of the heat affected zone (HAZ). The determination of the intensity profile of the laser beam after the penetration of the laser transparent semicrystalline thermoplastic is decisive for the simulation. For the determination of the intensity profile two measurement systems are presented and compared. The calculated size of the HAZ shows a high concordance to the dimensions of the HAZ found using light microscopy. However, the calculated temperatures exceed the indicated decomposition temperatures of the particular <b>thermoplastics.</b> For the <b>recording</b> of the real temperatures during the welding process a measuring system is presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a method for}} increasing the diffraction efficiency of multiply exposed photorefractive holograms by periodic copying. The method is experimentally demonstrated with photorefractive and <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>recording</b> media. Photorefractive holograms are electro-optic index per-turbations formed by the redistribution of photogen-erated charge among local trapping sites. The charge pattern associated with a hologram is driven by its own space-charge field to decay exponentially with a time constant characterized by the dielectric relaxation time. In the dark, this time may be days or months. For applications in adaptive holography and holo-graphic information storage, multiple exposures are used to form photorefractive holograms. Since the relaxation time decreases substantially during expo-sure, recording an uncorrelated hologram causes th...|$|E
40|$|The Holographic Enhanced Remote Sensing System (HERSS) {{consists}} of three primary subsystems: (1) an Image Acquisition System (IAS); (2) a Digital Image Processing System (DIPS); and (3) a Holographic Generation System (HGS) which multiply exposes a <b>thermoplastic</b> <b>recording</b> medium with sequential 2 -D depth slices that are displayed on a Spatial Light Modulator (SLM). Full-parallax holograms were successfully generated by superimposing SLM images onto the thermoplastic and photopolymer. An improved HGS configuration utilizes the phase conjugate recording configuration, the 3 -SLM-stacking technique, and the photopolymer. The holographic volume size is currently limited to the physical size of the SLM. A larger-format SLM is necessary to meet the desired 6 inch holographic volume. A photopolymer with an increased photospeed is required to ultimately meet a display update rate of less than 30 seconds. It is projected that the latter two technology developments will occur in the near future. While the IAS and DIPS subsystems were unable to meet NASA goals, an alternative technology is now available to perform the IAS/DIPS functions. Specifically, a laser range scanner can be utilized to build the HGS numerical database of the objects at the remote work site...|$|E
