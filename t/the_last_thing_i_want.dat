The album was only made available through American Wal-Mart stores and Wal-Mart's website. Furthermore, it was made a limited release because Swift only allowed Big Machine Records to manufacture {{a certain number of}} copies of the EP. She said, [...] "I’m only letting my record company make a small amount of these. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> any of you to think is that we are putting out too many releases." ...|$|E

So {{for the first time the}} lyrics started being written before recording begun, with Grohl stating that he [...] "sat in the back of the studio and just wrote every day for about 14 hours a day." [...] Most of the lyrics of the album deal with themes of birth, death and life, which Grohl attributed to the birth of his daughter Violet, considering that having a child [...] "changes your entire outlook on the world", and that he was suddenly more emotional - [...] "So when you're writing music with that in mind or that in your heart, everything just blooms into this fucking incredibly colourful, colourful feeling." [...] Helped by the extensive lyrical preparation, the lyrics also tried to show more of Grohl's feelings, [...] "those things that you've always wanted to do or always wanted to say", with Hawkins adding that he could not listen to [...] "Stranger Things Have Happened" [...] as [...] "I'm one of his best friends, and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do is read a love letter to his wife or whoever it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pet usage is {{the primary}} market for trapped painted turtles {{although}} a small number are sent to turtle races. Commercial trapping is modest economically, with double digits of trappers, selling a few thousand turtles yearly, at $1–2 per turtle. Individual harvesters who trap painted turtles typically do so for extra money and alternate between fishing and turtle trapping based on the markets. Many have been traditionally involved in the trade: Ben Hedstrom of Minnesota said, [...] "We've sold turtles for 50 years. My dad did it since the 1920s." [...] Some harvesters disagree with limiting the catch. Rex Campbell of Minnesota said, [...] "I {{can go out and}} catch more turtles today than I did 10 years ago. I don't see that it's hurting the turtle population. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to see {{is the end of the}} resource we've all depended on for a long time. I'm not against regulating the industry, but we want to go out and harvest and still make a living at it." ...|$|E

A violent revolution falls into the hands of narrow-minded fanatics and of tyrannical hypocrites at first. Afterwards comes the turn of all the pretentious intellectual failures of the time. Such are the chiefs and the leaders. You will notice that I have left out the mere rogues. The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane, and devoted natures; the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a movement--but it passes away from them. They are not the leaders of a revolution. They are its victims: the victims of disgust, of disenchantment--often of remorse. Hopes grotesquely betrayed, ideals caricatured--that is the definition of revolutionary success. There have been in every revolution hearts broken by such successes. But enough of that. My meaning is that I don't want you to be a victim." ...|$|E
