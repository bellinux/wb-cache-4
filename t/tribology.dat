25|$|In <b>tribology,</b> liquids are {{studied for}} their {{properties}} as lubricants. Lubricants {{such as oil}} are chosen for viscosity and flow characteristics that are suitable throughout the operating temperature range of the component. Oils are often used in engines, gear boxes, metalworking, and hydraulic systems for their good lubrication properties.|$|E
25|$|The many {{self-organizing}} {{phenomena in}} physics include phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking such as spontaneous magnetization and crystal growth in classical physics, and the laser, superconductivity and Bose–Einstein condensation in quantum physics. It {{is found in}} self-organized criticality in dynamical systems, in <b>tribology,</b> in spin foam systems, and in loop quantum gravity.|$|E
25|$|A common way {{to reduce}} {{friction}} is by using a lubricant, such as oil, water, or grease, which is placed between the two surfaces, often dramatically lessening the coefficient of friction. The science of friction and lubrication is called <b>tribology.</b> Lubricant technology is when lubricants are mixed with the application of science, especially to industrial or commercial objectives.|$|E
25|$|Classical contact {{mechanics}} is most notably associated with Heinrich Hertz. In 1882, Hertz solved the contact problem of two elastic bodies with curved surfaces. This still-relevant classical solution provides {{a foundation for}} modern problems in {{contact mechanics}}. For example, in mechanical engineering and <b>tribology,</b> Hertzian contact stress is {{a description of the}} stress within mating parts. The Hertzian contact stress usually refers to the stress close to the area of contact between two spheres of different radii.|$|E
25|$|The modern total hip {{replacement}} was pioneered by Sir John Charnley, expert in <b>tribology</b> at Wrightington Hospital, England in the 1960s. He found that joint surfaces could {{be replaced by}} implants cemented to the bone. His design consisted of a stainless steel one-piece femoral stem and head and a polyethylene, acetabular component, {{both of which were}} fixed to the bone using PMMA (acrylic) bone cement. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty and its derivative designs were the most-used systems in the world. This formed the basis for all modern hip implants.|$|E
25|$|Further {{advancement}} {{in the field}} of contact mechanics in the mid-twentieth century may be attributed to names such as Bowden and Tabor. Bowden and Tabor were the first to emphasize the importance of surface roughness for bodies in contact. Through investigation of the surface roughness, the true contact area between friction partners is found to be less than the apparent contact area. Such understanding also drastically changed the direction of undertakings in <b>tribology.</b> The works of Bowden and Tabor yielded several theories in contact mechanics of rough surfaces.|$|E
25|$|When {{surfaces}} in contact move relative to each other, the {{friction between the}} two surfaces converts kinetic energy into thermal energy (that is, it converts work to heat). This property can have dramatic consequences, {{as illustrated by the}} use of friction created by rubbing pieces of wood together to start a fire. Kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy whenever motion with friction occurs, for example when a viscous fluid is stirred. Another important consequence of many types of friction can be wear, which may lead to performance degradation or damage to components. Friction is a component of the science of <b>tribology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Burtonwood Brewery (the HQ of Thomas Hardy Burtonwood, who {{developed}} Britain's alcopop drinks in the 1990s) {{is on the}} B5204 in the west of Burtonwood, towards St Helens borough. Birchwood Park {{has to be the}} main technical business park in the North West. The Bank of England MPC's Agency for the North West is on Birchwood Park near the HQ of GB Oils, the UK's leading fuel oil supplier (owned by DCC), and the operator of Gulf Oil petrol stations in the UK. Electricity North West (the North West's distribution network operator) is near by, with ESR Technology, who did work for the Philae space probe and owns the National Centre of <b>Tribology</b> at Whittle House in Risley, with TalkTalk Business to the west, near International Nuclear Services and Sellafield Ltd at Hinton House. Terberg Matec UK (Dutch) supply lifts for bin wagons next to M62 junction 11. Also west of the park is Nuvia UK (part of Soletanche Freyssinet). Betfred (having the largest turnover in the region—£13.3bn) is at the western end of Birchwood itself, next to the M6 and Birchwood railway station. Birchwood was built on the former ROF Risley.|$|E

2500|$|The classic laws of sliding {{friction}} were discovered by Leonardo da Vinci [...] in 1493, {{a pioneer in}} <b>tribology,</b> but the laws documented in his notebooks, were not published and remained unknown. These laws were rediscovered by Guillaume Amontons in 1699 and became known as Amonton's three laws of dry friction (below). [...] Amontons presented the nature of friction in terms of surface irregularities and the force required to raise the weight pressing the surfaces together. This view was further elaborated by Bernard Forest de Bélidor and Leonhard Euler (1750), who derived the angle of repose of a weight on an inclined plane and first distinguished between static and kinetic friction.|$|E
2500|$|Contact {{mechanics}} is part {{of mechanical}} engineering. [...] The physical and mathematical formulation of the subject is built upon the mechanics of materials and continuum mechanics and focuses on computations involving elastic, viscoelastic, and plastic bodies in static or dynamic contact. Contact mechanics provides necessary information for the safe and energy efficient design of technical systems and {{for the study of}} <b>tribology,</b> contact stiffness, electrical contact resistance and indentation hardness. Principles of contacts mechanics are implemented towards applications such as locomotive wheel-rail contact, coupling devices, braking systems, tires, bearings, combustion engines, mechanical linkages, gasket seals, metalworking, metal forming, ultrasonic welding, electrical contacts, and many others. Current challenges faced in the field may include stress analysis of contact and coupling members and the influence of lubrication and material design on friction and wear. Applications of contact mechanics further extend into the micro- and nanotechnological realm.|$|E
