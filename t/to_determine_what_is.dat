5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E

Some of the letters may have been forgeries or literary exercises assembled in collections which were already circulated in the 2nd century AD. It has been asserted that Philostratus himself forged a considerable part of the letters he inserted into his work; others were older forgeries available to him.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a recent problem with fake amber being sold on the street, either made of plastic or glass. True Chiapas amber is {{extracted}} {{from the town of}} Simojovel to the north. There is a great price difference between the real and fake amber, and this price difference can be enough to put authentic amber vendors out of business. Many of the sellers of fake amber are successful because many people, especially foreign tourists, do not know how <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> real. However, one indicator is price, as true amber cannot be sold for the very low prices that street vendors offer.|$|E
25|$|On 26 November 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Virgin Media would trial deep packet inspection technology to measure the level of illegal file sharing on its network. The CView system, provided by Detica, will look at traffic and identify the peer-to-peer packets. It will then peer inside those packets and try <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> licensed and what is unlicensed, based on data provided by the record industry. The trial – which has no scheduled end date – will cover about 40% of Virgin Media's network but those involved will not be informed. Virgin Media emphasised that it is seeking to measure the overall level of illegal file sharing, not to keep records on individual customers. Data on the level of copyright infringement will be aggregated and anonymised.|$|E

500|$|Categorically {{stating the}} number of islands is difficult, as the method used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> an island is not {{necessarily}} the same in each source. Since the water level of the lake can vary greatly between years, what may be considered an island in a high water year may be considered a peninsula in another, or an island in a low water year may be covered during another year. According to the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey, [...] "there are eight named islands in the lake that have never been totally submerged during historic time. All have been connected to the mainland by exposed shoals during periods of low water." [...] In addition to these eight islands, the lake also contains a number of rocks, reefs, or shoals that become fully or partially submerged at high water levels.|$|E
500|$|According to Dean Biron of Overland, [...] "Nightcrawler is a {{shattering}} {{critique of}} both modern-day media practice and consumer culture." [...] Throughout the film, Nina sensationalizes news headlines {{in an attempt}} to increase viewership. PopMatters Jon Lisi believes that, because of Nina's actions, the film specifically targets journalists who exaggerate headlines in order to combat a decline in viewership. Ed Rampell of The Progressive offers similar commentary, stating: [...] "Nightcrawler contends that ethnic and class biases are used <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is,</b> and is not, deemed 'worthy' of news coverage. Local politics and related matters that actually affect viewers' lives get short shrift." [...] As much as the film indicts modern journalism, Nightcrawler director Dan Gilroy noted that his goal was for audiences to realize that by watching sensationalized news stories, they themselves are encouraging unethical journalism. Biron argues that Lou's character in the film is created because of consumer demand, and that he is a [...] "reflection of the symbiotic relationship between commercial imperatives and audience desire". Some critics argue that Nightcrawler {{is not so much a}} critique of journalism, but instead a depiction of Lou's entitlement.|$|E

2500|$|Values {{within the}} {{reference}} range (WRR) are those within the normal distribution {{and are thus}} often described as within normal limits (WNL). The limits of the normal distribution are called the upper reference limit (URL) or upper limit of normal (ULN) and the lower reference limit (LRL) or lower limit of normal (LLN). In health care–related publishing, style sheets sometimes prefer the word reference over the word normal to prevent the nontechnical senses of normal from being conflated with the statistical sense. Values outside a reference range are not [...] pathologic, {{and they are not}} necessarily abnormal in any sense other than statistically. Nonetheless, they are indicators of probable pathosis.

2500|$|From his {{definition}} of wealth, Hall argued that the problem in civilised societies came from {{the ability of the}} wealthy, through their control of the labour of others, <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> produced.

Because the rich exploit the poor to produce their luxuries, Hall argued that [...] "the wealth of the rich and the misery of the poor increase in strict proportion". Thus, the rising power of the rich is the cause of the suffering of the poor.|$|E
