In later series, as usable material from the books and other obvious sources began to run out, concepts were drawn from more standard historical texts under Jenner's supervision. He and fellow researchers read through many different studies and picked out suitably quirky, intriguing snippets, which were then pitched to the writers for development.|$|E

5|$|For {{the series}} of Bond novels, Fleming {{realised}} that without threatening villains Bond seemed less heroic: this tradition of strong literary villain was brought across <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> in the Eon series. The third Bond film, Goldfinger, set a pattern for having a main villain with a loyal and dangerous henchman, a model which was followed in subsequent films.|$|E
5|$|Kneale {{credited}} {{the director}} Rudolph Cartier with bringing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> in Quatermass II, with its ambitious location filming, an expansive style {{that had not}} been seen in British television drama beforehand. Cartier worked with Kneale again on the third Quatermass serial, Quatermass and the Pit, in 1958, and had subsequent successes with plays such as Anna Karenina (1961), Cross of Iron (1961) and Lee Oswald — Assassin (1966). He continued directing for television until the 1970s.|$|E

Newsletters were published by local performance groups, and fans gathered for Rocky Horror conventions. By the end of 1979, there were twice-weekly showings at over 230 theatres. The National Fan Club was established in 1977 and later merged with the International Fan Club. The fan publication The Transylvanian printed a number of issues, and a semi-regular poster magazine was published {{as well as an}} official magazine.|$|E

Episodes of The Simpsons, The Venture Bros., The Boondocks, Glee, The Drew Carey Show, That '70s Show, and American Dad! spotlight Rocky Horror, as well as films like Vice Squad, Halloween II (2009), and The Perks of Being a Wallflower. The 1980 film Fame featured the audience reciting their callback lines <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> and dancing the Time Warp, the dance from the stage show and film, which has become a novelty dance at parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{adaptation}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> {{has continued}} with {{the trend of}} including new scenes to flesh out characters that in the book are only superficially seen through {{the point of view}} characters. These include the dialectical confrontation between Littlefinger and Varys, and the conversation between King Robert and Queen Cersei, and the young lovers Renly and Loras. The show's writers used this opportunity to make explicit Loras and Renly's ongoing assignations, which were only hinted at in the books.|$|E
5|$|The real-life {{surprise}} of the actors gave the scene an intense sense of realism and made {{it one of the}} film's most memorable moments. During preview screenings the crew noticed that some viewers would move towards the back of the theater {{so as not to be}} too close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> during the sequence. The scene has frequently been called one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. In 2007, Empire magazine named it as the greatest 18-rated moment in film, ranking it above the decapitation scene in The Omen (1976) and the transformation sequence in An American Werewolf in London (1981).|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} {{animated}} in a stylized way, which Tartakovsky says {{was influenced by}} the Merrie Melodies cartoon The Dover Boys at Pimento University. Dexter's Laboratory, however, was staged in a cinematic way, rather than flat and close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> to leave space and depth for the action and gags. Tartakovsky was also influenced by other Warner Bros. cartoons, Hanna-Barbera, Japanese mecha anime, and the UPA shorts.|$|E

5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and the Beast composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E

Less than maximal participation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> program can relate to different factors, e. g.; a trend for obese children to decline participation; lack of time of school nurses <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> <b>screening</b> program due <b>to</b> competing duties at health centre level.

5|$|In 2013, Ranjith {{announced}} plans to produce a film for Aashirvad Cinemas, starring Mohanlal and Manju Warrier, which was scheduled for a 2014 release coinciding with the annual Vishu festival held in Kerala, India. Production was slated to begin in December 2013. The announcement of Loham received considerable media attention as it was Manju Warrier's return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> after leaving the film industry to marry actor Dileep. The media coverage was further heightened when Prithviraj Sukumaran joined the cast. However, the film was shelved soon after its official announcement. Ranjith explained it was dropped because the film's story resembled that of another film in the same language released during its pre-production time. It was Prithviraj who noticed that the ending sequence of the planned script {{was similar to that}} of Thira (2013).|$|E
5|$|On February 19, 1930, Variety {{published}} the entire {{contents of the}} Code and predicted that state film censorship boards would soon become obsolete. However, the men obligated to enforce the code — Jason Joy, who {{was the head of}} the Committee until 1932, and his successor, Dr. James Wingate — were seen as generally ineffective. The very first film the office reviewed, The Blue Angel, which was passed by Joy without revision, was considered indecent by a California censor. Although there were several instances where Joy negotiated cuts from films, and there were indeed definite—albeit loose—constraints, a significant amount of lurid material made it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E

Vicinanza was the literary agent who handled George R. R. Martin's foreign language rights, and (with Vince Gerardis) one of the co-founders of the management company Created By which aimed at developing feature films and television shows based on the works of Vicinanza's clients. He was instrumental in bringing Martin's work <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> recommending the books to David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, and leading the negotiations with HBO.

5|$|The {{producers}} {{were determined}} that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director Dominic Brigstocke concluded that the material {{was strong enough to}} stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase. Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media conventions as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.|$|E
5|$|Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have {{frequently}} been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both {{set in the}} Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former {{was the first time}} in history that a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring Neuromancer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen,</b> after some years in development hell. Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006, and Pattern Recognition was in the process of development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project. Announced at International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2015 is an adaptation of Gibson's short story Dogfight by BAFTA award-winning writer and director Simon Pummell. Written by Gibson and Michael Swanwick and first published in Omni in July 1985, the film is being developed by British producer Janine Marmot at Hot Property Films.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 Briskin was {{responsible}} for bringing Milton Berle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen.</b> During a strike by the Federated Motion Picture Crafts union in 1937, there was concern {{that they would be}} joined by members of the Screen Actors Guild. Briskin was one of four producers chosen by the producers guild to negotiate with the actors' union to head off them joining the walkout. As the new film season started in the summer of 1937, Briskin announced that RKO would have a significant increase in their overall production budget from $14.5 million in the 1936–37 season, to $18 million for the 1937–38 season. In mid-July 1937, it was announced that Briskin had received a long-term extension on his contract, however, several months later it was revealed that the deal had never been finalized, and that Briskin was considering leaving RKO. In early November the change became official when Briskin resigned as RKO's head of production. Briskin had been offered a three-year deal by the studio, which he rejected. Rumors began to circulate about where Briskin was headed. In early December it was being reported that Briskin would be heading to Paramount, although he denied those reports.|$|E
