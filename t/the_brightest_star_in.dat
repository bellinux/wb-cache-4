5|$|Alpha Trianguli Australis, {{known as}} Atria, is a second-magnitude orange giant and <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the constellation, {{as well as}} the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the {{triangle}} are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars, deep-sky objects are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC 5979.|$|E
5|$|Vega, also {{designated}} Alpha Lyrae (α Lyrae, abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr), is <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> {{the constellation}} of Lyra, the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus.

It appears to be a rich yellowish-white color, although the yellow color is more apparent during daylight observation with a telescope, due to the contrast against the blue sky.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 2.59, Gamma Corvi—also known as Gienah—is <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the constellation. It is an aging blue giant around {{four times as}} massive as the Sun. The young star Eta Corvi {{has been found to}} have two debris disks. Three star systems have exoplanets, and a fourth planetary system is unconfirmed. TV Corvi is a dwarf nova—a white dwarf and brown dwarf in very close orbit.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula.

5|$|Canis Major is a {{prominent}} constellation {{because of its}} many bright stars.

Furthermore, two other stars {{are thought to have}} previously outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) shone at -3.99 around 4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam (Beta Canis Majoris) peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million years ago. Another, NR Canis Majoris, will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years' time.|$|E
5|$|Gamma Comae Berenices (15 Comae Berenices) is an orange-hued giant {{star with}} a {{magnitude}} of 4.4 and a spectral class of K1III C. In the southwestern {{part of the}} constellation, it is 170 ± 7 light-years from Earth, Estimated to be around 1.79 times as massive as the Sun, it has expanded to around 10 times its radius. It is <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the Coma Star Cluster. With Alpha Comae Berenices and Beta Comae Berenices, Gamma Comae Berenices forms a 45-degree isosceles triangle from which Berenice's imaginary tresses hang.|$|E
5|$|Sirius appears bright {{because of}} its {{intrinsic}} luminosity and its proximity to Earth. At a distance of 2.6 parsecs (8.6 ly), {{as determined by the}} Hipparcos astrometry satellite, the Sirius system is one of Earth's near neighbours. Sirius is gradually moving closer to the Solar System, so it will slightly increase in brightness over the next 60,000 years. After that time its distance will begin to increase and it will become fainter, but it will continue to be <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the Earth's night sky for the next 210,000 years.|$|E

5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83. Sirius, <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> {{the night sky}} as seen from Earth, is approximately 23 times more luminous than the Sun, while Canopus, the second brightest star {{in the night sky}} with an absolute magnitude of −5.53, is approximately 14,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus. This is because Sirius is merely 8.6 light-years from the Earth, while Canopus is much farther away at a distance of 310 light-years.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> Serpens is the {{red giant}} star Alpha Serpentis, or Unukalhai, in Serpens Caput, with an {{apparent}} magnitude of 2.63. Also located in Serpens Caput are the naked-eye globular cluster Messier 5 and the naked-eye variables R Serpentis and Tau4 Serpentis. Notable extragalactic objects include Seyfert's Sextet, one of the densest galaxy clusters known; Arp 220, the prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy; and Hoag's Object, {{the most famous of}} the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> {{the night}} sky, Sirius is {{recorded}} in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, it disappears for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E

5|$|The star KELT-2A (HD 42176A) is <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> Auriga {{known to}} host a transiting exoplanet, KELT-2Ab, and is the fifth-brightest transit hosting star overall. The {{brightness}} of the star KELT-2A allows the mass and radius of the planet KELT-2Ab to be known quite precisely. KELT-2Ab is 1.524 Jupiter masses and 1.290 Jupiter radii and on a 4.11-day-long orbit, making it another hot Jupiter, similar to HAT-P-9b. The star KELT-2A is a late F-dwarf and is {{one member of the}} common-proper-motion binary star system KELT-2. KELT-2B is an early K-dwarf about 295 AU away.|$|E
5|$|Lying {{near the}} constellation's {{northern}} border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> Pavo. Its proper name — Peacock — is an English {{translation of the}} constellation's name. It was assigned by the British Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an apparent (or visual) magnitude of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing {{the distance between the}} pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light years away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Lynx is a {{constellation}} {{named after the}} animal, usually observed in the northern sky. The constellation {{was introduced in the}} late 17th century by Johannes Hevelius. It is a faint constellation, with its brightest stars forming a zigzag line. The orange giant Alpha Lyncis is <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the constellation, and the semiregular variable star Y Lyncis is a target for amateur astronomers. Six star systems have been found to contain planets. Those of 6 Lyncis and HD 75898 were discovered by the Doppler method; those of XO-2, XO-4, XO-5 and WASP-13 were observed as they passed in front of the host star.|$|E

5|$|Marking the Little Bear's tail, Polaris, or Alpha Ursae Minoris, is <b>the</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the constellation, varying between {{apparent}} magnitude 1.97 and 2.00 {{over a period}} of 3.97days. Located around 432light-years away from Earth, it is a yellow-white supergiant that varies between spectral types F7Ib and F8Ib, and has around 6times the Sun's mass, 2,500times its luminosity and 45times its radius. Polaris is the brightest Cepheid variable star visible from Earth. It is a triple star system, the supergiant primary star having two yellow-white main-sequence star companions that are 17 and 2,400astronomical units (AU) distant and take 29.6 and 42,000years respectively to complete one orbit.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>brightest</b> <b>star</b> <b>in</b> the {{constellation}} is Alpha Telescopii, a blue-white subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 3.5, {{followed by the}} orange giant star Zeta Telescopii at magnitude 4.1. Eta and PZ Telescopii are two young star systems with debris disks and brown dwarf companions. Telescopium hosts two unusual stars with very little hydrogen {{that are likely to}} be the result of two merged white dwarfs: PV Telescopii, also known as HD 168476, is a hot blue extreme helium star, while RS Telescopii is an R Coronae Borealis variable. RR Telescopii is a cataclysmic variable that brightened as a nova to magnitude 6 in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The name Gliese 581 {{refers to}} the catalog number from the 1957 survey Gliese Catalogue of Nearby Stars of 965 stars located within 20 parsecs of the Earth.
