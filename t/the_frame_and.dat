5|$|The finite {{width of}} the tires alters the actual lean angle of the rear frame from the ideal lean angle {{described}} above. The actual lean angle between <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> the vertical must increase with tire width and decrease with center of mass height. Bikes with fat tires and low center of mass must lean more than bikes with skinnier tires or higher centers of mass to negotiate the same turn at the same speed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> {{qualification}} problems. AI researchers (like John McCarthy) {{who used}} logic {{discovered that they}} could not represent ordinary deductions that involved planning or default reasoning without making changes to the structure of logic itself. They developed new logics (like non-monotonic logics and modal logics) to try to solve the problems.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists have argued that The Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E

5|$|The Ju 87 V1, {{powered by}} a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V12 {{cylinder}} liquid-cooled engine, and with a twin tail, crashed on 24 January 1936 at Kleutsch near Dresden, killing Junkers' chief test pilot, Willy Neuenhofen, and his engineer, Heinrich Kreft. The square twin fins and rudders proved too weak; they collapsed and the aircraft crashed after it entered an inverted spin during the testing of the terminal dynamic pressure in a dive. The crash prompted a change to a single vertical stabiliser tail design. To withstand strong forces during a dive, heavy plating was fitted, along with brackets riveted to <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> longeron, to the fuselage. Other early additions included the installation of hydraulic dive brakes that were fitted under the leading edge and could rotate 90°.|$|E
5|$|The Motmot Capstone is an inscribed {{stone that}} was placed over a tomb under Structure 10L-26. Its face was finely sculpted with {{portraits of the}} first two kings of the Copán dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all {{contained}} within a quatrefoil frame. <b>The</b> <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings place them in a supernatural realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD435 and AD441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.|$|E
5|$|The P90 {{requires}} minimal maintenance, {{and it can}} be disassembled {{quickly and}} easily. It is a modular firearm, consisting of four main component groups: the barrel and optical sight group, the moving parts group, <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> trigger group, and the hammer group. The P90's barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with an overall length of 263mm (10.4in). The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231mm (1:9.1in), and it is equipped with a diagonally cut flash suppressor that also acts as a recoil compensator. The stated service life of the barrel is 20,000 rounds.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 recoil mechanism {{and other parts of}} the M2 howitzer carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the gun carriage proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> <b>and</b> redesigning the howitzer mount. Demountable headlights were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they were not available for early production models. Early models had no shield for the howitzer either, but a foldable shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from −5 to +35 degrees. The armored windshield cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E

25|$|The piano had 44 notes, {{half the}} number of keys found on a normal piano keyboard. It was played by regular hammers using a {{standard}} player piano action. The hammers were activated by electromagnets. The piano frame was made of iron, shaped like a shield, and symmetrically strung. The bass strings were at the centre of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> the treble strings radiated out to the edges from the centre. This arrangement distributed the string pressure more evenly across <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> helped keep the piano in tune.|$|E

25|$|One {{prediction}} method uses the intergenic distance between reading frames {{as a primary}} predictor {{of the number of}} operons in the genome.

25|$|Up {{until the}} 2003 model year, the engine on the Sportster was rigidly mounted to the frame. The 2004 Sportster {{received}} a new frame accommodating a rubber-mounted engine. This made the bike heavier {{and reduced the}} available lean angle, while it reduced the amount of vibration transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> <b>and</b> the rider, providing a smoother ride for rider and passenger.|$|E
25|$|The K class 2-8-0 {{built by}} VR in 1922-23 was a success, {{but with a}} firebox mounted between frames {{engineered}} for broad gauge operation only, it was not readily gauge-convertible. Thus when additional branch line locomotives were required, the VR produced a 2-8-2 'Mikado' variant of the K, the first 2-8-2 tender engine in Australia. It retained the same wheels, cylinders, motion, <b>and</b> much of <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> of <b>the</b> K, but featured a longer boiler with a wider, larger grate, mounted above <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> supported by a trailing truck. This enabled possible gauge conversion without radical re-engineering of <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> <b>and</b> grate.|$|R
