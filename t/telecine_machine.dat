5000|$|R5 (bootleg), {{a copy of}} a movie {{made with}} a <b>telecine</b> <b>machine</b> from an analog source ...|$|E
50|$|R5, in {{the film}} business, is a DVD of a movie sold in Russia much closer after the first {{screening}} in cinema, at reduced wholesale prices. It is made with a <b>telecine</b> <b>machine</b> from an analog source and is typically of a lower quality than other retail releases.|$|E
5000|$|Presentation's [...] "Noddy" [...] camera {{also had}} a companion, {{originally}} named [...] "Big Ears", which was a dual monochrome slide scanner, thus allowing in-vision changes between slides. With the advent of colour this was replaced with a Rank Cintel slide scanner, electronically similar to a flying spot <b>telecine</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
50|$|DigiSync is a {{hardware}} device developed by Filmlab Systems International to allow negative cutters, <b>telecine</b> <b>machines,</b> and ColorMaster {{to read and}} log keykode data from motion picture film. It {{can also be used}} to capture KeyCode and change emulsion settings on Hollywood Film Company color film analyzers.|$|R
50|$|After that, Rod Reyes, the then-general {{manager of}} RBS {{recruited}} old-timers from ABS-CBN, including {{from the news}} department and entertainment programs. Through the acquisition, the station was able to broadcast in color with a PhP8 million credit line thru buying <b>telecine</b> <b>machines</b> and acquired foreign programs. Ratings were up from #5 to #3 that time.|$|R
50|$|For home theater, VHS and DVD did {{not offer}} enough {{resolution}} to carry the full image quality captured by 70 mm film, and VHS and DVD video transfers were usually prepared from 35 mm reduction elements. The high-definition Blu-ray format, in contrast, can potentially reveal the quality advantage of 70 mm productions. Although <b>telecine</b> <b>machines</b> for 70 mm scanning are uncommon, high-resolution transfers from high-quality full-gauge elements can reveal impressive technical quality.|$|R
50|$|The term {{may also}} {{refer to a}} form of copying of movies (normally without {{authorization}} from the copyright holder) created using a <b>telecine</b> <b>machine,</b> as opposed to recording the projected image with a video camera (the camera method with a direct audio source is called a telesync). Since this process requires both access to a print of the movie on film and expensive equipment, telecine bootlegs are less common than camera bootlegs.|$|E
50|$|In some film {{sequences}} for location {{shots in}} these programmes (shot in colour), the colour {{signal from the}} <b>telecine</b> <b>machine</b> had to be switched off in the vision mixing desk before being recorded to tape, but this was partly unsuccessful, leading to some film sequences being recorded with an odd array of pale colours (as for items where the colour {{is a mix of}} two primary colours, only one primary colour would show). This is prominent in the second series of Hadleigh, for example.|$|E
50|$|Previously, the BBC in Wales {{had been}} {{located in a}} {{converted}} chapel in Broadway, Cardiff and in temporary accommodation at BBC Broadcasting Centre {{on the banks of}} the River Taff. While these studios played host to drama, entertainment and regional programmes, the site was still not ideal. The site only held two studios, both located in the church, and the ability to broadcast film was not installed on the site for several years; film played into programmes from a <b>telecine</b> <b>machine</b> in Bristol or London and film processing for news was carried out by a firm called Park Pictures in Cardiff until BBC processing was installed in Stacey Road.|$|E
50|$|At {{least two}} PTRs {{are needed in}} the film path - one for the base side {{and one for the}} {{emulsion}} side - though four are frequently used. A set of PTRs is frequently placed in the film paths of projectors, <b>telecine</b> <b>machines,</b> scanners and printers in order to remove dust and contaminants {{from the surface of the}} film before projection, transfer or duplication. PTRs are also used in some dedicated film cleaning machines, or mounted between rewind heads and used for manual cleaning. The contaminants are lifted from the film and adhere to the roller as the film passes in contact with it. The rollers themselves are then cleaned, usually in soapy water, and dried before the next use.|$|R
50|$|As was industry-practice at the time, STV {{programming}} {{would either}} be totally studio-based, include film inserts where required (the local news programme Scotland Today and Take the High Road being early examples of this), or other completely film-based shows with no studio content. The company employed {{up to six}} film crews who could be assigned to providing filmed news coverage on a daily basis, football matches, or feature programming such as Redgauntlet or Weirs Way. Since the company originally went on air, images not provided electronically 'live' within the studio centre were provided via <b>telecine</b> <b>machines,</b> allowing the station to run local advertisements to fill the ad breaks within and {{on either side of}} local and networked programming. Local advertisements - where a single image was shown on screen whilst the continuity announcer read the promotional message 'live' - was sourced from a standard 35 mm slide.|$|R
5000|$|DCP or Digital Color Processor was a standard-definition {{digital video}} {{processor}} {{controlled by a}} Pogle. DCP {{was one of the}} first commercially available systems which was built entirely with digital circuitry using programmable logic. Until this time most color manipulation the circuity within <b>Telecine</b> <b>machines</b> was predominantly analog. With the DCP, primary Lift/Gamma/Gain and secondary and Hue based colour processing could be done outside the telecine and so input could be from film or video tape. Standard definition processing was of NTSC and PAL video.The DCP was a modular system so over the life of the product various add-on's and upgrades were made including the [...] "Electric Sunroof" [...] option. This was launched in direct competition to the [...] "Power Windows" [...] feature from DaVinci System in Florida. It enabled multiple secondary colour corrections to be applied each within a separate area of the image. ESR windows featured an advanced keying system which allowed the user to identify the areas of the image using Hue, Saturation and Luminance keys combined with the physical position of pixels on the screen.|$|R
5000|$|Gate weave, {{known in}} this context as [...] "telecine weave" [...] or [...] "telecine wobble", caused by the {{movement}} of the film in the <b>telecine</b> <b>machine</b> gate, is a characteristic artifact of real-time telecine scanning. Numerous techniques have been tried to minimize gate weave, using both improvements in mechanical film handling and electronic post-processing. Line-scan telecines are less vulnerable to frame-to-frame judder than machines with conventional film gates, and non-real-time machines are also less vulnerable to gate weave than real-time machines. Some gate weave is inherent in film cinematography, as it introduced by the film handling within the original film camera: modern digital image stabilization techniques can remove both this and telecine/scanner gate weave.|$|E
5000|$|Pandora Int. was {{the maker}} the Pogle colour {{corrector}} controller. The Pogle can control a <b>Telecine</b> <b>machine,</b> like the FDL60 the first digital telecine. New models could control FDL 90, Quadra and Spirit DataCines Pogle used customized external control panels. The Pogle {{also included a}} VTR deck controller which was capable of controlling up to four video tape decks for field accurate editing including 3/2 sequence control. Other systems made do with a separate computer system TLC for this function. Pogle has a CPU rack which used twin Motorola 68020 CPU's and a telecine interface rack which varied depending on the make and model of the Telecine system in use.The first Pogles controlled the telecine's internal colour corrector. Originally Pogles used a PDOS operating system which was quickly replaced with a proprietary system named ANDIX. The program and list are stored on a SCSI hard disk, with backup to a 3.5" [...] floppy disk. Video display is to a multi-sync monitor. The newer operating system updated to a Silicon Graphics (SGI) platinum operating system ran on a SGI Indy computer and later an SGI O2; these replaced the internal CPU and video cards in the Pogle controller rack. The Indy computer and O2 computer's backup is usually to an external zip Drive or ext. floppy. The O2 has an internal CD-ROM. Pandora's DCP external colour corrector is a Rec. 601 digital system so some telecine's FDL60 which only had analog output's had to first send their signal to an external Analog to Digital Converter.|$|E
40|$|Method and {{experimental}} setup We will consentrate {{on the task}} of simulating the scanned images from various lm stocks. In our case, the <b>telecine</b> <b>machine</b> was calibrated to give an image that was as close to the lm scanner output as possible. We therefore consentrated on using the images from the digital still camera to simulate the lm scanner, making the meta-data and color corrected images more relevant for the nal color grading of the lm. The viewing conditions on the set were made as similar to the laboratory as pos-sible. We have used a digital still camera (Canon EOS 20 D) and several types of lm stocks. The GretagMacbeth Digital ColorChecker and a custom made color chart were care-fully positioned in a scene to make the illumination as consistent as possible. The digitally captured images were stored in a RAW le format. We have then used the free RAW converter DCRAW to convert these images to RGB TIFF les, ensuring the repeatability of this transformation. The analog images were captured using a lm camera, and later processed and scanned at the Chimney Pot post-production facility in Norway using an Arri lm scanner. At the time of the experiment their laboratory equipment was calibrated according to the ITU-R Recommendation BT. 709 (Rec. 709) standard. The DPX les from the lm scanner were then paired with the corresponding TIFF les according to their attributes (e. g. lm speed, ASA setting, spectral sensitivity). We tested and compared two dierent approaches to do the simulation of the lm based on direct and indirect polynomial models. By using a single model and going directly from the RGB values of the digital camera to the RGB produced by the lm scanner, one would assume that a better match could be made than by using the two separate models for eac...|$|E
50|$|Innovation TK Ltd, ITK, {{was founded}} in 1994, Innovation TK, the key {{engineer}} and manager was Stuart Hunt, who was design engineer for Cintel. Innovation TK designed and patented product to improve Cintel's flyingspot telecines, like the TWiGi system, the SCAN'dAL, and the Y-Front. Later TWiGi and SCAN'dAL are became standard features used on Cintel's URSA Diamond. Later ITK deigned and built their own <b>telecine</b> the: Millennium <b>Machine</b> and Millennium Lite. In 2002 Cintel acquired Innovation TK, including the Millennium HD and Millennium Data Telecine.|$|R
