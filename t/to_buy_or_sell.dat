The Supreme Court handed down an 8–0 decision stating that the Act did preempt such claims, thereby overruling Sotomayor's decision.|$|E

In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> <b>sell.</b> When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, Morse code operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators.

5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} a risk parity portfolio requires strong management and continuous oversight {{to reduce the}} potential for negative consequences {{as a result of}} leverage and allocation building in the form of buying and selling of assets to keep dollar holdings at predetermined and equalized risk levels. For example, if the price of a security goes up or down and risk levels remain the same, the risk parity portfolio will be adjusted to keep its dollar exposure constant. On the other hand, some consider risk parity to be a passive approach, because it does not require the portfolio manager <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> <b>sell</b> securities on the basis of judgments about future market behavior.|$|E

5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> <b>sell</b> some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E

25|$|Between 1970 and 1989, the {{official}} exchange rate was fixed by the government through law. This exchange rate {{was used by the}} government to calculate the value of foreign trade, but foreign currency was not available to be bought and sold by private individuals. Owning or attempting <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> <b>sell</b> foreign currency was a criminal offence, punishable with a prison sentence that could go up to 10 years (depending on the amount of foreign currency found under one's possession). International trade was therefore considered as part of another economic circuit than domestic trade, and given greater priority.|$|E

25|$|The US FTT bills {{proposed}} by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon) and Sen. Harkin (D-Iowa) {{have received a}} number of cosponsors in the Senate and House. The Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill is {{an early version of}} their cosponsored US FTT bill which includes a tax on US financial market securities transactions. The bill suggests to tax stock transactions at a rate of 0.25%. The tax on futures contracts <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> <b>sell</b> a specified commodity of standardized quality at a certain date in the future, at a market determined price would be 0.02%. Swaps between two firms and credit default swaps would be taxed 0.02%. The tax would only target speculators, since the tax would be refunded to average investors, pension funds and health savings accounts. Projected annual revenue is $150 billion per year, half of which would go towards deficit reduction and half of which would go towards job promotion activities. The day the bill was introduced, it had the support of 25 of DeFazio's House colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Smallholders {{used the}} dense network of ADMARC markets to obtain {{fertilizer}} or seed and <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> <b>sell</b> crops at standard prices. Partial privatisation {{inspired by the}} World Bank in 1987 left it short of funds to provide services. Despite liberalisation, few private traders emerged, and maize markets were disrupted. Malawi was increasingly dependent on imported maize in deficit years, but limited state funding forced ADMARC to use commercial loans to import 312,000 tonnes of maize {{a year in the}} 1990s. It also had to create, with inadequate funds, an 180,000 tonne Strategic Grain Reserve from the cheaper of domestic or imported maize to stabilise prices for farmers and consumers. The World Bank criticised losses on imported maize as an untargeted subsidy: in 1996, it required the creation of a National Food Reserve Agency (NFRA) independent of government influence to control grain imports. NFRA was not responsible for price stability, and was poorly funded. ADMARC kept control over domestic grain and remained under political control. It also started selling the domestic reserves after the NFRA was formed.|$|E
500|$|Kirchner was reelected in 2011, {{along with}} Amado Boudou as vice president. Hernán Lorenzino became the new {{minister}} of economy. The government established currency controls that limited the power <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>or</b> <b>sell</b> foreign currencies, especially American dollars. Many Argentines kept their savings in dollars {{as a hedge}} against inflation. The government believed the controls were required to prevent the capital flight and tax evasion. Axel Kicillof was appointed minister in 2013, and served {{for the remainder of}} Kirchner's term. He arranged payment of the debt to the Paris Club, and the compensation requested by Repsol for the nationalization of YPF. One month later, negotiations with hedge funds failed, and American judge Thomas Griesa issued an order that Argentina had to pay to all creditors and not just those who had accepted a reduced payment as outlined in the [...] Argentine debt restructuring plan. Kicillof refused to agree that the country had fallen into a sovereign default.|$|E
