[...] Henderson himself is {{resigned}} to his persona: [...] "A {{lot of stuff}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> doing or something they said I had created, it's comedy.

2500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} study singing", Hayworth complained, [...] "but Harry Cohn kept saying, 'Who needs it?' and the studio wouldn't pay for it. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> so intimidated that I couldn't have done it anyway. They always said, 'Oh, no, we can't let you do it. There's no time for that; {{it has to be}} done right now!' I was under contract, and that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|This time, Wagner {{could not}} be stifled as he outhit Cobb, [...]333 to [...]231, and stole six bases, {{establishing}} the new Series record. The speed demon Cobb only managed two steals, one of which Cobb himself admitted was a botched call. Wagner recounted: [...] "We had him out at second. We put up a squawk, but Silk O'Loughlin, the umpire, overruled it. We kept the squawk going {{for a minute or}} so, making no headway of course, and then Cobb spoke up. He turned to O'Loughlin, an American League umpire, by the way, and said, 'Of course I was out. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> by a foot. You just booted the play, so come on, let's play ball.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|<b>They</b> should <b>have</b> stabb'd <b>me</b> where I lay, Oriana! [...] How could I {{rise and}} come away, Oriana? [...] How could I look upon the day? [...] <b>They</b> should <b>have</b> stabb'd <b>me</b> where I lay, Oriana [...] <b>They</b> should <b>have</b> trod <b>me</b> into clay, Oriana.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Will <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> at all? There {{will always}} be a sort of ticket-of-leave flavour about me,' said Leonard, {{speaking}} simply, straight-forwardly, but without dejection; 'and I might be doubtful material for a mission.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're not a beak," [...] he said, [...] "too {{young for}} that, I guess. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> in chokey at Paisley and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> in chokey at Wigtown, {{but by the}} living thunder if another of them lays a hand on me I'll make him {{remember}} Corporal Rufus Smith! It's a darned fine country this, where they won't give a man work, and then lay him by the heels for having no visible means of subsistence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{where was}} you, Bill, {{about the time}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> down? I don't {{remember}} hearin' anything of you 'long about that time, Bill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> {{out with}} 'em, but not often. I couldn't keep {{up to their}} style. She used to pull out his notes and criticize them like bills of lading.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I look bughouse?" [...] {{answered}} Thomas. [...] "Enough of the footback {{life for}} <b>me.</b> But will <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> again? The old lady is as fixed in her ways as a nut {{on a new}} axle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick," [...] cried Matcham, [...] "I am lost; we {{are both}} lost. Let us flee if there be yet time. They will not rest till <b>they</b> <b>have</b> found <b>me.</b> Or, see! let me go forth; when <b>they</b> <b>have</b> found <b>me,</b> ye may flee. Let me forth, Dick--good Dick, let me away!" ...|$|R
60|$|DMITRI. You {{will see}} nothing but {{suffering}} in it. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> tortured <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Happily I couldn't. The {{things were}} gone {{and could not}} be identified, and there was nothing about him. So, though <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> over to Backsworth, they could not fall foul of me for refusing to prosecute. Have you seen him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is gone!--it is all gone!" [...] said Baldassarre; [...] "and {{they would}} not believe me, because he lied, and said I was mad; and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> dragged to prison. And I am old--my mind will not come back. And the world is against me." ...|$|E
60|$|First I photographed {{them from}} {{different}} positions; then I took up my stand about {{on a level}} with them in an open place on the slope where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> in plain sight. I might have been fifty feet from them. They showed no inclination to come down.|$|E
6000|$|I {{was a white}} man, he said, {{they were}} Indians; {{nevertheless}} <b>they</b> <b>had</b> treated <b>me</b> well. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> fed <b>me</b> and sheltered <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> <b>had</b> done {{a great deal for}} me: <b>they</b> <b>had</b> taught <b>me</b> the use of the zabatana, and had promised to make one for me, asking for nothing in return. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> also promised <b>me</b> a wife. How had I treated them? I had deserted them, going away secretly to a distance, leaving them in doubt as to my intentions. How could they tell why I had gone, and where? <b>They</b> <b>had</b> an enemy. Managa was his name; he and his people hated them; I knew that he wished them evil; I knew where to find him, for <b>they</b> <b>had</b> told <b>me.</b> That was what they thought when I suddenly left them. Now I returned to them, saying that I had been to Riolama. He knew where Riolama was, although he had never been there: it was so far. Why did I go to Riolama? It was a bad place. There were Indians there, a few; but they were not good Indians like those of Parahuari, and would kill a white man. HAD I gone there? Why had I gone there? ...|$|R
60|$|So I related my adventures {{from the}} moment <b>they</b> <b>had</b> left <b>me</b> till we met again.|$|R
6000|$|But now <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> in {{a burning}} scent, and run after me full cry: [...] "Was ever such licence connived at, in an impious libeller and scribbler, that the succession, so solemn a matter, {{that is not}} fit to be debated of but in parliament, should be profaned {{so far as to}} be played with on the stage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The young rancher {{sank down}} on the bed limply, but smiled as he explained: [...] "I'm only singed a little, doc. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> foul. You see, I was in the light, but I handed one or two of them {{something}} they didn't like. I left a keepsake with 'em. They won't forget me soon." ...|$|E
60|$|I sat and pondered. I {{thought what}} an {{interesting}} case I must {{be from a}} medical point of view, what an acquisition I should be to a class! Students would have no need to “walk the hospitals,” if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me.</b> I was a hospital in myself. All they need {{do would be to}} walk round me, and, after that, take their diploma.|$|E
6000|$|HOW dared you get rich--you great stupid!-- [...] Like papa, {{and some}} men that I know, [...] Instead of just trusting to Cupid [...] And {{to me for}} your money? Ah, Joe! [...] Just to think you sent never a word, dear, [...] Till you wrote to papa for consent! [...] Now I know why <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> {{transferred}} here, [...] And [...] "the health of papa"--what that meant! ...|$|E
5000|$|... "It is an appetising {{contract}} though I {{would have}} loved it if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> bought <b>me</b> outright." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>have</b> brought <b>me</b> {{from that}} ridge Seed pods and flowers {{that are not}} all wild poppy.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{one thing}} I am thankful to them," [...] {{continued}} Edmund; [...] "I thought <b>they</b> might <b>have</b> shot <b>me</b> down before my mother's door, and so filled {{the place with}} horror for her ever after. Now <b>they</b> <b>have</b> given <b>me</b> time for preparation, and she will grow accustomed to the thought of losing me." ...|$|R
6000|$|The constable gave {{a slight}} gulp. [...] "I saw the three running {{by the side}} of the road," [...] he said, slowly. [...] "Their {{behaviour}} seemed suspicious, so I collared the big one, but they set on me like wild cats. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> down three times; the last time I laid my head open against the kerb, and when I came to my senses again they had gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Why, thus," [...] he returned. [...] "Here is a Ghost to be disproved. Well! I cannot {{answer for}} what my fancy might do if I were alone here, or what tricks my senses might {{play with me}} if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> to themselves. But, in company with another man, and {{especially}} with Dick, I would consent to outface all the Ghosts that were ever of in the universe." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{asked me}} what I was in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French; but I {{understood}} none of them; but at last a Scots sailor, who was on board, called to me, and I answered him, and told him I was an Englishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors at Sallee. Then <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> come on board, and very kindly took me in, and all my goods.|$|E
5000|$|The real Donohue has a {{still of}} himself wearing the papal mitre from this episode {{displayed}} in his office. He {{sums up the}} plot as [...] "In the episode, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> overthrow the pope because the pope is a wimp, and then I take over the church and give it some guts. ... But in the end, Jesus kills me".|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{letter of}} proper submission!" [...] {{repeated}} he; [...] "would <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>me</b> beg my mother's pardon for Robert's ingratitude to HER, and breach of honour to ME?--I can make no submission--I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed.--I am grown very happy; {{but that would}} not interest.--I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make." ...|$|R
60|$|I have {{to thank}} many gallant {{officers}} for the assistance <b>they</b> <b>have</b> given <b>me</b> {{in the collection of}} material. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> all asked <b>me</b> not to mention their names, but to accede to this request would be to rob the story of the Malakand Field Force of all its bravest deeds and finest characters.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Yes,' says I, 'yes,' for I knew <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me.</b> 'Touching's believing, ain't it, boys? Yes. Now there's {{some might}} say the seats of your {{trousers}} are sky blue, but 'tis my opinion they are red. Let's apply the tests of the laying on of hands and feet.' And so I hoisted both those inspectors out {{the door on the}} toe of my shoe, and sat down to cool off on my block of disreputable glass.|$|E
6000|$|... "I had to {{make some}} of them saints. I {{had to make}} Enraghty Saint Paul, and I had to make Hingston Saint Peter. You think I had to lie to them, to deceive them, to bewitch them. I didn't have to do {{anything}} of the kind. They did the lying and deceiving and bewitching themselves, and when they done it, they {{and all the rest of}} the believers, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> fast, faster than I had them." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{things were}} all about me. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>me</b> {{surrounded}} {{at the intersection of}} two corridors. Retreat was cut off in all directions, unless I chose to charge one of the beasts. Even then I had no doubt but that the others would hurl themselves upon my back. I could not even guess the size or nature of the weird creatures. That they were of goodly proportions I guessed {{from the fact that the}} eyes were on a level with my own.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 August 2014, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in a {{televised}} interview on NTV news network, remarked that being Armenian is [...] "uglier" [...] even than being Georgian, saying [...] "You wouldn't believe the things <b>they</b> <b>have</b> said about <b>me.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> said I am Georgian...they have said even uglier things - <b>they</b> <b>have</b> called <b>me</b> Armenian, but I am Turkish." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{might have}} {{appointed}} somebody but I appointed {{them because they}} were friends, not because of anything <b>they</b> <b>had</b> given <b>me.</b>|$|R
