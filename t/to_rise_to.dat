5|$|Cagney's {{frequent}} co-star, Pat O'Brien, {{appeared with}} him on the British chat show Parkinson in the early 1980s and they both made a surprise appearance at the Queen Mother's command birthday performance at the London Palladium in 1980. His appearance on stage prompted the Queen Mother <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> her feet, the only time she did so during the whole show, and she later broke protocol to go backstage to speak with Cagney directly.|$|E
5|$|In 1721, the {{economic}} disaster of the South Sea Bubble allowed Walpole <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> {{the pinnacle of}} government. Walpole and his Whig Party were dominant in politics, as the king feared that the Tories would not support the succession laid down in the Act of Settlement. The power of the Whigs {{was so great that}} the Tories would not come to hold power for another half-century.|$|E
5|$|In early 1816, {{a quarter}} (28 pounds) of wheat cost 52shillings (£), rising through 76shillings (£) in May to 103shillings (£) in December. Average wages {{for the period}} {{remained}} static at 8–9shillings (£–£), per week. In 1815, a pound of bread was quoted at over 4shillings (£) and predicted <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> over 5shillings (£).|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that of 92 potentially possible modes of life – combinations of feeding style, tiering and motility — no more than a dozen are occupied {{by the end of the}} Ediacaran. Just four are represented in the Avalon assemblage. The lack of large-scale predation and vertical burrowing are perhaps the most significant factors limiting the ecological diversity; the emergence of these during the Early Cambrian allowed the number of lifestyles occupied <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> 30.|$|E
5|$|Japan has {{the second}} longest overall life {{expectancy}} at birth {{of any country}} in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010–2015. The Japanese population is rapidly aging {{as a result of a}} post–World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates. In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the proportion is projected <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> almost 40 percent by 2050.|$|E

5|$|Back in Cuba, Castro feared a U.S.-backed coup; in 1959 {{his regime}} spent $120 million on Soviet, French, and Belgian {{weaponry}} and by early 1960 had doubled {{the size of}} Cuba's armed forces. Fearing counter-revolutionary elements in the army, the government created a People's Militia to arm citizens favorable to the revolution, training at least 50,000 civilians in combat techniques. In September 1960, they created the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution (CDR), a nationwide civilian organization which implemented neighborhood spying to detect counter-revolutionary activities as well as organizing health and education campaigns, becoming a conduit for public complaints. By 1970, {{a third of the}} population would be involved in the CDR, and this would come <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> 80%.|$|E
5|$|Douglas MacArthur (26 January 18805 April 1964) was an American five-star {{general and}} Field Marshal of the Philippine Army.

He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Philippines Campaign, which made him and his father Arthur MacArthur Jr., the first father and son to be awarded the medal.

5|$|During the Tudor {{conversion}} of the abbey to a private house the south range was extensively rebuilt, and only the north wall of the medieval structure remains, which makes tracing the monastic layout difficult. Going east to west, first came the day stair, then the warming house where the communal fire burned constantly to allow the monks to warm themselves after long hours of study in the unheated cloister. The room was probably vaulted and had its great fireplace on the west wall to allow heat <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the refectory or dining hall next door. It is likely that, as at the great Cistercian house Fountains Abbey, the chamber above the warming house was the muniment room, where the abbey's charters, records and title deeds, {{as well as those}} of local lords, were kept.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, {{together}} with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the plume would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.|$|E
5|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) was $8.3 billion in 2012, a figure expected <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> $15 billion in 2013. In 2012, Fitch Group upgraded Turkey's credit rating to investment grade after an 18-year gap; {{this was followed}} by a ratings upgrade by Moody's in May 2013, as the service lifted Turkey's government bond ratings to the lowest investment grade Baa3. In September 2016, Moody's cut Turkey's sovereign debt to junk status. In the economic crisis of 2016 it emerged that the huge debts incurred for investment during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government since 2002 had mostly been consumed in construction, rather than invested in sustainable economic growth. Private bank debts in Turkey were 6.6 billion TL in 2002 and had increased to 385 billion TL by the end of 2015.|$|E

5|$|Full {{production}} of the i-MiEV started in July 2009 and Mitsubishi expected initial sales volume to be small, to sell up to 1,400 vehicles by March 2010, but expected sales <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> 5,000 vehicles in the following twelve months, once retail sales had started. Mitsubishi decided to target sales to corporate customers in Japan at first to allow local governments and businesses to set up recharging stations around the country. The company said initial sales were constrained by production capacity but expects production to ramp up quickly from 2,000 units in 2009/10 to 30,000 vehicles within three years as it expands {{production of}} lithium-ion battery through Lithium Energy Japan, {{a joint venture with}} GS Yuasa Corporation and Mitsubishi Corporation. Production was projected to increase to 9,000 units in its fiscal year 2010/11, and to 18,000 in the following twelve months.|$|E
5|$|Greek life at UVA began a {{few decades}} after the school's {{establishment}} in 1819. Before this time social life at the university was fixed around debating societies; the now-defunct Patrick Henry Society, for instance, initially had a membership nearly equal {{to the size of}} the student body. In the 1850s the first fraternities began to appear and assumed a significant role in the student body's social landscape. In the following decades, the university became the birthplace of two national fraternities and saw many more fraternity chapters chartered. The twentieth century saw the system expand even more to include professional fraternities, social sororities, local fraternities, and black fraternities and sororities. Moving into the 2000s, several new social Greek organizations were founded, and multicultural organizations began <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> prominence.|$|E

He scored 1,137 runs {{at an average of}} 27.73. He made centuries in the two matches against Northamptonshire, sharing big partnerships in both games: 276 with Rhodes in the first and 299 with Percy Holmes in the second. His overall performance left him sixth in the Yorkshire batting averages, and fourth in the bowling averages. Through the winter, he continued to develop his bowling.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} eastern European countries, Belarus has a {{negative}} population growth rate and a negative natural growth rate. In 2007, Belarus's population declined by 0.41% and its fertility rate was 1.22, well below the replacement rate. Its net migration rate is +0.38 per 1,000, indicating that Belarus experiences slightly more immigration than emigration. , 69.9% of Belarus's population is aged 14 to 64; 15.5% is under 14, and 14.6% is 65 or older. Its population is also aging; {{the median age of}} 30–34 is estimated <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> between 60 and 64 in 2050. There are about 0.87 males per female in Belarus. The average life expectancy is 72.15 (66.53 years for men and 78.1 years for women). Over 99% of Belarusians aged 15 and older are literate.|$|E
