McKenzie {{saw an opportunity}} for Fisk to provide continuing education for Black teachers from throughout the South during the summer months, and requested permission to begin a summer session in 1916. McKenzie envisioned Fisk as a center for teacher training. [...] "We should not only set standards for advanced training for <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> state, but we would {{meet the needs of}} those capable of meeting our standards throughout a large number of the Southern states." [...] In early 1917, The General Education Board expressed interest in funding the program. However, with the outbreak of World War I and increasing economic uncertainty throughout the country, the foundation reconsidered and [...] "deemed it wise to [...] postpone the consideration of a summer school on account of the war." [...] It was not until 1920-21, five years after McKenzie first proposed the idea, that Fisk established a summer school program for teachers.|$|E
2500|$|Two notable {{products}} of the scholarship at the college are the first New World [...] "herbal," [...] and a map {{of what is now}} the Mexico City region. An [...] "herbal" [...] is a catalog of plants and their uses, including descriptions and their medicinal applications. Such an herbal, the Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis, was written in Latin by Juan Badianus de la Cruz, an Aztec teacher at the college, perhaps with help from students or other <b>teachers.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> document, the plants are drawn, named and presented according to the Aztec system of organization. The text describes where the plants grow and how herbal medicines can be made from them. This [...] "herbal" [...] may have been used to teach indigenous medicine at the college. [...] The Mapa de Santa Cruz shows the urban areas, networks of roads and canals, pictures of activities such as fishing and farming, and the broader landscape context. The herbal and the map show the influence of both the Spanish and the Aztec cultures, and by their structure and style convey the blending of these cultures.|$|E

6000|$|The {{revival of}} the hexameter in modern poetry is due to Johann Heinrich Voss, a man of genius, an admirable metrist, and, Schlegel's sneer to the {{contrary}} notwithstanding, hitherto the best translator of Homer. His [...] "Odyssey" [...] (1783), his [...] "Iliad" [...] (1791), and his [...] "Luise" [...] (1795), were confessedly Goethe's <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> kind of verse. The [...] "Hermann and Dorothea" [...] of the latter (1798) was the first true poem written in modern hexameters. From Germany, Southey imported that and other classic metres into England, {{and we should be}} grateful to him, at least, for having given the model for Canning's [...] "Knife-grinder." [...] The exotic, however, again refused to take root, and for many years after we have no example of English hexameters. It was universally conceded that the temper of our language was unfriendly to them.|$|E

Perhaps it may justly {{be said to}} be the common practice of <b>teachers</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> country, to affect dignity of deportment in the presence of their pupils, which, in other cases, is laid aside; and to pretend to superiority in knowledge, and an infallibility of judgment, which no sensible man would claim before other sensible men, but which an absurd fashion seems to require of the teacher. It can however scarcely {{be said to be}} a fashion, for the temptation is almost exclusively confined to the young and the ignorant, who think they must make up by appearance, what they want in reality. Very few of the older, and more experienced, and successful instructers in our country, fall into it at all. But some young beginner, whose knowledge is very limited, and who, in manner and habits, has only just ceased to be a boy, walks into his school-room with a countenance of forced gravity, and with a dignified and solemn step, which is ludicrous even to himself. I describe accurately, for I describe from recollection. This unnatural, and forced, and ludicrous dignity, cleaves to him like disease, through the whole period of his duty. In the presence of his scholars, he is always under restraint,--assuming a stiff, and formal dignity, which is as ridiculous as it is unnatural. He is also obliged to resort to arts which are certainly not very honorable, to conceal his ignorance.|$|E
