In this context, [24] developed a particular interface enabling data migration between Railsys and NEMO models {{with the aim of}} supporting the generation of a conflict-free timetable. Moreover, [25] derived a macroscopic framework starting from a microscopic model, implemented in OpenTrack, for determining conflict-free <b>track</b> <b>allocations.</b> In particular, the transformation occurs by means of the aggregation of block sections and station areas, together with the introduction of ‘pseudo-nodes’ which replicate the interactions among different convoys. In addition, after deriving the macroscopic from the microscopic model, the proposed procedure combines them with each other in order to validate the solutions provided.|$|R

This paper reviews models and methods that have been proposed in the literature to assist planners in finding train routes. Since the problem of routing trains on a railway network entails allocating the track capacity of the network (or part thereof) over time in a conflict-free manner, all studies that model railway <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> in some capacity are considered relevant.

Because most agencies distribute federal funds, we are able to provide empirical evidence about the relationship between structural features of administrative agencies and the degree of political responsiveness of their spending decisions.

40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic {{approach}} to memory leak detection and reporting {{to aid the}} debugging process. We <b>track</b> memory <b>allocations</b> and aliases during execution, which allows us not only to detect leaks, but also locate {{the point of the}} leak in the source code. The level of tracking can be customised by the user. This analysis is safe in the presence of pointer aliasing - a benefit of the dynamic approach, as such problems are hard to solve using static analysis (or lead to many false positives). Our technique works by instrumenting programs with statements that <b>track</b> memory <b>allocations,</b> capture alias information, and monitor potential leaks. By tracking only location and size of memory allocation, rather than monitoring every bit, as is common in other approaches, we keep memory overhead very low. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach on a number of open-source programs and a few SPEC CPU benchmarks. Our experiments show that the overheads compare favourably with current analysis tools such as Valgrind...|$|R
40|$|Transatlantic flight {{operations}} are, {{due to the}} absence of radar-based surveillance, the influence of the polar jet stream and the highly directional traffic peaks, significantly different compared to continental {{flight operations}}. To safely accommodate all transatlantic traffic in the North Atlantic oceanic airspace the Organized Track System (OTS) has been established, existing of a number of pre-determined flight routes. Currently, about half of all transatlantic traffic uses the OTS which is created twice a day, once to accommodate the westbound traffic and once to accommodate the eastbound traffic flow. All aircraft requesting to use the OTS send an oceanic clearance request to the oceanic planning controller, containing the estimated time of arrival at the track entry boundary, the preferred OTS track, flight level and Mach number. The aircraft are cleared onto the OTS using a first-come, first-served (FCFS) approach, taking the separation requirements with already cleared aircraft into account. If an oceanic clearance request cannot be granted due to a potential loss of separation, the requesting aircraft will receive an alternative clearance. The research objectives of this thesis assignment are to: “Reduce the total direct operating cost of transatlantic air traffic by optimizing the OTS <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> procedure using a real-time meta-heuristic scheduling algorithm” “Create a model capable of optimizing the OTS <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> procedure for different cost-index values” This research aims at improving the current OTS <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> procedure by changing the first-come, first-served approach, currently used, to a scheduling concept in which the total direct operating cost (DOC) is minimized for a large number of aircraft in a single optimization window. The use of a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm is proposed in this thesis project and the potential of using stochastic optimization for large scheduling problems is researched. The direct operating cost penalties for the possible alternative clearances is determined using fuel consumption models in combination with time cost models. The created population algorithm is tested for multiple cost-index values, using real life problems, and the results are compared to the existing OTS <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> procedure. The generated results show a potential direct operating cost reduction as well as the possibility to use the created <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> algorithm as a real-time decision support tool for the oceanic planning controller.

40|$|Terminal {{capacity}} and performance {{have become a}} major concern for rail transit agencies in China due to the ever increasing passenger demand. This paper develops a mixed integer programming (MIP) optimization model to estimate the turnback {{capacity and}} performance of a rail transit terminal with two-tail tracks. The capacity evaluation and delay propagation are described and assessed as an N-track integrated model with minimal time span and train delay. Operations and design parameters such as tail <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> strategies, maximum layover time, headway pattern, buffer time distribution scheme, and primary delay are also considered in this model. The effectiveness of the model is tested by a case study with computation results drawn from one terminal station in Shanghai, China. The case study results show that unfixed platform time and flexible tail <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> strategies can improve the capacity of turnback operation, and the strategy of allowing swapping of the tail tracks has a significantly positive impact on delay absorption...|$|E

Finally, {{the results of the}} tests based on a rail hub linking six lines and a TAS about thirty minutes show that the the minimum buffer time is 21 seconds and there are two bottlenecks where the buffer times are 57 and 44 seconds respectively, and it indicates that the bottlenecks do not certainly locate at the area where there is minimum buffer time. The proposed approach can further support selection of mufti schemes and robustness optimization. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates to {{what extent}} subjective teacher assessment of children's ability adds {{to the use of}} test scores in the explanation of children's outcomes in the transition from elementary to secondary school in terms of initial <b>track</b> <b>allocation,</b> track switching in {{the first three years of}} secondary education and subsequent test scores. We apply micro-data from the Netherlands about cognitive test scores and teacher assessment in elementary schools and about track placement, track switching and test scores in secondary schools. Our estimates suggest that subjective teacher assessment is about twice as important as the elementary school cognitive test scores for initial track placement in secondary school. In addition, teacher assessment is more predictive of <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> in 9 th grade compared to cognitive test scores. Next, children who switch tracks are more likely to be placed in tracks based on test scores. Also, test scores in 9 th grade are predicted by subjective teacher assessment, not by test scores in 6 th grade. Finally, a back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that switching could be reduced by at least ten percent if children would have been allocated according to the teacher's assessment...|$|E
40|$|Secondary {{education}} {{is associated with}} a comparatively high level of inequality in Germany. This has often been attributed to the early ability-based between-school tracking in the German school system. However, as yet there has been no empirical evaluation of the actual impact of initial track placement on social inequality in final school attainment. Since educational reforms in the 1960 s increased educational mobility after track placement, it can be expected that initial <b>track</b> <b>allocation</b> has become less important for the process of secondary educational attainment and the inequalities therein. By drawing on longitudinal life-course data for different birth cohorts from the 1930 s to the 1980 s, this paper analyses temporal developments in the connections between track placement, educational mobility and social inequality in final school outcomes. The analyses reveal that the impact of track placement actually diminished for those cohorts exposed to the reformed school system. Instead, social inequalities in school attainment are increasingly influenced by processes of educational mobility after <b>track</b> <b>allocation.</b> Furthermore, the analyses show that developments in educational mobility have contributed more to declining inequalities in access to upper secondary education than changes of the selectivities in the transition to secondary education...|$|E

40|$|In {{rail freight}} operation, freight cars {{need to be}} {{separated}} and reformed into new trains at hump yards. The classification procedure is complex and hump yards constitute bottlenecks in the rail freight network, often causing outbound trains to be delayed. One {{of the problems is}} that planning for the <b>allocation</b> of <b>tracks</b> at hump yards is difficult, given that the planner has limited resources (tracks, shunting engines, etc.) and needs to foresee the future capacity requirements when planning for the current inbound trains. In this paper, we consider the problem of allocating classification tracks in a rail freight hump yard for arriving and departing trains with predetermined arrival and departure times. The core problem can be formulated as a special list coloring problem. We focus on an extension where individual cars can temporarily be stored on a special subset of the tracks. An extension where individual cars can temporarily be stored on a special subset of the tracks is also considered.
