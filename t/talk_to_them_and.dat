25|$|Barton quickly {{recognized}} them, as she {{had grown}} up with some of them, and some she had even taught. Barton, along with several other women, personally provided clothing, food, and supplies for the sick and wounded soldiers. She learned how to store and distribute medical supplies and offered emotional support to the soldiers by keeping their spirits high. She would read books to them, write letters to their families for them, <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> support them.|$|E
25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. I am no longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E
500|$|Several {{journalists have}} {{commented on the}} {{apparent}} conflict between the group's sexualized and often violent lyrics and their stated spiritual message. In a June 2010 interview with The Columbians Alan Sculley, Bruce explained, [...] " [...] the stuff that {{people are talking about}} on the streets...to get attention, you have to speak their language. You have to interest them, gain their trust, <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> show you're one of them. You're a person from the street and speak of your experiences. Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion".|$|E

500|$|With {{his career}} on hold, Hunt {{continued}} recording new songs and demos, posting {{them on his}} MySpace page, while Popular gained exposure among listeners through online music sharing. In 2009, he released the compilation album Use in Case of Emergency as a free download through his website. It featured previously unreleased material recorded by Hunt prior to Popular. He also continued touring, worked on an autobiographical book of short stories, entitled Tales of Friction, and studied classical piano. Hunt also took up photography after his girlfriend purchased him a camera. He started {{out on the streets}} of Los Angeles, where he photographed subjects on street corners and discarded objects, including furniture and numerous couches he found abandoned on the streets. In an interview for PopMatters, he explained how his photographying of people there inspired him: [...] "It's sad as you can quite imagine. It's also kind of welcoming to me. Sometimes I do get a chance to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> hear a bit of their story. I'm not the only one out here who had an idea of trying to make it happen. Some of us are luckier than others. Some of us are more prepared than others. That's just the truth of the situation." [...] Along with photography, he was stimulated creatively after reading Legs McNeil's 1997 book Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History of Punk and relating to its themes of artistic frustration and rebelliousness.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from {{choosing}} how {{to react}} to Voight-Kampff results, the player must also decide how McCoy conducts himself {{in other areas of}} the game, such as whether to interrogate an NPC, or simply <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> how aggressive to be in his questioning. The player can choose from one of five settings regarding McCoy's demeanor during conversations; [...] "Polite", [...] "Normal", [...] "Surly", [...] "Erratic" [...] (the game randomly picks one of the first three options at different points of the conversation) and [...] "User Choice". If the fifth option is selected, conversations with NPCs will present the player with menus from which they can choose their questions, rather than the game automatically selecting questions. Each choice will affect the storyline differently, with the player's cumulative decisions leading to one of the game's thirteen different endings.|$|E

5000|$|Before gunfire began, {{there was}} a verbal {{exchange}} with the Indians telling the Mormons to go away and the Mormons telling the Indians to surrender. Our interpreters <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> told <b>them</b> our errand, <b>and</b> asked <b>them</b> <b>to</b> give themselves up. They refused. Our guide <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> reasoned with <b>them,</b> but all <b>to</b> no purpose, fight they would unless we went away, then {{they said they would}} come out. The guide told them they must come out then or die...The first one shot was their leader. Then such a howling and crying, I think white men never heard before.|$|R
60|$|At Annootok Dr. Cook {{found many}} Esquimaux assembled, all {{ready for a}} great bear hunt. As he could speak their language, he <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> engaged a number of them, with their dogs and sledges, to serve him.|$|R
2500|$|ABC News {{reporter}} John Miller, who {{has also}} worked as a press secretary for law enforcement agencies, has identified three distinct stages {{in the evolution of}} the perp walk. Until the 1940s, suspects were paraded before reporters across a stage in the basement of police headquarters. The reporters decided if any would make a good story. After that period, reporters were assigned to individual station houses, and watched as suspects were booked and fingerprinted. They often were allowed to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> if any were deemed worthy of coverage a photo opportunity was usually provided. Bank robber Willie Sutton's legendary response (which he denied ever having made) of [...] "Because that's where the money is" [...] to a question about why he robbed banks, was said to have been uttered during a perp walk held in this fashion. A variant of the perp walk from this era, now no longer practiced, was the [...] "confession shot" [...] in which the defendant would be photographed signing or reviewing his written statement admitting to the crime.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack, you {{had better}} be the {{spokesman}} for the crowd," [...] remarked Randy. [...] "You go ahead and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> we'll stand back with our guns." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} {{do much more than}} walk down to the post office and back on the pleasantest days. A few people called, but he could not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> they did not call again.|$|E
6000|$|The girl nodded. [...] "They are splendid. I {{have been}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> made one sit still while I drew him. Please don't trouble about supper. I have seen cookie, and he's {{going to make}} the very things I like." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{says in an}} interview: “We have a rich {{tradition}} of PaaNans and Koothars going around places singing and creating poetry in the Sangam period. I am just a modern day PaaNan who goes to places, meets people, <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> tells their stories.” ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} clearly {{established}} that a competitive tendering {{process is the}} best method for meeting the objectives of this purchasing project. If (for example) it was known {{that there was only}} one organisation capable of supplying; best to get on with <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> negotiating a contract.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{said the}} Wizard reflectively, [...] "that I'd better {{go to the}} shore of the island, where I can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> work to better advantage. How did Trot and Cap'n Bill get to the island?" ...|$|E
60|$|And so John Carter, Prince of Helium, meekly {{surrendered}} {{to a single}} antagonist. The others now swarmed about us, asking many questions, but I would not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> finally my captor {{announced that he would}} lead me back to my cell.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then I don't {{think there}} is any harm done. If it comes before Mysie or Val I will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> I mean to take this poor child alone for a little while each day in the week and try to get at her.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{did not see}} him any more, but I detest his memory. Of course my resentment did {{not extend}} to the students, and so I had an unforgettable good time <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> <b>And</b> I think {{they had a good}} time too, for they responded [...] "as one man," [...] to use Susy's unimprovable phrase.|$|R
5000|$|I told John, [...] "Your cock's {{never been}} so hard," [...] and I told Peggy, [...] "You're a female dog in heat, and you want him. But don't let him have it in a hurry. Keep him waiting." [...] That's exactly how I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> I turned <b>them</b> loose. I didn't have <b>to</b> give <b>them</b> more directions.|$|R
5000|$|Facing {{the wishes}} (2007, [...] ) {{is a book}} {{containing}} the portraits and wishes {{of the children of}} Brenner primary school, Tel Aviv. Elyasaf Kowner met each of the children in person, <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> took their photographs. A portrait of each child appears in the book in an attempt to transcend the magical moment of making a wish.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think of it, Mr. Lacy," [...] was the slow reply. [...] "I have not yet had an {{opportunity}} to interview the two Rovers. If you will sit down here in my office, I'll <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> try to settle this matter with you." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the robbers}} began to mutter {{to each other}} apart about {{what they should do}} with him, whether they should murder him, or what else they should do. In the {{meantime}} the boy got up and began to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> ask them if they did not want a man-servant, for he could find pleasure enough in serving them.|$|E
6000|$|He broke off, and {{sat still}} awhile as one dreaming. [...] "I can't put things together, {{but at last}} we came south, Jake and I, and struck the Kamtchadales again. We could <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> one of them told us about a {{schooner}} lying in an inlet by a settlement. The Russians had brought her there from the islands, and {{she must have been}} a sealer. Jake figured it was just possible we might run away with her and push across for the Aleutians or Alaska." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's all in {{all with}} the young squire," [...] said Boscobel. [...] "And there's a chap there called Jacko--he's another. He gets <b>'em</b> down there <b>to</b> Gangoil, <b>and</b> the ladies <b>talks</b> <b>to</b> <b>'em,</b> <b>and</b> then they'd go through fire and water for him. There's Mickey--he's another, jist the same way. I don't like them ways, myself." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{and that}} pale-face aristocrat had for weeks now, months, or years perhaps, conspired against the Republic, against the Revolution, {{which had been}} made by a people thirsting for liberty. During these months and years he had <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> they had listened; he had poured forth treasures of eloquence, cajoled them, as he had done just now.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I'd had my way," [...] said Mrs. Glegg, [...] "the {{children}} 'ud ha' been in {{the room}} from the first. It's time they knew who they've to look to, and it's right as somebody should <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>'em,</b> <b>and</b> let <b>'em</b> know their condition i' life, and what they're come down <b>to,</b> <b>and</b> make <b>'em</b> feel as they've got to suffer for their father's faults." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The beasts of {{the forest}} must decide this matter for themselves," [...] he said. [...] "Go you, Rango the Gray Ape, and tell your monkey tribe to order all the forest beasts to {{assemble}} in the Great Clearing at sunrise to-morrow. When all are gathered together, this mixed-up Beast who is a magician shall <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> tell them what he has told us. Then, if they decide to fight the Oz people, who have declared war on us, I will lead the beasts to battle." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{though not}} soft or tender with his {{children}} he was very fond of them, {{and when he came}} home early in the evening he would get them round him and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> sing old songs and ballads he had learnt in his young years--"Down in the Village," [...] "The Days of Queen Elizabeth," [...] "The Blacksmith," [...] "The Gown of Green," [...] "The Dawning of the Day," [...] and many others, which Caleb in the end got by heart and used to sing, too, when he was grown up.|$|E
60|$|I {{have often}} heard persons of good {{judgment}} {{say that all}} the stir that people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is owing {{to the strength of}} imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy in their minds; {{that there is no such}} thing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost walking; that people's poring affectionately upon the past conversation of their deceased friends so realises it to them that they are capable of fancying, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they see them, <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> are answered by them, when, in truth, there is nothing but shadow and vapour in the thing, and they really know nothing of the matter.|$|E
60|$|Toto and the Yellow Hen {{had become}} quite {{friendly}} by this time, although {{at first they}} did not get along well together. Billina had been rather suspicious of dogs, and Toto had had an {{idea that it was}} every dog's duty to chase a hen on sight. But Dorothy had <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> scolded <b>them</b> for not being agreeable to one another until they grew better acquainted and became friends.|$|R
60|$|I {{gathered}} <b>them</b> all in <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> all <b>and</b> severally, the payment, a merely nominal matter, being made, pro forma, in advance.|$|R

Sister is <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> her left hand stretches out to hold one of the children holding a ball. Behind them are brick buildings...|$|R
