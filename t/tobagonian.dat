25|$|A {{majority}} of the early Indian immigrants spoke Trinidadian Hindustani, which {{is a form of}} the Bhojpuri and Awadhi dialect of Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu), which later became the lingua franca of Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonians. Attempts are being made to preserve the Trinidaian Hindustani language in the country, including the promotion of Indo-Trinidadian and <b>Tobagonian</b> musical forms called Pichakaree and Chutney, which are typically sung in a mixture of English and Trinidadian Hindustani.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 20% – 30% of measured GDP represents the hidden economy. Within the Trinidadian and <b>Tobagonian</b> business structure illicit activities and licit activities work side by side, with many business and political organisations being funded by institutionalised drug smugglers. Within Trinidad and Tobago {{there are two main}} drug cartels, the Syrian/Lebanese drug cartels and the Indo Trinidadian drug cartels. The Syrian Lebanese drug cartels are the longest tenured drug cartel on the islands, having ridden the wave of cocaine exportation from the 1970s to the current day. The Syrian Drug Cartels control the vast sway of financing and business interest on the island and exhibit monopolistic tendencies which limit free market policies in insurance, health, finance, heavy and light manufacturing, and land distribution.|$|E

The destruction of the <b>Tobagonian</b> rainforests resulted in a continual decline of agriculture on the island due to animals previously in the forest eating the crops for food. The passage of the hurricane reduced the height of the rainforest canopy above [...] by half. Twenty-five years passed before the canopy reached its previous height.|$|E

50|$|The {{background}} for the foundation of movement is a widespread presence of black racism, the division of community {{on the basis of}} race, the illicit drug trade and ideology of extremist jihad. The next step was a development of a militant Islamic discourse which insisted that liberation for especially Afro-Trinidadians and <b>Tobagonians</b> was only found within the ambit of Islam. As the result, a group called Jamaat al Muslimeen (JAM), an Afro-Trinidadian Muslim movement, was founded.|$|R
50|$|Afro-Trinidadians and <b>Tobagonians</b> {{accounted}} for 35.4 per {{cent of the}} population of Trinidad and Tobago according to the 2011 Census. However, the classification is primarily a superficial description based on phenotypical (physical) description opposed to genotypical (genetic) classification. It is not uncommon for Trinidadians of both Indian and African descent to be considered Afro-Trinidadian solely based on appearance. An additional 22.8 per cent of Trinidadians described themselves as being multiracial, of whom 7.7 per cent were dougla (mixed African and Indian ethnicity).|$|R
