5|$|Few records survive of the Brill Brick and Tile Works, {{as it came}} to be called, but it was {{operational}} by 1895. Jones (1974) {{says the}} siding to the brickworks opened with the extension to Brill, implying that Brill Brick and Tile Works existed in early 1872. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly incorrect; no mention of the sidings is made in the Duke of Buckingham's correspondence before 1887 and no reference to the Brill Brick and Tile Works exists in any source earlier than 1895. The bricks used to build Waddesdon Manor had to be shipped by road from Poore's to Brill or along the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway from further afield before being sent down the Tramway to the site, implying there was no works capable of making high numbers of bricks along the Tramway.|$|E

Close XI, Ken Rutherford scored 317 runs off just 245 balls, including 228 runs in fours and sixes.

25|$|The initial {{treatment}} for testicular cancer is {{surgery to remove}} the affected testicle (orchiectomy). While it may be possible, in some cases, to remove testicular cancer tumors from a testis while leaving the testis functional, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> never done, as the affected testicle usually contains pre-cancerous cells spread throughout the entire testicle. Thus removing the tumor alone without additional treatment greatly increases the risk that another cancer will form in that testicle.|$|E
25|$|As usual, the {{artisans}} {{were sent}} back to Mongolia, young {{women and children were}} given to the Mongol soldiers as slaves, {{and the rest of the}} population was massacred. The Persian scholar Juvayni states that 50,000 Mongol soldiers were given the task of executing twenty-four Urgench citizens each, which would mean that 1.2 million people were killed. While <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly an exaggeration, the sacking of Urgench is considered one of the bloodiest massacres in human history.|$|E

25|$|Mousthwaite Comb is a {{geographical}} oddity. To {{the north of}} the depression, running eastward, is the River Glenderamackin. To the south of the col, flowing westward is the same river. In the intervening time the Glenderamackin has run for six miles, surrounding Souther Fell on three sides like a moat. The Comb provides its only dryshod connection to other ground and even <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> cut off by the tributary of Comb beck on the southern slope.|$|E
25|$|The {{destruction}} of the Confederate garrison was complete. Only a few hundred individual soldiers managed to escape by wading or rafting across Reelfoot Lake and later rejoining the army. The number who were captured became a matter of controversy. Pope asserted, in his official reports, {{that he had taken}} 273 officers and 6,700 private soldiers captive. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly a great exaggeration. Confederate records (admittedly incomplete) indicate that not more than 5,350 men were present. The number captured would then likely have been less than 4,500.|$|E
25|$|Primidone {{has other}} {{cardiovascular}} effects in beyond shortening the QT interval. Both it and phenobarbital {{are associated with}} elevated serum levels (both fasting and six hours after methionine loading) of homocysteine, an amino acid derived from methionine. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly related to the low folate levels reported in primidone users. Elevated levels of homocysteine {{have been linked to}} coronary heart disease. In 1985, both drugs were also reported to increase serum levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A and B.|$|E

25|$|The branch Forcade du Tauzia, Forcade du Pin and Lafourcade de la Prade was {{confirmed}} in two 17th century judgments to descend from the Noble family of Forcade in Orthez. The founder of this branch {{is identified as}} Jean Laforcade, Seigneur de Lafitte. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly the Jean de Laforcade, Seigneur de La Fitte, who {{is believed to be}} the son of Noble Gaston de Forcade, not the son of Noble Odet de Forcade born and residing in Orthez, as Bourrousse de Laffore alleged he learned from an unnamed heraldry practice in Bordeaux.|$|E
25|$|The browser's use of {{compression}} and encrypted proxy-based technology to reduce traffic and speed page display has the {{side effect of}} allowing it to circumvent several approaches to Internet censorship. Since 20 November 2009, {{there have been reports}} from Chinese users that when they use Opera Mini, they are redirected to an error page leading them to download Opera Mini China version. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly due to the Chinese government being concerned that users are using Opera Mini to bypass the Great Firewall of China. Opera agreed to route all of their traffic through government servers.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, men {{and women}} who are not married and are not closely related are {{generally}} not allowed to touch each other. Many Orthodox married couples will also not touch one another in public. A person who refrains from touching the opposite sex is said to be shomer negiah. Shmirath negiah applies to touching that is b'derech chiba (in an affectionate manner). According to some authorities, mainly of Modern Orthodox background, a quick handshake, particularly in the context of earning a living in a business setting, does not fall under this category. However, people who are stringently shomer negiah will avoid shaking hands with a member of the opposite sex, even in a business context. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> universally observed within the Haredi community, and somewhat observed within the Modern Orthodox community where the term originated in recent decades. Conservative and Reform Judaism do not follow these laws.|$|E

25|$|The Clergy of the Church of England {{database}} (CCEd) has {{a record}} of Samuel Fisher's ordination as priest at Eccleshall by Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Lichfield, on 18 December 1630. The five years, 1630-5, between Fisher's ordination and his appointment as rector at Upton Magna, are largely unaccounted for. Rigg's account in the Dictionary of National Biography implies that he worked at St Bride's Church in London before coming to Shropshire: <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly untrue, as he is known to have worked there in the 1650s. Fisher's ordination by Thomas Morton seems to connect him from the outset of his career with the West Midlands and his preaching at Shrewsbury in 1633 shows that he was moderately known as a preacher in the region before his presentation to the rectory. However, it is not known how or where, or even if, he had an ecclesiastical living during this period.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{centre of}} Gubbio has a decidedly medieval aspect: {{the town is}} austere in appearance because of the dark grey stone, narrow streets, and Gothic architecture. Many houses in central Gubbio date to the 14th and 15th centuries, and were originally the dwellings of wealthy merchants. They often have a second door fronting on the street, usually just {{a few inches from}} the main entrance. This secondary entrance is narrower, and a foot or so above the actual street level. This type of door is called a porta dei morti (door of the dead) because it was proposed that they were used to remove the bodies of any who might have died inside the house. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly false, but there is no agreement as to the purpose of the secondary doors. A more likely theory is that the door was used by the owners to protect themselves when opening to unknown persons, leaving them in a dominating position.|$|E
25|$|Stefan Kraowski {{indirectly}} {{places the}} Mongol invasion force a fair bit above 30,000 men by estimating the smaller Mongol invasion of Poland {{two years later}} as having about that many soldiers, stating that Nogai and Talabuga personally leading an invasion suggests its a massive force by definition. Peter Jackson, using contemporary Hungarian charters, concludes that the Mongol army was very large, but is unsure if it was larger, smaller, or comparable in size to the 1241–42 invasion force. A contemporary letter from Benedict, the provost of Esztergom, estimates {{the size of the}} Mongol army at 200,000. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly an enormous exaggeration, as the Mongols almost never fielded armies larger than 100,000 men. The Austrian chronicler of Salzburg recorded that the Mongol military camp covered an area of ten miles in width and six miles in depth (whether this was Nogai's or Talabuga's army, or how this chronicler got his information, is unknown). The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle puts the size of the Mongol army in the hundreds of thousands, saying that Talabuga's column alone lost 100,000 men during the march through the Carpathians.|$|E
