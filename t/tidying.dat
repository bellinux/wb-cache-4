5|$|Suzy and Doc are {{attracted}} to each other; she has in fact been quietly <b>tidying</b> his rooms while he is down at the tide pool catching specimens ("The Man I Used to Be"). Fauna tries to persuade Doc, who is very successful with the ladies, to woo Suzy. When Doc is dismissive, Fauna explains {{that she wants to}} get Suzy out of the Bear Flag when it is taken over for the night by a private party. Doc agrees to take Suzy out and treat her like a lady. Fauna goes back to the Bear Flag ("Sweet Thursday"), and works to give Suzy confidence ("Suzy is a Good Thing"). Doc and Suzy's date is the source of great interest to the people of Cannery Row. Both are nervous; Doc wears an unaccustomed necktie, while Suzy tries to act like a lady, but her polish wears thin at times. ("All At Once You Love Her"). At the end of the meal, they decide to continue the evening on a secluded sand dune.|$|E

25|$|Despite the setback, the {{supporters}} of the line {{knew that they were}} close to getting approval. As a result Moorsom was dismissed and Isambard Kingdom Brunel was asked to design a new scheme for the 1846 session. Brunel brought in William Johnson, whom he fully trusted, to survey and redesign the line. This was a full fresh survey and not simply a <b>tidying</b> up of Moorsom's work. It was ready within three months and was lodged in Parliament with a new Bill on 30 November 1845.|$|E
25|$|The MNR quickly {{returned}} {{the station to}} use, as a visitor centre rather than an operational railway museum. Over the next year, the MNR spent £28,000 restoring the station buildings to wartime LNER condition, <b>tidying</b> the grounds and removing scrap material left by the former lessee. With additional investment, the station drive, damaged after decades of neglect, was professionally resurfaced, scrub growth {{was removed from the}} railway formation opening up the views of the Wensum Valley for walkers, and formation for the restoration of track was prepared. In 2010 it was repainted into MNR house colours.|$|E
25|$|Its {{design was}} based on the {{previous}} Rs.III, differing primarily in having a narrower hull fitted with sponsons and stressed skin structure, with some minor <b>tidying</b> of the design. It was a braced parasol monoplane with the fuselage mounted on the wing above both engine nacelles and hull. The four engines were mounted in push-pull pairs in nacelles large enough to allow in flight access — a requirement of the original Riesenflugzeug giant aircraft type specification by IdFlieg in 1915 — between the hull and the wing, and staggered to allow propeller disks to overlap slightly so as to reduce adverse yaw when an engine was not running.|$|E

500|$|There {{is a local}} {{tradition}} that Hylton Castle is haunted by the spirit of Robert Skelton, known as the Cauld (a pronunciation of [...] "cold" [...] in Mackem) Lad of Hylton. Various versions of how he was killed exist, the most popular being that he was decapitated by Sir Robert Hylton (later de jure 13th Baron Hylton), after falling asleep and failing to get his master's horse ready on time. Skelton's spirit then began to haunt the castle and would move objects, either misplacing them or <b>tidying</b> up. The spirit {{was said to have}} been finally laid to rest when the castle servants put a cloak out for him.|$|E
500|$|Local volunteers {{under the}} {{guidance}} of the Manchester Bolton and Bury Canal Society have for years worked on sections of the canal, removing overgrowth and <b>tidying</b> up its general appearance. [...] A new pedestrian footbridge, designed by artist Liam Curtin, was opened at Nob End Locks in April 2013. [...] Made entirely out of scaled-up pieces of Meccano, it was built by society volunteers {{and other members of the}} public at a cost of about £90,000. [...] Toward the end of 2015, work began to restore water to the top lock at Nob End. [...] Infill beneath the first bridge on the canal's Bolton arm was excavated, exposing the towpath for the first time in decades.|$|E

500|$|Leo VI {{achieved}} the complete codification of Byzantine law in Greek. This monumental work of 60 volumes became {{the foundation of}} all subsequent Byzantine law and is still studied today. Leo also reformed {{the administration of the}} Empire, redrawing the borders of the administrative subdivisions (the Themata, or [...] "Themes") and <b>tidying</b> up the system of ranks and privileges, as well as regulating the behaviour of the various trade guilds in Constantinople. Leo's reform did much to reduce the previous fragmentation of the Empire, which henceforth had one center of power, Constantinople. However, the increasing military success of the Empire greatly enriched and empowered the provincial nobility with respect to the peasantry, who were essentially reduced to a state of serfdom.|$|E

[...] The more hardy stayed overnight in sleeping bags on the wooden floor with one brave soul suspending a hammock from the roof beams. [...] This group started work <b>tidying</b> up the station and evicting the rats, but more important was fencing, ditching and keying-up on 'their' section of track northwards to Newtondale.|$|E

[...] There are in existence designs for gilded doors and panels at Wilton annotated by Jones. [...] It seems likely that Jones originally sketched some ideas for de Caus, and following the fire conveyed through Webb some further ideas for <b>tidying</b> the house and its decorations. [...] Fireplaces and decorative themes can be executed at long distance. The exact truth of the work by Jones will probably never be known.|$|E
2500|$|The {{business}} of making the changes was then entrusted to a small committee of bishops and the Privy Council and, apart from <b>tidying</b> up details, this committee introduced into Morning and Evening Prayer a prayer for the Royal Family; added several thanksgivings to the Occasional Prayers {{at the end of}} the Litany; altered the rubrics of Private Baptism limiting it to the minister of the parish, or some other lawful minister, but still allowing it in private houses (the Puritans had wanted it only in the church); and added to the Catechism the section on the sacraments.
