40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{indicators of}} prognosis for mechanical risks of amalgam and composite resin restorations in permanent teeth. METHODS: Thirty-nine adult patients with direct clinical, photographic, radiographic and model examinations. A total of 256 restorations {{were classified as}} "not satisfactory," with Bravo or Charlie values according to the modified Ryge /USPHS criteria. The total "n" was divided into Bravo and Charlie groups according to the value obtained in the "marginal adaptation" parameter. Each of the groups was sub-divided {{by the type of}} material (amalgam and composite resins) and the class: occlusal (O) and proximal (MOD). RESULTS : Comparing the Bravo and Charlie groups, the statistically significant indicators were: the mesiodistal dimension (p= 0. 037), <b>the</b> distal <b>isthmus</b> (p< 0. 05), the average of <b>the</b> <b>isthmuses</b> (p< 0. 05), the distal (p< 0. 05) cavity depth, and the average depth of the MOD (p< 0. 05) cavities. It was concluded that the type and the class of the restoration are not indicators for sampling. CONCLUSIONS: With regard to the design of the cavity preparation, the valid mechanical risk indicators include the mesiodistal dimension, <b>the</b> distal <b>isthmus,</b> <b>the</b> average of <b>the</b> <b>isthmuses,</b> <b>the</b> depth of the distal cavity and the average depth of the MOD cavities. A simple clinical assessment does not provide sufficient information to establish the indicators for mechanical failure risk of restorations...|$|R

5|$|Phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{mitochondrial}} DNA, {{has concluded that}} the sand devil and the Pacific angel shark (S. californica) are sister species.

Molecular clock estimation has timed the divergence of S. dumeril and S. californica at c. 6.1 Ma, around the time that <b>the</b> <b>Isthmus</b> of Panama formed. The rise of <b>the</b> <b>Isthmus</b> likely split the ancestral angel shark population, leading to their becoming separate species.|$|E

50|$|The {{idea of the}} {{so-called}} three-isthmus border—defined by <b>the</b> White <b>Isthmus,</b> <b>the</b> Olonets <b>Isthmus,</b> and <b>the</b> Karelian Isthmus—is hundreds of years old, {{dating back to the}} period when Finland was part of Sweden. There was a disagreement between Sweden and Russia as to where the border between the two countries should be. The Swedish government considered a three-isthmus border to be the easiest to defend.|$|R
5|$|Three years later, a Macedonian {{fleet of}} 38 vessels was sent across by Philip V, while the larger {{warships}} sailed around Cape Malea. After his victory at Actium in 31BC, Octavian advanced {{as fast as}} possible against Marc Antony by ordering part of his 260 Liburnians to be carried over <b>the</b> <b>Isthmus.</b> In 868AD, the Byzantine admiral Niketas Oryphas had his whole fleet of one hundred dromons dragged across <b>the</b> <b>Isthmus</b> in a quickly executed operation, but this took place most likely on a different route.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning <b>the</b> <b>Isthmus</b> of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across <b>the</b> <b>Isthmus</b> and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane {{off the coast of}} the Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.|$|E

40|$|In 104 {{hearts of}} infants and children, who died from non-vascular diseases, and whose ages ranged up to 10 years after birth, {{narrowing}} of <b>the</b> aortic <b>isthmus,</b> i. e. an internal diameter of 80 % {{or less of}} that of the descending aorta, was found in 26 cases (24 %). The remaining cases showed a lesser degree or no narrowing of <b>the</b> aortic <b>isthmus.</b> Among <b>the</b> 38 cases who died within 2 days after birth (gestational age range 21 to 42 weeks) narrowing of <b>the</b> aortic <b>isthmus,</b> as defined above, was present in only 14 cases (37 %). This is much less frequent than is suggested in the literature. No correlation was found between presence, and degree, or absence of narrowing of <b>the</b> aortic <b>isthmus</b> and <b>the</b> relative sizes of the aortic and pulmonary narrowing of <b>the</b> aortic <b>isthmus</b> and <b>the</b> relative sizes of the aortic and pulmonary ostia. Possibly, to define {{the limits of the}} normal condition of <b>the</b> aortic <b>isthmus,</b> not only its diameter, but also the characteristics of its tunica media may be of importance. Therefore, the thickness and the packing density of the elastic fibres of both <b>the</b> aortic <b>isthmus</b> and <b>the</b> descending aorta were measured in 69 cases, equally distributed over the material. It is reasoned that in the 3 {{out of a total of}} 26 cases, in which not only a marked narrowing of <b>the</b> aortic <b>isthmus</b> was observed but also a relative underdevelopment of its tunica media, a persistent narrowing might have developed, whereas development of such a persistent narrowing seems less likely with a tunica media of normal volume and structure...|$|R

5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were not {{protected}} by <b>the</b> <b>isthmus,</b> but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on <b>the</b> <b>isthmus</b> was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{affecting}} Guerrero, Hurricane Calvin {{was responsible}} for heavy rains and widespread flooding across Oaxaca. An estimated 7,000 were left homeless along the Oaxacan coast and on <b>the</b> <b>Isthmus</b> of Tehuantepec. In addition, travel from <b>the</b> <b>isthmus</b> was cut off due to mudslides that blocked portions of the Pan-American Highway. Two rivers threatened to overflow their banks while the Benito, Juarez, and Yosocuta dams attained peak capacity and thus the gates were opened to prevent overflowing. A total of 42 communities were flooded. The cities of Tehuantepec, Salina Cruz, Juchtianm, and Tuxtepec were flooded due to extended periods of torrential rains. Across the state, the rains blocked highways and knocked out electrical, telephone, and water services. About 3,000people took refuge to shelters and one person was killed.|$|E
