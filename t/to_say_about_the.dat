5|$|Epaminondas was {{considered}} the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does not have anything <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the Sacred Band, nor does he {{say anything about the}} following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus, the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.|$|E
5|$|Peter K. Bol {{asserts that}} the {{supporters}} of Wang Anshi's expansionist, activist central government in his New Policies were convinced that he understood the dao which brought utopia to Western Zhou (c. 1050 BC – 771 BC) antiquity and were determined to conform society according to his vision. The marginalised emperor – the last remaining aristocrat with any true political power – embraced the fiction that he was like the sage kings of old who brought society {{into a state of}} total harmony with court rituals and policy reforms. Yet after the reign of Emperor Huizong, Song rulers and officials alike disregarded the New Policies and focused instead on reforming society through a local, bottom-up approach. For example, Emperor Huizong attempted from 1107–1120 to bar anyone who had not attended a government school from serving in public office. He thus rejected anyone who did not acknowledge his brand of Confucian ideology as orthodoxy. However, the government-run school system during the Southern Song eventually lost prominence to private academies, which had outnumbered government schools during the early Northern Song. Even before Emperor Huizong's reign, Sima Guang (1019–1086), a prominent chancellor and political rival to Wang Anshi, had little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> emperor's role in shaping major reforms and public policy, mentioning only that the emperor made major appointments when necessary.|$|E

Other authors, even Christians writing in Arabic in the Caliphate, had less <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire than al-Mas‘udi.

25|$|In 2011, the Washington Post listed Old Ebbitt Grill {{as one of}} the {{top three}} raw bars in the city.

The busy atmosphere, he argued, was not conducive to a positive dining experience. By contrast, the Restaurant Association of Metropolitan Washington gave Old Ebbitt Grill its Visitors' Choice Award in 2011.|$|E

25|$|All of {{them had}} {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Christian form of the Logos. The Catholic Church {{found it necessary to}} distinguish between the Christian logos and that of Heraclitus as part of its ideological distancing from paganism. The necessity to convert by defeating paganism was of paramount importance. Hippolytus of Rome therefore identifies Heraclitus along with the other Pre-Socratics (and Academics) as sources of heresy. Church use of the methods and conclusions of ancient philosophy as such was as yet far in the future, even though many were converted philosophers.|$|E
25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{influences}} on Structural Marxism, {{primarily from the}} British Marxist historical tradition, included E.P. Thompson, Eric Hobsbawm and Raymond Williams. They criticized the functionalist emphasis in Structural Marxism, that neglected individuals in favour of the structural elements of their model. The British school {{was more interested in}} class, culture and politics, and placed human subjects at the centre of analysis. Where mode of production analysis was abstract, they focused on people. Where world-systems theory had little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> local, the Cultural Materialists began and ended there. Others connected with this school of thought concentrated on issues such as ethnic formation, labor migration, remittances, household formation, food production and the processes of colonialism.|$|E

I’m ashamed, really, of how little leadership there has been. There has been just tremendous timidity {{on the part of the}} party, generally, although there have been a handful of exceptions. But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E
25|$|Lt. Fessenden had the {{following}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> battle that day: During the morning, after an all night march, we were ordered forward by General King. The battery was hardly in position before the {{troops on the}} right gave way and it was exposed to a most terrific fire of musketry from front and flank. General King ordered us to limber to the rear, {{but it was impossible}} to execute the order, since many of the cannoneers were either killed or wounded, and the horses shot at the limbers. At the first fire, Lieut. Burnham fell mortally wounded; Lieut. Ludlow was also wounded and fell into the enemy's hands, and myself slightly wounded in the side. The battery was taken by the enemy, after firing sixteen rounds of canister.|$|E
25|$|Dilthey {{was also}} {{interested}} in what some would call sociology in the 21st century, although he strongly objected to being labelled as such, as the sociology of his time was mainly that of Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. He objected to their dialectical/evolutionist assumptions about the necessary changes that all societal formations must go through, {{as well as their}} narrowly natural-scientific methodology. Comte's idea of positivism was, according to Dilthey, one-sided and misleading. Dilthey did, however, have good things <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> neo-Kantian sociology of Georg Simmel, with whom he was a colleague at the University of Berlin. Simmel himself was later an associate of Max Weber, the primary founder of sociological antipositivism. J. I. Hans Bakker has argued that Dilthey should be considered one of the classical sociological theorists due to his own influence in the foundation of nonpositivist verstehende sociology and the Verstehen method.|$|E

25|$|LQG {{differs from}} string theory {{in that it}} is {{formulated}} in 3 and 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry or Kaluza-Klein extra dimensions, while the latter requires both to be true. There is no experimental evidence to date that confirms string theory's predictions of supersymmetry and Kaluza–Klein extra dimensions. In a 2003 paper A dialog on quantum gravity, Carlo Rovelli regards the fact LQG is formulated in 4 dimensions and without supersymmetry as a strength of the theory as it represents the most parsimonious explanation, consistent with current experimental results, over its rival string/M-theory. Proponents of string theory will often point to the fact that, among other things, it demonstrably reproduces the established theories of general relativity and quantum field theory in the appropriate limits, which Loop Quantum Gravity has struggled to do. In that sense string theory's connection to established physics may be considered more reliable and less speculative, at the mathematical level. Loop Quantum Gravity has nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> matter(fermions) in the universe.|$|E
25|$|The early Spanish {{writers have}} little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> king's (or, {{as the case}} might be, queen's) ritual duties. Nonetheless, one finds the Yucatec king (halach uinic) {{referred}} to as 'bishop', so that, in virtue of his office, the king appears {{to have had a}} leading role in major public rituals. In the Classic period, the rituals of kingship were the most important rituals of the Maya court. The term 'theatre state' (Geertz), originally coined for the Hindu kingdoms of Bali, could also be used for describing the Classic Maya kingdoms; it suggests the cohesion of the state to be dependent on elaborate royal rituals through which status differences between aristocratic families could find expression. On monuments, the king sometimes assumes a dancing posture suggestive of his participation in the rituals that were staged on the large plazas where the royal stelas stood. On important occasions, the royal impersonator would be shown to the crowd while being within a shrine erected on a large palanquin (as on a wooden lintel from Tikal's Temple IV).|$|E
