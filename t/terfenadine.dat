25|$|Earlier {{case reports}} on sudden death {{prompted}} {{a study on}} a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, erythromycin should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include <b>terfenadine</b> (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, is also contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|The TCAs {{are highly}} metabolised by the {{cytochrome}} P450 hepatic enzymes. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 (for example cimetidine, methylphenidate, fluoxetine, antipsychotics, and calcium channel blockers) may produce decreases in the TCAs' metabolism, leading {{to increases in}} their blood concentrations and accompanying toxicity. Drugs that prolong the QT interval including antiarrhythmics such as quinidine, the antihistamines astemizole and <b>terfenadine,</b> and some antipsychotics may increase the chance of ventricular dysrhythmias. TCAs may enhance the response to alcohol {{and the effects of}} barbiturates and other CNS depressants. Side effects may also be enhanced by other drugs that have antimuscarinic properties.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terfenadine</b> is a prodrug, {{generally}} completely metabolized to {{the active}} form fexofenadine {{in the liver}} by the enzyme cytochrome P450 3A4. Due to its near complete metabolism by the liver immediately after leaving the gut, <b>terfenadine</b> normally is not measurable in the plasma. <b>Terfenadine</b> itself, however, is cardiotoxic at higher doses, while its major active metabolite is not. <b>Terfenadine,</b> {{in addition to its}} antihistamine effects, also acts as a potassium channel blocker (Kv11.1 encoded by the gene hERG). Since its active metabolite is not a potassium channel blocker, no cardiotoxicity is associated with fexofenadine. Toxicity is possible after years of continued use with no previous problems {{as a result of an}} interaction with other medications such as erythromycin, or foods such as grapefruit. The addition of, or a dosage increase in, these CYP3A4 inhibitors makes it harder for the body to metabolize and remove <b>terfenadine.</b> In larger plasma concentrations, it may lead to toxic effects on the heart's rhythm (e.g. ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes).|$|E

50|$|<b>Terfenadine,</b> {{the first}} non-sedating antihistamine, {{had to be}} {{withdrawn}} from the market {{because of the small}} risk of a serious side effect. However, <b>terfenadine</b> was discovered to be the prodrug of the active molecule, fexofenadine, which does not carry the same risks as the parent compound. Therefore, fexofenadine could be placed on the market as a safe replacement for the original drug. Loratadine, another non-sedating antihistamine, is the prodrug of desloratadine, which is largely responsible for the antihistaminergic effects of the parent compound. However, in this case the parent compound does not have the side effects associated with <b>terfenadine,</b> and so both loratadine and its active metabolite, desloratadine, are currently marketed.|$|E

50|$|The older {{antihistaminic}} agent <b>terfenadine</b> {{was found}} to metabolize into the related carboxylic acid, fexofenadine. Fexofenadine {{was found to}} retain all of the biological activity of its parent while giving fewer adverse reactions in patients, so <b>terfenadine</b> was replaced in the market by its metabolite. Fexofenadine was originally synthesized in 1993 by Massachusetts-based biotechnology company Sepracor, which then sold the development rights to Hoechst Marion Roussel (now part of Sanofi-Aventis), and was later approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996. Albany Molecular Research Inc. (AMRI) holds the patents to the intermediates and production of fexofenadine HCl along with Roussel. Since that time, it has achieved blockbuster drug status with global sales of $1.87B USD in 2004 (with $1.49B USD coming from the United States). AMRI received royalty payments from Aventis that enabled the growth of AMRI.|$|E

However, by the time Schering submitted the drug to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval, the agency had already approved a competitor's nonsedating antihistamine, <b>terfenadine</b> (trade name Seldane), and, therefore, put loratadine on a lower priority.|$|E
50|$|Although CYP3A4 is {{predominantly}} {{found in the}} liver, it is also present in other organs and tissues of the body, where it may {{play an important role}} in metabolism. CYP3A4 in the intestine plays an important role in the metabolism of certain drugs. Often this allows prodrugs to be activated and absorbed - as in the case of the histamine H1-receptor antagonist <b>terfenadine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Oral antihistamine: Antihistamines such as hydrochloride, hydroxyzine, <b>terfenadine</b> and {{cyproheptadine}} {{have frequently}} {{been used to}} reverse or minimize the effects of aquagenic urticaria.

50|$|Dr. Woosley's {{research}} at Georgetown contributed substantially to {{the recognition that}} non-cardiovascular drugs, such as antihistamines (e.g., <b>terfenadine</b> (Seldane®)), may have arrhythmogenic effects. Dr. Woosley's invention, fexofenadine (Allegra®), resulted from this research and is today marketed as a safer non-sedating antihistamine replacing Seldane®. His research on drug safety led Dr. Woosley to champion {{the development of the}} Centers for Education and Research on Therapeutics (CERTs), until 2016, a network of federally funded centers designed to improve outcomes in medical therapeutics.|$|E
50|$|Most {{drugs that}} cause long QT {{syndrome}} {{do so by}} blocking the IKr current via the hERG gene. These include erythromycin, <b>terfenadine,</b> and ketoconazole. The hERG channel is very sensitive to unintended drug binding due to two aromatic amino acids, the tyrosine at position 652 and the phenylalanine at position 656. These amino acid residues are poised so a drug binding to them blocks the channel from conducting current. Other potassium channels do not have these residues in these positions, so are, therefore, not as prone to blockage.|$|E

5000|$|In January 1997, {{the same}} month when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had earlier {{approved}} a generic version of Seldane made by IVAX Corporation of Miami, the FDA recommended terfenadine-containing drugs {{be removed from the}} market and physicians consider alternative medications for their patients. Seldane (and Seldane-D, <b>terfenadine</b> combined with the decongestant pseudoephedrine) were removed from the U.S. market by their manufacturer in late 1997 after the FDA approval of Allegra-D (fexofenadine/pseudoephedrine). [...] Terfenadine-containing drugs were subsequently removed from the Canadian market in 1999, and are no longer available for prescription in the UK.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, various {{researchers}} showed that grapefruit juice, and grapefruit in general, {{is a potent}} inhibitor of CYP3A4, which can affect the metabolism {{of a variety of}} drugs, increasing their bioavailability. In some cases, this can lead to a fatal interaction with drugs like astemizole or <b>terfenadine.</b> The effect of grapefruit juice with regard to drug absorption was originally discovered in 1989. The first published report on grapefruit drug interactions was in 1991 in the Lancet entitled [...] "Interactions of Citrus Juices with Felodipine and Nifedipine" [...] and was the first reported food-drug interaction clinically. The effects of grapefruit last from 3-7 days, with the greatest effects when juice is taken an hour previous to administration of the drug.|$|E
5000|$|The cited {{findings}} suggest that various CYP epoxygenases along with the epoxide metabolites which they make promote the growth and spread of diverse types of cancer in animals and humans. Their effects may reflect {{the ability of the}} epoxide metabolites to stimulate the proliferation and survival of the target cancer cells but perhaps also to stimulate these cells to trigger new capillary formation (see angiogenesis#Tumor angiogenesis), invade new tissues, and metastasize. [...] A series of drugs derived from <b>Terfenadine</b> have been shown to inhibit CYP2J2 and to suppress the proliferation and cause the apoptosis of various types of human cancer cell lines in culture as well as in animal models. However, clinical studies targeting CYP epoxygenases and EETs and to successfully suppress cancer in humans have not been reported.|$|E
50|$|Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily, CYP3A. The {{activity of}} the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g. dexamethasone) which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, e.g. erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor)—are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels {{and the potential for}} rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated.Earlier case reports on sudden death prompted a study on a large cohort that confirmed a link between erythromycin, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of erythromycin (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4.

40|$|In a study {{designed}} to determine the protective effect of the specific histamine H 1 antagonist <b>terfenadine</b> on hypertonic saline induced bronchoconstriction, 10 asthmatic subjects underwent hypertonic saline challenge (3. 6 %) after premedication with placebo or <b>terfenadine</b> (120 mg) 12 and {{two hours before the}} challenge. Hypertonic saline was administered in a dose dependent manner and the response determined as the dose of hypertonic saline that induced a 20 % fall in FEV 1 (PD 20 FEV 1). FEV 1 was on average 11 % greater with <b>terfenadine</b> than with placebo given before the challenge with hypertonic saline. PD 20 FEV 1 was attenuated by a mean of 2. 5 fold after <b>terfenadine</b> (geometric mean PD 20 FEV 1 was 22 litres after placebo and 56 l after <b>terfenadine).</b> There was substantial intersubject variation in the inhibitory effect of <b>terfenadine</b> on hypertonic saline induced bronchoconstriction: the ratio of the PD 20 hypertonic saline after <b>terfenadine</b> to that after placebo ranged from 0. 9 to 10. 0. <b>Terfenadine</b> inhibited histamine induced bronchoconstriction in the eight subjects in whom it was tested, by 13 to 160 fold compared with placebo in four subjects and by greater than 2 to greater than 9 fold in the four who showed no response to the highest dose of histamine given (16 mg/ml).

40|$|Concurrent use of <b>terfenadine</b> or {{astemizole}} with erythromycin or ketoconazole can {{prolong the}} QT interval and produce potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias. We examine {{the frequency and}} patterns of concurrent prescribing and suggest methods to {{reduce the incidence of}} serious drug interactions. By retrospectively reviewing Oregon Medicaid prescription claims data over 22 months, we determined the frequency of concurrent prescribing of <b>terfenadine</b> or astemizole with macrolide antibiotics or ketoconazole. From 1991 to 1992, <b>terfenadine</b> use increased by 29 %, with a seasonal peak in June of each year. <b>Terfenadine</b> {{was one of the most}} prescribed medications from March through July 1992. During the 22 months reviewed, there were 122 episodes of concurrent use of <b>terfenadine</b> or astemizole with macrolide antibiotics or ketoconazole. Most of these episodes (94 %) involved <b>terfenadine.</b> The frequency of concurrent use increased more than threefold from 1991 to 1992. Although patients received prescriptions from different physicians in 48 % of these episodes, they used different pharmacies only 3 % of the time. We demonstrate that <b>terfenadine</b> use is extensive and increasing, thus increasing the possibility of serious interactions, and many physicians may remain unaware of this potential. Effective prospective screening by pharmacists could dramatically reduce the incidence of concurrent prescribing. Physicians must be aware of the potential for these drug interactions, avoid prescribing these medications concurrently, and consider these interactions in the evaluation of syncope and cardiac arrhythmias...|$|E
