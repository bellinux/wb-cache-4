25|$|On Monday, September 25, 2017 the {{blacksmith}} shop, built prior to 1927, and the granary building, built prior to 1927 and addition 1935 {{burned to the}} ground and days before that the milk house 1932 {{burned to the ground}} at historic Sahuaro Ranch. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> lost of important historical assets for the community. The park was closed on September 26, 2017 to allow for an investigation of the fires. The park has open up on September 27, 2017. The Glendale Arizona Historical Society stands ready to help and assist the City of Glendale in the investgation, rebuilding and remembrance of these historical resources.|$|E
500|$|New York Times {{columnist}} Nicolas Kristof {{described the}} raid as [...] "brutal repression" [...] {{that is usually}} [...] "confined to remote and backward nations" [...] and referred to the government's version of events as [...] "preposterous" [...] and expressed his sadness over the events. Fareed Zakaria, CNNs international affairs analyst, said that the crackdown on the protesters was a [...] "rash move that will enrage many of its people and cost the regime international prestige. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> mistake and they will pay a heavy price for it. The regime in Bahrain is doing something very rash and unwise; {{it is trying to}} respond by using force and punitive measures. This {{is not going to work}} in the end." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Some People" [...] {{received}} {{adequate to}} good reviews. Gonzalez missed Kurt's usual charisma and thought the performance [...] "a bit lackluster", and Benigno called it [...] "kind of a boring cover". It received their lowest grades of the show, [...] "B" [...] and [...] "B−", respectively. Kubicek stated, [...] "Kurt {{has a unique}} voice that sounds positively beautiful with the right melodic song, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> song for his style", and Vanity Fair Brett Berk added, after he gave it two out of five stars, that it was [...] "not the best showcase of Kurt's talents". Futterman and Reiter referred approvingly to Kurt's [...] "upper register", and both Reiter and Respers France said he [...] "ripped it" [...] on his song.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> blow to poor Linda. [...] "But I don't {{like doing}} it," [...] she answered. [...] "It wasn't my fault. I did not bid him come." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> blow. I {{looked away}} appealingly. 'Harold,' I cried in despair, 'do {{you think we}} could manage to hide {{ourselves}} safely anywhere in Scotland for twenty-one days?' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> question. Bartley {{knew nothing}} about the prices that city papers paid; he feared to ask too much, but he also feared to cheapen his wares by asking too little. [...] "Twenty-five dollars," [...] he said, huskily.|$|R
500|$|Tahil's casting was {{considered}} to be controversial, and was slammed by British Asian actors who said the part should have been given to a UK actor, referring to it as [...] "disgraceful". Actors Albert Moses and Renu Setna complained that home-grown talent was being overlooked, with Moses saying, [...] "British Asian actors have been fighting {{for the last five years}} to persuade the BBC to bring an Asian family into EastEnders and when at last it happens it goes to Bollywood. It is a disgrace and an insult to British Asian actors. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> thing for the BBC to do. It should be ashamed." [...] Setna said: [...] "I have heard that for this storyline the BBC has brought over a Bollywood star to play the father. Why, when we have excellent Asian actors of our own?" [...] British immigration laws state that nationals from outside the European Union should not replace resident actors capable of doing the same work. A spokesperson for the BBC responded: [...] "After due consideration, Dalip was deemed to be the most appropriate actor for the job." [...] Additionally, it was suggested that Madhur Jaffrey was miscast in the role of Dan's wife Pushpa.|$|E
2500|$|Aylor {{issued the}} {{following}} statement on his official website [...] "Today, I withdrew my representation of Michael Slager. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> tragedy that has impacted our community." ...|$|E
2500|$|Governor Rick Snyder {{traveled}} to the courthouse the evening of July 11 for a press conference, during which he stated, [...] "This is a particularly tough time for law enforcement. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> event to have happen, {{and we need to}} rally together." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> task; but {{the queen}} had such just {{confidence}} in her Prigio that she soon dried her tears, remarking that Heaven would not desert Jaqueline, {{and that the}} king {{would find a way}} out of the trouble.|$|R
50|$|The Uesugi forces burned much of {{the city}} to the ground, {{including}} Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> psychological loss for the Hōjō, since the earlier Hōjō clan, from which they took their name, had suffered their final defeat at the same location in 1333.|$|R
60|$|All <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> {{trial to}} Turenne, who was deeply {{attached}} to his brother, and who mourned not only the danger he had incurred, but {{that he should have}} broken his engagements, and while commanding a royal army should have plotted against the royal authority.|$|R
2500|$|In Valve's early days, the company's {{structure}} {{was similar to}} other development firms; this was principally driven {{by the nature of}} physical game releases through publishers that required tasks to be completed by given deadlines, requiring a more regimented structure. As the company moved to digital releases where they serve as their own publisher, the company structure has become more as a flat organization. Valve published their employee handbook to the public in 2012, demonstrating at that time that outside of executive management, there were no bosses, and the company used an open allocation system, allowing employees to move between departments at will. This approach allows employees to work on whatever interests them, but requires them to take ownership of their product and mistakes they may make, according to Newell. Newell recognized that this structure works well for some but that [...] "there are plenty of great developers for whom <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> place to work".|$|E
2500|$|With 10:38 {{left in the}} game, USC faced a 3rd and 7 {{from its}} own 36-yard line. Trojan quarterback Toby Page, who had {{replaced}} an ineffective Steve Sogge, called a pass play, then saw the Bruin linebackers drop back into pass coverage. He changed the signals before the snap, calling an audible ("23 blast"), and handed off to Simpson. Simpson would later recall standing in his halfback position, hearing the audible and thinking to himself [...] "Toby, it's 3rd and 7; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> call." [...] Simpson veered to the left sideline, got a key block from fullback Dan Scott, and then cut {{back to the middle}} to run 64 yards for a touchdown. Rikki Aldridge kicked the extra point, and the Trojans led, 21–20. John McKay stated, [...] "I believe it was the most exciting college run I've ever seen." [...] By now Beban could barely move or breathe, and UCLA never crossed midfield again as USC won.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your Excellencies," [...] he said--he spoke an English {{that was}} smooth and fluent for all its foreign accent [...] "Your Excellencies, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> affair." ...|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after this}} the snow fell thicker than ever, {{and it became}} evident that an unusually early winter was about to set in among the mountains. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> calamity, for, if the regular snow of winter set in, it would be {{impossible}} for him either to advance or retreat.|$|R
50|$|A few local {{rallies and}} forest grouts {{in the early}} 90’s saw some success, but {{unfortunately}} for Mark rallying was getting pretty expensive. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> blow for {{him as he was}} passionate about motor sport, so he looked for another way to continue this passion, which led him to the modified car scene.|$|R
6000|$|The attendant, who <b>was</b> shaking like <b>a</b> leaf, obeyed. The station-master {{turned away}} and drew a long breath. He himself <b>was</b> {{conscious}} of <b>a</b> sense of nausea, <b>a</b> giddiness which <b>was</b> almost overmastering. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> thing to face without a second's warning. He had not the slightest doubt but {{that the man who}} was seated at the table was dead! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kurt, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> {{hour for}} both of us," [...] she said, [...] "but, thank Heaven, you have confessed to me. Now I will confess to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! my dear friend, {{it is all}} over. This is a more bitter {{moment for}} you even than for me, kind friend. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> {{termination}} of all your zeal and labours.' ...|$|E
60|$|June 21.--A very wet Sunday. I {{employed}} it to good purpose, bestowing much labour on the History, ten {{pages of}} which are now finished. Were {{it not for the}} precarious health of poor Johnnie I would be most happy in this reunion with my family, but, poor child, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> drawback.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> blow to Phelps and his family. He reorganized the business, {{forming the}} Phelps Dodge Company in 1833 with his sons-in-law William Earl Dodge and Daniel James as partners. The {{two of them}} {{operated}} the firm's functions in Liverpool, England. In 1839 Phelps made his son Anson G. Phelps, Jr. a partner, with a one-eighth share of the business.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> programme, and {{involved}} an expenditure of life far beyond {{anything that had}} taken place. Grant's plan, in fact, was to fight and to keep on fighting, regardless of his own losses, until at last the Confederate army, whose losses could not be replaced, melted away. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> strategy that few generals have dared to practice, fewer still to acknowledge.|$|R
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> {{piece of}} news to poor Dick, and at first his heart fairly sank within him, but by degrees he came to be more hopeful. He {{concluded}} that if these men told lies in regard to one thing {{they would do it}} in regard to another, and perhaps they might have some strong reason for denying any knowledge of Joe and Henri.|$|R
6000|$|Apparently the {{scrutiny}} was satisfactory. The old man sat {{down as if}} relieved to be no longer alone. [...] "Eh!" [...] he said, [...] "but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> time! War and fighting, and the dead lying there--men, strong men, dying in the dark. Sons! I have three sons. God knows where they are tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear, my dear! <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> thing. There is {{not such}} another ne'er-do-well in all Nuremberg as Ludovic Valcarm. Support a wife! He cannot support himself. And it will be well {{if he does not}} die in a jail. Oh dear! oh dear! For your father's sake, fraulein--for your father's sake, I would go any {{distance}} to save you from this. Your father was a good man, and a credit to the city. And Peter Steinmarc is a good man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 5. Now {{also want}} {{will come up}} against him; he will come up like an armed man. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> army to him that is graceless in heart, and fruitless in life. This WANT will {{continually}} cry in thine ears, Here is a new birth wanting, a new heart, and a new spirit wanting; here is faith wanting; here is love and repentance wanting; here is the fear of God wanting, and a good conversation wanting: 'Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting' (Dan 5:27).|$|E
5|$|Part of the {{conflict}} between Team Bondi and Rockstar was due to Rockstar's frustration with Team Bondi's direction, and eventually Team Bondi's management in turn resented Rockstar for taking lots of creative control. It's also worth pointing out that Rockstar used to be very keen on making Team Bondi something like 'Rockstar Sydney' - the more they worked with Team Bondi management, the more they {{came to understand that}} <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> idea.|$|R
50|$|Sri Aurobindo {{unexpectedly}} died on 5 December 1950. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> {{experience for}} Mirra. All the {{activities in the}} ashram were suspended for twelve days after which Mirra had to decide the future course of the ashram. Mirra decided {{to take up the}} entire work of the ashram and also to continue the integral yoga internally. The years from 1950 to 1958 were the years where she was mostly seen by her disciples.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, as {{the winds}} blew fresh at west, as before, {{we had a}} smooth sea, and we found it pretty good going before it, and so, taking our {{smallest}} canoe in tow, we stood in for the shore with all the sail we could make. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> adventure, for, if the least gust of wind had come, we had been all lost, our canoes being deep and in no condition to make way in a high sea.|$|R
60|$|The {{assembly}} he justly commends for {{the bright}} {{appearance of the}} beauties; but with a sting in the tail of this compliment, where he says they seldom end without some considerable match or intrigue; and yet he owns that during the fair these assemblies are held every night. Now that these fine ladies go intriguing every night, and that too after the comedy is done, which is after the fair and raffling is over for the day, so {{that it must be}} very late. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> character for the ladies of Bury, and intimates, in short, that most of them are loose women, which is a horrid abuse upon the whole country.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mark, my dear fellow, what's all this?" [...] said he, in {{a cheery}} tone {{and with a}} {{pleasant}} face. [...] "Did not you know that I was here? I came down yesterday; landed from Hamburg only yesterday morning. How do you do, Mrs. Robarts? <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> bore, isn't it?" [...] Robarts, at the first moment, hardly knew how to speak to his old friend. He was struck dumb by the disgrace of his position; the more so as his misfortune was one which it was partly {{in the power of}} Lord Lufton to remedy. He had never yet borrowed money since he had filled a man's position, but he had had words about money with the young peer, in which he knew that his friend had wronged him; and for this double reason he was now speechless.|$|E
6000|$|Most {{people have}} had a period or periods in their lives when they have felt thus forsaken--when, having long hoped against hope, and still seen the day of {{fruition}} deferred, their hearts have truly sickened within them. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> hour, but it is often that darkest point which precedes the rise of day--that turn {{of the year when}} the icy January wind carries over the waste at once the dirge of departing winter and the prophecy of coming spring. The perishing birds, however, cannot thus understand the blast before which they shiver; and as little can the suffering soul recognize, in the climax of its affliction, the dawn of its deliverance. Yet, let whoever grieves still cling fast to love and faith in God. God will never deceive, never finally desert him. [...] "Whom He loveth, He chasteneth." [...] These words are true, and should not be forgotten.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no!" [...] said Billie. [...] "I'm {{only too}} {{glad to be}} able to do {{something}} for you, father dear. <b>This</b> noise <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> nuisance, isn't it." ...|$|R
50|$|Cleary <b>was</b> {{appointed}} <b>a</b> Liverpool Justice of the Peace in 1927. A {{member of}} the Labour Party, he contested the East Toxteth by-election, 1929 and fought the seat again at the general election later that year, performing creditably in a safe Conservative seat. In the 1931 general election Cleary fought the West Derby division of Liverpool. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> year for Labour and his Conservative opponent trounced him by over 23,000 votes. He was the councillor for Croxteth ward from 1925-1940.|$|R
60|$|We {{need not}} say that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> shock to the poor wanderer--a shock which was {{rendered}} all the more severe when he reflected that he had parted from his father in anger. In his weak condition, Will could not bear up under the blow, and, for some days, he lay in such a depressed state of mind and body that his comrades began to fear for his life. But after that he rallied, and a sudden improvement took place in his health.|$|R
