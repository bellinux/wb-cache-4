Auctions were conducted in a field setting in and around Winnipeg, Manitoba {{during the summer of}} 2006. Four hypothetical brands were developed to individually represent local/Canadian, natural, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>tender,</b> and Angus attributes, respectively. It was found that WTP was highest, approximately $ 1. 31 per 12 ounce steak, for branded steaks associated with the natural, <b>guaranteed</b> <b>tender,</b> and Angus attributes. It was further discovered that WTP is positively affected by preference for the brand name, frequency with which beef is consumed, and the male gender. Conversely, confidence in selecting beef tended to reduce WTP, while effects of age, education, and income were uncertain. It is concluded that the industry should explore opportunities to market higher value products both domestically and abroad if the cost of doing so does not exceed WTP premiums.

Assessing the quality of an input is particularly important for firms that want to move into niche markets by differentiating their products with some attribute that consumers can only assess imperfectly prior to consumption (e. g., beef tenderness or breed). The success or failure of these ventures is often dependent on whether the selling firm is seen as dependable and trustworthy by its customers.

Primary {{objectives}} {{of this research}} component were to assess {{the current state of}} fresh branded beef offerings in Canada and to determine the willingness-to-pay of Canadian consumers for such products. A second component of the research, “pricing to value in the beef supply chain”, was carried out under sub-contract by researchers at Oklahoma State University. Two reports arising from that research component, led by Dr. Clement E. Ward, are available from Canfax Research Services. An extensive investigation into the current state of branded beef offerings in Canada was undertaken.

However, the First Legal Tender Act did not make the notes an unlimited legal tender as they could not be used by merchants to pay customs duties on imports and could not be used by the government to pay interest on its bonds. The Act did provide that the notes be receivable by the government for short term deposits at 5% interest, and for the purchase of 6% interest 20-year bonds at par. The rationale for these terms was that the Union government would preserve its credit-worthiness by supporting the value of its bonds by paying their interest in gold. Early in the war, customs duties were a large part of government tax revenue and by making these payable in gold, the government would generate the coin necessary to make the interest payments on the bonds. Lastly, by making the bonds available for purchase at par in United States Notes, the value of the latter would be confirmed as well. The limitations of the legal tender status were quite controversial. Thaddeus Stevens, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee of Ways and Means, which had authored an earlier version of the Legal Tender Act that would have made United States Notes a legal tender for all debts, denounced the exceptions, calling the new bill [...] "mischievous" [...] because it made United States Notes an intentionally depreciated currency for the masses, while the banks who loaned to the government got [...] "sound money" [...] in gold.

40|$|Beef {{tenderness}} {{is one of}} {{the highest}} ranked beef quality concerns among beef packers, purveyors, restaurateurs, and retailers according to recent surveys (Smith et al.). Tenderness has been demonstrated as beef’s most important palatability attribute (Huffman et al.). Unfortunately, current USDA quality grading standards inadequately identify meat tenderness (Savell et al.). However, recent technological improvements have made it possible to effectively segregate carcasses into tenderness categories and to tenderize less tender meat (Shackelford et al.). Widespread adoption of these technologies would enable the beef industry to better provide consumers with the quality products they desire. Prior to implementing an alternative grading (or tenderization) system, more information is needed regarding the value consumers place on tenderness. This study investigated consumer willingness to pay for a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>tender</b> steak and quantified the impact various economic and demographic factors have on consumer willingness to pay for steak with varying tenderness levels. Results demonstrate several points about consumer preferences for beef that should be considered prior to adoption of a beef production/ marketing system based upon tenderness.

40|$|Tenderness {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} reported {{as the most}} important quality aspect of meat. However, {{a number of studies have}} shown that a significant portion of retail meat can be considered tough. As a consequence, a significant consumer segment is willing to pay a premium for <b>guaranteed</b> <b>tender</b> meat. However, apart from measuring the shear force, there is no reliable method to predict tenderness. Most of the branded meat programs therefore attempt to ensure eating quality by controlling some of the factors that affect tenderness. Meat tenderness is determined by the amount and solubility of connective tissue, sarcomere shortening during rigor development, and postmortem proteolysis of myofibrillar and myofibrillar-associated proteins. Given the effect of postmortem proteolysis on the muscle ultrastructure, titin and desmin are likely key substrates that determine meat tenderness. A large number of studies have shown that the calpain proteolytic system plays a central role in postmortem proteolysis and tenderization. In skeletal muscle, the calpain system consists of at least three proteases, µ-calpain, m-calpain and calpain 3, and an inhibitor of µ- and m-calpain, calpastatin. When activated by calcium, the calpains not only degrade subtrates, but also autolyze, leading to loss of activity. m-Calpain does not autolyze in postmortem muscle and is therefore not involved in postmortem tenderization. Results from a number of studies, including a study on calpain 3 knockout mice, have shown that calpain 3 is also not involved in postmortem proteolysis. However, a large number of studies, including a study on µ-calpain knockout mice, have shown that l-calpain is largely, if not solely, responsible for postmortem tenderization. Research efforts in this area should, therefore, focus on elucidation of regulation of lcalpain activity in postmortem muscle. Discovering the mechanisms of µ-calpain activity regulation and methods to promote µ-calpain activity should have a dramatic effect on the ability of researchers to develop reliable methods to predict meat tenderness and on the meat industry to produce a consistently tender product...|$|R
40|$|December 2013. ""A thesis {{presented}} to the Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri [...] Columbia In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Master of Science. "Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Carol L. Lorenzen. Tenderness {{has been identified as}} one of the most important attributes for consumers concerning their meat quality desire, so there is a clear need to accurately determine and grade meat accordingly to tenderness. A tenderness grading system has been proposed to be used to segregate carcasses in order to provide a more consistent prediction of eating quality to the consumers and also enable more carcasses to be segregated into the highest USDA quality grade and categorized as <b>guaranteed</b> <b>tender.</b> Known as an endogenous specific inhibitor of calpain, an enzyme responsible for proteolysis of myofibrillar proteins during post-mortem degradation of muscle, calpastatin presence in the muscle indicates that the activity of calpain can potentially be down regulated, resulting in meat toughness. Thus tenderness can be predicted with the assessment of calpastatin activity in the meat. Independent contribution of the sarcomere length to tenderness is also well established as classic scientific works have demonstrated that muscles with longer sarcomere lengths have lower resistance to shear force. Previous research have been done using enzymatic biosensor to predict calpastatin activity, this being a faster method compared to the traditional method, but the previous biosensor research might have been detecting fragments of inactive calpastatin. Hence more research was necessary in order to determine the rate of calpastatin degradation in samples, comparing quantity versus activity of calpastatin. In order to investigate the degradation of calpastatin mechanism and its activity an experiment was conducted using three different methodologies to measure calpastatin activity or quantity over a period of 180 total days. Longissimus dorsi samples from between the 12 th and 13 th rib of the beef carcass (n = 12) were extracted at 0 hour postmortem. These samples were assayed for calpastatin by the traditional method at day 0, and then kept under refrigeration until day 90 and day 180, when the same traditional assay was performed.

40|$|Tenderness {{is such an}} {{important}} quality of beef that consumers {{are willing to pay}} more for beef that is <b>guaranteed</b> <b>tender.</b> Although advancements have been made in producing a tender product, tenderness of retail cuts remains variable. Zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) is a feed additive that is fed for 21 d prior to slaughter to increase muscle size; unfortunately, it often results in tougher beef cuts. Vitamin D 3 can improve beef tenderness when it is fed to steers in amounts greater than 1 × 106 IU for 4 to 14 d prior to slaughter. The hypothesis for this thesis was that feeding 250, 000 IU for 165 d (long-term D) or 5 × 106 IU vitamin D 3 for 10 days (short-term D) prior to slaughter would improve tenderness of steaks from steers fed ZH for 21 d. To test this hypothesis 210 steers were allotted to 6 treatments (35 steers per treatment) : no supplemental vitamin D 3 (ND) with no ZH (NDNZ), ND with ZH (NDZ), 250, 000 IU vitamin D 3 fed for 165 d (LD) with no ZH (LDNZ), LD with ZH (LDZ), or 5 x 106 IU vitamin D 3 fed for 10 days (SD) with no ZH (SDNZ) or with ZH (SDZ). Carcass weights, dressing percent, and LM area were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 02) whereas, marbling scores, fat thickness, and yield grade were lower (P 3 ̆c 0. 03) for ZH steers compared with no-ZH (NZ) steers. Steaks from ZH treated steers were tougher than steaks from NZ steers when aged for 7, 14, or 21 d (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Final BW and fat thickness decreased in SDNZ steers compared to NDNZ steers (P 3 ̆c 0. 03). Vitamin D 3 supplementation did not improve beef tenderness and tended to increase toughness in steaks aged 21 d post-mortem when LDZ was compared with NDZ (P = 0. 06). Short-term D increased plasma total and ionic calcium (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and increased vitamin D metabolites in muscle, liver, and kidney. However, SD did not increase tissue total calcium (P = 0. 17). Short-term D did increase tissue ionic calcium when ZH was not fed (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Tissue ionic calcium was higher in LDNZ steers than NDNZ steers, but was lower in LDZ steers compared to NDZ steers (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Steers fed ZH had decreased expression of Mhy 1 and 2 a muscle fibers compared with NZ steers (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Expression of Mhy 2 a increased in SDNZ steers compared to NDNZ steers (P 3 ̆c 0. 03). Vitamin D 3 treatment did not alter calpain, calpastatin, or PPAR mRNA expression. However, ZH tended to decrease calpain mRNA expression (P 3 ̆c 0. 09). In conclusion, feeding ZH improved feedlot performance and improved yield grades, but resulted in lower marbling scores and tougher steaks, possibly because of a change in muscle fiber type and decreased calpain expression. Furthermore, vitamin D 3 did not improve tenderness, which could be the result of calcium not increasing in the muscle of steers fed ZH and steaks from steers not fed ZH being too tender to detect a significant improvement. ...|$|R
