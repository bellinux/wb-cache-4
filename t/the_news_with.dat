She reveals Rajan's extramarital affair with a dancer named Ambujam, who is pregnant with his child. As Rajan treated <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>with</b> a reckless attitude, Hema suggests that Ambujam could have killed him. When questioned, Ambujam accuses Chinnaiah of murdering Rajan, saying that Chinnaiah was her foster father and wanted her {{to stay away from}} Rajan after the three met during a picnic.

Pocahontas, having been moved by Smith’s nobility, says she will not allow Smith to be killed unless she herself dies with him. This persuades Powhatan to free Smith. Soon, Percy and Rolfe encounter Smith and his Indian allies {{on the way back to}} the settlement, and Rolfe is immediately struck by Pocahontas, whose manner suggests the attraction is mutual. They speak of love, but Rolfe must soon depart with Smith. Pocahontas confesses her love for Rolfe to Miami, who receives <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>with</b> anger, jealousy and rage. Pocahontas convinces her father to dissolve her arranged engagement with Miami, which will mean war between their two tribes.|$|E

5|$|Amésqueta left Mopán {{three days}} after Díaz and {{followed}} Díaz’s trail to the lakeshore. He arrived at the lake over a week later with 36 men. As they scouted along the south shore near Nojpetén they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. Amésqueta was extremely suspicious of the small canoes being offered by the Itza to transport his party across to Nojpetén; as nightfall approached Amésqueta retreated from the lakeshore and his men took up positions on a small hill nearby. In {{the early hours of}} the morning he ordered a retreat by moonlight. At San Pedro Martír he received news of an Itza embassy to Mérida in December 1695, and an apparent formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>with</b> the loss of his men, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned his unfinished fort and retreated to Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} weeks scouts were {{sent out to}} try to make contact with local Mopan and Ch'ol communities, including Chok Ajaw, AjMay, IxB'ol and Manche without success – most of the natives had fled, leaving the forest deserted. At San Pedro Mártir he received news of AjChan's embassy to Mérida in December 1695 and the formal surrender of the Itza to Spanish authority. Unable to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>with</b> the loss of his men at Lake Petén Itzá, and with appalling conditions in San Pedro Mártir, Amésqueta abandoned the unfinished fort. Friar Cano recommended to the new Guatemalan president that the Ch'ol be moved to Verapaz where they could be properly administered. As a result of the failed expedition, Cano's recommendation was accepted, the fort was dismantled and any Maya that could be captured across a wide swathe of southern Petén was forcibly relocated to Belén near Rabinal in Verapaz. This relocation was brutal and ruthless and was condemned by several high-ranking colonial officials, including oidor José de Escals and even by Amésqueta.|$|E

Magazines including Time published commemorative editions. A scene that had featured Jackson's sister La Toya was cut from the film Brüno out of respect toward Jackson's family.|$|E

25|$|Low {{concentrations}} of dioxins existed in nature prior to industrialization {{as a result}} of natural combustion and geological processes. Dioxins were first unintentionally produced as by-products from 1848 onwards as Leblanc process plants started operating in Germany. The first intentional synthesis of chlorinated dibenzodioxin was in 1872. Today, {{concentrations of}} dioxins are found in all humans, with higher levels commonly found in persons living in more industrialized countries. The most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), became well known as a contaminant of Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. Later, dioxins were found in Times Beach, Missouri and Love Canal, New York and Seveso, Italy. More recently, dioxins have been in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>with</b> the poisoning of President Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine in 2004, the Naples Mozzarella Crisis the 2008 Irish pork crisis, and the German feed incident of 2010.|$|E
25|$|Justinian then {{targeted}} {{his former}} place of exile in the Crimea. There his brother-in-law, the Khagan, had infringed on Imperial territory {{by establishing a}} Khazar governor of his own to run Cherson. Upon arriving there, the expedition set about doing its work— countless citizens were drowned (apparently with weights attached) and seven were roasted alive. The Tudun, the governor appointed by the Khagan was sent to Constantinople with 30 others. However, a storm destroyed his army and his fleet when he ordered it to return. Justinian {{is said to have}} greeted <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>with</b> great laughter. Another fleet was sent but the arrival of the Khagan's army made Justinian reconsider his move to a more diplomatic one. He decided to send the Tudun back to the Khagan with his apologies and had George of Syria to present the Imperial apology. The citizens of Cherson were naturally in no mood to hear any apology after what Justinian had done. When the Tudun died along the way, the Khazars took it upon themselves to send his 300-strong escort to the afterlife with him.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{to their}} homestand against the Colorado Rockies, Dodger manager Joe Torre {{announced}} {{his intention to}} retire {{at the end of}} the season and that Don Mattingly would take over as the Manager for the 2011 season. The Dodgers followed <b>the</b> <b>news</b> <b>with</b> a 7–5 loss to the Rockies. Relief pitcher Octavio Dotel switched dugouts prior to the second game as the Dodgers traded him to the Rockies for a player to be named later. The Dodgers then proceeded to be blown out 12–2 as Troy Tulowitzki slugged two homers and Melvin Mora hit a grand slam, while John Ely was roughed up in the loss. The Dodgers fell behind 6–1 in the series finale, but came back to send the game into extra innings, finally winning the game 7–6 on a walk-off hit by A. J. Ellis in the 11th inning. The Dodgers two-year stay as National League Western Division champions came to an end on September 21 when they were officially eliminated from post-season contention when the Giants beat the Cubs. The Dodgers then proceeded to be shut out by the Padres 6–0, the first career shutout for Padres starter Clayton Richard and the 17th time the Dodgers had been shut out in 2010, the most in the league and their highest total since 1989. In the next game, Ted Lilly struck out eight in seven innings, but the Dodgers managed just three hits in a 3–1 defeat. The Dodgers avoided being swept at home due to Hiroki Kuroda's eight-inning, one-run performance in the Dodgers' 3–1 win over the Padres.|$|E

Although it supported Britain, the Company was concerned about the possible financial implications for its chartered territory should it make direct commitments to the war effort, particularly at first, so most of the colony's contribution to the war was made by Southern Rhodesians individually—not only those who volunteered to fight abroad, but also those who remained at home and raised funds to donate food, equipment and other supplies.|$|E
