5|$|As a youth, Berkman was {{influenced}} by the growing radicalism that was spreading among workers in the Russian capital. A wave of political assassinations culminated in a bomb blast that killed Tsar Alexander II in 1881. While his parents worried—correctly, as it turned out—that the tsar's death might result in repression of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> other minorities, Berkman became intrigued by the radical ideas of the day, including populism and nihilism. He became very upset when his favorite uncle, his mother's brother Mark Natanson, was sentenced to death for revolutionary activities.|$|E

Emicho's army eventually continued into Hungary but was defeated by the army of Coloman of Hungary. His followers dispersed; some eventually joined the main armies, although Emicho himself went home.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka.

Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E

Nebe wanted to include sending Berlin's Gypsies to the planned reservations for <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> others in the east.

5|$|Legalized {{discrimination}} against Jews in Germany began {{immediately after the}} Nazi seizure of power in January 1933.

5|$|Miller {{was born}} Rudolph Muller in the Moravian city of Kroměřížthen known as Kremsier in Austria-Hungaryon 2 September 1899. Little {{is known about}} his earlier life, but he started working as an actor in Vienna in 1921, and spent his early years as an actor mainly in theatre and cabaret in Austria and Czechoslovakia. He {{was a member of}} the Jewish League of Culture in Berlin in 1938–39. At the {{outbreak}} of World War II he fled Austria to escape the persecution of <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> arrived in London in March 1939 to pursue a career in the British theatre and film industry.

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{migration}} and evolution {{of the practice of}} circumcision is followed mainly through the cultures and peoples in two separate regions. In the lands south and east of the Mediterranean, starting with Sudan and Ethiopia, the procedure was practiced by the ancient Egyptians and the Semites, and then by <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> Muslims, with whom the practice travelled to and was adopted by the Bantu Africans. In Oceania, circumcision is practiced by the Australian Aborigines and Polynesians. There is also evidence that circumcision was practiced among the Aztec and Mayan civilizations in the Americas, but little detail is available about its history.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a common}} belief among the Poles that most Jews were Bolsheviks and Communists, in league with the enemy of the Polish state, Soviet Russia. The Polish army stated that any Jews it killed were militants and {{collaborators}} engaged in actions against the Polish army. Having been fired at from Jewish homes, Polish soldiers took this {{as an excuse to}} break into many Jewish homes and stores, beating <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> robbing them, desecrating synagogues, arresting hundreds, depriving them of food and drink for days and deporting them from the city; such abuses were, however, not supported by – and even specifically forbidden by – the Polish high command.|$|E

5|$|With half {{a million}} burghers in the Commonwealth now {{substantially}} enfranchised, political power became more equally distributed, but little was done about the less politically conscious and active classes, such as <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> peasants. Although ArticleIV placed the Commonwealth's peasantry {{under the protection of}} the national lawa first step toward enfranchising the country's largest and most oppressed social classthe low status of the peasantry as compared to other classes was not eliminated, as the constitution did not abolish serfdom. Not until the Second Partition and Kościuszko's Proclamation of Połaniec in 1794 would the Polish government begin to abolish serfdom.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew {{has been}} written {{with a number of}} {{different}} writing systems. The Hebrews adopted the Phoenician alphabet around the 12th centuryBCE, which developed into the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet. This was retained by the Samaritans, who use the descendent Samaritan alphabet to this day. However, the Aramaic alphabet gradually displaced the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet for <b>the</b> <b>Jews,</b> <b>and</b> it became the source for the modern Hebrew alphabet. All of these scripts were lacking letters to represent all of the sounds of Biblical Hebrew, though these sounds are reflected in Greek and Latin transcriptions/translations of the time. These scripts originally only indicated consonants, but certain letters, known by the Latin term matres lectionis, became increasingly used to mark vowels. In the Middle Ages, various systems of diacritics were developed to mark the vowels in Hebrew manuscripts; of these, only the Tiberian vocalization is still in wide use.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, {{as part of}} his {{preparations}} for war, Hitler ended the German alliance with China, and entered into an agreement with the more modern Japan. That same year, Austria was unified with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss, and the Munich Agreement gave Nazi Germany control over the Sudetenland, part of Czechoslovakia. Hitler's primary motivations for war included obtaining additional Lebensraum ("living space") for the Germanic peoples, who were considered racially superior according to Nazi ideology. A second goal was the elimination of those considered racially inferior, particularly <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> Slavs, from territories controlled by the Reich. From 1933 to 1938, hundreds of thousands of Jews emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries. Some converted to Christianity.|$|E

In September, Louis visited Cracow to attend the large {{congress}} where Peter I of Cyprus attempted to persuade a dozen European monarchs to join the crusade. Louis was the only monarch to promise assistance, but later failed to fulfill his promise. At the congress, Casimir III of Poland confirmed Louis's right to succeed him in Poland if he died without a male issue. Louis, who had not fathered a son either, invited a distant relative of his, Charles of Durazzo, to Hungary in 1364, but did not make the young prince his official heir. Louis allowed the Jews to return to Hungary in the same year; legal proceedings between <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> those who had seized their houses lasted for years.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939. German {{dictator}} Adolf Hitler {{ordered that}} the Polish leadership and intelligentsia be destroyed. Approximately 65,000 civilians, who {{were viewed as}} being inferior to the Aryan master race, {{were killed by the}} end of 1939. In addition to leaders of Polish society, the Nazis killed Jews, prostitutes, Romani, and the mentally ill. SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich, then head of the Gestapo, ordered on 21 September that Polish Jews should be rounded up and concentrated into cities with good rail links. Initially the intention was to deport the Jews to points further east, or possibly to Madagascar. Two years later, in an attempt to obtain new territory, Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, intending to deport or kill <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> Slavs living there.|$|E
5|$|The Jews of England were {{considered}} {{the property of}} the Crown, and they had traditionally been used as a source of cheap loans and easy taxation, in exchange for royal protection against antisemitism. The Jews had suffered considerable oppression during the First Barons' War, but during Henry's early years the community had flourished and {{became one of the most}} prosperous in Europe. This was primarily the result of the stance taken by the regency government, which took a range of measures to protect <b>the</b> <b>Jews</b> <b>and</b> encourage lending. This was driven by financial self-interest, as they stood to profit considerably from a strong Jewish community in England. Their policy ran counter to the instructions being sent from the Pope, who had laid out strong anti-Jewish measures at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215; William Marshal continued with his policy despite complaints from the Church.|$|E
