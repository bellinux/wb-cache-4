5|$|The main themes {{expressed}} in the collection include how an individual's worldview (Weltanschauung) affects their actions and the attitudes of <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> the philosophy of social determinism, and why a lack of personal responsibility for one's actions results from an individual's beliefs in determinism. The writing style that Dalrymple explains these in was praised by reviewers for its clear, witty prose and for going immediately to the truth and heart of any matter that is being discussed.|$|E
5|$|Part {{of the new}} {{genre of}} the Romantic travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors {{demonstrate}} their desire to {{develop a sense of}} taste and distinguish themselves from <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical politics to nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise of Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman.|$|E
5|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} of {{the individual}} power that lies inside every person, their ability to be their own hero. According to author Carol K. Ingall, the song inspires anyone to be a hero. Ingall continued how due to a hero's power to transform and inspire <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> so too every person has inside of them the light and force needed to help change the world. Similarly, author Darlene Wade connects the song's lyrical content to the power within the soul, however also with the inclusion of God.|$|E
50|$|Student social {{responsibility}} {{is the responsibility}} of every student for their actions. It is morally binding, and suggests that each individual act {{in such a way that}} minimizes the adverse effect on <b>those</b> immediately <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
60|$|By himself stood {{an officer}} in a uniform differing from all around him. His figure was small, his eye restless, quick, and piercing, and bent on those shores {{to which he was}} unwillingly advancing, with a look of anxiety and mortification, that showed him the late {{commander}} of <b>those</b> vessels <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> which, by displaying their double flags, manifested to the eye of the seaman a recent change of masters.|$|R
60|$|It is of this Abbey {{and this}} Nunnery and of <b>those</b> who dwelt <b>around</b> <b>them</b> {{in a day}} bygone, and {{especially}} of that fair and persecuted woman who {{came to be known}} as the Lady of Blossholme, that our story has to tell.|$|R
5|$|They soon {{learn that}} the king of Pedda and Roget's {{childhood}} friend, Inath, has been driven mad and is launching Operation Psi {{with the aim of}} taking over the world. Roget and Yerchael journey to the other nations in order to help stop the Peddan army. They join forces with the rulers and warriors of several countries, including the defeated Amazons of Laurent, the rebels of Nevarla, which has allied itself with Pedda, and the warriors of Valsena and Altena. As they fight the Peddan army, they discover that Inath is installing Black Mirrors in the conquered kingdoms, which are corrupting <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> Roget and Yurchael are joined in their quest by the elemental spirits, which are concerned about the mirrors. After confronting Roget's twin brother, the Mirage Bishop, they discover that Inath and the Mirage Bishop have been corrupted by the ancient witch Anise, who is planting the mirrors in order to summon a dark energy for her own power.|$|E
5|$|There {{was little}} warning in New Richmond. The tornado was {{completely}} illuminated by lightning, {{but it was}} visible {{for only a few}} minutes before it reached the town, as the view was largely obstructed by buildings and large trees. Initially, several of the town's residents recalled hearing a faint rumble in the distance which many mistook for the sound of a passing train. Before long the tornado became more visible, and those who did come to realize the danger approaching began to alert <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> and panic ensued in the streets as people scrambled to take shelter. Despite the best efforts of the storm's early spotters, a great many of the town's residents were not fully aware of the oncoming storm until it was almost upon them. Shortly after 6 PM, the tornado tore into the southwest corner of the city. This neighborhood was where many of the town's wealthiest and most influential residents lived, many of them having first come to the area as pioneers from New England in the 1850s. They included the owners of some of New Richmond's most prominent businesses, residing in stately homes built in styles derived from those seen back east. Within a few moments, as many as fifty homes were leveled in this area.|$|E
25|$|Civil {{inattention}} {{is defined}} as the polite way to manage interaction with strangers by not engaging in any interpersonal communication or needing to respond to a stranger’s touch. Goffman uses an elevator study to explain this phenomenon. It is uncommon for people to look at, talk to, or touch the person next to them. While it may be so crowded that they 'touch' another person, they will often maintain an expressionless demeanor so not to affect <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
50|$|In November 2016, a {{case was}} {{reported}} in Kisii town, Kenya. It is alleged that the two lovers engaged in extramarital sex in a lodging in the town. The story was captured once the lady cried out for help, attracting the attention of <b>those</b> <b>around</b> prompting <b>them</b> to intervene. They were carried to a witch-doctor who {{is alleged to have}} managed to separate them by performing rituals. The story was by authentic media stations in the country.|$|R
50|$|Over easy or over light: Cooked on both sides; the yolk is runny and the {{egg white}} is fully cooked. Eggs fried over easy are also {{commonly}} referred to as dippy eggs or dip eggs by Marylanders, by Pennsylvania Dutch people living in central Pennsylvania, by <b>those</b> living <b>around</b> <b>them</b> as well as in parts of Ohio, mainly due to the practice of dipping toast into the yolk while eating. This term is also occasionally used in Canada.|$|R
50|$|Coal mining in {{the area}} ceased in the 1980s but some {{remnants}} from the industry are visible {{in the area}}, including winding wheel relics at Bullcroft. Demographic evidence of the former mining community is also evident in both higher than average levels of unemployment, and {{a strong sense of}} community with residents knowing their neighbours and <b>those</b> that live <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
25|$|A typical {{chest x-ray}} {{delivers}} 0.02mSv (2 mrem) of effective dose. A dental x-ray delivers {{a dose of}} 5 to 10 µSv. A CT scan delivers an effective dose to the whole body ranging from 1 to 20 mSv (100 to 2000 mrem). The average American receives about 3mSv of diagnostic medical dose per year; countries with the lowest levels of health care receive almost none. Radiation treatment for various diseases also accounts for some dose, both in individuals and in <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|Herd {{immunity}} also decreases risk {{to people}} who have a compromised immune system. Some people who have a compromised immune system cannot get certain vaccines and thus are at increased risk if <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> are not vaccinated for those diseases. If the immunocompromised person is surrounded by people who have not been vaccinated and have the disease, that person will likely contract the disease. The outcome for people with compromised immune systems who subsequently get infected is often worse than that of the general population. Herd immunity decreases this risk.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of this social and {{political}} change, hunter-gatherer egalitarianism is established. As children grow up, they are motivated by <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> to reverse perspective, engaging with other minds on the model of their own. Selection pressures favour such psychological innovations as imaginative empathy, joint attention, moral judgment, project-oriented collaboration and the ability to evaluate one's own behaviour from the standpoint of others. Underpinning enhanced probabilities of cultural transmission and cumulative cultural evolution, these developments culminate in the establishment of hunter-gatherer-style egalitarianism in association with intersubjective communication and cognition. It is in this social and political context that language evolves.|$|E
40|$|Since {{at least}} Veblen’s (1899) classic work on {{conspicuous}} consumption, economists {{and social scientists}} have recognized that social comparisons can influence individual decisions. People compare their consumption, their income, and their belongings to <b>those</b> of people <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> and they strive to maintain their position within their community.

5000|$|Pynchon devotes a {{significant}} part of the book to a [...] "play within a play", a detailed description of a performance of an imaginary Jacobean revenge play, involving intrigues between Thurn und Taxis and Trystero. Like [...] "The Mousetrap", based on [...] "The Murder of Gonzago" [...] that Shakespeare placed within Hamlet, the events and atmosphere of The Courier's Tragedy (by the fictional Richard Wharfinger) mirror <b>those</b> transpiring <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> In many aspects it resembles a typical revenge play, such as The Spanish Tragedy by Thomas Kyd, Hamlet by William Shakespeare and plays by John Webster and Cyril Tourneur.|$|R
2500|$|Dissociation {{can occur}} during the assault. [...] Memories may be {{fragmented}} especially immediately afterwards. They may consolidate {{with time and}} sleep. [...] A man or boy who is raped may be stimulated and even ejaculate during {{the experience of the}} rape. A woman or girl may orgasm during a sexual assault. This may become a source of shame and confusion for those assaulted along with <b>those</b> who were <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
25|$|Inoculation {{was already}} a {{standard}} practice, but involved serious risks; among which included the fear that those inoculated would then transfer the disease to <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> due to their becoming carriers of the disease. In 1721, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu had imported variolation to Britain after having observed it in Constantinople. Voltaire wrote {{that at this time}} 60% of the population caught smallpox and 20% of the population died of it. Voltaire also states that the Circassians used the inoculation from times immemorial, and the custom may have been borrowed by the Turks from the Circassians.|$|E
25|$|Dispensability in a {{group is}} {{described}} by Price as employees who join a work group and quickly begin to measure up their skills with {{the people that they}} are assigned to work with. If they feel that their skills are inferior to <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> people tend to sit back and let the other more skilled workers carry the workload. Fairness {{in a group}} is when some group members feel that their voice is not heard in decision making because of their ethnicity, gender or other discriminatory factors. Instead of fighting for their voice to be heard many group members will decide to loaf in these circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} OCD perform {{compulsive}} rituals because they inexplicably {{feel they have}} to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so idiosyncratic or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> Excessive skin picking, hair-pulling, nail biting and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the obsessive–compulsive spectrum. Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled {{to follow through with}} them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{permissive}} parenting styles; indulgent and neglectful. Indulgent parents do not create proper boundaries for their children and provide them with positive reinforcement even though it is not applicable. Neglectful parents create no boundaries for their child and ignore their needs. Both indulgent and neglectful parenting styles can lead children to develop insecure attachment issues as they may feel that they cannot trust <b>those</b> who are <b>around</b> <b>them</b> to be loyal.|$|R
25|$|Herd {{immunity}} is {{an important}} supplement to vaccination. Among those individuals who receive oral polio vaccine, only 95 percent will develop immunity. That means five of every 100 given the vaccine will not develop any immunity and will be susceptible to developing polio. According to the concepts of herd immunity this population whom the vaccine fails, are still protected by the immunity of <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> Herd immunity can only be achieved when vaccination levels are high. It is estimated that 80–86 percent of individuals in a population must be immune to polio for the susceptible individuals to be protected by herd immunity. If routine immunization were stopped, the number of unvaccinated, susceptible individuals would soon exceed the capability of herd immunity to protect them.|$|E
25|$|Rogers {{described}} {{the concepts of}} congruence and incongruence as important ideas in his theory. In proposition #6, he refers to the actualizing tendency. At the same time, he recognized the need for positive regard. In a fully congruent person realizing their potential is {{not at the expense}} of experiencing positive regard. They are able to lead lives that are authentic and genuine. Incongruent individuals, in their pursuit of positive regard, lead lives that include falseness and do not realize their potential. Conditions put on them by <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> make it necessary for them to forgo their genuine, authentic lives to meet with the approval of others. They live lives that are not true to themselves, to who they are on the inside out.|$|E
25|$|Astrologically speaking, the Moon is {{associated}} with a person's emotional make-up, unconscious habits, rhythms, memories, moods and their ability to react and adapt to <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> It is also associated with the mother, maternal instincts or the urge to nurture, the home, the need for security and the past, especially early experiences and childhood. The 1st-century poet Manilius described the Moon, or Luna, as melancholic. In medicine, the Moon {{is associated}} with the digestive system, stomach, breasts, the ovaries and menstruation (which does occur on a monthly cycle) and the pancreas. Despite Manilius's assignation, the Moon is commonly associated with the phlegmatic humor; it ruled the animal spirits. In modern astrology, the Moon is the primary native ruler of the fourth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the third house.|$|E
50|$|The term cubicle {{comes from}} the Latin cubiculum, for bed chamber. It was used in English {{as early as the}} 15th century. It {{eventually}} came to be used for small chambers of all sorts, and for small rooms or study spaces with partitions which do not reach to the ceiling. Like the older carrel desk, a cubicle seeks to give a degree of privacy to the user while taking up minimal space in a large or medium-sized room. Prior to the widespread adoption of cubicles, office workers often worked at desks arranged in rows in an open room, where they were exposed to the sounds and activity of <b>those</b> working <b>around</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{need that}} drove some people aspire to a musical and social {{situation}} {{such as the}} Low Bap, was initially a matter of artistic concern and secondly on organizational survival and subsistence in the same situation. Indeed, this new word and meaning, went to {{the conscience of the}} world spontaneously, but decisive. This is primarily due to full support of the idea of Low Bap <b>those</b> who are <b>around</b> <b>them</b> through their lives, discography and artistic expression in general and the media.|$|R
50|$|His mysticism {{was of a}} {{moderate}} character; in his Bayān ghurbat al-Islām bi-wāsiṭat ṣinfayn min al-mutafaqqihah wa 'l-Mutafaqqirah min Ahl Miṣr wa 'l-Shām wa-mā yalīhumā min bilād al-a‘jām (Elucidation of the Abandonment of Islam on the Part of those who Claim to be Legal Scholars and those who Claim to be Sufis, from among the People of Egypt and Syria and <b>those</b> Foreign Lands <b>around</b> <b>them),</b> he inveighed against the religious and social abuses which he had noticed in the east. He wrote this work at an advanced age (he commenced it on 19 Muharram 916).|$|R
25|$|Some {{believe that}} those who have a high degree of {{cognitive}} impairment, such as an intellectual disability, are unable to process the loss of <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them,</b> but this is untrue, those with cognitive impairments such as an intellectual disability are able to process grief in a similar manner to those without cognitive impairment. One of the main differences between those with an intellectual disability and those without, is typically the ability to verbalize their feelings about the loss, which is why non-verbal cues and changes in behavior become so important, because these are usually signs of distress and expression of grief among this population. It is important when working with individuals with these such impairments that caregivers and family members meet them where their level of functioning is and allow them to process the loss and grief with assistance given where needed, and not to ignore the grief that these individuals undergo. An important aspect of treatment of grief for those with an intellectual disability is family involvement where possible, this can be a biological family or a family created in a group home or clinical setting. By having the family involved in an open and supporting dialogue with the individual it helps them to process. However, if the family is not properly educated on how these individuals handle loss, their involvement may not be as beneficial than those who are educated. The importance of the family unit is very crucial in a soci-cognitive approach to bereavement counseling. In this approach the individual with intellectual disability has the opportunity to see how <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them</b> handle the loss and have the opportunity to act accordingly by modeling behavior. This approach also helps the individual know that their emotions are ok and normal.|$|E
25|$|Humanitarian {{support and}} welfare were {{provided}} by various agencies, in particular the New Zealand Red Cross and the Salvation Army. Welfare Centres and support networks were established throughout the city. Government Departments, such as WINZ and Housing New Zealand established contact with {{as many people as}} possible and provided grants and assistance. Many church and community-led projects also became established. The scale of the disaster meant many people went some days without official contact, so neighbourhoods and streets were encouraged to attend to <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> Official visitation teams were organised by Civil Defence, with aim of visiting every household; the teams, which assessed homes and welfare needs, and passed on official information, included structural engineers or assessors from EQC. The primarily wilderness all-volunteer search and rescue organisation, LandSAR, deployed 530 people to the city to perform welfare checks. Over the course of a week, LandSAR teams visited 67,000 premises.|$|E
25|$|Loneliness is {{a common}} theme in Fassbinder's work, {{together}} {{with the idea that}} power becomes a determining factor in all human relationships. His characters yearn for love, but seem condemned to exert an often violent control over <b>those</b> <b>around</b> <b>them.</b> A good example is The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (Die bitteren Tränen der Petra von Kant, 1972) which was adapted by Fassbinder from his plays. The title character is a fashion designer who lives in a self-created dreamland and the action is restricted mostly to her lavish bedroom. After the failure of her second marriage, Petra falls hopelessly and obsessively in love with Karin, a cunning working-class young woman who wants a career in modeling. The model's exploitation of Petra mirrors Petra's extraordinary psychological abuse of her silent assistant, Marlene. Fassbinder portrays the slow meltdown of these relationships as inevitable, and his actresses (there are no men in the film) move in a slow, trance-like way that hints at a vast world of longing beneath the beautiful, brittle surface.|$|E

50|$|Eventually the Phoenix sacrificed {{her life}} and the real Jean Grey returned. The Phoenix ended up in Death's realm, still {{in the guise of}} Jean Grey, {{and was one of the}} few beings in this realm that were aware that they were indeed dead (Citizens in the Realm of the Dead believe that they and <b>those</b> are <b>around</b> <b>them</b> are still alive, while others who are not present are deceased). She {{eventually}} joined up with Mar-Vel's army to battle Death and her army. During this time, Scott Summers (new Mr. S, leader of the X-Men, who was assisting Mar-Vel in the land of the living) was able to establish a mental rapport with the Phoenix and kept him informed as to the goings on in the Realm of the Dead and (later) Mar-Vel's Paradise. This soon became a great aid to Reed Richards and others who were trying to determine why the mortally wounded would no longer die following Death's death.|$|R
50|$|Social {{networks}} {{provide a}} familiar example. In a social network the nodes {{of the network}} are people and the network connections (edges) are relationships or interactions between people. For any individual, social activity alternates between a local phase, in which they interact only with people they already know, and a global phase {{in which they can}} interact with a wide pool of people not previously known to them. Historically, these phases have been forced on people by constraints of time and space. People {{spend most of their time}} in a local phase and interact only with <b>those</b> immediately <b>around</b> <b>them</b> (family, neighbors, colleagues). However, intermittent activities such as parties, holidays, and conferences involve a shift into a global phase where they can interact with different people they do not know. Different processes dominate each phase. Essentially, people make new social links when in the global phase, and refine or break them (by ceasing contact) while in the local phase.|$|R
