5|$|The Soviet coaches {{blamed the}} loss on the refereeing. Bobrov complained that <b>the</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> American referees, Frank Larsen and Steve Dowling, let the Canadians {{get away with}} everything. After the game, {{the head of the}} USSR Hockey Federation, Andrei Starovoitov, charged the door of the officials' {{dressing}} room and kicked chairs over. <b>The</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> referees, scheduled to referee game four in Vancouver, were replaced by the pair who had refereed game one and game three, Gord Lee and Len Gagnon. Team Canada agreed to the request by the Soviets to change referees, apparently not aware of Starovoitov's tantrum after game two.|$|E

5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the helium-4 atom is {{identical}} with an alpha particle. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: <b>the</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> neutrons and <b>the</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another {{of any of these}} particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.|$|E

50|$|Dodecacopter is a dodecarotor {{designed}} by FYAT, {{with a total}} of twelve rotors. Dodecacopter is similar to another multirotor developed by FYAT, the FYAT Intelligent Eagle. Common feature shared by both multirotor is that the fuselage is l shaped, {{with a total of}} six arms attached, three on each side. Each arm has a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> two-blade rotors attached to its end, one above the other. Dodecacopter differs from Intelligent Eagle in the arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms. For Intelligent Eagle, all arms are arranged in almost equal distance, the angles formed between <b>the</b> first <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms with <b>the</b> central <b>pair</b> is almost equal to the angle formed between <b>the</b> last <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms with <b>the</b> central <b>pair.</b> However, for dodecacopter, the angle formed between <b>the</b> last <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms and <b>the</b> central <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms is much larger than the angle formed between <b>the</b> first <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms and <b>the</b> central <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms, so <b>the</b> last <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> arms of dodecacopter are much closer to each other.|$|R

5|$|Despite her struggles at the World Cup, Taylor {{continued}} to improve as a batsman, and in 2006, she scored 156 not out, the highest individual total in an ODI at Lord's Cricket Ground.

5|$|In early human {{embryonic}} life, {{a series of}} five branchial arches and four branchial pouches form {{that give rise to}} the human face, neck, and surrounding structures. The pouches are numbered such that the first pouch is the closest {{to the top of the}} embryo's head and the fourth is the furthest from it. The parathyroid glands originate from the interaction of the endoderm of the third and fourth pouch and neural crest mesenchyme. The position of the glands reverses during embryological life. <b>The</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> glands which is ultimately inferior develops from the third pouch with the thymus, whereas <b>the</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> glands which is ultimately superior develops from the fourth pouch. During embryological development, the thymus migrates downwards, dragging the inferior glands with it. The superior pair are not dragged downwards by the fourth pouch to the same degree. The glands are named after their final, not embryological, positions. Since the thymus's ultimate destination is in the mediastinum of the chest, it is occasionally possible to have ectopic parathyroids derived from the third pouch within the chest cavity if they fail to detach in the neck.|$|E
5|$|Introduced in HDMI 1.4, HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel (HEAC) adds a {{high-speed}} bidirectional data communication link (HEC) {{and the ability}} to send audio data upstream to the source device (ARC). HEAC utilizes two lines from the connector: the previously unused Reserved pin (called HEAC+) and the Hot Plug Detect pin (called HEAC−). If only ARC transmission is required, a single mode signal using the HEAC+ line can be used, otherwise, HEC is transmitted as a differential signal over <b>the</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> lines, and ARC as a common mode component of the pair.|$|E

2500|$|Bell's theorem is {{concerned}} with correlations {{defined in terms of}} averages taken over very many trials of the experiment. The correlation of two binary variables is usually defined in quantum physics as the average of <b>the</b> products <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> measurements. Note that this is different from the usual definition of correlation in statistics. The quantum physicist's [...] "correlation" [...] is the statistician's [...] "raw (uncentered, unnormalized) product moment". They are similar in that, with either definition, if <b>the</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> outcomes are always the same, the correlation is +1; if <b>the</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> outcomes are always opposite, the correlation is -1; and if <b>the</b> <b>pairs</b> <b>of</b> outcomes agree 50% of the time, then the correlation is 0. The correlation is related in a simple way to the probability of equal outcomes, namely it is equal to twice the probability of equal outcomes, minus one.|$|R
