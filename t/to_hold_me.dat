500|$|After {{learning}} that {{a close friend}} of hers was dealing with issues in her romantic life, Oh Land took it upon herself to write a song that had the power to liberate the friend. However, she forgot about the track until that friend reminded the singer of it nearly an entire year later. Oh Land completed recording the song and decided to include it on Earth Sick. Acknowledging the clich√©s in the pre-chorus, Michael Cragg remarked that they [...] "somehow sound enriching". The lyrics feature encouraging and helpful mantras: [...] "No heavy rain's going <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> down any more". The chorus consists of the phrase [...] "high up" [...] sung repeatedly.|$|E
500|$|... "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] is a midtempo R and hip hop ballad that [...] "mixes a soft {{beat with}} piano accompaniment." [...] Written during a {{difficult}} time in Carey's personal life, the song boasts inspirational lyrics of self-worth and achievement. The song begins with an introductory verse from Mill, followed by Ross on the second verse. Though [...] "cooing" [...] throughout the chorus, Carey's begins singing during the song's bridge and final crescendo, where she displays her whistle register. The track opens with Mill, whose verse quickly sums up {{the theme of the}} track: [...] "The only way {{to make it to the}} top is if you go and get it from the bottom ... I remember they said that it ain't my turn/ Just look at me now/ Try <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> down, but I ain't gonna stop/ 'Cause I'm gonna climb to the mountaintop." [...] During the song's chorus, Carey sings of not being able to be torn down by others and [...] "staying triumphant", before continuing: [...] "Don't let 'em ever count you out/ Realize all things are possible/ In your heart who's the greatest/ Reach for the stars/ Be all that you are." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1980, Fricke's producer, Billy Sherrill, {{noticed her}} limited success and {{realized}} the issue could be changed. Sherrill advised Fricke {{to establish an}} identity by focusing on one style, and she then began to record ballads. As a result, Fricke had a breakthrough year in 1981, when she landed two top-five hits with [...] "Down to My Last Broken Heart" [...] and [...] "I'll Need Someone <b>to</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> (When I Cry)." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "John," [...] she sobbed, [...] "I do {{not know}} what is the matter with me. I am hysterical. Don't ask me any questions. Don't talk <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Hold</b> <b>me</b> like you are doing now, and listen. I love you, John--do you understand?--I love you!" ...|$|R

2500|$|... 1998 The video <b>to</b> the <b>Hold</b> <b>Me</b> Now single {{deals with}} adult {{entertainment}} and caused {{a bit of}} a stir, eventually shown censored only on the television show Jyrki. Director Pete Riski received an honorary mention of the video at the 1998 Oulu Music Video Festival.|$|R
2500|$|On {{coming to}} office, Prescott pursued an {{integrated}} public transport policy. On 6 June 1997, he said: [...] "I will have failed if {{in five years}} time there are not...far fewer journeys by car. It's a tall order but I urge you <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> to it." [...] However, by June 2002, car traffic was up by 7%. This prompted Friends of the Earth's Tony Bosworth to say [...] "By its own test, Government transport policy has failed".|$|E
6000|$|... "Not likely. I'm {{pretty well}} tired of Prospect and I haven't got {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> here. Things'll be livelier down south." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is much, mademoiselle, much, indeed, <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> firmly at Lavedan," [...] I pursued at last. [...] "But my--my {{obligations}} {{demand of}} me that I depart." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have lost}} my balance," [...] thickly {{answered}} Mr. Lavender, whose blood was running to his head, {{which was now}} lower than his feet. [...] "Fortunately, my dog seems <b>to</b> be <b>holding</b> <b>me</b> from behind. But if someone could assist her {{it would be an}} advantage, for I fear that I am slipping." ...|$|R
60|$|She yielded--not very willingly, poor thing. But she jealously {{declined}} <b>to</b> let <b>me</b> <b>hold</b> the pen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get {{into the}} saddle," [...] said Hare, leaping astride and {{pressing}} forward over the pommel. [...] "Slip down--there! and <b>hold</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Go! Silver!" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt myself}} {{held in a}} gentle embrace, as my husband's arms used <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> when he pressed me to his breast. And that was my answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't need <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>me,</b> Tim," [...] {{retorted}} Glynn, with a smile; [...] "but don't be long about it, Phil. You {{know where}} the brandy is kept--look alive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can never}} {{ask her to}} release me. If she wishes <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> to my word I will {{do my best to}} make her a good and loving husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you forget, Paul, that Gashford {{and his men}} are here, {{and will}} {{probably}} endeavour <b>to</b> lay <b>hold</b> of <b>me.</b> I can scarce look on myself as other than an outlaw." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Wal, I reckon there ain't anythin' <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>me</b> now," [...] drawled Larry. He {{had changed}} as he spoke. He had aged. The dry humor of the cowboy, the amiable ease, were wanting.|$|E

6000|$|Then quiet {{fell upon}} the place; {{it seemed that}} even the pursued grew quiet, and I heard the rustle of a woman's dress drawing towards me.
