5|$|By the 1820s, animal {{resources}} were in {{decline in the}} area leading to increased competition among the tribes for game and for furs to sell. Collusion among the fur trading companies led to a dramatic drop in fur prices during the late 1820s causing impoverishment for many Sioux hunters. The U.S. government strongly encouraged the tribes to <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> hunting to farming, trading the woodlands for the plains.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{over at the}} start of the day, Johnson {{extracted}} sharp <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Len Hutton and Compton progressed steadily, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly.|$|E
5|$|The {{first true}} herbal printed in Britain was Richard Banckes' Herball of 1525 which, {{although}} popular in its day, was unillustrated and soon eclipsed {{by the most}} famous of the early printed herbals, Peter Treveris's Grete Herball of 1526 (derived in <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> the derivative French Grand Herbier).|$|E

5|$|During this {{stint in}} Florida, LeDuc made a scripted <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> face to heel. Garvin claimed that LeDuc was aligned with heel manager Sonny King, but LeDuc denied the claim. Garvin then showed video footage {{to prove that}} LeDuc had secret {{dealings}} with King. LeDuc responded by attacking Garvin {{in front of the}} crowd, solidifying a heel turn for LeDuc. In a storyline several months later, LeDuc and King Curtis Iaukea attacked Buddy Rogers, a veteran then working as a face. The injuries Rogers received were said to be so severe that he was forced to retire, although, in reality, Rogers had simply moved to another wrestling promotion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Scottish people, {{like most of}} Catholic Europe, were {{increasingly}} concerned with prayers for the dead, necessary to speed passage from Purgatory to Heaven. The upper nobility began to <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> patronage for monasteries to the establishing collegiate churches to pray for them, such as Lord Dummond's foundation at Innerpeffray in 1508 and Lord Fleming's re-establishment at Biggar in 1546. Those lower down in society paid for shrines, priests and masses, leading to a proliferation of altars, clergy and services within existing churches. In the burghs the primary function of craft guilds was {{to pay for the}} funerals and masses of their members. By the early sixteenth century St. Mary's in Dundee had perhaps 48 altars and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50.|$|E
5|$|Noting Laker's {{ability to}} extract {{substantial}} <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> the pitch, Yardley brought on the part-time left-arm unorthodox spin of Compton, who bowled inaccurately although with some turn. Morris struck two fours in Compton's first over to register Australia's 50 in 64 minutes. Compton's next over was more potent; he deceived Morris, who danced down the pitch {{and missed the}} ball, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. At the time, Morris was on 32 and Australia at 55/0. Laker beat Morris in the next over with an off break that spun a foot, and in the succeeding over, Hassett was dismissed by Compton with the score at 57. Compton had caught Hassett's leading edge and dived forward in his follow through to catch the ball one-handed just above the ground.|$|E

5|$|Opera as a {{dramatic}} genre originated around the <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> the 16th to the 17th centuries, {{although the word}} itself was not in use before 1650. Precursors of musical drama included pastoral plays with songs and choruses, and the madrigal comedies of the late 16th century. Monteverdi had already {{established himself as a}} leading composer of madrigals before writing his first full-length operas in the years 1606–08, {{while he was in the}} service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. These works, L'Orfeo and L'Arianna, deal respectively with the Greek myths of Orpheus and Ariadne. After a disagreement in 1612 with Vincenzo's successor, Duke Francesco Gonzaga, Monteverdi moved to Venice to take up the position of director of music at St Mark's Basilica, where he remained until his death in 1643.|$|E
5|$|At 18:42 on 10 November 1808, the {{garrison}} of a French defensive gun battery {{on the island}} of Groix saw a frigate moving rapidly westwards. As they had not been informed of any French movements at that time, the battery fired two warning shots at the ship to establish her identity. The frigate, Thétis, replied with her recognition signal and the firing stopped, but the sound had attracted the attention of HMS Amethyst, then approaching Groix from the west. Within a few minutes, Seymour's lookouts had spotted the French frigate and Amethyst immediately gave chase. Pinsum followed his orders to avoid combat and made all sail south-west, intending to escape into the Atlantic. By 21:00, Amethyst was close enough to fire her bow-chasers, small guns positioned {{at the front of the}} ship, at the French frigate and was attacked in <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> the French stern chasers. Certain that his quarry was an enemy, Seymour launched signal rockets in the hope of attracting attention from other ships of the inshore squadron that might intercept the French ship, and he received answering flashes from the north-east as Captain Sir Thomas Hardy joined the chase in HMS Triumph.|$|E
5|$|Mermaid and Loire joined {{battle at}} 07:00, and the {{artillery}} exchange became close and furious after a boarding attempt by Loire was foiled by the helmsman of the British ship. Both ships took severe damage, Mermaid knocking away {{several of her}} opponent's spars, but suffering in <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> the musketry of the soldiers still aboard the Loire. At 09:15, the French vessel lost another spar, and Newman determined to rake his opponent. As he attempted to complete this manoeuvre, a shot from Loire brought down Mermaid's mizzenmast, making her unmanageable and disabling a number of her guns. Seeing an opportunity to escape, the battered Loire disengaged, making significant distance before Newman's crew could clear {{the wreckage of the}} mast. High winds further hampered Mermaid's repair efforts by tearing away several sails and spars and drowning the ship's carpenter when he was blown overboard. By the time Mermaid was ready for action once more, Loire had escaped.|$|E

5|$|As the new {{ball was}} due {{soon after the}} start of the play, Johnson and Toshack opened the attack as Bradman saved Johnston and Miller. In his first over, Johnson {{extracted}} sharp <b>turn</b> <b>from</b> one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly. Despite this, Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day {{as soon as it was}} available. Mindful of recent events, Miller refrained from bouncers during the morning. In the overcast conditions, Miller bowled a relatively full length and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. At the other end, Johnston was also able to make the ball move sideways. Meanwhile, Compton appeared to be untroubled by the bowling. After half an hour of play, an unsuccessful appeal against the light was made as dark clouds hovered overhead. The rejection of the appeal made little difference, as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after. Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions, ending the 111-run partnership at 150/3. Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours, and as in the first innings, he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to the bat, resulting in the delivery moving through the gap into the stumps. The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff, and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery, and it again went low to second slip as in the first innings. However, this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped. It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many near-misses. He played and missed at one ball, inside edged another into his pads and edged another through the slips for two runs. Hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter, especially as he had a tendency to poke at deliveries outside his off stump, and the poor visibility further hindered him.|$|E
