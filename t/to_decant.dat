25|$|The {{tea leaves}} are {{packaged}} loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other container {{such as a}} tea chest. Some whole teas, such as rolled gunpowder tea leaves, which resist crumbling, are sometimes vacuum packed for freshness in aluminised packaging for storage and retail. The loose tea must be individually measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavor control {{at the expense of}} convenience. Strainers, tea balls, tea presses, filtered teapots, and infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a gaiwan, the lid of which is tilted <b>to</b> <b>decant</b> the tea into a different cup for consumption.|$|E

50|$|The use of skimmers in {{industrial}} applications is often required to remove oils, grease and fats prior to further treatment for environmental discharge compliance. By removing {{the top layer}} of oils, water stagnation, smell and unsightly surface scum can be reduced. Placed before an oily water treatment system an oil skimmer may give greater overall oil separation efficiency for improved discharge wastewater quality. It should be noted that all oil skimmers will pick up a percentage of water with the oil which will need <b>to</b> be <b>decanted</b> <b>to</b> obtain concentrated oil.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "cascade system" [...] is used <b>to</b> <b>decant</b> {{economically}} {{from banks}} of storage cylinders {{so that the}} maximum possible gas {{is removed from the}} bank. This involves filling a diving cylinder by decanting from the bank cylinder with the lowest pressure that is higher than the diving cylinder's pressure and then from the next higher pressure bank cylinder in succession until the diving cylinder is full. The system maximises the use of low-pressure bank gas and minimises the use of high-pressure bank gas.|$|E

50|$|It {{was created}} in 1868 by the herbalist Girolamo Varnelli. According to his recipe, the {{ingredients}} are an infusion of herbs and roots from Monti Sibillini made on wood fire, pure honey from Monti Sibillini, and alcohol. These ingredients, once blended, have <b>to</b> be <b>decanted</b> and aged for several months. Nowadays, it is still produced in the same way.|$|R

25|$|Increases in {{temperature}} when filling {{make it difficult}} <b>to</b> accurately <b>decant</b> or pump a measured quantity of gas based on pressure measurement. When cylinders are filled with gas quickly, typically in 10 to 60 minutes at a dive filling station, the gas inside gets hot, which increases {{the pressure of the}} gas relative to its mass. When the cylinder cools, the gas pressure falls resulting in a reduced volume of breathable gas available to the diver.|$|R

50|$|Decanters {{have been}} used for serving wines that are laden with sediments in the {{original}} bottle. These sediments could be the result of a very old wine or one that was not filtered or clarified during the winemaking process. In most modern winemaking, the need <b>to</b> <b>decant</b> for this purpose has been significantly reduced, because many wines no longer produce a significant amount of sediment as they age.|$|E

50|$|The {{continuing}} {{expansion of}} the school led to further occupation of the mews complex behind Cromwell Place. In the mid 1960s, there had still been horses stabled in the mews, and equine odours invaded classrooms {{on the east side}} of the site. The erection in 1984 of the Primary School building to Roeven Vardi's design, in the playground on Harrington Road, allowed the primary classes <b>to</b> be <b>decanted</b> out of their cramped conditions in Queensberry Place.|$|R
50|$|In the {{straining}} method, {{the juice}} from the strained potatoes is saved and <b>decanted</b> <b>to</b> produce :es:chuño, {{a kind of}} potato starch. The chuño can then later {{be used to make}} milcao de chuño, milcaos made with a base of potato starch.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example of}} {{decantation}} is the regeneration of used chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP <b>to</b> be <b>decanted</b> is gently mixed {{in a container}} with a compatible solvent to form a suspension. The suspension is allowed to rest {{for a period of}} time, after which the supernatant is carefully poured off. The supernatant contains the undesirable constituents of the former suspension, while the leftover sediment in the container is clean, reusable CSP. Decantation should be done directly after sedimentation.This process is also used in erected pure iron from iron ore.|$|R

50|$|In {{the same}} way as coffee, a French press can also be used in place of a tea infuser to brew loose tea. To some extent the tea will {{continue}} to steep even after the plunger is depressed, which may cause the tea remaining in the press to become bitter. It might thus be advisable <b>to</b> <b>decant</b> the tea into a serving vessel after preparation. The same French press should not be used for both tea and coffee unless thoroughly cleaned, as coffee residue will spoil the flavour of the tea.|$|E
50|$|QEC re-merged with King's College London in 1985, and the Kensington campus became {{associated}} with biomedical sciences.

50|$|The {{filtered}} wine has {{the advantage}} of being ready <b>to</b> drink without <b>decanting</b> and is usually bottled in a stoppered bottle that can be easily resealed.

A debate then starts downstairs as to who will take Hudson's place that evening as butler, with Daisy heavily pushing for her husband Edward, but Frederick believing it should be himself. Upstairs, although James favours Frederick, Georgina and Richard go for Edward, who performs his duties as butler very well. However, he nearly makes one error when he forgets <b>to</b> <b>decant</b> the claret, but Frederick reminds him to do so.|$|E
50|$|Early {{inhabitants}} of Pirnmill {{made a living}} through seasonal herring fishing or crofting, but later the village became a tourist destination, with many Clyde steamers plying between Glasgow and Campbeltown. The village was served by a small ferry boats that would be rowed out to the steamers and visitors would have <b>to</b> <b>decant</b> into the small ferry to be rowed ashore. The lasts of these local ferry men was Archibald Currie (Sunnyside) who eventually fitted a small engine {{to one of his}} boats. The steamers were stopped during the Second World War and never really reinstated. Visitors now come to the village by road.|$|E
40|$|Pre-rinsing unfertilized {{eggs with}} a baking soda {{solution}} {{is an effective}} way of countering {{the harmful effects of}} ruptured egg material on fertilization rates but there are problems when using this procedure in large scale fish culture. With large batches of eggs it is difficult <b>to</b> thoroughly <b>decant</b> the final rinse solution so precise control of the amount of baking soda at fertilization is often impossible. Excess baking soda can result in sperm dilution and reduced fertilization. We found that egg mortality increased linearly from 5 % when the sperm dilution was low, to 24 % when the volume of baking soda was equal to the egg volume at fertilization...|$|R
