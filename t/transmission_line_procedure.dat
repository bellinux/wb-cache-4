The use of the computationally most demanding part of the finite element analysis, namely a time marching process, is minimized by employing the averaging methods of Krylov– Bogoliubov and Galerkin.

40|$|The {{spectral}} analysis {{and the concept}} of input impedance are used to develop a wave propagation model for a TDR measurement system that can account for dielectric dispersion of the material and non-uniform nature of the <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> The numerical <b>procedure</b> of the wave propagation model is relatively simple and becomes a powerful tool for parametric studies, data interpretations, and inverse analyses. The dielectric permittivity, the reference characteristic impedance, and the length of each uniform section characterize a non-uniform <b>transmission</b> <b>line.</b> Results indicate that inversion of these three parameters will result in definite non-uniqueness, but uniqueness can be achieved when one of the three parameters is known. The inversion of impedance profile from TDR waveforms with known dielectric properties can be used for data interpretation of rock and soil deformation; while the inversion of dielectric spectrum from TDR waveforms with known impedance can be used to study soil dielectric properties...|$|R
