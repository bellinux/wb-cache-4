25|$|Given the definition, {{once the}} child is aware of their gender they will start to behave in gender roles that their {{same-sex}} models would normally adopt. Therefore, these individual responses become internalized and function according to the appropriate gender-role standards. The responses that individuals receive from their social group will mold their identity – becoming more feminine or masculine – and thus affect the way they view the world. Other facets of the process can also result in atypical development. Albeit, whether a child develops shared traits, cross-gender identities, or androgyny, their decision begins with the identification of a gender and the models he or she chooses to emulate. The behaviors they adopt will ultimately shape their knowledge and identity for who <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> they should behave.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{successfully}} synthesized diverse dramatic {{styles and}} {{movements in the}} belief that a play should embody a delicate balance between the individual and society, between the singular personality and the polity, and between the separate and collective elements of life. He thought himself a writer of social plays with a strong emphasis on moral problems in American society and often questioned psychological causes of behavior. He also built on the realist tradition of Henrik Ibsen in his exploration of the individual's conflict with society but also borrowed Symbolist and expressionist techniques from Bertolt Brecht and others. Some critics attempt to interpret his work from either an exclusively political or an exclusively psychological standpoint but fail to pierce the social veil that Miller creates in his work. Miller often stressed that society made his characters what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> it dictated all of their fears and choices.|$|E

2500|$|The novel centres on a young, independent, unnamed, wealthy {{traveller}} (the narrator), who {{visits a}} friend, [...] a mining engineer. They explore a natural chasm in a mine {{which has been}} exposed by an exploratory shaft. The narrator reaches {{the bottom of the}} chasm safely, but the rope breaks and his friend is killed. The narrator finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels. He befriends the first being he meets, who guides him around a city [...] that is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian architecture. The explorer meets his host's wife, two sons and daughter who learn to speak English by way of a makeshift dictionary during which the narrator unconsciously teaches them the language. His guide comes towards him, and he and his daughter, Zee, explain who <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> they function.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{looks at}} Turing’s postulations about Artificial Intelligence in his paper ‘Computing Machinery and Intelligence’, {{published}} in 1950. It notes <b>how</b> accurate <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> relevant <b>they</b> still <b>are</b> today. This paper notes the arguments and mechanisms that he suggested {{and tries to}} expand on them further. The paper however is mostly about describing the essential ingredients for building an intelligent model and the problems related with that. The discussion includes recent work by the author himself, who adds his own thoughts on the matter that come from a purely technical investigation into the problem. These <b>are</b> personal <b>and</b> quite speculative, but provide an interesting insight into the mechanisms that might be used for building an intelligent system. ...|$|R

40|$|Acknowledging that polices {{are rarely}} {{made in a}} {{rational}} manner does not prevent the researcher from wanting to understand why particular policy responses were constructed the way <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> this can impact upon implementation (Winter, 2003). This paper explores the suitability of four hypotheses developed by Winter (2003) to explain {{the impact of the}} policy formation stage on the implementation of public policy. The Drinking Water Directive (80 / 778 /EEC) and its implementation in England/Wales and the Republic of Ireland provide the background for analysis. It is concluded that the policy formation stage of the Directive did contribute to the failures and delays of implementation. In particular, failures of implementation are attributed to conflict, invalid causal theories, political symbolism, and poor attention by policy makers...|$|R
