40|$|Given {{the fact}} that bending {{rigidity}} influences {{to a great extent}} the product handle and considering that the market demands products with a soft, pleasant handle, one must pay a special attention to these characteristics and especially to the treatments that modify <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity.</b> It was found that any mechanical or thermal treatment brings modifications of <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity,</b> in terms of the fibers nature and treatment conditions. In most of the methods meant to determine <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity</b> one must measure the amount of deflection of the fibers end in constant cross-section either under t he action of the weight. The textile products are subjected to flexion, to repeated and frequent bending due to knotting and kinking during both the processing and exploitation. All these result in the appearance of stresses of various natures depending on the fibers type. The strains and fiber destruction as the result of these stresses depend on a series of factors related to the fibers composition and in termolecular and intra-molecular structure, their yarn count, elastic modulus, fiber flexibility, finishing procedures or products texture, etc. Following the performed measurements, we calculated <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity</b> for the witness samples and for thermally cured fibers; then we divided them in classes and we graphically represented their distribution in terms of <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity...</b>|$|E
40|$|We study <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity</b> {{of highly}} charged stiff polyelectrolytes, for both a single chain and many chains forming a bundle. A theory is {{developed}} {{to account for}} the interplay between competitive binding of counterions and charge correlations in softening the polyelectrolyte (PE) chains. The presence of even a small concentration of multivalent counterions leads to a dramatic reduction in <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity</b> of the chains that are nominally stiffened by the repulsion between their backbone charges. The variation of <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity</b> as a function of $f_{ 0 }$, the fraction of charged monomers on the chain, does not exhibits simple scaling behavior; it grows with increasing $f_{ 0 }$ below a critical value of $f_{ 0 }$. Beyond the critical value, however, the chain becomes softer as $f_{ 0 }$ increases. <b>The</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity</b> also exhibits intriguing dependence on the concentration of multivalent counterion $n_{ 2 }$; for highly charged PEs, <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity</b> decreases as $n_ 2 $ increases from zero, while it increases with increasing $n_{ 2 }$ beyond a certain value of $n_{ 2 }$. When polyelectrolyte chains form a $N$-loop condensate (e. g., a toroidal bundle formed by $N$ turns (winds) of the chain), the inter-loop coupling further softens the condensate, resulting in the bending free energy of the condensate that scales as $N$ for large $N$.

40|$|The {{ease with}} which a cell {{membrane}} can bend and deform is important {{for a wide range}} of biological functions. Peripheral proteins that induce curvature in membranes (e. g.

Little is known, however, about the effect of integral membrane proteins on the stiffness of a membrane (characterised by <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity,</b> Kc). We demonstrate by computer simulation that adding integral membrane proteins at physiological densities alters the stiffness of the membrane.

We find that altering the lipid composition changes <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity.</b> Adding integral membrane proteins to lipid bilayers also changes <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity,</b> whilst adding a simple peripheral membrane protein has no effect.

40|$|Bending {{rigidity}} of a charged membrane or a charged polyelectrolyte screened by monovalent counterions {{is known}} to be enhanced by electrostatic effects. We show {{that in the case of}} screening by multivalent counterions the electrostatic effects reduce <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity.</b> This inversion of the sign of the electrostatic contribution is related to the formation of two-dimensional strongly correlated liquids (SCL) of counterions at the charged surface due to strong lateral repulsion between them. When a membrane or a polyelectrolyte is bent, SCL is compressed on one side and stretched on the other so that thermodynamic properties of SCL contribute to <b>the</b> <b>bending</b> <b>rigidity.</b> Thermodynamic properties of SCL are similar to those of Wigner crystal and are anomalous in the sense that the pressure, compressibility and screening radius of SCL are negative.
