The muted reaction of the Athens Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Besides Gešovski, {{there were}} no fatalities, but several JNA {{soldiers}} were wounded. Gešovski's death sparked demonstrations in the Macedonian capital, Skopje, in June. Protesters accused Tuđman of being responsible for the murder. The Croatian Government refused to express regret for Gešovski's killing, and the Serbian media pointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Macedonian's death as proof that Tuđman's government had revived the fascist Ustaše, which controlled Croatia during World War II.|$|E

When a ship's boat was taken by native Fuegians, FitzRoy took some of them hostage. After their return to Devonport dockyard on 14 October 1830 Captain King retired.|$|E

From 18 May to 6 June 1943, the pilots received three weeks of specialized fighter pilot training for the Soviet conditions.|$|E

5|$|Byard {{began playing}} professionally on piano {{at the age}} of 16, in bands led by Doc Kentross and Freddy Bates. His early lessons had {{involved}} mostly playing by rote, so his development of knowledge of theory and further piano technique occurred from the late 1930s until 1941, including studying harmony at Commerce High School. In that year he was drafted into the army, where he continued with piano lessons and was influenced by pianist Ernie Washington, with whom he was barracked, although Byard also took up trombone at this time. He also studied Stravinsky and Chopin, and continued studying classical composers into the 1960s. Part of his military service was in Florida, where he was a mentor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and his brother, Nat. After leaving the army in 1946, Byard's musical education continued, through discussions with others, and using library materials combined with music school syllabuses.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{was born}} in Islington and raised in Finsbury Park, London. Running {{was a part of}} his family life: his older sister Christine won the senior 100metres Finals at the English Schools Championships in 1986 and 1987 and competed in the European Athletics Junior Championships. As a schoolboy he was coached by Selwyn Philbert who devoted himself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> sprinter. Chambers first {{athletic}} success came at the 1994 English Schools' Athletic Association Championships, where he won the boys' intermediate 100m race with a time of 10.64seconds.

5|$|Despite {{offers from}} Bologna and Milan, Buffon {{began his career}} with the Parma youth system in 1991, at the age of 13. During his time in the youth academy, he {{initially}} played in several out-field positions, in particular as a midfielder, before switching to his current position of goalkeeper. His idol Thomas N'Kono inspired this change of position due to his notable goalkeeping performances for Cameroon at the 1990 World Cup in Italy; as a result, when both of the Parma youth team's keepers suddenly suffered injuries, Buffon was called upon due to his interest, height and physical attributes. He quickly adapted to this role, and within two weeks he had been promoted to first keeper of the Parma youth team. Ermes Fulgoni, the academy's goalkeeping coach, would soon become a mentor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> goalkeeper.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to {{set a good example}} for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more as a warning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E

5|$|In 1290, Edward's {{father had}} {{confirmed}} the Treaty of Birgham, {{in which he}} promised to marry his six-year-old son <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Margaret of Norway, who had a potential claim to the crown of Scotland. Margaret died later that year, bringing {{an end to the}} plan. Edward's mother, Eleanor, died shortly afterwards, followed by his grandmother, Eleanor of Provence. Edward I was distraught at his wife's death and held a huge funeral for her; his son inherited the County of Ponthieu from Eleanor on her death. Next, a French marriage was considered for the young Edward, to help secure a lasting peace with France, but war broke out in 1294. The idea was replaced with the proposal of a marriage to a daughter of the Count of Flanders, but this too failed after it was blocked by King Philip IV of France.|$|E
5|$|In 1844, {{the family}} hired Fanny Dürbach, a 22-year-old French governess. Four-and-a-half-year-old Tchaikovsky was {{initially}} thought {{too young to}} study alongside his older brother Nikolai and a niece of the family. His insistence convinced Dürbach otherwise. By the age of six, he had become fluent in French and German. Tchaikovsky also became attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> woman; her affection for him was reportedly a counter to his mother's coldness and emotional distance from him, though others assert that the mother doted on her son. Dürbach saved much of Tchaikovsky's work from this period, which includes his earliest known compositions, and became a source of several childhood anecdotes.|$|E

When Vader brings Luke before his master, the Emperor tempts Luke to join the dark side by appealing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>young</b> Jedi's fear for his friends, whom he has lured into a trap. This leads to a lightsaber duel in which Luke defeats and nearly kills Vader. The Emperor tells Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses and declares himself a Jedi. Enraged, the Emperor attacks Luke with Force lightning. Moved by his son's cries for help, Vader throws the Emperor into the Death Star's reactor shaft, killing him.|$|E
