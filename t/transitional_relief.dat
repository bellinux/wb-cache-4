25|$|On revaluation, the {{multiplier}} is adjusted so {{that the}} overall increase in liability across {{the country is in}} line with the Retail Prices Index, a measure of inflation. A property whose rateable value changes exactly in line with the national average would see an inflation-only rise in liability. Conversely, properties with unusually large changes in rateable value would have a significant change in liability. To smooth these jumps in liability, schemes of <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> have been applied to each rating list. These operate by restricting the proportion by which liability may change per year, both upwards and downwards. The 1990 and 1995 <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> schemes required funding from the Treasury, while the 2000 list scheme was designed to be revenue-neutral over the lifetime of the list, albeit with Treasury funding at the beginning. The Local Government Act 2003 required that all revaluations in England feature a revenue-neutral scheme, beginning with the 2005 rating list. <b>Transitional</b> <b>relief</b> applies only to changes in liability between rating lists, not changes within lists. For example, under the 2005 <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> scheme in England, if a rateable value had risen by 20%, the rise in liability would be restricted to 12.5% in the first year, 17.5% in the second year, and the full 20% in the third year (different restrictions would apply for a small business). <b>Transitional</b> <b>relief</b> schemes have been applied to the 1990, 1995, and 2000 rating lists in England and Wales, and to the 2005 rating list in England.|$|E
25|$|The new {{non-domestic}} {{rating system}} {{became known as}} business rates, or sometimes the universal business rate. It retained from its predecessors {{the concept of a}} series of local rating lists, with each property being assessed for a rateable value based on rental values. Rating lists were prepared and maintained by the Valuation Office (reconstituted in 1991 as an UK Government Executive Agency, the Valuation Office Agency), while billing and collection was the responsibility of local authorities. Previously, local authorities had decided what proportion of rateable values to charge; the new system featured a centrally set multiplier, {{often referred to as the}} Uniform Business Rate, by which the basic bill was calculated. The bill could be further modified by various reliefs, including the newly introduced <b>transitional</b> <b>relief,</b> which was designed to smooth large changes in liability due to revaluations. The multiplier was calculated to ensure that, on average, bills rose by no more than the rate of inflation.|$|E

40|$|The {{position}} of architecture in humanitarian relief is limited {{if it does}} not adequately meet the needs of people in an appropriate timeframe. Traditionally {{in the aftermath of a}} disaster, displaced people are immediately sheltered in community centres or tents, remaining in this state of uncertainty for extended periods of time. Three years after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, over 300, 000 people were still living in displacement camps, most of which had no on-site access to water. As the disaster-stricken region sits in a state of disrepair, prefabricated temporary houses emerge months later and continue to be in use for years. Three years on from the 2011 East Japan earthquake and tsunami, over 90, 000 people were still living in temporary accommodation. This state of hiatus is typically detrimental to the length of the recovery process â€“ when temporary housing exists for too long, the longevity of the reformation of the city increases. Taking this system failure as a provocation, this research discusses the role of architecture in the immediate reformation of a city. It proposes a transitional house, constructed on site within 24 hours, which can be adapted into a permanent condition within 12 months, as an answer to reforming housing in post-disaster situations. It questions how a change from the traditional response to <b>transitional</b> disaster <b>relief</b> housing can become a feasible option in the aftermath of a disaster, and how such housing can become adaptable for the individual. These ideas are explored through design as research: the problem analysed and revealed through design. The first section reveals the design problem through a literature review, identifying the previous attempts and failures of disaster relief housing. The second section speculates responses for post disaster housing, exploring solutions to the ideas identified in section one. The third section tests the design outcome, refining the design ideas and positioning them within architectural discourse. This thesis explores a departure from conventional New Zealand housing, and the facilitation of a new typology in disaster relief housing...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the issues that}} influence health development post conflict. Its aim is to increase understanding of the current issues within the transitional post conflict phase through presenting the experiences of three communities in rural Angola. Having emerged from nearly 30 years of civil war, Angola remains in a challenging transitional period. This phase of rehabilitation, flanked by efforts of relief and development, is shown to be problematic. This thesis considers the process from conflict to peace and subsequent repatriation of population. It identifies the <b>transitional</b> phase between <b>relief</b> and development projects and the ambiguous linking of theory and practice within literature Discussion of appropriate health strategies for implementation shows {{the limitations of the}} primary health care (PHC) model. Concepts of community participation and empowerment are identified as difficult due to resettlement factors of time and planning. The methods of research include household surveys (181 completed), interviews, group discussions, and observations of three communities. Comparisons of the two groups of previously identified Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and Returned Refugees (RRs) are made throughout the thesis. A focus on the needs, wants, reality and use of health services reveals community participation and responsibility. The influences of identity (tribe, gender, IDP / RR) and past experiences of refuge, settlement, and education are recognised as impacting to varying degrees, knowledge, attitude and practice towards health services. The research concludes that the post conflict phase is impacted most strongly by community (identity), time and communication...|$|R
25|$|During the {{introduction}} of business rates, criticism focused {{on the level of}} the multiplier to be chosen, and on the <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> scheme, with organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry calling for a lower multiplier and a relief scheme more to the benefit of its members. In 2007, the Lyons Inquiry into Local Government said there was no significant opposition to the principles of the tax, but that the level was a concern to property-intensive businesses. Due to the overall yield being linked to the Retail Prices Index as a measure of inflation, the contribution of business rates to local government finance has decreased compared to Council Tax and government grants. Many local authorities have called for the rate to be increased, and for the power to set the multiplier to be returned to local control; both suggestions have been opposed by business organisations such as the British Retail Consortium. The Lyons Inquiry rejected the return to local control, and instead proposed giving local authorities the power to levy a local supplement, in consultation with affected businesses; responses from the business sector have ranged from caution to opposition.|$|E

50|$|It is {{nonetheless}} possible {{to achieve the}} same result using Gift Aid, regardless of which tax band the donor is in, because the Gift Aid scheme allows higher rate taxpayers to reclaim the difference between higher and basic rate taxes. For example, if a donor gives Â£80 via Gift Aid, this is equivalent to donating Â£100 via Payroll Giving. In both cases, the benefit to the charity is Â£100 (disregarding the <b>Transitional</b> <b>Relief</b> payable until April 2011). The cost to a basic rate taxpayer is Â£80 in both cases, as the Â£100 paid by Payroll Giving would otherwise have been taxed at 20%. The cost to a higher rate taxpayer is Â£60 for the Payroll Giving donation (Â£100 less 40%), and initially Â£80 for the Gift Aid donation, although the higher rate taxpayer can later reclaim the Â£20 difference through his/her tax return.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the appropriateness {{and consequences of}} compensation and transitional arrangements such as "grandfathering" in regulatory design, with particular reference to two public policy initiatives championed by the Rudd Labor Government in Australia between 2007 and 2010 - the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) and the Resources Super Profits Tax (RSPT). In particular, this paper explores the efficacy of alternative approaches to compensation and <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> where regulatory change has a retrospective impact. In doing so it considers factors that may be relevant to the choice {{of whether or not}} to provide any compensatory or <b>transitional</b> <b>relief.</b> This paper also highlights the risks associated with governments taking inconsistent approaches to compensation and <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> on policy reform, and argues that the different approaches taken to compensation with respect to the CPRS and the RSPT was a factor that contributed to the uncertainty and opposition that enveloped both policy proposals...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decade the water {{industry}} throughout Great Britain has undergone its most radical restructuring in over half a century. In England and Wales privatisation of the ten regional water authorities in 1989 removed the industry from the public sector at a stroke. In Scotland the privatisation option was rejected, and responsibility for {{water and sewerage services}} was instead transferred from local to central government control through the creation of three public water authorities in 1996. Despite these fundamental differences, however, domestic customers {{on both sides of the}} border have faced increases in thencharges, year on year, well above the rate of inflation. In Scotland these increases have been underpinned by the need for additional capital investment, tariff harmonisation across water authority areas and reductions in central government financial support in the form of <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> for sewerage services. The statutory body established to protect consumer interests - the Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers Council - has viewed the sharp rise in prices with increasing concern, taking the controversial step of rejecting the 1998 / 99 water authority charging proposals in January 1998. The final settlement determined by the Secretary of State for Scotland allowed these increases to stand, but arranged a redistribution of the <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> grant of Â£ 30 million to limit the effect of the price rises on low-income households. For the 1999 / 2000 determination <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> was phased out completely, leading to rises in average domestic water bills of the order of 20 %. Against this background our paper analyses the distributional impact of water and sewerage price rises on domestic households in Scotland. Following the introduction, section two contains a brief theoretical discussion and an analysis of the recent charging reforms in Scotland. In section three we employ data from the Family Resources Survey, a source not used previously in this context, to examine the relative burden of water and sewerage charges on households classified according to income, property value and geographical location. Section four discusses the policy implications of the analysis and section five concludes...|$|E
40|$|The United Kingdom has {{experienced}} different local taxation regimes {{in each of}} the last three financial years: namely the property-based household rates; the personal community charge or 'poll tax'; and the hybridised personal community charge adjusted for neighbourhood 'transitional relief'. The geographical impact of these changing policies in the Inner Areas of the City of Cardiff is examined, highlighting the importance of historical rateable values and household sizes. By using a purpose-built street-level database, the implications of the different taxation systems are examined at increasingly detailed geographic scales, and the complexity of their impact is illustrated. This analysis focuses upon the geographical effects of using administrative community boundaries for the allocation of <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> in Cardiff, Wales. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Few GIS {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} a preparedness {{to grapple with the}} messy empirical problems which beset applied research. This paper uses a detailed case study to illustrate some of the problems which are encountered when attempting to integrate widely used urban data sources into a disaggregate GIS.

INTRODUCTION: A GEOGRAPHICAL PROBLEM Since 1990, the UK has undergone a number of major changes in the structure and level of local taxation, moving from a property-based domestic rating system, through different vari ants of a personal community charge regime (i. e., with and without <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> payments and national reductions), to a new council tax, implemented in April 1993.

40|$|In the March 1993 budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer {{proposed}} the phasing {{out of the}} Petroleum Revenue Tax. All fields receiving development assent after March 1993 will now pay no tax apart from Corporation Tax at 33 %. PRT for existing fields is reduced from 75 % to 50 %. At the same time companies {{will no longer be}} able to offset exploration and appraisal expenditure in one field against tax liabilities accruing from other fields in the North Sea (some form of <b>transitional</b> <b>relief</b> will be available till 1995). The changes are seen in general to be prejudicial to an industry already finding it difficult to cope with declining real oil prices in an ageing oil province with internationally high production costs. The specific focus of this article is the impact which any such decline will have on the contracting and supply industry which has grown up to service North Sea oil production...|$|E
40|$|Britain is {{currently}} experiencing a rapid succession of different local taxation regimes, namely the domestic rates, the community charge (adjusted by various amounts of <b>transitional</b> <b>relief)</b> {{and the council}} tax. Although each of these regimes is in practice a hybrid tax based upon dwelling attributes and household characteristics, the principal mechanisms of taxation have changed significantly {{over the last four}} years. Little is known about the recent and future redistributional consequences of these changes in a geographical context. In this paper, we develop and extend our previous research on the impact of the changeover from the domestic rates to the community charge at the small area level: specifically, we extend our analysis to anticipate the impact of the council tax, and we model its redistributional consequences using a street-level GIS. Our empirical study is based upon the estimated 45 658 dwellings that comprise the Inner Area of Cardiff, Wales. The pattern of revenue-raising under the domestic rates is described using a public domain source, and the pattern of revenue-raising under the community charge is approximated using the Electoral Register. The pattern of payment under the council tax is modelled in a GIS environment using information collected in a house price survey. Redistributional patterns under the three basic regimes are described and some implications of the council tax are assessed in a geographical context...|$|E
40|$|The thesis's {{principal}} {{aim is to}} investigate the distributional impact of {{the introduction of the}} Council Tax as the Community Charge's replacement in England in April 1993. The thesis's empirical analyses consider the distribution of the local tax burden at the household level in terms of income groups, household types and geographical location. The research models the introduction of the Council Tax using a large set of data provided by the Nationwide Anglia Building Society. These data comprise details of over 75, 000 mortgages granted by the Building Society between 1988 and 1990 and are sufficiently detailed to allow calculation of individual and household liability for both Community Charge and Council Tax. The Council Tax is chiefly a property tax based on the capital value of domestic property. Because the capital value of domestic property is unevenly distributed both geographically and across income groups, necessarily the Council Tax's burden is also distributed geographically and across income groups. Previous distributional analyses {{of the impact of the}} Council Tax have been unable to consider this spatial distribution. However, the Nationwide Anglia data allow analysis of this spatial distribution. The thesis considers a number of influences on the tax's distribution - the use of capital value as a tax base; the operation of the Revenue Support Grant; the Council Tax <b>Transitional</b> <b>Relief</b> Scheme; the Council Tax's hybrid personal / property tax design; as well as the distributional implications of the transition to a form of property tax from the Community Charge's flat- rate poll tax. The final chapter uses the implications of the preceding distributional analyses to consider the Council Tax in the longer term as part of a broader solution to the historic difficulties of the overall local government finance system...|$|E
