This was a {{conceptual}} paradigm which outlined the major factors influencing student success in school learning, indicating also how these factors interacted. Carroll's model stemmed from his previous work with foreign language learning. He found that a student's aptitude for a language predicted not only the level <b>to</b> which he <b>learned</b> in a given time, but also {{the amount of time}} he required <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> a given level. Carroll then suggests that aptitudes are actually a way to measure the amount of time required <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> a task up to a certain level (under ideal instructional conditions). So Carroll's model is actually suggesting that, if each student was allowed the time <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> some level, then he could be expected to attain that level.|$|R

An ageing survey conducted with 2620 Australian respondents aged 50 to 90 years examined aspects of work, learning, social, spiritual and emotional status, health, vision, home, life events, demographics, and asked an open ended question about what being actively engaged in life meant. Ordinal regression was carried out on two dependent variables: wanting and <b>needing</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> discourage violence.

This is a comparative study seeking to identify all the Hadiths that are listed in a collection by a distinguished Hadith scholar but are not listed in any of the six main Hadith collections. This is highly useful for students of Hadith, because it identifies for them which Hadiths <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> from any particular collection, if they have already learned the six main ones. Moreover, many of these collections, from which Al-Haythami extracted the Zawa’id, are not arranged according to topics of Fiqh, while Al-Haythami arranged them on this basis, which makes for easier reference. Hence, his work is highly valuable.|$|E

College students interacted with a computer-based tutor that presented algebralike problems in a novel graphical representation.

In Experiment 2, with only a little practice for each transformation, students performed worst in the discovery condition. The authors suggest that the high levels of practice in the 1 st experiment made students more efficient at discovering the algebraic transformations. When the cognitive demands were manageable, the discovery students may have more often encoded the algebraic transformations in mathematically correct ways...|$|R
