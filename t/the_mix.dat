5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> to gelatinize. During this process, salts in <b>the</b> <b>mix</b> serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E

40|$|A {{mixed graph}} is a graph with edges and arcs, {{which can be}} {{considered}} as a hybrid of an undirected graph and a directed graph.

40|$|Under the {{background}} of dual combustor ramjet (DCR), a numerical investigation of supersonic mixing layer was launched, focused on <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> enhancement method of applying baffles with different geometric configurations. Large eddy simulation with high order schemes, containing a fifth-order hybrid WENO compact scheme for the convective flux and sixth-order compact one for the viscous flux, was utilized to numerically study the development of <b>the</b> supersonic <b>mixing</b> layer. <b>The</b> supersonic cavity flow was simulated and the cavity configuration could influence <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> characteristics, since <b>the</b> impingement process of large scale structures formed inside the cavity could raise the vorticity and promote <b>the</b> <b>mixing.</b> <b>The</b> effect of baffle's configurations on <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> process was analyzed by comparing <b>the</b> flow properties, <b>mixing</b> efficiency, and total pressure loss. The baffle could induce large scale vortexes, promote <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> layer to lose its stability easily, and then lead to <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> efficiency enhancement. However, the baffle could increase the total pressure loss. The present investigation could provide guidance for applying new passive mixing enhancement methods for <b>the</b> supersonic <b>mixing...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{single phase}} flow of a passive tracer through {{heterogeneous}} porous media, a mixing layer develops between the tagged and untagged regions of <b>the</b> fluid. <b>The</b> <b>mixing</b> region expands {{as the time}} evolves. We have developed a multilength scale theory {{for the growth of}} <b>the</b> <b>mixing</b> region induced by a general random velocity field (multi-fractal field).

5|$|Gold, a siderophile, is most {{commonly}} recovered by dissolving the ores {{in which it}} is found in a cyanide solution.

40|$|Hydroxyapatite is a {{bioactive}} material. However, Hydroxyapatite {{in medical}} application {{is limited by}} its poor mechanical properties.
