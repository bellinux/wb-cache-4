40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{models for}} graphite pencil, <b>drawing</b> <b>paper,</b> blenders, and kneaded eraser that produce realistic looking pencil marks, textures, and tones. Our models {{are based on}} an observation of how lead pencils interact with <b>drawing</b> <b>paper,</b> and on the absorptive and dispersive properties of blenders and erasers interacting with lead material deposited over <b>drawing</b> <b>paper.</b> The models consider parameters such as the particle composition of the lead, {{the texture of the}} paper, the position and shape of the pencil materials, and the pressure applied to them. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach with a variety of images and compare them to digitized pencil drawings. We also present image-based rendering results implementing traditional graphite pencil tone rendering methods...|$|R

50|$|As {{with other}} earlier reprographic processes, a <b>translucent</b> {{original}} <b>drawing</b> was placed over {{a sheet of}} the sensitized paper and exposed to light. However, the next step exposed the paper to an ammonia gas. This alkaline gas catalyzed a reaction between the diazo salts and the coupling agent to produce an image that fixed in the paper over several days. Typically these prints have blue or dark purple lines on a mottled cream-colored background, although line and ground colors can vary.|$|R

We propose another method to prepare graphitic carbon by irradiating lead pencil <b>drawn</b> <b>paper</b> using femtosecond laser [Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 55 (2016) 01 AE 24]. In order to evaluate electronic properties, such as resistivity and mobility, surface roughness of paper is important to evaluate thickness of lead pencil as one of principal factors. The surface roughness of variety of paper was investigated including cross section of <b>drawing</b> <b>paper.</b> Femotosecond laser irradiated the sample surface with its focus shifted from the optical focal point to enlarge the laser spot and tender irradiation.

40|$|We {{focused on}} {{developing}} {{a technique to}} grow graphene employing femtosecond laser irradiation on a pencil <b>drawn</b> <b>paper.</b> In order to grow graphene with flat surface and low resistance, variety of paper (PC print paper, PC photo <b>paper,</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>paper,</b> silver halide print paper) and lead pencil (graded by hardness, blackness and fineness) combinations were investigated. The Raman peaks, related to graphene G and D bands, were clearly observed on silver halide paper and 10 B lead pencil combination in both states, before and after femtosecond laser irradiation. Furthermore, among the all combinations the multi-graphene grown by combination of silver halide print paper and 10 B lead pencil performed relatively flat surface with 1 μm thickness and low resistance after femtosecond laser irradiation...|$|R

30|$|To get paper-based SCs, a {{piece of}} Xerox paper (1.5 cm 2) was drawing by a 4 B pencil (86  % {{graphite}} and 14  % clay) until its sheet resistance reduced to about 95  Ω sq− 1 (~ 150 times of scratching). After that, a layer of thin graphite sheets was deposited on the paper. Then, the graphite–paper composite (the area is about 1.0  ×  1.0  cm) was immersed in a solution that contained 0.2  M NaClO 4 and 5  % (V:V) pyrrole monomer, and PPy was grown on the <b>drawn</b> <b>paper</b> via an electrochemical deposition process. Three-electrode configuration {{was used in this}} deposition process with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, platinum foil as the counter electrode and the <b>drawn</b> <b>paper</b> as the working electrode. A constant voltage of 0.8  V was applied during the process. Then the as-grown sample was washed with deionized water and dried at room temperature. In order to seek for the dependence of SC performance on PPy deposition time, the deposition time of PPy on the <b>drawn</b> <b>paper</b> was different. Finally, two pieces of 1.0  ×  1.5  cm functionalized paper were used as electrodes with the opposite area of 1.0  ×  1.0  cm. A gel composite H 3 PO 4 /PVA was used which acted as the separator and the electrolyte between the two electrodes. After the gel electrolyte dried completely, the quasi-solid-state SC was prepared.|$|R
