3000|$|There {{have been}} many {{applications}} of the one parameter Rasch model in test development. Holmes ([1982]) has shown how Rasch analysis {{can be used to}} vertically equate suites of tests, each of which has been designed to measure a different range of ability. Agrawal ([1979]) used the technique to recalibrate tests from which items that were deemed not to fit the validity construct had been removed. More recently, Rasch analysis software enabled Goh & Aryadoust ([2010]) to identify and remove from a test items that elicited an erratic pattern of responses (known as [...] "underfitting" [...] items) as well as those whose pattern of responses appeared not to be independent ("overfitting" [...] items). Nevertheless, the main application of the Rasch analysis techniques has been to create banks of items of known difficulty from which tests can be constructed such that candidates of a certain standard of mastery consistently achieve a passing score while others below that level consistently do not (Alderson et al. [1995]). It was the apparent lack of consistency is this area that led Gilks and Trejos ([2013]) to conclude that Taiwanese tour guide and <b>tour</b> <b>escort</b> tests were unreliable. Although there were variations in the pass rates of over 20 % for the <b>tour</b> <b>escort</b> test and over 30 % for the tour guide test, they did not find any significant differences in the education levels, gender or ages of the test takers that might have accounted for such large variations in pass rates, suggesting that the by now commonplace application of IRT to trialling, calibration and item-banking had not been followed in the construction of these tests.|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} version of the expectation/performance paradigm was applied in a specific group tour situation to measure the relative importance of tourism services and attractions to satisfaction with a weekend motorcoach tour to Niagara Falls. It was determined that the experience level of the traveler did not significantly affect expectations norperformance ratings. Utilizing repeated measures ANOVA, two service features (<b>tour</b> <b>escort</b> service and convenience of departurepoints) and one attraction (sightseeing) were singled out as being the attributes which contributed significantly to satisfaction with the trip and to intention to book another tour. These three variables were not rated as most important in the travelers’ tour selection processes. The most important thing to know about intangible products is that customers usually don’t know what they’re getting into until they don’t get it. Only then do they become aware of what they bargained for; only on dissatis-faction do they dwell. Satisfaction is, as it should be, mute. Its existence is affirmed only by its absence. (Levit...|$|E
30|$|While {{this study}} {{can be seen}} as a attempt to assess the {{reliability}} of the tour guide and <b>tour</b> <b>escort</b> tests in a more detailed manner, it must be pointed out that it is an assessment of just one particular kind of reliability, namely the consistency with which equivalent forms of a test distinguish those candidates who are deemed to have attained a certain level of proficiency from those who have not. The other common notion of test reliability, namely internal consistency, was not questioned by Gilks and Trejos and was therefore not the main focus of this study. Nevertheless, insofar issues relating to this concept of reliability are relevant, they are reviewed in the discussion on the theoretical background to the study. Moreover, since data gathered during the course of the research did allow the internal consistency of the tests under consideration to be measured, it has been noted in the results.|$|E

3000|$|Taiwan's Ministry of Examinations {{produces}} two English tests {{each year}} {{as part of}} the foreign language component of a four-part certification process for domestic tour guides ([...]; daoyou) and <b>tour</b> <b>escorts</b> ([...]; lingdui), i.e., guides who accompany parties of Taiwanese tourists abroad. The tests have steadily grown in popularity over the last ten years, with over 15, 000 candidates taking the tests in 2013 compared to just under 6, 000 candidates in 2004 (ROC Ministry of Examinations [2013]). Despite their popularity, only one study of the tests has so far been published. Using Bachman and Palmer's ([1996]) criteria for test [...] "usefulness", Gilks and Trejos ([2013]) found that both tests were deficient in all categories under consideration except practicality. That is, although the researchers recognised the advantages of the tests' multiple choice format for large scale administration, they also found that the tests lacked reliability, construct validity, authenticity, interactiveness, and a pedagogically desirable impact on English language education.|$|R
