5|$|Rethinking the {{conventions}} of a Zelda game became an important theme as development progressed. In previous Zelda games, the player would go into a dungeon, obtain a new item, and then move onto the next dungeon in a specific order. The development team felt that this formula was flawed as a player could get stuck on a dungeon and {{would be unable to}} progress further in the game. They wanted to give the player more freedom in <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> could advance through the game, allowing them to tackle dungeons in any order and clear multiple dungeons in parallel, but this meant that the method for acquiring items had to be changed. They opted for a system where players could rent or purchase items using the game's currency, rupees. In the final game, rented items are returned to the merchant when the player is defeated, however the team had considered other ideas for returning rented items, such as setting a timer on the rental period and imposing fees if they were returned late. The development team found out about the existence of the Nintendo 2DS console during the game's production. As the Nintendo 2DS lacked 3D capabilities, the team decided to revise some of the game's dungeon designs to be certain that they could be completed without the 3D effect enabled.|$|E

2500|$|What {{they call}} [...] "Israel" [...] is no mere {{military}} state.

25|$|Debate {{continues}} {{as to the}} origins of the unidentified ghost rockets. In 1946, however, it was thought likely that they originated from the former German rocket facility at Peenemünde, and were long-range tests by the Russians of captured German V-1 or V-2 missiles, or perhaps another early form of cruise missile because of <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> were sometimes seen to maneuver. This prompted the Swedish Army to issue a directive stating that newspapers were not to report the exact location of ghost rocket sightings, or any information regarding the direction or speed of the object. This information, they reasoned, was vital for evaluation purposes to the nation or nations performing the tests.|$|E

500|$|The {{series was}} {{inspired}} by several Western films, most notably L.A. Confidential. Director Naoyoshi Shiotani cited several other influences, including Minority Report, Gattaca, Brazil and Blade Runner; the latter of which he compared very closely to Psycho-Pass. Before {{the making of the}} series, Urobuchi insisted on using a Philip K. Dick-inspired, dystopian narrative. The psychological themes were based on the time Shiotani watched Lupin III during his childhood because he thought about adding [...] "today's youth trauma" [...] to the series.

500|$|Much {{critical}} {{attention has}} been given {{to the development of the}} characters from the original book, 25 years on. One review opined that [...] " [...] characters are incapable of growth. They cannot credibly find Jesus or even see a skilled psychologist or take the right medication to fend off despair. They are bound to be American psychos." [...] Their development, some critics have observed, illuminates <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> have not developed as people; Clay is, for example, [...] "in mind and spirit if not quite in body, destined to remain unchanged, undeveloped, unlikable and unloved." [...] In Less Than Zero, though the characters of the novel compose for some [...] "the most hollow and vapid representation of the MTV generation one could possibly imagine", they remained to other reviewers [...] "particularly sympathetic". Like the novel, its characters were equally cultural milestones, described by a reviewer as [...] "seminal characters" [...] (of American fiction). On the subject of the 1987 film, Clay describes that [...] "the parents who ran the studio would ever expose their children in the same black light the book did". To Bill Eichenberger, this shows how [...] "the children have become the parents, writing scripts and producing movies, still imprisoned by Hollywood's youth and drug cultures – but now looking at things from the outside in." [...] Eisinger comments for the New York Press, that while [...] "they're in careers now and new relationships and different states of mind... their preoccupations are just the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, A. Dirk Moses {{described}} genocide as a [...] "total social practice." [...] Within this context, rape can {{be viewed}} {{as an integral part of}} genocide. Genocides usually involve attacking the familial roles of the victims, which are <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>they</b> contribute to the reproduction of the targeted group as perceived by the perpetrators. Commonalities across all genocides are the murder of infants in front of parents, forced rape of women by family members, and the violation and mutilation of the reproductive systems. The Armenian genocide is a prime example of these behaviors. The attackers follow a pattern of family based destruction. In attacks on villages men were killed, and the surviving population were raped, forcibly dislocated or killed. Another purpose of the rapes was eliticide, the destruction of a group's leadership, which was then used to create confusion. This gave a public demonstration of the mastery the attackers had over the Armenian populace, and caused `total suffering` on both sexes, as they bore witness to sexual assault and the torture of those they loved.|$|E
