Fibre LSCs {{were found to have}} a linear relationship between photon concentration and fibre lengths in scales suitable for LSC modules. Using raytrace modelling, cylindrical LSC arrays were found <b>to</b> <b>exhibit</b> <b>light</b> trapping properties at certain angles of incidence, which can pave the way for more efficient BIPV applications. Novel optics for a double-illuminated water splitting reactor were introduced, for the objective of solar hydrogen for energy storage and sustainable transport fuels. A reflective cone embedded in a waveguide reflects incident concentrated light into the waveguide. Raytrace modelling and practical high concentration measurements demonstrate the viability of the optical system as well as necessity for a perfectly smooth reflective cone. It was also shown that replaced the reflective cone with a quantum well solar cell (QWSC) in order to harness the photoluminescence (PL) is not a viable concept with current QWSC structures. Another form of sustainable transport fuels is to use biofuels produced by algae. Algae have evolved to absorb excess amounts of energy, even when it is detrimental to their own growth and survival. This causes inefficiencies when growing algae in raceway ponds. The luminescent solar diffuser (LSD) is an optical funnel, optimisable by use of a genetic algorithm, that can be retrofitted into an algae raceway pond in order to better distribute incident light into the pond depths. This was calculated to increase algae growth rates in the pond, thereby increasing the yield of an algae farm. Open Acces...|$|R

The band gap of the CZTSSe alloy decreases with the Se content almost linearly, and the band alignment between Cu(2) ZnSnS(4) and Cu(2) ZnSnSe(4) is of type I, which allows for more facile n-type and p-type doping for alloys with high Se content.

40|$|Direct {{integration}} of InGaN/sapphire LED with a cup-shaped copper heat spreader was proposed for enhancing light extraction and heat dissipation by self-aligned photolithography and copper electroforming techniques. Based on optical simulation results, geometric {{design for a}} copper heat spreader is crucial to luminous property of an LED chip. An InGaN/sapphire LED embedded with the optimized cup-shaped copper heat spreader was demonstrated <b>to</b> <b>exhibit</b> superior <b>light</b> output power than a conventional LED {{by a factor of}} 2. 68 times at an injection current of 1 A. Moreover, the power efficiency is remarkably increased from 4. 2 % to 15. 7 % at the same driven current. The improved device performance can be attributed to both of the enhanced light extraction of the laterally emitted light from an LED chip and efficient heat dissipation by the highly reflective and excellently thermal conductive copper heat spreader.

40|$|Rhodospirillum centenum resembles typical nonsulfur {{photosynthetic}} bacteria {{in a number}} of respects, including its ability to grow either anaerobically as a phototroph or aerobically as a heterotroph. We demonstrate, however, that R. centenum is unusual in its ability to synthesize a functional photosynthetic apparatus regardless of the presence of molecular oxygen. Aerobically expressed photopigments were shown to be functionally active, as demonstrated by the ability of heterotrophically grown cells to grow photosyntheti-cally, without a lag, when suddenly placed under anaerobic conditions. An R. centenum mutant that has acquired the ability to repress synthesis of photopigments in the presence of oxygen was also characterized. Both the wild type and the oxygen-repressed mutant of R. centenum were found <b>to</b> <b>exhibit</b> high <b>light</b> intensity repression of photopigment biosynthesis.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the effective dielectric tensor of a metal film penetrated by cylindrical holes {{filled with a}} nematic liquid crystal (NLC). We assume that the director of the NLC {{is parallel to the}} film, and that its direction within the plane can be controlled by a static magnetic field, via the Freedericksz effect. To {{calculate the}} effective dielectric tensor, we consider both randomly distributed holes (using a Maxwell-Garnett approximation) and a square lattice of holes (using a Fourier technique). Both the holes and the lattice constant of the square lattice are assumed small compared to the wavelength. The films are found <b>to</b> <b>exhibit</b> extraordinary <b>light</b> transmission at special frequencies related to the surface plasmon resonances of the composite film. Furthermore, the frequencies of peak transmission are found to be substantially split when the dielectric in the holes is anisotropic. For typical NLC parameters, the splitting is of order 5 – 10 % of the metal plasma frequency. Thus, the extraordinary transmission can be controlled by a static magnetic or electric field whose direction can be rotated to orient the director of the NLC. Finally, as a practical means of producing the NLC-filled holes, we consider the case where the entire perforated metal film is dipped into a pool of NLC, so that all the holes are filled with the NLC, and there are also homogeneous slabs of NLC {{on both sides of the}} film. The transmission in this geometry is shown to have similar characteristics to that in which the NLC-filled screen is placed in air.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} substantial improvements of the colloidal photolithography technique (also called microsphere lithography) {{with the}} goal of better controlling the geometry of the fabricated nano-scale structures—in this case, hexagonally arranged nanopillars—printed in a layer of directly photopatternable sol-gel TiO 2. Firstly, to increase the achievable structure height the photosensitive layer underneath the microspheres is deposited on a reflective layer instead of the usual transparent substrate. Secondly, an increased width of the pillars is achieved by tilting the incident wave and using multiple exposures or substrate rotation, additionally allowing to better control the shape of the pillar’s cross section. The theoretical analysis is carried out by rigorous modelling of the photonics nanojet underneath the microspheres and by optimizing the experimental conditions. Aspect ratios (structure height/lateral structure size) greater than 2 are predicted and demonstrated experimentally for structure dimensions in the sub micrometer range, as well as line/space ratios (lateral pillar size/distance between pillars) greater than 1.
