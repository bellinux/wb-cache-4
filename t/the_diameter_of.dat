40|$|Aim: To {{study the}} {{performance}} of the implanted both one-piece and three-piece IOLs in relation to <b>the</b> enlarged <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsular bags of the highly myopic eyes. Subjects and Methods: Patient were randomly divided into two groups; group (A), included 25 eyes that underwent phacoemulsification with implantation of one-piece IOLs, Group (B) included 25 eyes that underwent phacoemulsification with implantation of three-piece IOLs. All patients include in this study were high myopes with axial length greater than 26. 5 mm. All eyes were planned for clear lens extraction or cataract extraction. Results: In group (A), a statistically significant negative correlation was found between <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capsular bags and <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implanted on – piece IOLs.

5|$|The account {{published}} in Journal des sçavans {{was based on}} a report that Rømer read to the French Academy of Sciences in November 1676 (Cohen, 1940, p.346). When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference {{in the time it takes}} light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect for Jupiter's innermost moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross <b>the</b> <b>diameter</b> <b>of</b> the Earth's orbit.|$|E

Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area.

However, whether <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{coronary arteries}} {{are associated with the}} coronary lesion severity on angiography has not been determined. Methods: One hundred sixty-seven consecutive adult patients (109 men and 58 women) aged 31 – 84 years who underwent coronary angiography for suspected or known CAD were enrolled. The known catheter tip diameter was used as the calibration to measure <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> coronary arteries, and the severity of coronary lesions was evaluated with the vessel score and Gensini score. Results: In patients with a higher vessel score and Gensini score, <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> left main (LM), left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and right coronary arteries (RCA) were smaller (all p&#x 3 c; 0. 05) than those in patients with lower scores. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the average coronary artery diameter was significantly associated with the Gensini score (β=- 0. 444, p&#x 3 c; 0. 00001). Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>diameters</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coronary arteries were potential predictors of CAD, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0. 268 for average diameter (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0. 183 – 0. 353, p&#x 3 c; 0. 00001), 0. 356 for <b>the</b> LM <b>diameter</b> (95 % CI: 0. 266 – 0. 445, p= 0. 005), 0. 214 for <b>the</b> LAD <b>diameter</b> (95 % CI: 0. 136 – 0. 291, p&#x 3 c; 0. 00001), 0. 366 for <b>the</b> LCX <b>diameter</b> (95 % CI: 0. 271 – 0. 461, p= 0. 009), and 0. 346 for <b>the</b> RCA <b>diameter</b> (95 % CI: 0. 245 – 0. 447, p= 0. 003).
