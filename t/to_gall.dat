5|$|In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was {{tasked with}} {{developing}} new varieties suitable for {{growing in the}} north of the country. They produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance, especially in the spring, ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance. Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance <b>to</b> <b>gall</b> mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus. 'Ben Lomond' {{was the first of the}} 'Ben' varieties and was released in 1975. This was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as 'Ben Alder' and 'Ben Tirran'. The cultivar 'Ben Hope' was released in 1998 with increased tolerance <b>to</b> <b>gall</b> mite, and in the same year, 'Ben Gairn' became available. It shows resistance to the reversion virus. For gardeners and the pick-your-own market, 'Ben Sarek', 'Ben Connan' and 'Big Ben' were introduced and have large, sweet berries. The cultivars 'Ben Connan', 'Ben Lomond' and 'Ben Sarek' have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance, disease resistance, machine harvesting, fruit quality, nutritional content and fruit flavour.|$|E

He died in 1230, of natural causes. The Annals of Connacht recorded his death, styling him:efender of Leth Cuind Chetchathaig against the Galls and against Leth Moga Nuadat, a prince eligible de jure for the kingship of Ireland, died this year; a king who never gave pledge or hostage or tribute <b>to</b> <b>Gall</b> or Gael; a king who wrought slaughterings and great routs on the Galls; a king who was the support of any Gaels who were in banishment or homeless; a king who was the most generous and excellent of all the men of Ireland who ever lived.|$|E
25|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens overwinters in infested soils. Agrobacterium species live {{predominantly}} saprophytic lifestyles, so it's {{not uncommon}} even for plant parasitic species of this genus {{to survive in}} the soil for lengthy periods of time, even without host plant presence. When there is a host plant present, however, the bacteria enter the plant tissue via recent wounds or natural openings of roots or stems near the ground. These wounds may be caused by cultural practices, grafting, insects, etc. Once the bacteria have entered the plant, they occur intercellularly and stimulate surrounding tissue to proliferate due to cell transformation. Agrobacterium performs this control by inserting the plasmid T-DNA in the plant's genome. More details about this process of plasmid DNA insertion are mentioned in the preceding sections. Excess growth of the plant tissue leads <b>to</b> <b>gall</b> formation on the stem and roots. These tumors exert significant pressure on the surrounding plant tissue, which causes it to become crushed and/or distorted, ultimately leading to reduced water flow in the xylem due to crushed vessels. Young tumors are soft and therefore vulnerable to secondary invasion by insects and saprophytic microorganisms. This secondary invasion causes breakdown of the peripheral cell layers as well as tumor discoloration due to decay. Breakdown of the soft tissue leads to release of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens into the soil allowing it to restart the disease process with a new host plant.|$|E

500|$|Golden wattle is {{cultivated}} in Australia and {{was introduced to}} the northern hemisphere in the mid-1800s. Although it has a relatively short lifespan of 15 to 30 years, it is widely grown for its bright yellow, fragrant flowers. As well as being an ornamental plant, it {{has been used as a}} windbreak or in controlling erosion. Trees are sometimes planted with the taller sugar gum (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) to make a two-layered windbreak. One form widely cultivated was originally collected on Mount Arapiles in western Victoria. It is floriferous, with fragrant flowers appearing from April to July. The species has a degree of frost tolerance and is adaptable to a wide range of soil conditions, but it prefers good drainage. It tolerates heavy soils in dry climates, as well as mild soil salinity. It can suffer yellowing (chlorosis) in limestone-based (alkaline) soils. Highly drought-tolerant, it needs [...] winter rainfall for cultivation. It is vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>gall</b> attack in cultivation. Propagation is from seed which has been pre-soaked in hot water to soften the hard seed coating.|$|E

2500|$|Custer {{may have}} seen Reno stop and form a {{skirmish}} line as Custer led his command to {{the northern end of}} the main encampment, where he apparently planned to sandwich the Indians between his attacking troopers and Reno's command in a [...] "hammer and anvil" [...] maneuver. According to Grinnell's account, based on the testimony of the Cheyenne warriors who survived the fight, at least part of Custer's command attempted to ford the river {{at the north end of}} the camp but were driven off by stiff resistance from Indian sharpshooters firing from the brush along the west bank of the river. From that point the soldiers were pursued by hundreds of warriors onto a ridge north of the encampment. Custer and his command were prevented from digging in by Crazy Horse, however, whose warriors had outflanked him and were now to his north, at the crest of the ridge. Traditional white accounts attribute <b>to</b> <b>Gall</b> the attack that drove Custer up onto the ridge, but Indian witnesses have disputed that account.|$|E

50|$|Steps can {{be taken}} <b>to</b> control crown <b>gall</b> disease and {{reduce the risk of}} infection.
