In 85 AD, the Dacians had swarmed over the Danube and pillaged Moesia and initially defeated an army the Emperor Domitian sent against them, but the Romans were victorious in the Battle of Tapae in AD 88 and a truce was drawn up.|$|E
5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, {{but he also had}} the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E

As a result, Pinney was relieved from command of his Territorial brigade in October and assigned to command the newly formed 23rd Brigade, made up from three battalions <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> garrison duty in Malta and one from Egypt. All were regular units, with very few reservists, but having spent a long period in colonial stations they were considered as only partially trained compared to the units serving with the Expeditionary Force.|$|E

5|$|On 23 March 1998, Braathens SAFE {{changed its}} name and {{corporate}} identity to Braathens. It introduced a new livery with a blue bottom, and replaced the Norwegian flag on the tail with an abstract, silver wing, that became the company's new logo. The re-branding {{was an attempt to}} create an international identity, and tone down the Norwegian national symbols <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the airplanes since 1946. At the same time, a two-class configuration was introduced: the 'Best' section, accounting for 70% of the planes capacity, received higher seat pitch, complimentary in-flight drinks, meals and newspapers, priority boarding and refundable tickets. The 'Back' section was for discount ticket holders, who received a no-frills service with a smaller seat pitch, and were located {{at the back of the}} aircraft behind a curtain. Best tickets became NOK300 more expensive, while it became easier to purchase discounted tickets. The scheme was, according to Erik G. Braathen, an attempt to differentiate between the full-fare customers, with whom Braathens was competing with SAS, and the low-fare customers, who Braathens was competing with Ryanair and the to-be established Color Air. The scheme as first introduced on the first 737-700 that was delivered.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Marines were {{relieved}} as the garrison of Emirau by the 147th Infantry on 11 April 1944. The next day, Noble was replaced as island commander by a marine aviator, Major General James T. Moore, the Commanding General of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. In turn, the 147th Infantry was relieved as garrison by the 369th Infantry in June. In August, General MacArthur directed that responsibility for garrisoning Emirau would {{be transferred to}} the Australian Army. The Australian 8th Infantry Battalion arrived to take over the garrison role on Emirau on 30 September. They were met by a small ANGAU detachment <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the island since May. Marine Aircraft Group 12 operated from Emirau until December, when it moved to Leyte; its place was taken by squadrons of the RNZAF. On 20 March 1945, General MacArthur authorized a reduction in the garrison size to one company of the 8th Infantry Battalion. In June 1945, it too was withdrawn. CBMU 502 departed for Manus that month. The RNZAF maintained a bomber-reconnaissance squadron at Emirau until July 1945, and a fighter squadron until August, when all forces were withdrawn from the island.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the German {{aircraft}} over Dombås {{came as a surprise}} to the Norwegian forces who nonetheless soon opened fire on the Ju 52s with all available arms. Gunners aboard the Ju 52s returned fire while flying at treetop level. Soon after, the first paratroopers were dropped over the area and took heavy fire while descending to the ground. The ground fire took a heavy toll on the German transport aircraft, with only five out of the original 15 Ju 52s making it back to Fornebu, with another two landing at Værnes Airbase near Trondheim, all seven surviving aircraft riddled with bullet holes. The remaining eight transports were shot down or made forced landings. One Ju 52 made an emergency landing on Vänern Lake near Mariestad, Sweden, where it later broke through the ice and sank. The aircraft was salvaged and returned to the Luftwaffe by the Swedish authorities in January 1941. Many of the paratroopers <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the shot-down aircraft died in the crashes, or were killed or captured by Norwegian patrols soon after.|$|E
25|$|Scaramanga was {{severely}} wounded in a dogfight and lost consciousness {{before he took}} down his twelfth and final enemy aircraft on 10 July 1918. He regained consciousness and with his one good arm shot down the attacking Pfalz D.III <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> their tail. He died that same day, soon after he and his pilot, Lieutenant John Everard Gurdon, landed, about two weeks short of his twentieth birthday. Scaramanga was interred at Aire Communal Cemetery in Aire-sur-la-Lys, Pas-de-Calais, France. His grave reference number is III. H. 25.

25|$|Falls {{rejected}} {{claims that}} British methods were predictable, noting that attacks {{had been made}} at dawn, noon, afternoon and at night. Bombardments had been fired before some attacks, during attacks on other occasions, on call from the infantry or were dispensed with. Attacks had been made indirectly, using ground for cover {{and a number of}} outflanking moves had succeeded. Combined operations with infantry, cavalry, cyclists, armoured cars and aircraft had also occurred. The most successful divisions in the pursuit were those <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the Somme for a considerable time, rather than the newer divisions, which were fresh and had trained for open warfare in England. Many of the British attacks had substantial casualties, mostly from German machine-gun fire, although artillery casualties were also high. Attacks on similar objectives using different methods had similar casualties, which suggested that losses were determined by the German defence, rather than unsatisfactory British methods. British field artillery had been supplied with an adequate amount of ammunition, despite the transport difficulties but much heavy artillery was left behind.|$|E

25|$|News Corporation, {{through its}} Fox Television Stations subsidiary, agreed to {{purchase}} Chris-Craft Industries and its stations, including KMSP-TV, for $5.35 billion in August 2000 (this brought KMSP, along with San Antonio's KMOL-TV and Salt Lake City's KTVX, back under common ownership with 20th Century Fox); the deal followed {{a bidding war}} with Viacom. The sale was completed on July 31, 2001. While Fox pledged to retain the Chris-Craft stations' UPN affiliations through at least the 2000–01 season, and Chris-Craft agreed to an 18-month renewal for its UPN affiliates in January 2001, an affiliation swap was expected once KMSP's affiliation agreement with UPN ran out in 2002, given Fox's presumed preference to have its programming on a station that it already owned. Additionally, KMSP's signal was much stronger than that of WFTC, it was a VHF station <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the air much longer than UHF outlet WFTC. Most importantly, Fox had been aggressively expanding local news programming on its stations, and KMSP had an established news department whereas WFTC's news department did not begin operations until April 2001. The move was made easier when, in July 2001, Fox agreed to trade KTVX and KMOL (now WOAI-TV) to Clear Channel Communications in exchange for WFTC, a transaction completed that October.|$|E
