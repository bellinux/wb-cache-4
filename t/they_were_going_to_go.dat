25|$|Unlike earlier {{waterfront}} strikes, longshoremen were {{prevented from}} picketing the docks to discourage strikebreaking, {{and claimed that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> en masse {{to talk to the}} non-union workers. They were led by Victoria Cross recipient Mickey O'Rourke and a contingent of First World War veterans and marched behind a Union Jack flag, to great symbolic effect. At the entrance to the pier, they were met by Chief Constable Colonel W. W. Foster, who warned the demonstrators {{that they would not be}} permitted to proceed. When they refused to turn back, protesters were attacked with clubs by the police guarding the pier. Within minutes, more police joined in the fight. In addition to the Vancouver city police, contingents from the British Columbia Provincial Police, who had been hiding behind boxcars, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, engaged with demonstrators. The police chased the dispersing crowd, continuing to club people even as they fled and fired tear gas. Many protesters fought back, throwing rocks and other projectiles at the police, while others that were attacked were simply trying to flee the scene. The ensuing melee continued for three hours and spread throughout the nearby residential district. Several people, both police and protesters, were hospitalized as a result of the riot, and one bystander was shot in the back of his legs by a police shotgun. Offices of Communist organizers and the longshoremen's union were also raided, with tear gas shot through the windows to drive out any occupants before the police entered. Strike supporters set up a makeshift hospital at the Ukrainian Hall, and the police did the same for their wounded at the Coroner's Court on Cordova Street. In total, 28 out of the 60 injured were hospitalized and 24 men were arrested. Mayor Gerry McGeer declared that striking longshoremen would no longer be eligible for relief payments for themselves or their families.|$|E
2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, and I knew what order <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in, but it was just a matter of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the initial}} protest, {{two men were}} arrested in the mid-afternoon, one for {{trespassing}} {{and the other for}} as yet undisclosed reasons. Inspector Howie Page commented to CityNews: [...] "From a policing side, it's been a good day. They've been lawful, they've been peaceful, they told us where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go...</b> they were more than willing to work with us and facilitate what we were asking." ...|$|E
5000|$|In November 2016, Loch Fyne {{carried out}} further {{berthing}} trials on the Mallaig to Armadale route, causing rumours suggesting {{she was going}} to take over from [...] in the future, but these trials concluded that major modifications would be needed to the vessel and linkspans at both ports. However, in January 2017, CalMac announced that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead with these modifications; Loch Fyne became the primary vessel on the Mallaig to Armadale route on 31 March 2017, with [...] carrying out further sailings in between her own roster to Lochboisdale.|$|E
5000|$|When asked later {{about this}} discrepancy, Professor Harrington replied: Can I clarify this {{once and for}} all? In my first year — before the first report, that is — I said to {{minister}} that, left to my own devices, I would prefer it if they would postpone the IB migration until I had got at least one review in, so they could just deal with the new claimants {{and would not be}} confused by another group of people coming in — a completely different group of people, as you well know. He did not say no; it was just obvious that it was a political done deal and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> ahead and do the IB migration whatever.|$|E

50|$|Roger Corman went up {{to bigger}} budgeted {{pictures}} when he made House of Usher (1960), shot in colour and considerably more prestigious than the Corman-Griffith collaborations. Corman chose Richard Matheson to write the scripts rather than Griffith, who said:He Corman said that Matheson had a reputation. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with color and CinemaScope. It was irritating because I {{saw that he was}} making a value judgement based on how much people were making and he was the one making policy. He said that no screenwriter who gets less than fifty thousand a script was any good.However Corman continued to use Griffith on other projects: a third black comedy, Creature from the Haunted Sea (1961) - which used the Naked Paradise structure - and Atlas (1962), a sword and sandal movie shot in Greece.|$|E
5000|$|Sawalha {{spoke in}} an {{interview}} with Larry Jaffee about how she got the role of Annie saying that she auditioned with many other actresses. She got through to the screen test with Victoria Gould who played Polly Becker. Sawalha has said that the only two they screen-tested were her and Victoria Gould: [...] "We were always going to get the job. They hadn’t decided which way <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> (who was going to be Annie and who Polly). They always have a vague idea of they want, and then they build the character around the person they choose. I was pleased when they turned it around." [...] She also said she enjoyed playing [...] "such a devilsome lady". Sawalha originally believed she may not be right for EastEnders saying,“My father is Arabic and my mother English. I just thought that I was too exotic — that there wasn’t enough call for a foreigner.” In September 1998 it was revealed that Sawalha had quit the role.|$|E

5000|$|Charlie and Claire {{are alone}} on the beach when Rousseau runs up, telling Charlie {{that she needs to}} see Sayid urgently. When Charlie runs off to get Sayid, Rousseau asks Claire if she can hold her baby. Soon Charlie and Sayid (accompanied by Shannon) return, to find Claire with a head wound exclaiming that her baby has been taken, and Sayid surmises that Rousseau intends to attempt an {{exchange}} of Aaron, Claire's baby, for her own child, Alex, with the [...] "Others." [...] As evening approaches, Charlie and Sayid head toward the black smoke. During their journey, Charlie is injured by one of Rousseau's traps, and they also encounter the downed drug smugglers' plane, which Sayid, unaware of Charlie's past as an addict, reveals is full of heroin. When Sayid and Charlie arrive on the beach with the black smoke, there are no other people, just a pyre on the sand without any footprints around, but they follow the sound of the baby's crying to find Rousseau's hiding place. Charlie angrily accuses her of lighting the pyre herself and inventing [...] "the Others" [...] as cover for kidnapping the baby. She tearfully tells them that she overheard them saying that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> after [...] "the boy", and she thought that if she brought him to them, they would return her child. She returns the baby.|$|E
5000|$|Richard {{also has}} the {{capacity}} to perform uncharacteristically good deeds, but has to look around {{to make sure no one}} is watching. He seems particularly likely to do this for Cale, for whom he seems to have a well hidden soft spot. On a number of occasions however, Cale has had to offer Richard something. When he asked Richard to save a village of people, Richard replied [...] "I don't 'Save'", until Cale said that afterward <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> and cut a path of slaughter and destruction through Legarion forces, to which Richard immediately strikes a heroic pose and proclaims [...] "We need to save these people!" [...] For instance, when Cale had his throat slashed by a Black Dwarf, Richard used a fire spell to cauterize the wound and carries Cale away from the mountain, despite his frequent assertions that he never saves anyone. He has also saved the life of a small boy for no good reason as well as saving an entire village from flooding at Cale's request. He can also be seen as strangely naïve after commenting that he thinks he hears Benn'Joon getting hurt in the distance by Cale when actually they made love just after kissing passionately. Characteristically he assumes that Cale was hurting her and offered to bury the corpse.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of Barrie's last season with Leeds, he won the 2005 World Club Challenge. The Rhinos won the World Club Challenge against the then National Rugby League champions the Canterbury Bulldogs. They won the trophy {{in front of a}} record crowd for a World Club Challenge held in Britain. There was a 37,028 strong crowd at Elland road. The Rhinos looked like <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> onto more success in 2005 as they reached the Challenge Cup Final for the 4th time in 6 years. They were leading 24-19 with a couple of minutes to go when {{disaster}} struck as they conceded a Paul Cooke try which Danny Brough converted to give the men from the east coast the trophy, winning by a point 25-24, The Rhinos' season went from bad to worse as they slipped up in the league allowing St. Helens to finish top of the table. The Rhinos finished 2nd and so played Saint Helens at Knowsley Road for the right to go to old trafford and play in the Grand Final. The Rhinos won and so reached their second consecutive Grand Final. They had to wait and see who they would play in the Grand Final. Saints played Bradford in the Grand Final Eliminator to see who would play the Rhinos at Old Trafford. The Bulls won so it was a repeat of the 2004 Grand Final - however it wasn't to be a fairytale for the Rhinos and Barrie as the Bulls won the match 15-6.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to explore {{pregnant}} women's decision-making and major influences on their preferences for a place of delivery. The study was prompted by the UK government's policy of a woman centred maternity service (Department of Health 1993 b), and the observation that studies had concentrated on professionals' rather than women's views about the place of delivery. Two factors were considered to have potential influence in decision making, one being the individual woman's risk perception related {{to the process of}} childbirth, and the other, knowledge about available options for place of birth. First, a systematic review was conducted, looking at available studies on women's views about the place of delivery. Only 9 studies were found, suggesting a need for more studies. Secondly, a primary study was conducted using in-depth interviews with 20 women planning a hospital birth, and 13 planning a home birth to explore factors that led to their respective choices. Results from the primary study indicate that women were not offered information about the availability of home birth. Consequently, 90 % of those planning a hospital birth did not give thought to where {{they were going to have}} their babies, but assumed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to hospital. On the other hand, those planning a home birth found information privately and discussed the options with their husbands before making a decision. Additionally, results exposed differences in perception of safety concerning childbirth for subsequent deliveries according to planned place of delivery. Control of the birth process and environment was also found to be important for women planning a home birth. Risk perception and information about available options were found to influence decision-making about the place of birth, thus supporting the hypotheses of the thesis. </p...|$|E
