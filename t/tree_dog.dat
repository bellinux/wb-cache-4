Their height can also vary with a minimum height of 16 inches tall. Males in the same lines are normally larger than females.|$|R
5000|$|Treeing is {{a method}} of hunting where dogs are used to force animals that {{naturally}} climb up into trees, {{where they can be}} shot by hunters. Particularly used with coonhunting, <b>treeing</b> <b>dogs</b> are selected for the instinct to not cease barking at an animal after it has escaped into a tree. The idiomatic phrase [...] "Barking up the wrong tree" [...] comes from this practice.|$|R

This much he saw, then swayed an instant longer in his lofty perch and hurtled far out into the frozen hell.|$|R
50|$|Some Mountain Feist bloodlines {{were indeed}} bred down from Jack Russell Terriers, {{crossing}} most likely with <b>treeing</b> <b>dogs,</b> such as <b>Treeing</b> Walker hounds. Jack Russell traits often remain visible despite this crossbreeding. These descendants usually are mostly white in color with brown or black around {{the head and}} neck, with tall stand up, or button ears. These dogs usually hunt in packs in the Appalachian and Ozark mountains. They use their eyes and ears exceptionally well.|$|R

2500|$|Tree {{infestation}} can {{be detected}} by looking for exit holes 3/8 to 3/4inches in diameter (1–2cm) often in the larger branches of the crowns of infested trees. Sometimes sap can be seen oozing from the exit holes with coarse sawdust or [...] "frass" [...] in evidence {{on the ground or}} lower branches. Dead and dying tree limbs or branches and yellowing leaves when there has been no drought also indicate A. glabripennis infestation. Traps can also be used containing a pheromone and a plant kairomone to attract nearby adults. Some acoustic sensors can also differentiate larval feeding within <b>trees.</b> <b>Dogs</b> can also be trained to detect the smell of frass on trees.|$|R

5000|$|The Treeing Tennessee Brindle's {{development}} {{began in}} the early 1960s with the efforts of Reverend Earl Phillips. Because of a column he was then writing in a hunting dog magazine, Phillips became aware of the existence of brindle curs—hunting and <b>treeing</b> <b>dogs</b> with brown coats, [...] "tiger-striped" [...] with black. He contacted their owners and fanciers, discovering that the type was highly regarded for its abilities, and in 1967 contacted them again to form an organization to [...] "preserve and promote" [...] the brindle cur. The Treeing Tennessee Brindle Breeders Association was established in Illinois on March 21. Foundation stock was obtained from various locations in the United States, particularly those between the Ozarks and Appalachian Mountains. The Treeing Tennessee Brindle's records have been maintained through the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service Program since 1995.|$|R

2500|$|This is {{demonstrated}} by the dog picture, which depicts a Dalmatian dog sniffing {{the ground in the}} shade of overhanging <b>trees.</b> The <b>dog</b> is not recognized by first identifying its parts (feet, ears, nose, tail, etc.), and then inferring the dog from those component parts. [...] Instead, the dog appears as a whole, all at once. Gestalt theory does not have an explanation for how this perception of a dog appears.|$|R
500|$|The dog or {{dogs are}} {{released}} {{at night in}} an area where raccoons are likely to be, such as a forest, crop field or swamp, and allowed to find a raccoon scent. Most dogs will emit a long, distinct bay upon striking a trail, and will continue to bay the entire time they are tracking the raccoon. The dog's voice may change timbre depending on how fresh or [...] "hot" [...] a scent is. Unlike some breeds of hunting dog that use sight to locate their prey, coonhounds use their sense of smell alone. The hunt typically ends when the raccoon climbs a tree. Upon reaching the <b>tree,</b> the <b>dog</b> or dogs will stop baying and begin the [...] "tree" [...] bark, also referred to as the chop bark for its short, sharp sound. This change in vocalization lets the hunter know when a raccoon is treed. Some dogs have emitted as many as 150 chop barks per minute when on a <b>tree.</b> The <b>dog</b> is thus said to be treeing, and the raccoon is considered treed.|$|R
