In June 2014, Glenn underwent successful heart valve replacement surgery at the Cleveland Clinic.

5|$|Most {{voters in}} Brazil had a low income. For example, in the Minas Gerais town of Formiga in 1876, the poor {{constituted}} 70% of the electorate. In Irajá {{in the province}} of Rio de Janeiro, the poor were 87% of the electorate. Former slaves could not vote, but <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> could, as could the illiterate (which few countries allowed). In 1872, 10.8% of the Brazilian population voted (13% of the non-slave population). By comparison, electoral participation in the UK in 1870 was 7% of the total population; in Italy it was 2%; in Portugal 9%; and in the Netherlands 2.5%. In 1832, the year of the British electoral reform, 3% of the British voted. Further reforms in 1867 and 1884 expanded electoral participation in the UK to 15%.|$|E

25|$|Croatian, Portuguese and Italian fishing families, {{many of them}} Catholic, founded San Pedro.

They lived there only briefly and in 1981 moved to a [...] house in Saddle River, New Jersey.

2500|$|Chinese-Filipino {{funeral and}} burial customs mainly {{depend on the}} {{religion}} of the family of the deceased. There is a mix of religions, such as Buddhist, Catholic, Born-Again Chrisitian, [...] within the Chinese-Filipino sector of the Philippines. This is mainly {{due to the fact that}} initial Chinese settlers in the country were Buddhist, while <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren</b> would incorporate the mainstream religion of the country because of their Filipino-based education and exposure. Therefore, most Chinese-Filipino funeral practices are a mix of the fundamental funeral practices of such religions stated above.|$|E

2500|$|Second, the Amsterdam Jewish {{community}} was largely composed of former [...] "conversos" [...] {{who had fled}} from the Portuguese Inquisition within the previous century, with <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren.</b> This community must have been concerned to protect its reputation from any association with Spinoza lest his controversial views {{provide the basis for}} their own possible persecution or expulsion. There is little evidence that the Amsterdam municipal authorities were directly involved in Spinoza's censure itself. But [...] "in 1619, the town council expressly ordered [...] to regulate their conduct and ensure that the members of the community kept to a strict observance of Jewish law." [...] Other evidence makes it clear that the danger of upsetting the civil authorities was never far from mind, such as bans adopted by the synagogue on public wedding or funeral processions and on discussing religious matters with Christians, lest such activity might [...] "disturb the liberty we enjoy." [...] Thus, the issuance of Spinoza's censure was almost certainly, in part, an exercise in self-censorship by the Portuguese Jewish community in Amsterdam.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} later, the pro-Mugabe Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) {{organised}} several people (including {{but not limited}} to war veterans; many of them were <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren)</b> to march on white-owned farmlands, initially with drums, song and dance. This movement was officially termed the [...] "Fast-Track Land Reform Program" [...] (FTLRP). The predominantly white farm owners were forced off their lands along with their workers, who were typically of regional descent. This was often done violently and without compensation. In this first wave of farm invasions, a total of 110,000 square kilometres of land had been seized. Several million black farm workers were excluded from the redistribution, leaving them without employment. According to Human Rights Watch, by 2002 the War Veterans Association had [...] "killed white farm owners in the course of occupying commercial farms" [...] on at least seven occasions, in addition to [...] "several tens of [...] farm workers". The first white farmers to die as a direct consequence of the resettlement programme were murdered by Zimbabwean paramilitaries in mid 2000. More commonly, violence was directed against farmworkers, who were often assaulted and killed by the war veterans and their supporters. Violent confrontations between the farmers and the war veterans occurred and resulted in exchanges of gunfire, as well as a state of armed siege on the affected farms.|$|E

60|$|The cave-man stalked {{from his}} hole under a cliff, boldly forth with his huge club or stone mace. Perhaps he stole his neighbor's woman, but if {{so he had}} more reason to hunt than before--he had to feed her as well as himself.

Long, long ages was the being called cave-man in developing; more long ages he lived on the earth, in that dim dark mystic past; and just as long were his descendants growing into another and higher type of barbarian. But they and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>grandchildren,</b> and all their successive, innumerable, and varying descendants had to hunt meat and eat meat to live.|$|E
