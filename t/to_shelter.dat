Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely had to rely on locally available materials.|$|E

During the 1997 rebellion in Albania, the townspeople of Sarandë in southern Albania were reported to have taken up positions in bunkers around the town in the face of fighting between government troops and rebels.

5|$|By August {{the plan}} was already behind schedule: severe {{shortages}} of stores and wages slowed work at the Brest shipyards, while the troops {{set aside for the}} invasion of Cornwall proved unreliable, deserting in large numbers. A practice voyage of the Cornish invasion fleet ended in total failure, as the small ships intended for the operation proved unable to operate in open water. The plan was dropped and the reliable soldiers from the unit were merged into the Ireland expeditionary force and the rest returned to prison. Reinforcements from the Mediterranean Fleet were also delayed: seven ships from the expedition under Contre-amiral Joseph de Richery had <b>to</b> <b>shelter</b> from the British blockade squadron in Rochefort, only arriving in Brest on 8 December, while a second squadron under Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve did not arrive until after the expeditionary force had departed.|$|E
25|$|C. lectularius only feeds {{every five}} to seven days, which {{suggests}} {{that it does not}} spend the majority of its life searching for a host. When a bed bug is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches for a host. If it successfully feeds, it returns <b>to</b> its <b>shelter.</b> If it does not feed, it continues to search for a host. After searching—regardless of whether or not it has eaten—the bed bug returns <b>to</b> the <b>shelter</b> <b>to</b> aggregate before the photophase (period of light during a day-night cycle). Reis argues that two reasons explain why C. lectularius would return <b>to</b> its <b>shelter</b> and aggregate after feeding. One is to find a mate and the other is <b>to</b> find <b>shelter</b> <b>to</b> avoid getting smashed after eating.|$|R

5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge <b>to</b> <b>shelter</b> and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of the Great Migration of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E

French boarding parties extinguished the fires and rehung the struck ensign upside down to signify that Hannibal had surrendered. However, in the Royal Navy an inverted flag is a signal of distress, and at least one British ship's boat was captured while attempting to bring assistance to Ferris before the misunderstanding was realised.|$|E

5|$|Ownership of Amman {{following}} Sirghitmish's {{death in}} 1358 passed to successive generations of his descendants until 1395, when his descendants {{sold it to}} Emir Baydamur al-Khwarazmi, the na'ib as-saltana (viceroy) of Damascus. Afterward, part of Amman's cultivable lands were sold to Emir Sudun al-Shaykhuni (died 1396), the na'ib as-saltana of Egypt. The increasingly frequent division and sale {{of the city and}} lands of Amman to different owners signaled declining revenues coming from Amman, while at the same time, Hisban was restored as the major city of the Balqa in the 15th century. From then until 1878, Amman was an abandoned site periodically used <b>to</b> <b>shelter</b> seasonal farmers who cultivated arable lands in its vicinity and by Bedouin tribes who used its pastures and water.|$|E

By 1811, Royal Navy control of the French coast was so entrenched that French ships were unable to travel safely even in French territorial waters.

There they came under sustained attack and Elisa was destroyed, Amazone successfully slipping back to Le Havre under cover of darkness.
