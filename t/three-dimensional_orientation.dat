50|$|A second key {{concept is}} that {{movement}} along a buffer line must correspond {{to a change}} in PCO2. Thus, like the isopleths, the buffer line as drawn on a typical Davenport Diagram (e.g., Fig 6) is actually the projection of a line existing in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane. As with the isopleths, buffer lines in their actual <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientation</b> are confined to the surface representing the values of PCO2, HCO3− and pH that satisfy equilibrium for the system. In Fig. 10, the dark red lines are the actual buffer lines in three-dimensional space, while the light red lines are the projections of the buffer lines onto a two-dimensional plane.

However, the electromagnetic wave nature of light in free space sets a fundamental limit on the <b>three-dimensional</b> polarization <b>orientation</b> of a light beam. Although a high numerical aperture objective can be used to bend the wavefront of a radially polarized beam to generate the longitudinal polarization state in the focal volume, the arbitrary <b>three-dimensional</b> polarization <b>orientation</b> of a beam has not been achieved yet. Here we present a novel technique for generating arbitrary <b>three-dimensional</b> polarization <b>orientation</b> by a single optically configured vectorial beam. As a consequence, by applying this technique to gold nanorods, orientation-unlimited polarization encryption with ultra-security is demonstrated.

40|$|The {{histogram}} of gradients for three-dimensional images (HOG 3 D) {{has been}} widely used to generate descriptors of local features for the matching of salient interest blobs between volumetric medical images. The distinctiveness of descriptors is essential to match similar patterns as well as differentiate different patterns. However, most methods for HOG 3 D {{are based on the}} unequal azimuth-elevation-angle division of the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientations,</b> leading to the reduction of the distinctiveness. This paper presents a description method to extract distinctive descriptors by using a novel histogram of gradients based on the maximum directional derivative (HOG 3 DMAX). The <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientations</b> are divided equally into 24 homogeneous regions for the bins of gradient histogram to improve the distinctiveness. In addition, the interpolation of gradients is applied in HOG 3 DMAX according to the relatively simple form of the homogeneous regions in order to avoid harmful effects from boundary in images. Experiments were performed on three sets with different extents of similarity. The cluster analysis and classification accuracy were utilized to validate the proposed method. Compared with the commonly used azimuth-elevation based method, the new method shows lower intra-cluster pairwise distances relative to inter-cluster pairwise distances, and achieved 5 % higher classification accuracy. The results indicate the improvement of distinctiveness by using equally divided regions and the interpolation of gradients. We conclude that the HOG 3 DMAX is an effective description method for three-dimensional images.

40|$|Directional {{estimation}} is {{a common}} problem in many tracking applications. Traditional filters such as the Kalman filter perform poorly because they fail to take the periodic {{nature of the problem}} into account. We present a recursive filter for directional data based on the Bingham distribution in two dimensions. The proposed filter can be applied to circular filtering problems with 180 degree symmetry, i. e., rotations by 180 degrees cannot be distinguished. It is easily implemented using standard numerical techniques and suitable for real-time applications. The presented approach is extensible to quaternions, which allow tracking arbitrary <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientations.</b> We evaluate our filter in a challenging scenario and compare it to a traditional Kalman filtering approach...|$|R
5000|$|In {{structural}} geology, rake (or pitch) is formally {{defined as}} [...] "the angle between a line a feature and the strike {{line of the}} plane {{in which it is}} found", measured on the plane. The <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientation</b> of a line can be described with just a plunge and trend. The rake is a useful description of a line because often (in geology) features (lines) follow along a planar surface. In these cases the rake can be used to describe the line's orientation in three dimensions relative to that planar surface. One might also expect to see this used when the particular line is hard to measure directly (possibly due to outcrops impeding measurement). The rake always sweeps down from the horizontal plane.|$|E

50|$|A more {{accurate}} depiction would involve three axes. Figure 9 shows a Davenport Diagram in three dimensions. The light blue lines indicate the isopleths {{as we would}} normally encounter them, confined to a two-dimensional plane. The dark blue curves show the actual locations of the isopleths in three dimensions. Thus, the light blue lines are simply the projections of the isopleths in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane. Again, recall that an isopleth is just a titration curve—that is, the path that is traced if pH is varied while PCO2 is held constant. The green surface describes all combinations of PCO2, HCO3− and pH that satisfy equilibrium for the system. All isopleths in their actual <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientations</b> must be confined to this surface.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A match-to-sample {{task was}} performed, in which {{observers}} compared configurations of line segments presented stereoscopically in different <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientations.</b> Several different structural properties of these configurations were manipulated, including the relative orientations of line segments (a Euclidean property), their coplanarity (an affine property), and their patterns of cointersection (a topological property). Although {{the differences in}} these properties to be detected were all metrically equivalent, they varied dramatically in their relative perceptual salience, such that the error rates and reaction times in the three conditions varied {{by as much as}} 400 %. Performance was highest in the topological condition, intermediate in the affine condition, and lowest in the Euclidean condition. These findings suggest that the relative perceptual salience of object properties may be systematically related to their structural stability under change, {{in a manner that is}} similar to the Klein hierarchy of geometries. ...|$|R

The time-dependent one-dimensional and <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientation</b> of a thermal ensemble of 6 - chloropyridazine- 3 -carbonitrile molecules in combined linearly or elliptically polarized laser fields and tilted dc electric fields is computed. The results are in good agreement with recent experimental results of one-dimensional orientation for weak dc electric fields [J. L. Hansen, J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234313 (2013) ]. Moreover, they predict that using elliptically polarized laser fields or strong dc fields, <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientation</b> is obtained.

The orientation search problem is formalized as a constrained line arrangement problem that is of independent interest. The negative complexity results give a partial justification for the heuristic methods used in orientation search, and the positive complexity results on the orientation search have some positive implications also to the problem of finding functionally analogous genes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — When {{presented}} with an object to be manipulated, a robot {{must consider the}} set of actions available for interaction. How might an agent acquire this mapping from object representation to action? In this paper, we describe an approach that learns a mapping from objects to grasps from human demonstration. For a given object, the teacher demonstrates a set of feasible grasps. We cluster these grasps {{in terms of the}} corresponding orientation of the hand. Individual clusters of these <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>orientations</b> are represented using probability density functions that take on Gaussian-like shapes, and thus correspond to variations around canonical approach orientations. Multiple clusters are captured through a mixture distribution-based representation. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting a compact set of canonical grasps from the human demonstration. Each of these canonical grasps can then be used to parameterize a reach controller that brings the robot hand into a specific (and functional) spatial relationship with the object. 1 Index Terms — Grasp affordance, learning from demonstration, clustering, mixture models, probabilistic densities of 3 D rotations I...|$|R
