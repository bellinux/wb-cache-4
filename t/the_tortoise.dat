The unique emblem of <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> Club is <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> badge. The College of Arms' narrative should not be misunderstood to imply use of <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> emblem by the general Oriel College Boat Club membership or members of the Oriel Society – these have their own appropriate emblematic devices.|$|E
5|$|As, {{according}} to Bulgarian mythology {{and some other}} traditions, tortoises were the only beings who knew {{the appearance of the}} herb and the location where it grows, such people would try to obtain the raskovnik by deceiving a tortoise. They would find a tortoise nesting site and hem it in with a fence while <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> is away. When it returns, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> would be unable to access its eggs, so it would return with a raskovnik in order to breach the fence. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> would reveal the herb and people would acquire it from <b>the</b> <b>tortoise,</b> which does not need it anymore.|$|E
5|$|The long-time {{informal}} {{emblem of}} <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> Club (1st Summer VIII and 1st Torpid crews), was formalized in {{a grant to}} the College by Letters Patent dated 20 April 2009 of Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster King of Arms. The Badge is blazoned A Tortoise displayed the shell circular Azure charged with two concentric annulets Argent. The grant is formulated to provide the College, the Boat Club, and the Oriel Society (Oriel's Alumni society) use of the badge in relation to Tortoise Club alumni activities; <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> Club is not itself an incorporated entity and does not bear Arms in its own right; therefore {{it could not be}} granted such a heraldic Badge directly.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, <b>the</b> Outdoor <b>Tortoise</b> Enclosure {{was laid}} out. It {{is meant to}} imitate the animals' natural habitat, with many stony burrows for <b>the</b> <b>tortoises</b> to retreat into and foliage in the {{enclosure}} for <b>the</b> <b>tortoises</b> to consume. Within the enclosure, {{there is also a}} small stream and 'warming shelters': Plexiglass containers into which <b>the</b> <b>tortoises</b> can go to warm themselves up.Previously, <b>the</b> <b>tortoises</b> were housed in the same building as the aquarium, where they had a large enclosure strewn with sand and into which warming lamps were placed.|$|R

50|$|To restock {{their food}} {{supplies}} for the long journey, Essex sailed for Charles Island (later renamed Floreana Island) in the Galápagos Islands group. The crew needed to fix a serious leak and initially anchored off Hood Island (now known as Española Island) on 8 October. Over seven days they captured 300 Galápagos giant <b>tortoises</b> to supplement <b>the</b> ship's food stores. They then sailed for Charles Island, where on 22 October they took another 60 <b>tortoises.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tortoises</b> weighed from 100 lb to 800 lb each. The sailors captured them alive and allowed {{some of them to}} roam the ship at will; the rest they kept in the hold. The sailors believed <b>the</b> <b>tortoises</b> were capable of living for a year without eating or drinking water (though in fact <b>the</b> <b>tortoises</b> slowly starved). <b>The</b> sailors considered <b>the</b> <b>tortoises</b> delicious and extremely nutritious and would butcher them at sea as needed.|$|R
5|$|White's {{frequent}} {{accounts in}} The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne of his tortoise Timothy, inherited from his aunt, {{form the basis}} for a variety of literary mentions. Verlyn Klinkenborg's book, Timothy; or, Notes of an Abject Reptile (2006) is based wholly on that reptile, as is Sylvia Townsend Warner's The Portrait of a Tortoise (1946). <b>The</b> <b>tortoise</b> also finds its way into science, as its species, Testudo whitei (Bennett 1836), long thought to be a synonym of Testudo graeca, has been rediscovered in Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Although the IUCN {{lists the}} Rodrigues {{solitaire}} as going extinct by 1778, the species probably became extinct some {{time between the}} 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> trade between 1730 and 1750, when traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires, and released cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks. In 1755, Joseph-François Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen, {{as he had been}} assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island. After searching for 18 months and offering large rewards, he could find none. He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species, but suspected that it was really due to hunting by humans. When he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, Alexandre Guy Pingré encountered no solitaires, although he had been assured that they survived.|$|E

Alexandre Guy Pingré did not encounter any solitaires when he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, although he had been assured they survived. His friend Pierre Charles Le Monnier named the constellation Turdus Solitarius after the bird to commemorate the journey. Although the Rodrigues solitaire is the only extinct bird to have a former constellation named for it, celestial mapmakers did not know what it looked like and star maps depict other birds.|$|E

50|$|This zone is {{also home}} to Aldabra giant <b>tortoises,</b> one of <b>the</b> largest species of <b>tortoises</b> in <b>the</b> world.

5000|$|Shell {{size and}} shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, <b>the</b> <b>tortoises</b> are larger, with domed shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, <b>the</b> <b>tortoises</b> are smaller, with [...] "saddleback" [...] shells and long necks.

25|$|In {{the paradox}} of Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>tortoise,</b> Achilles is in a footrace with <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b> Achilles allows <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> a head start of 100 meters, for example. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some {{constant}} speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b>|$|E

25|$|This {{argument}} {{is called the}} Dichotomy because it involves repeatedly splitting a distance into two parts. It contains {{some of the same}} elements as the Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> paradox, but with a more apparent conclusion of motionlessness. It is also known as the Race Course paradox. Some, like Aristotle, regard the Dichotomy as really just another version of Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{origins of}} the paradoxes are {{somewhat}} unclear.

25|$|In some myths, he is a trickster and outwits other gods {{for his own}} {{satisfaction}} or for {{the sake}} of humankind.

25|$|As well as {{the usual}} yellow and deep red colourings, many coccinellid species are mostly, or entirely, black, dark grey, gray, or brown, and may be {{difficult}} for non-entomologists to recognise as coccinellids at all. Conversely, non-entomologists might easily mistake many other small beetles for coccinellids. For example, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> beetles, like the ladybird beetles, look similar because they are shaped so that they can cling to a flat surface so closely that ants and many other enemies cannot grip them.|$|E

Australian scientists have developed methods to identify medicines containing DNA traces of endangered species. Finally, although not an endangered species, sharp rises in exports of donkeys and donkey hide from Africa to China to make the traditional remedy ejiao have prompted export restrictions by some African countries.|$|E
