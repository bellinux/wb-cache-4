40|$|Heedless to the {{repetition}} of catastrophic events that affect various places on earth, contemporary man often forgets that such events will strike again in the same places, bringing the same desperation to the population, the same loss of material assets and monuments, the erasure of collective identities and the suffering of other human beings. Convinced that modern progress and technique would remove all traumas of the past, mankind immediately activated processes aimed at compensating lost heritage, often without the consideration {{of the impact of}} such decisions, hurried and extraneous to their social context, on the population and the historical and natural environment. Previous generations, on the contrary, learnt in both a conscious and intuitive way from such experiences, devising continually improved solutions to protect the buildings that surrounded them, such as those built by their forefathers and the houses in which they carried out their daily life. They also understood that in order to mitigate the devastating action of earthquakes, ty-phoons and tsunamis, a balanced pact with nature had to be made: an equal give and take. As a result <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice</b> techniques tried and developed over centuries, giving rise to build-ings which both ‘belonged’ to their surroundings and created a national identity, responding in a harmonious and coherent way to both climatic and environmental needs: such constructions made use of local materials and by artisans that had practiced their trades for centuries. But above all, man had learned that, when a system of building revealed some weakness, where a builder’s inexperience led him to commit some error, he would have to invent new solutions to improve inadequate structures, innovating, only to the degree necessary, in order to confirm what he had inherited from the past, and what he felt obliged to transmit to the future. In order to succeed he traditionally pursued two methods: prevention and the repair of damages. It is these two procedures that we wish to return to here in an effort to provide, in a contemporary setting, methodological tools for confronting and managing emergencies (before they happen) and consequences (after the destructive event), without losing the spirit and identity of place...|$|E
40|$|Product {{development}} {{has become an}} important competitive factor for most companies. A central task is to select which projects, often from {{a large number of}} project proposals, are to be developed in order to achieve strategic objectives without exceeding available resources. Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is the research discipline which focuses on the decision-making processes used to evaluate, select and prioritise projects. Previous research has stated that companies must be able to select and commit resources to different types of ideas and projects. However, it is widely believed that PPM literature has not sufficiently investigated the challenges that companies might face when putting into practice different decision-making approaches to select different types of ideas and projects. This thesis aims to explore how different types of ideas and projects are evaluated and selected {{in the context of the}} development of complex technological products. It is based on a qualitative research approach and interviews and observations have been carried out with the cooperation of six companies. The findings of this thesis reveal that because different decision-making approaches encounter different levels of acceptance within an organisation, the dynamics by which an idea evolves are affected by the way in which decision makers deal with the legitimacy of the decision-making approaches that <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice.</b> Decision makers use some mechanisms that allow them to avoid drawing exclusively on the highly accepted approaches when they are not considered to be suitable, and to give legitimacy to the decisions that have been made by the less accepted approaches. In addition, the way in which decision makers experience a decision situation influences how it is approached. If they experience ambiguity, they might display a decision-making logic in which actions are allowed to be taken within self-organised social interactions, in order to make sense of the idea, project or criteria. However, the occurrence of self-organised interactions is conditioned by how decision makers negotiate resources with stakeholders that display different interests and decision-making logics. These findings question the objective view that assumes that ideas and projects are already defined at the moment the decision is made and are able to be classified in pre-defined categories. It also led to the question of whether problems in fulfilling resource allocation plans and the risk of biases in decision making are problems that arise due to poor decision-making practices, and whether they should, instead, be understood as probable consequences of a flexible process. Finally, this thesis explores a way of enhancing decision makers’ abilities through scenarios in which decision makers experience decision situations and reflect on their own ways of making decisions.

40|$|Introduction: Farm {{health and}} safety has {{historically}} focussed on strategies such as injury prevention, safety audits and fulfilling legislative responsibilities. However, farmer injuries mask deeper health issues including higher rates of cancer, suicides, cardiovascular disease and stress. The relationship between occupational {{health and safety}} and farm family health has not been fully investigated. The Sustainable Farm Families (SFF) project attempts to make this connection in order to address premature death, morbidity and injury on Australian farms. The SFF project illustrates how increasing health literacy through education and physical assessment can lead to improved health and knowledge outcomes for farm families. Methods: The SFF project focuses on the human resource in the triple bottom line and is working with farmers, families, industry and universities to collaboratively assess and promote improvement in the health and wellbeing of farm families. Based on a model of extension that engages farm families as active learners where they commit to healthy living and safe working practices, the SFF project is proving to be an effective model for engaging communities in learning and change. Health education and information is delivered to farm men and women aged 18 to 75 years using a workshop format. Pre- and post-knowledge surveys, annual physical assessments and focus group discussions form the methodological context for the research over a three-year intervention. Results: This article discusses the progress of the research outlining the design of the SFF project, the delivery and extension processes used to engage 321 farm families from within a broadacre and dairy-farming family sample. The article presents key learnings on intersectoral collaboration, engaging farmers and families in health, and the future for this project extending into agricultural industries across the nation. Key results reveal that health issues do exist in farming families and are often underreported by family members. Health indicators were at a level where referral and intervention was required in over 60 % of men and 70 % of women in both broad acre and dairy industries. Farm men and women verbalised health concerns relating to access, support and control mechanisms of the health system. Participants also revealed how <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice</b> their new knowledge and how this has influenced their health. Conclusions: The key learning is that farm {{men and women who are}} at high risk of premature morbidity and mortality will participate in health education and assessment programs based on industry collaboration with high levels of individual participation. This program provides evidence that farmers will engage with health professionals if programs are presented to them in personally engaging and relevant ways. The SFF program is a definite tool for interventional health promotion that supports attitudinal change to health and farming practices. <br /...|$|E

Como diretora do GTC, foi reconhecida pela crítica especializada ao ser premiada pela montagem de Jorge Dandin. A partir de 1968, quando foi instaurado o AI - 5, que tolheu os direitos dos civis, Heleny abandonou o teatro e entrou na luta armada, foi presa, torturada e certamente assassinada. Esta pesquisa reconstitui a biografia de Heleny, os seus passos como diretora e o seu legado como personagem histórica do teatro brasileiro, através de documentos oficiais e entrevistas com familiares, amigos, historiadores e pessoas que a conheceram ou trabalharam com ela.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{of common}} {{knowledge}} that the timeline {{of the history of}} translation in imperial China is marked by three particularly significant moments, namely: the period of assimilation of Buddhism from the late Han to the Tang ; the time of the Jesuits’ missionary and scientific endeavor, between the late Ming and the reign of Qianlong ; the new era opened by the continuous contacts between China and the West, starting around the mid-nineteenth century. Beside these three notable moments, one should add the general activity of interpretation implied by the countinuous relationships between the imperial state and the neighbouring states and alien peoples. In this classical frame, which is concerned only by translating processes implying foreign languages, one issue is never taken into consideration as being part of the translation field : the relationship that existed between classical and vernacular forms of written texts within the same Chinese language. It is a well kown fact that the writing activity in China was marked by a continuous state of diglossia between the two registers, that lasted no less than a whole millenium, spanning from the Tang period to {{the very end of the}} empire. Although this is hard fact, it is suffering today from a lack of analysis and even of appreciation, which is extremely surprising when we remember how deep-rooted and wide-ranging it was, but the absence of reflexion on this topic can be explained to some extent by the heritage of the contempt in which the literati class traditionally affected to hold the vernacular literary production such as the novel and other imaginary works. At the most it will be agreed that there existed, in the vernacular literary creation, a certain relationship between sources in classical Chinese and texts in vernacular, which implied a certain amount of transposition and amplification. But this relationship—and this may be due to the prevalence, in China of the commentarial tradition—has never been assessed in terms of translation, not even in language-related terms: but rather (and often rather vaguely, for that matter) in terms of “inspiration” or “influence”, whatever these words may mean. This being said we have to admit that, if translation is implied here, it will be of the intralingual kind, a field that, as we know, has always been the poor cousin of the theoretical elaboration in matter of translation studies since the classical distinction made by Roman Jakobson decades ago (1959). And yet, a close examination of the relationship between source texts and target texts, whenever classical and vernacular registers of writing are involved, shows how the writing strategies of the Chinese authors were relevant not only to the domain of discourse, with the transmission of ideas, but to the domain of language as well, in its own right, and how rich and complex were the procedures of intralingual translation <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>into</b> <b>practice.</b> Plain translation, quotation, amplification, commentary, and adaptation, combined into a multifaceted rewriting activity that showed a keen awareness of the fundamentally linguistic aspects of the classical vs. / vernacular differentiation. One should add that these strategies were not uniform but changed deeply according to periods. Our knowledge of the phenomena at stake improves as more and more research is dedicated to the exploration of the true landscape of the vernacular cultures in the second millenium of imperial China. What could be deemed a “translational literacy” in classical and premodern China, which emerged from the diglossic, or even pluriglossic, relationship between classical and vernacular languages, was not only a fact that concerned creation in the well known field of literature of fiction, like theater and novel: it is actually possible to demonstrate how it was involved in such varied domains as religion, philosophy and the Classics, and even within classical literature like poetry. Additionally these language-related facts could not occur without their particular social backgrounds, with the the evolution of the public sphere and the emergence of new audiences. My paper presents itself as a form of manifesto for a change of paradigm in the analysis of the longlasting coexistence of the two regimes—classical and vernacular—that were constituent of the rich experience of diglossia in imperial China. The study of this dual situation shows how the apparently monolingual culture of China was actually filled with questions that were translational in nature. Through this example one could argue that the practice of translation is the experience of an “other of the language” which is not necessarily an experience of the foreign, to paraphrase Antoine Berman, but may also something that can occur within the boundaries of a single language...|$|E
