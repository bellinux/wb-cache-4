5|$|That day, Lützow had led {{a flight}} of six Me262s of JV44 against a force of 256 medium bombers of the 322nd and 344th Bombardment Group (344th BG). Lützow's flight {{included}} Hauptmann Walter Krupinski and Oberleutnant Klaus Neumann. Two of the Me262s had to abort the mission due to engine problems. The remaining four, of which at least Lützow's and Neumann's Me262s were armed with the R4M air-to-air rockets, attacked elements of 344thBG. Following the first attack, at least three B-26 Marauder bombers were seen <b>trailing</b> <b>smoke,</b> when the Me262s came under attack by P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft of the 365th Fighter Group. Blue Flight leader Captain Jerry G. Mast and his wingman, Second Lieutenant Byron Smith, went into full power dives to drive the attacking Me262s away. Following the dive, Smith got separated from Mast and pursued an Me262. Mast and Second Lieutenant William H. Myers then jointly went after another Me262 which went into an even steeper dive. The Me262 was seen crashing {{into the ground and}} exploding. In Forsyth's account, the Me262 chased by Mast and Myers was Lützow's and had been flying furthest to the south.|$|E

Charlie Stephens, who was age 10, told how he saw the airship <b>trailing</b> <b>smoke</b> as it headed north toward Aurora. He wanted to see what happened, but his father made him finish his chores; later, he told how his father went to town the next day and saw wreckage from the crash.|$|E

His closing words were : [...] "I congratulate all the athletes and officials who were part of the Games.

500|$|Clisby {{was still}} wearing his RAAF uniform on 15May when he went into action with his flight against more than thirty Bf110s over Reims. Having {{destroyed}} two of the German heavy fighters, Clisby's Hurricane was seen going down with its cockpit <b>trailing</b> <b>smoke</b> and flames, evidently hit by cannon fire. He was initially posted as [...] "missing", along {{with one of his}} comrades, Flying Officer Lorimer, whose plane was also seen losing height in the same action. The French later found two burnt-out Hurricanes in the vicinity, which were identified as [...] Clisby's and Lorimer's. Clisby died without knowing that he had been awarded the DFC.

Sebille had intended to release his second bomb, but he radioed Johnson that he had been hit and injured, probably fatally. Johnson radioed back Sebille should try to head for a US emergency landing strip in Taegu a short distance away, but Sebille responded with his last known words, [...] "No, I'll never make it. I'm going back and get that bastard (sic)". He dove straight toward the APC that was his target. He fired his six rockets in salvo, but instead of pulling up to the regular , he deliberately continued to dive his airplane and the remaining bomb straight into the target, firing his six machine guns. His plane sustained even heavier damage, and he crashed into the North Korean convoy destroying a large contingent of North Korean ground troops and vehicles though being killed instantly himself.|$|E

60|$|The 10th of August, 1852, brought {{little change}} to the dull monotony of wind, fog, and {{treeless}} coast line. Only the sea was occasionally flecked with racing sails that outstripped the old, slow-creeping trader, or was at times streaked and blurred with the <b>trailing</b> <b>smoke</b> of a steamer. There were a few strange footprints on those virgin sands, and a fresh track, that led from the beach over the rounded hills, dropped into the bosky recesses of a hidden valley beyond the coast range.|$|E

6000|$|One bright December mid-day lately I spent {{down on the}} New Jersey sea-shore, {{reaching}} it by {{a little}} more than an hour's railroad trip over the old Camden and Atlantic. I had started betimes, fortified by nice strong coffee and a good breakfast (cook'd by the hands I love, my dear sister Lou's--how much better it makes the victuals taste, and then assimilate, strengthen you, perhaps make the whole day comfortable afterwards.) Five or six miles at the last, our track enter'd a broad region of salt grass meadows, intersected by lagoons, and cut up everywhere by watery runs. The sedgy perfume, delightful to my nostrils, reminded me of [...] "the mash" [...] and south bay of my native island. I could have journey'd contentedly till night through these flat and odorous sea-prairies. From half-past 11 till 2 I was nearly all the time along the beach, or in sight of the ocean, listening to its hoarse murmur, and inhaling the bracing and welcome breezes. First, a rapid five-mile drive over the hard sand--our carriage wheels hardly made dents in it. Then after dinner (as there were nearly two hours to spare) I walk'd off in another direction, (hardly met or saw a person,) and taking possession of what appear'd to have been the reception-room of an old bath-house range, had a broad expanse of view all to myself--quaint, refreshing, unimpeded--a dry area of sedge and Indian grass immediately before and around me--space, simple, unornamented space. Distant vessels, and the far-off, just visible <b>trailing</b> <b>smoke</b> of an inward bound steamer; more plainly, ships, brigs, schooners, in sight, most of them with every sail set to the firm and steady wind.|$|E
