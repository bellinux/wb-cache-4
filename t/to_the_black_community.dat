25|$|In {{spite of}} the anti-segregationist opinions, St. Louisans {{overwhelmingly}} supported the ordinance at the polls, passing the first initiative-based segregation ordinance in the country {{by a vote of}} 52,220 to 17,877. Lower class white wards adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community</b> voted for segregation by a margin of eight to one, and the wealthy and elite Central West End voted in favor by four to one. Only predominantly black wards showed a majority in opposition. According to the law, no person could move onto a block where 75% of that block's inhabitants were of a different race. However, a court injunction filed by the NAACP invalidated the ordinance in April 1916, and after a Supreme Court decision in 1918, the injunction was made permanent. Although the ordinance was invalidated, private restrictive covenants began appearing in St. Louis real estate transactions that limited the ability of white owners to sell to blacks.|$|E

Children of middle class black immigrants undergo assimilation that coincides with one of the pathways theorized by segmented assimilation, in which they assimilate into mainstream society while attempting to hold on to their black culture. These children make use of the resources available to the middle class in the U.S. to prosper alongside their white counterparts, but are still affected by racial discrimination. They make use of so-called [...] "black spaces," [...] which are spaces exclusive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community,</b> such as networks and ethnic enclaves designed for African Americans. Thus these spaces are free of racism and are used to connect with other African Americans and reconnect with the cultures of their parents.

However, many in predominantly white south St. Louis perceived these projects as too favorable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> <b>community,</b> while economic problems such as inflation contributed to a need for city budget cuts. These budget cuts led to the closure of Homer G. Phillips Hospital in north St. Louis, which had served the black community since the 1930s. Conway faced a challenger for his reelection bid in Vincent Schoemehl, a young south St. Louis alderman whose campaign depended on strong support from the black community, and due to the alienation felt in both north and south St. Louis, Schoemehl defeated Conway in the 1980 Democratic primary election. In the general election, Schoemehl narrowly lost the white vote against the Republican candidate, but his overwhelming support from the black community ensured his election as mayor. To gain such support, Schoemehl had promised to reopen Homer G. Phillips Hospital, although after his election he reneged on that promise.
