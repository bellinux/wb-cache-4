5|$|Richard I was crowned King in 1189 and {{announced}} {{his intention to}} join the Crusades; this inflamed anti-Jewish sentiment. Rumours began to spread that the king had ordered that the English Jews be attacked. In York, tensions broke out into violence the following year. Richard de Malbis, who owed money to the powerful Jewish merchant Aaron of Lincoln, exploited an accidental house fire to incite a local mob to attack the home and family of a recently deceased Jewish employee of Aaron in York. Josce of York, {{the leader of the}} Jewish community, led the local Jewish families into the royal castle, where they took refuge in the wooden keep. The mob surrounded the castle, and when the constable left the castle to discuss the situation, the Jews, fearing the entry of the mob or being handed over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheriff,</b> refused to allow him back in. The constable appealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheriff,</b> who called out his own men and laid siege to the keep. The siege continued until 16 March when the Jews' position became untenable. Their religious leader, Rabbi Yomtob, proposed an act of collective suicide to avoid being killed by the mob, and the castle was set on fire to prevent their bodies being mutilated after their deaths. Several Jews perished in the flames but the majority took their own lives rather than give themselves up to the mob. A few Jews did surrender, promising to convert to Christianity, but they were killed by the angry crowd. Around 150 Jews died in total in the massacre. The keep was rebuilt, again in wood, on the motte, which was raised in height by 13 feet (4 metres) at a cost of £207.|$|E
5|$|The FA Charity Shield {{was founded}} in 1908 as a {{successor}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff</b> of London Charity Shield, and began as a contest between the respective champions of the Football League and Southern League, although in 1913 it was played between an Amateurs XI and a Professionals XI. In 1921, it was played by the league champions of the Football League First Division and the FA Cup winners for the first time. The 1974 match was the first Charity Shield game to be played at Wembley Stadium as the Football Association (the FA) tried to revive {{the status of the}} match as a traditional season curtain-raiser by moving it to the country's showpiece venue. Furthermore, it was televised live {{for the first time ever}} and the FA insisted on the champions and cup winners both taking part for the first time since 1970.|$|E

50|$|For {{a period}} prior <b>to</b> 1566 <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff</b> of Warwickshire was also <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff</b> of Leicestershire.

This would mark the first occasion Corinthians would play in the competition, they had previously won the Sheriff of London Charity Shield on four occasions.|$|E
5|$|Edward I gave wide-reaching powers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> of Yorkshire for {{enforcing}} law {{and order}} in the city of York, and the sheriffs established their headquarters in Clifford's Tower. During the wars against the Scots under both Edward and his son, York Castle also formed the centre of royal administration in England for almost half the years between 1298 and 1338. Many Westminster institutions followed the king north to York, basing themselves in the castle compound. The existing castle buildings were insufficient to house all the administrative institutions; a temporary building inside the castle was built for the Court of Common Pleas {{at the beginning of the}} period, and rebuilt on a larger scale during 1319–20. The Exchequer took over Clifford's Tower. Other buildings around the city had to be commandeered to absorb the overflow from the castle itself. As a result of the extended use of the castle for these purposes, the law courts at York Castle began to compete with those in London, a pattern that lasted into the 1360s. The castle eventually acquired its own mint in 1344, when Edward III decided to create a permanent mint in York Castle to produce gold and silver coins to serve the needs of the north of England. European coiners were brought to York to establish the facility.|$|E
5|$|Forests {{were special}} areas {{of land in}} medieval England, owned by the Crown and subject to forest law. They were often {{selected}} because of their natural resources, and were expected to provide the Crown with a flow of money or raw materials. In 1195, the Forest of Dartmoor extended across all of Devon, but in 1204 John curtailed {{the extent of the}} royal forest, removing much of Devon from Forest Law and leaving the area known in the modern period as Dartmoor. This reduced forest was still subject to the Forest Laws, involving a specialised group of legal officials who met at Lydford Castle to impose fines and other punishments. Probably both Lydford Castle and the forest was given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sheriff</b> of Devon, William Brewer, in 1216. The arrangement changed under Henry III, when the estates were given to Richard, the Earl of Cornwall in 1239. Legally, this meant that the Forest of Dartmoor was converted to a chase, although the Earls of Cornwall continued to hold law courts at Lydford Castle, enforcing chase laws that closely resembled the former Forest Laws.|$|E

25|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Act, {{the main}} means of {{ensuring}} impartiality was by allowing legal challenges <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheriff's</b> choices. <b>The</b> new provisions did not specifically aim at establishing impartiality, but {{had the effect}} of reinforcing the authority of the jury by guaranteeing impartiality at the point of selection.|$|R

25|$|The {{composition}} {{follows the}} lives of three main characters named Charles, Mary Anne and LeRoi. Charles is a 25-year-old white man {{from a family of}} bankers, just back from college and ready to start a family. LeRoi is a young black man in his early 20s from a well-to-do black family and son of a preacher, off for the summer and ready for college. Mary Anne is a young white woman courted by Charles, but who falls in love with LeRoi. When Charles discovers what has happened while he was away at college, he beats Mary Anne and reports <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> that LeRoi beat and raped her. The town forms a lynch mob and the governor is set to attend. Feeling some remorse for what he had brought about, Charles confesses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sheriff</b> that he had beaten Mary Anne and that she never had been raped. The sheriff, unwilling to cancel due to the visit of the governor, allowed the lynching to proceed anyway.|$|E
