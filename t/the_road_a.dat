5|$|For proper {{protection}} of the wood turtle,in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging solution to the highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow the wood turtle to pass under <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>a</b> solution that helps prevent accidental deaths. Brochures and other media that warn people to avoid keeping the wood turtle as a pet are currently being distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable the wood turtle's survival.|$|E
5|$|Prior to independence, Croatian {{actors and}} filmmakers {{participated in the}} Yugoslav film {{industry}} and several films made by Croatian filmmakers or produced by Croatian-based film studios were submitted for Oscar consideration representing Yugoslavia.

5|$|In 1931, the County Board of Supervisors {{agreed to}} submit the Campo road for {{consideration}} as a secondary state highway. The state considered {{the inclusion of}} the Campo road into the system in 1932. The California State Legislature defined Route200 in 1933 as a route from San Diego to west of Jacumba, going through the town of Campo. The San Diego Chamber of Commerce sent a representative to ask the state for funding for paving the Campo highway in 1935, and the road was paved that year. The Chamber also asked for the war department to declare <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>a</b> military highway to receive federal assistance for its improvement. Signs were posted for SR94 in 1937, and by 1938, SR94 was signed along Broadway and Lemon Grove Boulevard (later Federal Boulevard) before continuing east to Campo.|$|E
5|$|In Chesapeake City, the Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway {{ends and}} MD 213 {{continues}} north {{as a part}} of the Atlantic to Appalachians Scenic Byway which crosses the state of Maryland. Past this interchange, MD 213 passes over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal on the Chesapeake City Bridge. Upon crossing the canal, the road intersects MD 285 (Lock Street), which provides access to the northern portion of Chesapeake City. Past MD 285, the route resumes through a mix of woodland and farmland, with residential areas increasing along <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>A</b> park and ride lot is located at the southeast corner of the Frenchtown Road intersection. It approaches the Elkton area and heads through residential areas.|$|E
5|$|In March 1779 the {{regiment}} was reassigned to the Northern Department, and marched to Springfield, Massachusetts. From Springfield they marched to Charlestown, New Hampshire {{and picked up}} clothing and supplies. They arrived in {{what was called the}} Coös Country of northern New Hampshire in May, and were tasked to build a road now known as the Bayley-Hazen Military Road from the Connecticut River to St. Jean, Quebec. Hazen had been secretly ordered to the area by Washington in April. Along with a large portion of Colonel Timothy Bedel's Regiment and Major Benjamin Whitcomb's New Hampshire rangers, they began to extend <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> <b>a</b> portion of which had been constructed in 1776 under the direction of Colonel Jacob Bayley.|$|E

5|$|M-204 {{was first}} {{designated}} on July 12, 1933 between Leland and Suttons Bay along what is today Duck Lake Road. The highway was paved {{by the middle}} of 1936. The road was realigned on July 13, 1939, across the narrows of Lake Leelanau in the village of the same name. Another realignment near Suttons Bay was completed on March 26, 1956, to smooth out a curve in <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>A</b> second completed on May 4, 1956, straightened a curve by Sylt Road east of Lake Leelanau. The western section was completely rebuilt between Duck Lake Corner and the Lake Leelanau Narrows Bridge to smooth out curves in the roadway. Sections not obliterated by the reconstruction were turned over to local control as Main Street or Old M-204 in Lake Leelanau when the project was finished on July 1, 1970.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 1942, Prime Minister John Curtin {{announced}} the war cabinet decision {{to name the}} newly constructed road Forrest Highway, for military purposes. Separately, the states' nomenclature committees were considering names for <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>A</b> proposal for a single name {{to be used in}} both states was put by the Western Australian committee to the South Australian committee when the highway was completed. Two names were suggested: Great Western Highway, in line with similar directional names in Western Australia, and Eyre Highway, after the explorer. After several communications between the committees, both decided to use the name Eyre Highway. After a receiving a letter from the South Australian Premier in May 1943, supporting the nomenclature committee's recommendation, Curtin agreed to the name, subject to approval from the Western Australian government.|$|E
5|$|Route 56 {{begins at}} Route 77 and CR 622 in Upper Deerfield Township, Cumberland County, a short {{distance}} north of Bridgeton.

The road heads into Deerfield Township, coming to a junction with CR 686. Past this intersection, Route 56 continues toward the community of Rosenhayn. Here, the road intersects CR 737 before running past homes and crossing CR 634, where there are some businesses along <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>A</b> short distance later, the route intersects CR 717, where it crosses into Pittsgrove Township in Salem County.|$|E

5|$|Sheridan Drive was {{constructed}} during the early1920s as {{a town of}} Tonawanda project to help alleviate the anticipated growth of the village of Kenmore. Despite its construction, the new road was not without controversy. During construction, new traffic lights were put in with concrete supports were opposed heavily by the town of Tonawanda and its residents, resulting in the traffic lights not having been built for many years. The town also felt that {{the construction of a}} superhighway {{in the middle of the}} country in Tonawanda was unjustified with the average traffic in that area. After construction of Sheridan Drive was completed in 1925, a monument with a statue of General Phillip Sheridan {{was constructed}} to commemorate the new road. However, the taxpayers feeling enough money had already been spent on the road, the statue of Sheridan was never constructed and only the monument to the road's construction was completed. In order to give <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>a</b> new look, the road had large trees planted throughout what was considered a desolate area at the time.|$|E
5|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive.

Later that same day the pumice and ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|The route heads {{through some}} {{residential}} neighborhoods before entering a commercial area with strip malls and some high-rise buildings where White Flint Mall, {{once one of}} the D.C. metropolitan area's largest shopping malls, was located {{on the east side of}} the road. The road comes to an intersection with Old Georgetown Road as well as a grade-separated interchange at Montrose Parkway. The Metro Red Line draws farther east from MD355 before it crosses into Rockville, the county seat of Montgomery County. In Rockville, the road passes more commercial development with a railroad line paralleling <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>a</b> short distance to the east. The route intersects MD 911 (First Street) and the Wootton Parkway. MD355 intersects MD 660 (Dodge Street), which is a short connector to MD 28 (Veirs Mill Road) that the route intersects a short distance later.|$|E
