5|$|Cerezeda finally set {{out with}} his {{expedition}} to the interior but was forced to return when Díaz de Herrera attempted to abandon Trujillo, <b>taking</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> colonists with him. Trujillo was now {{at the point of}} collapse; the Spanish lacked essential provisions, and although more Spanish soldiers had come to Honduras than were needed to overthrow Peru, the bitter Spanish infighting had resulted in the almost complete collapse of the colony. Trujillo was the only Spanish settlement left in the territory, and possessed less than 200 Spanish inhabitants. The Spanish assaults upon the native population had wreaked havoc upon them, but failed to successfully conquer any territory outside the immediate environs of Trujillo. The native population level collapsed, with many Indians being sold as slaves to supply the workforce on the plantations of the Caribbean islands. In 1533, an epidemic swept through the natives within the reduced Spanish area of control, killing half their number. The encomienda system was dysfunctional in the colony, with little tribute, and no rich mines of silver or gold. Many colonists had heard of the riches to be had in Peru, and threatened to leave. By 1534, the only richly inhabited native region left was the Naco valley; in desperation, Cerezeda once again planned to move the colony west to Naco.|$|E

25|$|This {{situation}} {{represents a}} conflict of interest and duty. Both X and Y hold fiduciary duties to each other, which means they must subdue their own interests in favor of the duo's collective interest.

Therefore, a court will find that X has breached his fiduciary duty. The judicial remedy here will be that X holds both the contract and the money in a constructive trust for the duo. Note, X will not be punished or totally denied of the benefit; both X and Y will receive a half share in the contract and the money.|$|E
25|$|Spain {{contributed to}} the {{independence}} of the British Thirteen Colonies together with France.

The Spanish governor of Louisiana (New Spain) Bernardo de Gálvez carried out an anti-British policy due to the numerous British attacks {{to take control of the}} richness of the Spanish Empire from more than a century ago. Spain and France were allies because of the Bourbon Pacte de Famille carried out by both countries against Britain. Bernardo de Gálvez took measures against British smuggling in the Caribbean sea and promoted trade with France.

25|$|Contemporary chroniclers are of {{the opinion}} that since Purandar Singha had passed his {{childhood}} through economic hardships during his father’s exile in Bengal, he was very much attracted to money and wealth. This explains the accusations which he had faced during both of his reigns. During his first reign, Purandar Singha and his father Brajanath Gohain, after being defeated by Burmese, fled to Guwahati <b>taking</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> valuables from the Royal treasury worth 3.5 million rupees, due to which the next ruler Chandrakanta Singha faced economic hardships in gathering mercenaries and maintaining the army to fight Burmese. During his second reign, as tributary prince under British, it was found that Purandar Singha was busy gathering personal wealth, instead of taking care of administration, which resulted in the growth of corruption among his officials. Some historians also stated his character as stubborn and firm from the fact that he refused to accept any pensions or grants from British Government. His son, Kameswar Singha also refused to accept pension from the British Government. Some sources said that it was actually Maniram Dewan who advised both father and son, not to accept any pension, as it might weaken their petition to restore their kingdom. After the fall of Ahom kingdom by Burmese invasion and subsequently by British occupation, Purandar Singha got an golden opportunity to restore Ahom rule in Upper Assam, but he ruined the chance by failing to pay the annual tribute of 50,000 rupees, resulted in the annexation of his kingdom by British, putting an end of 600 years of rule by Ahom dynasty.|$|E
25|$|In {{the next}} match, against Hampshire, Nichols went one step further.

Against Leicestershire, Nichols scored 95 batting at number three as the West Country team amassed a first-innings total of 415. Nichols and Tyler combined to take all ten Leicestershire wickets in their first-innings, Nichols claiming six, restricting them to 61. Enforcing the follow-on, Somerset took eighty-three overs to bowl Leicestershire out for a second time, Nichols claiming a solitary wicket. Staffordshire were the next to fall victim, losing by an innings and 149 runs as Nichols claimed another ten-wicket haul. In the next match, against Warwickshire, Nichols took three wickets in each innings, Tyler <b>taking</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rest. Nichols top-scored for Somerset in both innings; claiming two half-centuries, and narrowly missed out on a third consecutive fifty when he was bowled on 49 against Glamorgan a few days later. His good form with the bat continued as he hit 110 against Leicestershire at Grace Road in early August. In the return fixture against Staffordshire the visitors were two batsmen short which, in addition to a pair of run outs, left only fourteen wickets on offer. Nichols claimed five of them, leaving the slow bowler Tyler to collect the other nine.|$|E

500|$|Rather Ripped is {{generally}} {{considered one of the}} band's most accessible albums, featuring an abundance of concise and catchy melodies. Moore described it as [...] "a super song record" [...] that contains [...] "rockers and ballads". In addition, seven of the album's 12 tracks have a duration of less than four minutes, a feature that is uncommon in previous Sonic Youth releases. The album generally favors guitar textures over feedback or noise, which typically characterized the band's earlier works. Dave Heaton of PopMatters remarked that the guitars on Rather Ripped are joined together to form a vibrant and mysterious sound, stating that [...] "it often feels like Sonic Youth are <b>taking</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> instrumental tricks they've learned over the years and putting them in the service of building a lasting landscape of guitar sounds, one that reverberates with the sounds of the past but also feels eternally youthful".|$|E
500|$|In {{an attempt}} to divert the {{attention}} of Brazil from the siege of the capital, the Blanco government ordered the [...] "Vanguard Army of the Republic of Uruguay", composed of 1,500 men under General Basilio Muñoz, to invade Brazilian soil. On 27 January 1865, Muñoz crossed the border and exchanged fire with 500 cavalrymen from Brazil's National Guard units. The Brazilians retreated {{to the town of}} Jaguarão, where they were joined by 90 infantrymen also from the National Guard, and hurriedly constructed trenches. There were also two small steamers and one other large vessel, each equipped with one artillery piece, to protect Jaguarão. The Blanco army attacked the town in the Battle of Jaguarão, but were repelled. Muñoz established a brief siege and asked Colonel Manuel Pereira Vargas (the commander of the Brazilian garrison) to surrender, but to no effect. In the early hours of 28 January, Muñoz retreated with his men toward Uruguay, ransacking property and <b>taking</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> slaves they could find.|$|E

Two days later several Dunkirkers were dispatched to force the Talamone's port mouth, and 8 ships arrived from Naples at Porto Santo Stefano, destroying or capturing about 70 tartanes and barges which contained the supplies of Thomas of Savoy's army during the operation. Du Daugnon, meanwhile, returned to Toulon. Despite his failure, reinforcements could later be carried to Talamone aboard five ships, and Linhares' attempts to dislodge the French siege lines were unsuccessful. Linhares disembarked 3.300 soldiers led by Pimienta, who divided them in two corps and advanced upon the French lines. The first one managed to occupy a hill on [...] which a French cavalry attack was repulsed, but the second corps was dislodged after a 6-hour battle and forced to reembark. 400 wounded men were evacuated; the killed were left on the battlefield.

500|$|In {{a review}} of Volume 16 of the manga, Deb Aoki from About.com listed Itachi's {{introduction}} in the series {{as one of the}} cons from the volume. She praised his first fight in the series as very entertaining, meant to [...] "whet readers' appetites for future fights between Konoha ninja and the Akatsuki". James Musgrove commented that Itachi and his partner Kisame [...] "make a dramatic and well-timed entrance into the story". However, Jason Van Horn criticised the first battle between Itachi and Sasuke, as [...] "good" [...] but not [...] "as epic as it should've been". His last fight with Sasuke before dying was considered [...] "epic" [...] by Casey Brienza from ANN. [...] She found to be [...] "a battle of minds" [...] since, even after Itachi's death, Sasuke changes his mind about him when he learns about his past. [...] She also anticipated the impact of Itachi's past revelations on the future storyline of Naruto. Despite disliking how the anime Shippuden used Itachi's light novel as part of the series, Chris Beveridge from the Fandom Post enjoyed Itachi's impact on both Sasuke and Naruto. Writer Jason Thompson highly praised his visual tortures, due to the effect it has on the victims, reminding him of the antagonist from Kiyoshi Kurosawa's film Cure notable for its horror scenes. Nevertheless, he criticized Itachi's death scene {{as a result of his}} disease rather than being killed by Sasuke, <b>taking</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> blame from his brother in the process. In 2014, IGN listed him as the fifth best Naruto character when the series ended.|$|E
