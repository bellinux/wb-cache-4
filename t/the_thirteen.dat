5|$|Many Sunnis (who {{compromise}} {{a substantial}} minority) support {{the government and}} see <b>the</b> <b>Thirteen</b> as dangerous revolutionaries that would destabilize the country should they succeed in toppling the monarchy. Government hardliners and Sunni political groups often call for harsh and no compromise approach, including calling for no pardons and death sentences. To their many supporters (in Bahrain and abroad) however, <b>the</b> <b>Thirteen</b> are heroes and prisoners of conscience jailed unfairly for nothing more than calling for democracy. Their faces appear daily in banners during protests.|$|E

5|$|The Royal Proclamation of 1763 {{established}} First Nation treaty rights, {{created the}} Province of Quebec out of New France, and annexed Cape Breton Island to Nova Scotia. St. John's Island (now Prince Edward Island) became a separate colony in 1769. To avert conflict in Quebec, the British Parliament passed the Quebec Act of 1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration {{at a time}} that <b>the</b> <b>Thirteen</b> Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule. It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and French civil law there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>Thirteen</b> Colonies. The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of <b>the</b> <b>Thirteen</b> Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the American Revolution.|$|E

The claim was disputed by the colony of Virginia, which did not participate in the treaty because it already laid claim to the land through its royal charter. In 1773, the territory of Indiana was brought under the administration of Province of Quebec to appease its French population. The Quebec Act was listed as one of the Intolerable Acts <b>the</b> <b>Thirteen</b> Colonies cited as a reason for the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. <b>The</b> <b>thirteen</b> colonies thought themselves entitled to the territory for their support of Great Britain during the French and Indian War, and were incensed that it was given to the enemy the colonies had been fighting.|$|E
