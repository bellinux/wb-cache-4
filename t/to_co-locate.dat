5|$|After John Myers' {{recommendations}} of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published, and the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations <b>to</b> <b>co-locate</b> or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national DAB was passed, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi-national station, and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that {{it wanted to}} compete with BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on DAB to the whole of England and Wales, and Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. Regional content would be kept; split news, travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional DAB stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the rules governing its broadcast licence, but networked content would be broadcast {{the rest of the}} time. The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended. The new Smooth Radio was launched on 4 October 2010 with most of the output originating from Salford Quays, and other programming coming from London.|$|E
5|$|The station {{opened in}} 1990 as 102.2 Jazz FM in London, {{and a second}} Jazz FM branded station was {{launched}} four years later in Manchester. The Manchester station became Smooth FM 100.4 in 2004, {{and was the first}} in the network of independent local radio stations to use the Smooth brand. The London station followed suit a year later. The network's parent company, GMG Radioa subsidiary of the Guardian Media Groupacquired the Saga Radio Group in the mid-2000s, and all Saga stations were given the Smooth name. After the publication of John Myers' recommendations of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio, and the passing of the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations <b>to</b> <b>co-locate</b> or discontinue local shows and broadcasts, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into a single, quasi-national station in October 2010; local news feeds were produced at GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland produced its own breakfast and drivetime shows, but carried networked programming at other times. As part of their licence agreement, the London and Manchester stations were required to continue their commitment to jazz music after dropping the Jazz FM name, and the UK's broadcasting industry regulator Office of Communications (Ofcom) stipulated they must broadcast 45 hours of jazz programming per week, but this requirement was ended shortly before the merger took place.|$|E

Twenty other airlines followed when the terminal became fully operational on 26 March 2008. Currently, it mainly houses Air China, Oneworld, Star Alliance, and other domestic and international flights which are not operated from Terminal 2.

40|$|Global {{software}} engineering {{has become a}} fact in many companies due to real necessity in practice. In contrast <b>to</b> <b>co-located</b> projects global projects face a number of additional {{software engineering}} challenges. Among them quality management {{has become much more}} difficult and schedule and budget overruns can be observed more often. Compared <b>to</b> <b>co-located</b> projects global software engineering is even more challenging due to the need for integration of different cultures, different languages, and different time zones - across companies, and across countries. The diversity of development locations on several levels seriously endangers an effective and goal-oriented progress of projects. In this position paper we discuss reasons for global development, sketch settings for distribution and views of orchestration of dislocated companies in a global project that {{can be seen as a}} "virtual project environment". We also present a collection of questions, which we consider relevant for global software engineering. The questions motivate further discussion to derive a research agenda in global software engineering. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

This study emphasizes the utilization of the entire DDM to more precisely infer ocean roughness directional parameters. In particular, we argue that the DDM exhibits the impact of both roughness and scatterer velocity.

40|$|Mobilizing vaccinators {{to provide}} mothers key family {{planning}} information and referrals <b>to</b> <b>co-located,</b> same-day {{family planning services}} was feasible in resource-limited areas of Liberia, leading to substantial increases in contraceptive use. Conversely, impact on immunization rates was less clear, but at a minimum there was no decrease in doses administered. Globally, unmet need for postpartum family planning remains high, while immunization services {{are among the most}} wide-reaching and equitable interventions. Given overlapping time frames, integrating these services provides an opportunity to leverage existing health visits to offer women more comprehensive services. From March through November 2012, Liberia’s government, with support from the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program (MCHIP), piloted an integrated family planning and immunization model at 10 health facilities in Bong and Lofa counties. Vaccinators provided mothers bringing infants for routine immunization with targeted family planning and immunization messages and same-day referrals <b>to</b> <b>co-located</b> family planning services. In February 2013, we compared service statistics for family planning and immunization during the pilot against the previous year’s statistics. We also conducted in-depth interviews with service providers and other personnel and focus group discussions with clients. Results showed that referral acceptance across the facilities varied from 10 % to 45 % per month, on average. Over 80 % of referral acceptors completed the family planning visit that day, of who...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the tax/subsidy {{competition}} between two potential host governments {{to attract the}} plants of firms in a duopolistic industry. While {{competition between}} identical countries for a monopolist's investment is known to result in subsidy inflation, two firms can be taxed in equilibrium with the host countries appropriating the entire social surplus generated within the industry, despite explicit non-cooperation between governments. Trade costs mean that the firms prefer dispersed <b>to</b> <b>co-located</b> production, creating these taxation opportunities for the host countries.
