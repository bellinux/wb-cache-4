50|$|The {{beauty of}} time <b>reversal</b> <b>signal</b> {{processing}} {{is that one}} need not know any details of the channel.

Time reversal is therefore suited to applications with inhomogeneous media.|$|R

First, Match pursuit algorithm is used to the original signal processing of guided wave detection to improve signal quality, and provides a good foundation for signal reconstruction. Then it does algebraic difference of the signal before plate injury and the signal after injury to obtain the difference signal, and it uses the difference <b>signal</b> as time <b>reversal</b> excitation <b>signal</b> to obtain a set of time <b>reversal</b> <b>signal.</b> Last, the time-reversed signals are re-energized in the finite element model to simulate the actual plate, and damage imaging is realized {{in accordance with the}} principle of synthetic imaging. Experimental results show that this method can accurately extract the envelope of the signal, and more accurately detect the position of the defect, the range and other characteristics.

This method allows for optimization of time reversal focusing {{for any number of}} channels by calculating the required time reversed signal to be rebroadcast from the time reversal mirror element using only the original recorded scattered signal from that element. The speed, simplicity and robust nature of this pro-cess for any number of time reversal mirror elements, including only a single channel, provide the ability to enhance applications currently using time re-versal for tasks such as communications, nondestructive evaluation, lithotripsy and imaging, among others.

Coping with stress {{has become a}} major concern for teenagers. With the development of social media, the huge amounts of teens’ tweets on micro-blog make it possible to sense teens’ stress and predict their stress level change through their tweeting contents and behaviors. The finding results enable teachers and parents to know teenager’ stress situations better, be aware of the possible stress level change in advance, and take actions to help stressful teenagers relieve stress. In this paper, we propose to use the candlestick charts which are widely adopted in stock analysis to predict teens’ stress level change on a micro-blog platform. As different individuals have different stress changing characteristics, we define a stress pattern as a sequence of candlestick charts, and do stress pattern matching to judge if a candlestick chart with <b>reversal</b> <b>signals</b> will result in the trend reversal.

40|$|We generalize the {{portfolio}} shifts model advanced by Evans and Lyons (2002 a; b), {{and develop the}} dynamic asymmetric portfolio shifts (DAPS) model by explicitly allowing for possible market under- and overreactions and for asymmetric pricing impacts of order flows. Using the Reuters D 2000 - 1 daily trading data for eight currency markets over a four-month period from 1 May to 31 August 1996, we find strong evidence of a nonlinear cointegrating relationship between exchange rates and (cumulative) order flows: The price impact of negative order flows (selling pressure) is overwhelmingly stronger {{than that of the}} positive ones (buying pressure). Through the dynamic multiplier analysis, we find two typical patterns of the price discovery process. The markets following overreactions tend to display a delayed overshooting and a volatile but faster adjustment towards equilibrium whereas the markets following underreactions are generally characterized by a gradual but persistent adjustment. In our model, these heterogeneous adjustment patterns reflect different liquidity provisions associated with different market conditions following under- and overreactions. In addition, the larger is the mispricing, the faster is the overall adjustment speed, a finding consistent with Abreu and Brunnermeier (2002) and Cai et al. (2011). We also find that underreactions are followed mostly by positive feedback trading while overreactions are characterized by delayed overshooting in the short run but corrected by negative feedback trading at longer horizons, the finding is consistent with Barberis et al.

40|$|Precipitation and {{temperature}} climate indices are calculated using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) reanalysis and validated against observational data from some stations over Brazil {{and other data}} sources. The spatial patterns of the climate indices trends are analyzed for the period 1961 - 1990 over South America. In addition, the correlation and linear regression coefficients for some specific stations were also obtained in order to compare with the reanalysis data. In general, {{the results suggest that}} NCEP/NCAR reanalysis can provide useful information about minimum temperature and consecutive dry days indices at individual grid cells in Brazil. However, some regional differences in the climate indices trends are observed when different data sets are compared. For instance, the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis shows a <b>reversal</b> <b>signal</b> for all rainfall annual indices and the cold night index over Argentina. Despite these differences, maps of the trends for most of the annual climate indices obtained from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and BRANT analysis are generally in good agreement with other available data sources and previous findings in the literature for large areas of southern South America. The pattern of trends for the precipitation annual indices over the 30 years analyzed indicates a change to wetter conditions over southern and southeastern parts of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, central and northern Argentina, and parts of Chile and a decrease over southwestern South America. All over South America, the climate indices related to the minimum temperature (warm or cold nights) have clearly shown a warming tendency; however, no consistent changes in maximum temperature extremes (warm and cold days) have been observed. Therefore, one must be careful before suggesting an), trends for warm or cold days. CAPESMinistry of Science and Technolog...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Deriving the {{appropriate}} gradient descent algorithm {{for a new}} network architecture or system configuration normally requires numerous chain rule expansions, diligent bookkeeping, and careful manipulation of terms.

However, the actual implementation of backpropagation {{may be viewed as}} a simple <b>reversal</b> of <b>signal</b> flow through the network.

Based on the theoretical formula, {{we carry out the}} numerical simulation using the half-space dyadic Green’s function in noisy scenario. The results show that the MUSIC imaging algorithm achieves the enhanced resolution and the transmit-mode method gives more robust output when performance comparison of the four methods is made, therefore indicate the TR-MUSIC could be a good candidate for subsurface detection. 1...|$|R
