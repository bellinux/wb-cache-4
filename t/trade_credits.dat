The exchange plays an important role because they provide the record-keeping, brokering expertise and monthly statements to each member.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In a {{quest to}} {{understand}} the motives for use of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> in inter-firm <b>trade,</b> many theories have been put forward. The empirical literature on <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> are largely focused on understanding firms' motives for use of <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> by testing these theories with micro- and macro-level data. Against the background that the extent and motives for use of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> in the agro-food industry is less understood, this dissertation extends the frontiers of knowledge on <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> use by examining <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> theories and empirical evidence from agro-food firms in Africa and the United States. The dissertation consists of three essays. The first essay examines <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> contracts, <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> theories and empirical {{evidence in support of}} or otherwise of the theories via review and analysis of the theoretical and empirical <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> literature. The second essay examines the motives for <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> supply in the African agro-food manufacturing industry, employing survey data from eight African countries [...] Burundi, Malawi, Mauritania, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Sudan and Sudan. Premised on {{the fact that there are}} benefits and costs of investing in <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> the third essay examines investment in <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> and firm profitability, using a panel of listed agro-food firms in the United States for the period 2001 - 2014. The review in essay one revealed a high use of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> in inter-firm <b>trade,</b> with variations across countries and industries. It is revealed that <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> contracts are simple in nature and factors such as the shortness of credit periods, frequency of transactions, close proximity and interaction between suppliers and customers, and effective informal enforcement mechanisms may account for the simplified nature of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> contracts. However, the use of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> is a multidimensional phenomenon, driven by varied yet interconnected motives, thus making it complex to put forward a single theory to explain the use of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> in interfirm <b>trade.</b> Contrary to a long-held notion that <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> is expensive relative to bank credit, evidence from the empirical literature suggests the opposite. In general, there is more empirical support for the theories of <b>trade</b> <b>credit.</b> The empirical results show a high participation of agro-food firms in <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> activity in African countries and the United States. While within-industry variability in <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> activity is not statistically significant in the African agro-food industry, there is significant within-industry variability in the United States. However, there is statistically significant variability in <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> activity across agro-food firms in the African countries studied. The empirical results from essay two show that the level of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> supply increases with manager experience, degree of product diversification, overdraft availability from banks, <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> from input suppliers and location in capital city. The results provide evidence in support of financing (particularly liquidity and redistribution) and commercial (particularly marketing and quality guarantee) theories of <b>trade</b> <b>credit.</b> Essay three found evidence of a non-linear (inverted U) relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> investment and firm profitability, reflecting benefits and costs of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> investment. This finding suggest that agro-food firms should be guided by benefit-costs off in their <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> investment decisions. The study found the threshold of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> investment beyond which the relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> investment and firm profitability transition from positive to negative. In general, the empirical results show that <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> is an important source of short-term financing for agro-food firms in African countries and the United States, and should be facilitated through policy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>credit</b> is {{a widely}} adopted {{industry}} practice. Prior {{research has focused on}} how <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> befits firms by improving vertical supply chain relationships. This paper offers a novel perspective by examining whether <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> benefits suppliers through a horizontal channel. Under the classic Bertrand competition framework, we analyze two competing firms' price decisions with and without <b>trade</b> <b>credit.</b> We find that when the firms are financially constrained, <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> softens horizontal price competition. Specifically, with <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> the firms will behave less aggressively in setting their prices for fear of incurring additional financing costs, resulting in equilibrium prices above the marginal cost, even if the products are perfect substitutes. Equilibrium profits under <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> may thus be strictly higher than those under cash contracts. Furthermore, we find that with <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> a financially stronger firm may be able to exclude its weaker competitor from the market. We also investigate the relationship between the firms' financial strength and their physical capacity in the competition with <b>trade</b> <b>credit.</b> We find that the horizontal benefit of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> over cash contracts increases as either the firms' physical capacities increase or their financial status weakens. Therefore, with <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> firms' financial constraints are a partial substitute for the role that physical capacity plays in price competition. Finally, we study the firms' choice between offering <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> and cash contracts. We find that <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> is the equilibrium contract form if customers value <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> suggesting that the horizontal benefit of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> may complement its vertical roles...|$|R

We show that the difficulty of gaining acces to bank credit positively influences the use of <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> and thus demonstrate the substitutability of bank <b>credit</b> and <b>trade</b> <b>credit.</b> Besides, firm's non-financial characteristics, namely age and size do not influence similarly the probability of having <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> and the volume of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> raised. Additional investigations strongly support the existence of non-linearities in the relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> and firm's financial structure and size. Finally, financial development emerges as a key feature of the demand for <b>trade</b> <b>credit.</b> Indeed, we show that most firm-level characteristics lose their influence on <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> when financial development is high enough. With financial development, <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> gets primarily driven by trade relationships and does not appear any more as a palliative solution when bank credit access is difficult. <b>Trade</b> <b>credit,</b> bank credit, financial constraints, financial development. ...|$|R

This modern trade and barter method is different than the ancient “direct trade” when people swapped one thing for another.

40|$|Using a dyadic panel dataset {{that links}} U.

We find that suppliers with smaller market share are associated with more <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> confirming that suppliers with weak market power use <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> as a competitive tool. Next, we find that buyers with larger market share are associated with more <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> whereas suppliers selling to a concentrated buyer base are associated with less trade credit; by differentiating competition in buyers’ markets from competition between supply chain partners, we show that the two types of competition have different impacts on <b>trade</b> <b>credit.</b> In studying the impact of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> on firm performance, we make the distinction between an industry-average <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> and an individual supply chain’s deviation from such an industry average.

While <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> is well researched in the finance literature, its link to innovation has been neglected in prior research. We argue that innovative {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) are more likely to use <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> than non-innovative SMEs because of credit constraints and that business partners may have incentives to offer <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> especially to innovative SMEs. The relationship between innovation and <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> is empirically examined by using a sample of SMEs from 14 European countries. The results of an econometric analysis confirm a positive relationship between innovation and <b>trade</b> <b>credit.</b> In particular, SMEs with product innovations have a higher probability of using <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> than other SMEs. Moreover, the results suggest that the effect of product innovation is only statistically significant if SMEs report that access to financing or cost of financing are obstacles for the operation and growth of their businesses. Hence, the results point to the relevance of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> as a source of short-term financing for innovative SMEs which are <b>credit</b> constrained. <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> innovation, credit constraints...|$|R

Thereafter India let agreements relating to oil processing and warehouse space in Calcutta for goods destined to Nepal expire.

40|$|Purpose – In {{contrast}} to common literature {{that suggests that}} <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> is an extremely expensive source of financing with annual interest rates exceeding 40 percent, this paper seeks {{to argue that the}} average interest rate of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> does not exceed the cost of alternative funds, thereby explaining why <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> constitutes a substantial part of the optimal financing mix of large, liquid, and capital market listed firms. Design/methodology/approach – Besides providing a formula for estimating a firm's actual <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> interest rate, this paper is mainly based on a descriptive analysis of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> use as well as on survey results of a broad range of prior studies. Findings – The paper finds that highly liquid firms use substantial amounts of <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> thus indicating that <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> use per se cannot be as expensive as literature supposes. In line, estimated average interest rates are about 4 to 6 percent. Originality/value – By arguing that actual cost of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> use is far from being as high as literature supposes, this paper provides important implications for optimal short-term financing strategies {{as well as for the}} assessment of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> use in credit worthiness analyses. <b>Credit,</b> Financing, <b>Trade...</b>|$|R

The new system took effect January 1, 2017.  The system contains two key components, cap, and trade. The cap restricts the amount of greenhouse gas pollution businesses and institutions can release into the environment. The cap shrinks year to year to encourage lower emissions. Companies must have permits or credits to cover their emissions if they exceed the cap. This is where the trade part of the policy comes into effect. Companies can <b>trade</b> <b>credits</b> or permits.This allows for high polluters to buy credits or permits from low emission companies to cover their emissions. The revenue generated from the cap and trade must be invested in a transparent way to {{comply with the}} law. Places companies can invest are green technology, lower carbon fuels and buying extra credits. According to the Ontario government, it will cost Ontario homeowners an extra $13 dollars a month. There will be three types of participants in the cap and trade. The first is voluntary participants who opt in to participate in the policy. The second is mandatory participants who by law are forced to participate. The third is market participants who participate in the allowance market but aren't forced to comply with other regulations of cap and trade.|$|E

[...] Additionally there was discussion concerning the proposed secret provision of Libyan credit to finance high-tech exports by East Germany to third countries. [...] However, Lamberz died on the evening of their last encounter, and these aspects were not all implemented.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{document}} financial aspects of transactions, and <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> supply behavior with FDI among {{small and medium-sized}} enterprises(SMEs) based on two original surveys, conducted in four cities in China in 2003. The survey was designed to capture the nature of inter-firm transactions, <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> and other financial conditions. Literature on FDI mainly refers to technology transfer, employment or investment. This paper focuses on the role and significance of FDI in the supply of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> due to its <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> enforcement technology. Yanagawa, Ito and Watanabe [2006] developed a model which indicates that when a seller has higher enforcement technology or a buyer has richer liquidity, both <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> and transaction volume will be increased. In this paper, we confirmed that FDI and G contributed to the provision of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> and had a positive external effect on <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> enforcement towards China’s economy. (1) Sales towards FDI customers {{have the power to}} increase the <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> ratio,even when controlling other factors such as choice of payment instrument, competitiveness, and expost default management. This implies that FDI does provide <b>trade</b> <b>credit,</b> not only because it has superior liquidity, but because it is also superior in terms of enforcement of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> repayment. (2) Cash constraints of the buyer influence the decisions concerning <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> provided by the seller, as a model in Yanagawa, et al. [2006] predicted, and this implies that strategic default is a serious concern among SMEs in China. (3) Spillover effect exists in payment enforcement technology in transactions with FDI customers.

It assumes that supplier offers retailer/buyer a permissible delay in payments (<b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> period). The account is not settled during <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> period {{and there is}} no interest charge. In fact, as short-term financing tool, <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> is widely implemented in fierce competitive circumstance and has important influence on inventory holding cost (Azzi et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> supply by Brazilian publicly traded companies between the years of 2005 and 2008. International literature (both theoretical and empirical) documents that the main determinants of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> supply are {{the size of the}} firm and the size of its debt. Both indicate that the availability of resources to the firm is an important factor for the supply of <b>trade</b> <b>credit.</b> In addition, the literature confirms strategic uses of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> such as those for price discrimination purposes. The results obtained using a sample of 157 Brazilian companies do not support that size and indebtedness are relevant determinants for <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> supply, but they confirm the supply of <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> as a strategic tool for the firms. Additionally we observed a significant decrease in <b>trade</b> <b>credit</b> supply in 2008, the year in which a severe international financial crisis took place...|$|R
