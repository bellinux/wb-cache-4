But in the Iowa speech that was recorded and distributed <b>to</b> <b>reporters</b> (with a parallel video of Kinnock) by aides to Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, he failed to do so. Dukakis, who disowned any knowledge of the Kinnock video, fired John Sasso, his campaign manager and long-time Chief of Staff, but Biden's campaign could not recover.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2005 ACC Championship Game, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick stormed off the field, {{refusing to}} talk <b>to</b> <b>reporters</b> {{following}} the loss. Vick, who {{picked up a}} 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty late in that game, also earned several unsportsmanlike conduct penalties in the 2006Gator Bowl, where post-game replays revealed he purposefully stomped on the leg of Louisville Cardinals' defensive end Elvis Dumervil. Vick claimed he apologized to Dumervil after the game, but Dumervil stated that no apology was made.

Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager to bury the matter, and the story died.|$|E
5|$|The Carter {{administration}} {{years were}} difficult for Kennedy; {{he had been}} the most important Democrat in Washington ever since his brother Robert's death, but now Carter was, and Kennedy at first did not have a full committee chairmanship with which to wield influence. Carter in turn sometimes resented Kennedy's status as a political celebrity. Despite generally similar ideologies, their priorities were different. Kennedy expressed <b>to</b> <b>reporters</b> that he was content with his congressional role and viewed presidential ambitions as almost far-fetched.|$|E

5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation <b>to</b> <b>reporters</b> asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|Although {{marketers}} typically avoid promoting adult-oriented {{films to}} reach a broader demographic, the film attracted several promotional partners including Coors, Amazon, and Verizon FiOS, which were estimated to have spent $30 million in marketing support. Amazon directed interested users to purchase tickets through Fandango, and placed promotional material in products shipped to customers; {{this was the first}} time that Amazon had allowed such marketing by an external company. The premiere in London was streamed live via the film's website and the Verizon FiOS Facebook page. The event was facilitated by BumeBox, which took audience questions from social sites and gave them <b>to</b> <b>reporters</b> to ask at the event. The National Entertainment Collectibles Association (NECA) released a series of Prometheus action figures in September 2012. A book, Prometheus: The Art of the Film, containing production art and behind-the-scenes photographs, was released on June 12, 2012.|$|E

5|$|He {{secretly}} left Louisville {{at night}} and returned to Indianapolis by train. Eitel defended Riley to the press {{in an effort to}} gain sympathy for Riley, explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made. Riley however refused to speak <b>to</b> <b>reporters</b> and hid himself for weeks. Much to Riley's surprise, the news reports made him more popular than ever. Many people thought the stories were exaggerated, and Riley's carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to believe he was an alcoholic. Riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath, but they soon began corresponding with him requesting that he resume writing. This encouraged Riley, and he made another attempt to give up liquor as he returned to his public career.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, all {{prisoners and}} parolees in Queensland have been {{prohibited}} by law (section 132 of Queensland's Corrective Services Act, {{introduced by the}} Beattie Labor Government) from speaking <b>to</b> <b>reporters</b> without permission. Thus, {{for the duration of}} his imprisonment and parole, Wotton could not lawfully speak to the media or attend public meetings without prior approval from his parole officer. Gracelyn Smallwood of the Indigenous Human Rights Committee believed it was designed to muzzle the truth. Terry O'Gorman, President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, has called it 'obnoxious'. Stewart Levitt, the director of the Black and White Justice Foundation remarked that it was unusual for a public spokesman and former politician to be prohibited from a public meeting. Welcoming Wotton back home, Alf Lacey, mayor of Palm Island, commented that the conditions were excessive.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available <b>to</b> <b>reporters,</b> giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since. Coolidge's second inauguration was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first president whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio. Coolidge signed the Radio Act of 1927, which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created Federal Radio Commission. On August 11, 1924, Theodore W. Case, using the Phonofilm sound-on-film process he developed for Lee DeForest, filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making Coolidge the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds. When Charles Lindbergh arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and a sound-on-film record of the event exists.|$|E
