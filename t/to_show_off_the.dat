5|$|In a bid {{to drive}} sales of the system, Pixar {{employee}} John Lasseter—who had long been working on not-for-profit short demonstration animations, such as Luxo Jr. (1986), <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> device's capabilities—premiered his creations at SIGGRAPH, the computer graphics industry's largest convention, to great fanfare.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodywork}} for {{the concept}} car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} bodyshell in silver. The concept also featured electrically operated scissor doors and a transparent engine cover <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically {{enter the}} house from the High Street to the south, passing through the gatehouse, across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's gatehouse was only the third such entrance building {{to be built in}} North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a gatehouse like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the gatehouse would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|E

50|$|The concerto is {{well suited}} {{throughout}} <b>to</b> <b>showing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> qualities of a fine harpsichord and the virtuosity of its player, but especially in the lengthy solo 'cadenza' to the first movement. It seems almost certain that Bach, considered a great organ and harpsichord virtuoso, was the harpsichord soloist at the premiere. Scholars have seen in this work {{the origins of the}} solo keyboard concerto as it is the first example of a concerto with a solo keyboard part.|$|R

5|$|The Army also {{conducted}} a weapons demonstration for the Senate Armed Services Committee in early 1972, <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Cheyenne's firepower and garner support for attack helicopter development. The first TOW missile that {{was fired in}} the demonstration failed {{and went into the}} ground. The second missile was fired and hit the target. Previously, 130 TOW missiles had been fired without failure, but the failure of the first missile was now linked to perception of the aircraft. In April 1972, the Senate published its report on CAS. The report recommended funding of the Air Force's A-X program, which would become the A-10 Thunderbolt II, and limited procurement of the Harrier for the Marine Corps. The report never referred to the Cheyenne by name and only offered a lukewarm recommendation for the Army to continue procurement of attack helicopters, so long as their survivability could be improved.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technological demo designed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> graphical {{capabilities of the}} GameCube. The full motion video footage had scenes seen in later trailers and commercials for the game, but were never used in the final release. This footage includes Luigi running from an unknown ghost in the Foyer, ghosts playing cards in the Parlor, ghosts circling around Luigi, and Luigi standing outside the mansion with lighting flashing. Soon after its creation, Nintendo {{decided to make the}} demo into a full-fledged video game. A year later, Luigi's Mansion was later shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the GameCube console. A newer version of the game, more closely related to the final version, was later revealed at Nintendo Space World 2001.|$|E
5|$|Top Hat began filming on April 1, 1935 {{and cost}} $620,000 to make. Shooting ended in June {{and the first}} public previews were held in July. These led to cuts of {{approximately}} ten minutes, mainly in the last portion of the film: the carnival sequence and the gondola parade which had been filmed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> huge set were heavily cut. A further four minutes were cut before its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall, where it broke all records, went on to gross $3 million on its initial release, and became RKO's most profitable film of the 1930s. After Mutiny on the Bounty, it made more money than any other film released in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in February 2008, US forces began {{returning}} {{political and}} military control of Anbar Province to Iraqis. On 14 February, 1st Battalion 7th Marines withdrew from Hīt. Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi security forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south {{to participate in the}} Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight. With Helicopter support, they pressed on and the SAS chased their targets into another house who used civilians as hostages who were then accidentally killed beside the terrorists, One SAS operator was killed.|$|E
5|$|Director John Lasseter's first {{experience}} with computer animation was during his work as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation, when two of his friends showed him the lightcycle scene from Tron. It was an eye-opening experience which awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer-generated animation. Lasseter tried to pitch The Brave Little Toaster as a fully computer-animated film to Disney, but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired. He {{then went on to}} work at Lucasfilm and later as a founding member of Pixar, which was purchased by entrepreneur and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs in 1986. At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Pixar Image Computer's capabilities, and Tin Toy (1988) —a short story told {{from the perspective of a}} toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys— would go on to claim the 1988 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first computer-generated film to do so.|$|E
5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips upstage. When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E

Braiding can be used to train the mane to lie {{on one side of the}} neck, if half falls on one side and half falls on the other.|$|E
25|$|The movie {{replaces the}} charmed Silver Shoes with pointed toes {{of the book}} with Ruby-Red Slippers. This was because full color motion {{pictures}} were still a relatively new technology in 1939, and MGM wanted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> visually dazzling process. Shiny red shoes were more impressive in a color motion picture compared to silver ones. Due to {{the popularity of the}} movie, the green witch and the Ruby Slippers are more well known to the general public and pop culture than their book counterparts, and are even considered iconic.|$|E

The airport is also used by VIP visitors, foreign top government officials, visiting heads of states and the king of Bahrain himself.|$|R
50|$|A bridle {{does not}} {{necessarily}} need a noseband, and many bridles, such as those used in Western riding, flat racing, or endurance riding, do not have one. Some horses shown in-hand do not use a noseband in order <b>to</b> better <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> animal's head. Many old paintings also depict a hunting horse without a noseband, since {{it was not always}} deemed useful by certain riders.|$|R

25|$|There {{is also an}} Indian {{version of}} the story, which appears in the Līlāvatīsāra by Jinaratna (1283), a summary of a now-lost {{anthology}} of fables, the Nirvāṇalīlāvatī by Jineśvara (1052). The dishonest merchant Dhana from Hastināpura swindles the King of Śrāvastī by offering to weave a supernatural garment that cannot be seen or touched by any person of illegitimate birth. When the king is supposedly wearing the garment, his whole court pretends to admire it. The king is then paraded about his city <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> garment; when the common folk {{ask him if he}} has become a naked ascetic, he realizes the deception, but the swindler has already fled.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, for {{the purpose}} of hosting Belgrade Fair, a complex of {{buildings}} was erected next to the already existing community. Spread over 15 thousand square metres, it hosted fairs and exhibitions designed <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Yugoslavia's developing economy. Also this year, the municipality of Belgrade signed a contract with two Danish construction companies, Kampsax and Højgaard & Schultz, to build the new neighbourhood. Engineer Branislav Nešić was entrusted with leading the project. He even continued his involvement on the project after 1941 when the Nazis conquered, occupied, and dissolved the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Because of this, the new communist authorities who came to power after 1945 put Nešić on trial as a collaborator. As the complex never hosted any fairs again and the new Belgrade Fair was built across the river, the area became known as Staro Sajmište ("Old Fairground").|$|E
25|$|Special costume: traditionally, {{the costumes}} of acolytes, footmen, {{ceremonial}} guards, or slaves help {{show off the}} wealth of the person staging a procession. An ornate example was the embroidered train of George IV of the United Kingdom, carried at his coronation by nine lords in waiting with their own matching silken clothes, capes, ruffs, and plumed hats. Other examples include the Swiss Guard and high vestments of the Pope. The formal, matching clothes of bridesmaids and groomsmen are in the same tradition, although sometimes purchased at the attendant's expense rather than by the people honored in the ceremony. In egalitarian times and places, whoever has taken the time and money to put together something impressive may appear in a parade; such costumes are of course the focal point of Halloween parades such as that staged in Greenwich Village, New York. Finally, processions may be staged simply <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> costumes as one part of a larger event, such as at fashion pageants, military reenactments, pop concerts, or Renaissance Festivals.|$|E

50|$|Eleven nations {{beside the}} U.S. {{had their own}} {{exhibition}} buildings. So did 26 of the 37 U.S. states. (Ohio House alone survives.)

The Women's Pavilion was the first structure at an international exposition devoted <b>to</b> <b>showing</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> work of women. The exhibits in this building were created and operated by women. Domestic labor saving devices invented by women were also displayed. The items that were exhibited included a dishwasher, a reliance stove, a stocking and glove darner, etc. The goals of the exhibit was to promote labor saving household gadgets that would provide women relief from household work {{so that they can}} focus on other leisurely activities of interest. The rest of the structures at the Centennial were corporate exhibitions, administration buildings, restaurants, and other buildings designed for public comfort.|$|R
