[...] But still Natalia said they were your friends, [...] And they assented though they smiled the more, [...] And all came round me--that thin Englishman [...] With light lank hair seemed leader of the rest; [...] 165 [...] He held a paper--"What we want," [...] said he, [...] Ending some explanation to his friends, [...] "Is something slow, involved, and mystical, [...] To hold Jules long in doubt, yet take his taste [...] And lure him on until, at innermost [...] 170 [...] Where he seeks sweetness' soul, he may find--this! [...] --As in the apple's core, the noisome fly; [...] For insects on the rind are seen at once, [...] And brushed aside as soon, but this is found [...] Only when on the lips or loathing tongue."

The first boat took me in two days to Amahay, {{on the opposite side of}} the bay to Awaiya. The chief here, wonderful to relate, did not make any excuses for delay, but immediately ordered out the boat which was to carry me on, put my baggage on hoard, set up mast and sails after dark, and had the men ready that nigh; so that we were actually on our way at five the next morning,--a display of energy and activity I scarcely ever saw before in a native chief on such an occasion. We <b>touched</b> at Cepa, <b>and</b> <b>stayed</b> for the night at Tamilan, the first two Mahometan villages on the south coast of Ceram.

40|$|Resumo: Reiki, Toque Terapêutico (TT) e Healing Touch (HT) são Técnicas de Imposição de Mãos (TIM) que trabalham na harmonização do fluxo natural de energia vital do organismo. Esta energia, apesar de ainda não ser qualificada pela física, é citada por alguns autores como sendo o biocampo: o campo de energia intrínseco a todos os seres vivos, chamado também de campo quântico, clássico e não clássico. Um dos efeitos mais comumente reportados proveniente da aplicação dessas técnicas é o relaxamento, este, pode auxiliar na melhora da qualidade de vida de pessoas com câncer, assim como no alívio de sintomas como dor e stress-ansiedade. Este trabalho teve como objetivo verificar o uso e o efeito das TIM aplicadas ao câncer, a dor e ao stress-ansiedade, para isto foi realizada uma revisão sistemática da {{literatura}} nas bases de dados "PubMed/Medline", "Lilacs", "Embase", "Ebsco" e "Web Of Science" com os termos: "Reiki and Cancer, Reiki and Pain, Reiki and Stress, Reiki <b>and</b> Anxiety, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Stress, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Stress e Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety". Foram incluídos artigos sem limite em relação ao tempo e de língua Inglesa ou Portuguesa, foram excluídos artigos de revisão, duplicatas, artigos que não realizaram experimentos em seres humanos e que não reportassem o uso e/ou efeito dessas técnicas. Os resultados demonstram que as TIM são um recurso terapêutico não convencional benéfico para pessoas em tratamento do câncer, com dor e stress-ansiedade, revelando melhores resultados quando aplicadas sob abordagem fenomenológica e personalizada.;;Abstract:Reiki, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> (TT) <b>and</b> Healing <b>Touch</b> (HT) are Techniques of Laying on of Hands (TLH) {{that work}} on harmonizing the natural flow of vital {{energy in the}} body.

One {{of the most commonly}} reported effects from the application of these techniques is relaxation, this can assist in improving {{the quality of life of}} people with cancer, as well as in relieving symptoms such as pain, anxiety and stress. This study aimed to examine the use and effect of TLH applied to cancer, pain and stress-anxiety, therefore systematic literature review was performed in the databases "PubMed/Medline ", " Lilacs ", " Embase ", " Ebsco" and " Web of Science " with the words: "Reiki and Cancer, Reiki and Pain, Reiki and Stress, Reiki <b>and</b> Anxiety, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Stress <b>and</b> Therapeutic <b>Touch,</b> Therapeutic <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Cancer, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Pain, Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Stress <b>and</b> Healing <b>Touch</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety".
