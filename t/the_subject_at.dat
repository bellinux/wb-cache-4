5|$|Fermi {{was among}} the first to warn {{military}} leaders about the potential impact of nuclear energy, giving a lecture on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>at</b> the Navy Department on 18March 1939. The response fell short of what he had hoped for, although the Navy agreed to provide $1,500 towards further research at Columbia. Later that year, Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, and Edward Teller sent the famous letter signed by Einstein to U.S. President Roosevelt, warning that Nazi Germany was likely to build an atomic bomb. In response, Roosevelt formed the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the matter.|$|E

Turning to academia, from 1980 to 1985 he studied for a bachelor's degree in Classical archaeology at Hunter College, which he followed up with a master's degree in <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>at</b> Bryn Mawr College from 1985 to 1988. Buczynski was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1988, and died from a related Toxoplasma gondii infection the following year, converting to Roman Catholicism briefly beforehand. In 2012, the practicing Pagan Michael G. Lloyd published a biography of Buczynski entitled Bull of Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Only {{four days}} after {{returning}} from the Moscow Conference, Ismay left England again for the Cairo Conference and Teheran Conference with Churchill. One major source of conflict at the Cairo Conference was an American proposal to appoint an overall commander for the strategic bombing of Germany. Ismay and the British were strongly opposed, and Ismay wrote a long paper against the idea, which became the basis of British policy on <b>the</b> <b>subject.</b> <b>At</b> Teheran, Ismay helped to argue the case for Operation Overlord, but immediately after the conference he developed bronchitis and returned to England by ship, scrapping his other plans for the trip.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the modification of body composition {{and level of}} aerobic capacity in older athletes practicing competitive sport for two years consecutively, 20 elderly male endurance athletes (A) were compared with twenty elderly male subjects who practiced moderate exercise (C). Body composition analysis, physical activity and maximal aerobic power (VO 2 max) were measured {{at the beginning of}} the study, after twelve months and after twenty-four months in both groups. We observed significant differences in group A: body fat was significantly lower in <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first and second year than {{at the beginning of the}} study; fat-free mass (FFM) was significantly higher in <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first and second year; VO 2 max in every measurements was significantly higher in <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> at the first and second year than at beginning of the study.

5|$|Jolie has fronted a {{campaign}} against sexual violence in military conflict zones by the UK government, which made the issue a priority of its 2013 G8 presidency. In May 2012, she launched the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative (PSVI) with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who was inspired to campaign on the issue by her Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011). PSVI was established to complement wider UK government work by raising awareness and promoting international co-operation. Jolie spoke on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>at</b> the G8 foreign ministers meeting, where the attending nations adopted a historic declaration, and before the UN security council, which responded by adopting its broadest resolution on the issue to date. In June 2014, she co-chaired the four-day Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, the largest-ever meeting on the subject, {{which resulted in a}} protocol endorsed by 151 nations.|$|E
5|$|When Antoine was alive, many {{observers}} {{thought that the}} healings he obtained resulted to suggestion only, and Dr. Schuind, who wrote two articles in The Meuse (La Meuse) on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>at</b> the time, criticized the lack of control and vague diagnostics surrounding these healings. Sociologist Anne-Cécile Bégot considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine, (2) the traditional representation of disease—the real healing can be attained only through {{a new approach to}} the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension—and (3) the management of disease—sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an endogenous etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion, and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society.|$|E

Additionally, the art is mentioned in fragments from earlier Greek works including the Dialexis, dated to approximately 400 BCE. Aristotle wrote extensively {{on the subject of}} memory, and mentions the technique of the placement of images to lend order to memory. Passages in his works On The Soul and On Memory and Reminiscence proved to be influential in the later revival of the art among medieval Scholastics.|$|E

Compleat Angler was written by Izaak Walton in 1653 (although Walton continued to add to it {{for a quarter of}} a century) and described the fishing in the Derbyshire Wye.

There were roughly 1100 contributors altogether, a handful of whom were women; this edition {{was also the first}} to include a significant article about women ("Women, Law Relating to").

25|$|The art of {{fly fishing}} took a {{great leap forward}} after the English Civil War, where a newly found {{interest}} in the activity left its mark on the many books and treatises that were written on <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>at</b> the time. The renowned officer in the Parliamentary army, Robert Venables, published in 1662 The Experienced Angler, or Angling improved, being a general discourse of angling, imparting many of the aptest ways and choicest experiments for the taking of most sorts of fish in pond or river. Another Civil War veteran to enthusiastically take up fishing was Richard Franck. He {{was the first to}} describe salmon fishing in Scotland, and both in that and trout-fishing with artificial fly he was a practical angler. He was the first angler to name the burbot, and commended the salmon of the River Thames.|$|E
25|$|Leibniz's first {{position}} {{was as a}} salaried secretary to an alchemical society in Nuremberg. He knew fairly little about <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>at</b> that time but presented himself as deeply learned. He soon met Johann Christian von Boyneburg (1622–1672), the dismissed chief minister of the Elector of Mainz, Johann Philipp von Schönborn. Von Boyneburg hired Leibniz as an assistant, and shortly thereafter reconciled with the Elector and introduced Leibniz to him. Leibniz then dedicated an essay on law to the Elector {{in the hope of}} obtaining employment. The stratagem worked; the Elector asked Leibniz to assist with the redrafting of the legal code for the Electorate. In 1669, Leibniz was appointed assessor in the Court of Appeal. Although von Boyneburg died late in 1672, Leibniz remained under the employment of his widow until she dismissed him in 1674.|$|E
