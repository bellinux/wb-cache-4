40|$|An {{iterative}} procedure for calculating eigenvector derivatives {{has been developed}} based on the subspace iteration concept. The basic formulation is derived directly from the first variation of the resulting equations of subspace iteration for solving eigenvalue problems. Since the basic formulation conserves the convergence properties of the original subspace iteration for eigen-problems, an overrelaxation scheme similar <b>to</b> <b>Bathe's</b> approach is employed to accelerate the subspace iteration process for calculating eigenvector derivatives...|$|R

5|$|Classical Athenian girls {{probably}} reached menarche {{at about}} age fourteen, {{when they would}} have married. Girls who died before marriage were mourned for their failure to reach maturity. Memorial vases for dead girls in classical Athens often portrayed them dressed as brides, and were sometimes shaped like loutrophoroi (vases which held water used <b>to</b> <b>bathe</b> before the wedding day).|$|E
5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by {{any member of the}} general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>bathe</b> together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E
5|$|Gurnemanz {{asks the}} lead Knight for {{news of the}} King's health. The Knight says the King has {{suffered}} during the night and is going early <b>to</b> <b>bathe</b> in the holy lake. The squires ask Gurnemanz {{to explain how the}} King's injury can be healed, but he evades their question and a wild woman – Kundry – bursts in. She gives Gurnemanz a vial of balsam, brought from Arabia, to ease the King's pain and then collapses, exhausted.|$|E

5|$|Two {{or three}} oval white eggs, laid {{two to three}} days apart, are most {{commonly}} laid in a clutch, though there can be anywhere from one to five. They average 41.6mm long by 35.5mm wide, and are finely pitted. The female alone incubates the eggs, during which time she is fed by the male. She does leave the nest at dusk for around half an hour, sometimes <b>to</b> <b>bathe.</b> Incubation takes 30–31 days.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Cornish and Devonian icons, clotted cream has become entrenched in local folklore. For example, one myth tells of Jenny who enticed the giant Blunderbore (sometimes called Moran) by feeding him clotted cream. He {{eventually}} {{fell in love}} with her and made her his fourth wife. Another myth, from Dartmoor, tells of a princess who wanted to marry an elven prince, but according to tradition had <b>to</b> <b>bathe</b> in pure cream first. Unfortunately, a witch who wanted the prince for her daughter kept souring the cream. Eventually, the prince offered the princess clotted cream, which the witch was unable to sour.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Crabbaberry fishing station in West Voe was {{opened and the}} island had a {{population}} of 360 people or more. However, fuel shortages {{and a decline in}} fishing due to the introduction of steam drifters saw a fall in population from the 1870s on. At this time another duel entered the history of Papa Stour. Edwin Lindsay, an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of Balcarres, was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one. He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835. Lindsay's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed <b>to</b> <b>bathe.</b>|$|E

5|$|The rituals {{performed}} at the statue by pregnant women involved walking round three times, reciting charms and touching one's abdomen. Women would also carry a band which would either be touched to the statue and then tied around their waist, or half of the band would be tied to the statue while the remaining half would be kept on the woman's body until the child was born. After the childbirth, the basin {{in front of the}} statue was used by women <b>to</b> <b>bathe</b> in. The rites performed in the honour of the statue were said to be similar to those performed by Phoenicians in the worship of their Venus.|$|E
5|$|All {{significant}} {{stages of}} the history of England are represented within the city, from the Roman Baths (including their significant Celtic presence), to Bath Abbey and the Royal Crescent, to the more recent Thermae Bath Spa. The size of the tourist industry is reflected in the almost 300 places of accommodation– including more than 80 hotels, two of which have 'five-star' ratings, over 180 bed and breakfasts– many of which are located in Georgian buildings, and two campsites located on {{the western edge of the}} city. The city also has about 100 restaurants and a similar number of pubs and bars. Several companies offer open top bus tours around the city, as well as tours on foot and on the river. Since the opening of Thermae Bath Spa in 2006, the city has attempted to recapture its historical position as the only town or city in the United Kingdom offering visitors the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>bathe</b> in naturally heated spring waters.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{popular as}} a caged {{bird in the}} 19th century, the {{turquoise}} parrot was rarely seen in captivity between 1928 and 1956, the main problem being {{the high rate of}} infertile eggs. It has become more common since, and has adapted readily to aviculture. A quiet species, it likes <b>to</b> <b>bathe</b> in captivity. There is a possibility of interbreeding {{with other members of the}} genus Neophema if caged together. Specimens with more prominent orange bellies have been bred, sourced from wild birds in New South Wales and not from breeding with scarlet-chested parrots. A yellow form, where the blue pigment is lost and yellow and red pigments are conserved, first appeared in the 1950s in aviculture. It is a recessive mutation. Other colour forms seen are a red-fronted and pied form (both recessive), and jade and olive (dominant).|$|E

50|$|A later John Burnell of Casleknock {{took part}} in the Rebellion of Silken Thomas and was {{executed}} for treason at Tyburn in 1537; but his cousin, yet another John, managed to retain the family estates, which later passed by inheritance <b>to</b> the <b>Bathe</b> family.|$|R
5|$|The Puranas {{introduce}} {{themes that}} are echoed in later works, including the deception of the unsuspecting Ahalya by Indra's devious disguise as Gautama in his absence. The Padma Purana states that after Gautama leaves for his ritual bath, Indra masquerades as Gautama and asks Ahalya to satisfy him. Ahalya, engrossed in worship, rejects him, considering it inappropriate {{to have sex}} {{at the cost of}} neglecting the gods. Indra reminds her that her first duty is to serve him. Finally Ahalya gives in, but Gautama learns of Indra's deception through his supernatural powers and returns to the ashram. A similar account is found in the Brahma Purana. At times, Indra {{takes the form of a}} cock that crows to dispatch Gautama for his morning ablutions, as in the 18th-century Telugu rendition of the tale by the warrior-poet Venkata Krishnappa Nayaka of the Madurai Nayak Dynasty. In other versions, he uses an accomplice, such as the moon-god Chandra, to distract Gautama. In the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Ahalya comes <b>to</b> <b>bathe</b> in the Svarnadi (heavenly river) and Indra becomes infatuated with her when he sees her. Assuming Gautama's form, Indra has sex with her until they sink to the river bed in exhaustion. However, Gautama catches them in the act. Another version in the same Purana focuses on the question of how the chaste Ahalya was seduced by Indra. In this version, Indra approaches Ahalya on the banks of the Mandakini river in his own form to ask for a sexual favour, which is flatly refused by Ahalya. Indra subsequently poses as Gautama and fulfils his objective.|$|E
