25|$|On August 12, 1996, Mayne Queen {{departed}} Swartz Bay {{terminal and}} ran aground off Piers Island after losing steering control. The grounding occurred while performing a regular weekly {{test of the}} batteries for <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> system. A crew member overheard {{there was going to}} be a test, and in an attempt to be helpful and without direction, cut all power from the vessel's steering batteries, as he had done at night when the ship was stored, not realizing that the test in question only required the removal of a battery charger and that his assistance was neither requested nor required. No one was injured in the incident, and the vessel was assisted off the rocks at high tide, but it suffered extensive damage to its propulsion system, having two of the four steering and propulsion pods for the right-angle drives sheared off and one of the two remaining pods suffering propeller damage.|$|E
500|$|Around 4:00, Indefatigable was hit {{around the}} rear turret {{by two or}} three shells from Von der Tann. She fell out of {{formation}} to starboard and started sinking towards the stern and listing to port. Her magazines exploded at 4:03 after more hits, one on the forecastle and another on the forward turret. Smoke and flames gushed from the forward part {{of the ship and}} large pieces were thrown [...] into the air. The most likely cause of her loss was a deflagration or low-order explosion in 'X' magazine that blew out her bottom and severed <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> shafts, followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley. Von der Tann fired only fifty-two [...] shells at Indefatigable before she exploded. Of her crew of 1,019, only three survived. While still in the water, two survivors found Indefatigable's captain, C. F. Sowerby, who was badly wounded and died before they could be rescued. Two survivors, Able Seaman Frederick Arthur Gordon Elliott and Leading Signalman Charles Farmer, were rescued by the German torpedo boat [...] A third survivor, Signalman John Bowyer, was picked up by another unknown German ship. He was incorrectly reported as a crew member from HMS Nestor in [...] "The Times" [...] on 24 June 1916.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 March, U-66 {{left for}} what would be her most {{successful}} patrol, resulting in 43,956 gross metric tons sunk and 12,502 gross metric tons damaged in the Caribbean Sea. 24 days after departure she sank Korthion, a [...] Greek steam merchantman just south of Barbados with one torpedo hit amidships. Two days later, the boat sank Amsterdam, a [...] Dutch steam tanker, which split in two after being hit by two torpedoes, one amidships, {{and one in the}} engine room. Most of the survivors were picked up near Port of Spain, (Trinidad) by Ivan, a Yugoslavian steam merchant vessel. The next day U-66 attacked Heinrich von Riedemann, an 11,020-ton Panamanian motor tanker. The first torpedo severely damaged <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> of her port engine and ruptured a tank of oil, making much of it leak out. 20 minutes after the first hit, just after the starboard engine was stopped, the ship was abandoned when the crew took to the lifeboats. An hour later U-66 hit her with a second torpedo, setting her afire. It extinguished itself within 25 minutes. 50 minutes later the submarine hit her with a third torpedo, which set the ship afire again. She remained that way for about 70 minutes before she finally sank. Nine days later U-66 sank the [...] US Alcoa Partner with a torpedo and a shot from her deck gun.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic benefit}} of using run-flat tires is {{continued}} mobility {{in case of}} a loss of air pressure, due either to a 'normal' puncture or to a hostile deliberate act including a bullet strike while the vehicle is traveling at high speed.

50|$|According to Mitsubishi, the Lancer Evolution {{uses its}} four-wheel drive system {{to improve the}} handling, rather than simply to {{increase}} traction. Super AYC acts like a limited slip differential to optimise the Lancer’s handling during hard driving. It improves cornering performance by transferring torque between the rear wheels. It also works harmoniously with the ACD, which was introduced on the Evolution VII. Mitsubishi's Sports ABS system is used to enhance <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> during hard driving. The Sport ABS ECU uses inputs from steering angle, lateral G and vehicle speed sensors to individually apportion braking pressure {{to each of the}} four wheels.|$|E

The fault was corrected in time to ensure the success of AST#3, the first comprehensive test of the entire system. On September 14, 1998, all system components successfully countered a computer-simulated threat.

40|$|In {{precision}} agriculture (PA), {{an agricultural}} vehicle navigation {{system is essential}} and the navigation control accuracy is important in this system. As straight path tracking is the major operating mode of agricultural vehicles on large fields, a cascaded navigation control method for straight path tracking is proposed in this study. Firstly, a cascaded navigation control structure for the agricultural vehicle was discussed. Based on this structure, the navigation control task was decomposed into two cascaded control tasks, namely, the path tracking control task and <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> task. Secondly, a relative kinematics model of agricultural vehicles was deduced, and an optimal Proportional-Derivative (PD) method based on the deduced model {{was developed in the}} path tracking control task. Then, an improved PD method based on a transition process was proposed in <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> task to enhance the performance of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>control</b> subsystem. Finally, the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed method were verified by a series of experiments. Results of the experimental data analysis show that mean value of the lateral position deviation is 0. 02 m and standard deviation of the lateral position deviation is 0. 04 m, which proves that the proposed method has achieved satisfactory effects on the straight path tracking of agricultural vehicles...|$|E
