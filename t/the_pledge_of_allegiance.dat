During his time in Iraq, Rice met with Colorado Governor Bill Ritter, Congressman Ed Perlmutter, and Congressional candidate Jared Polis during their trips to the country, and also met with U.S. Marine and Colorado state senator Steve Ward, who was stationed in Iraq at the same time.

5|$|World War I {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the school. A newfound sense of patriotism had the {{administration}} require students to recite <b>the</b> <b>Pledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Allegiance</b> as an entrance requirement to the school. The war also {{had an effect on}} enrollment as all of the male students gradually left the school to join the war efforts; in 1916 there were 421 total students, 382 in 1917, 172 in 1918 (including only one male student), and in 1919, 147 students. In addition to the students, some of the faculty members joined the military. Due to the decreased student enrollment, the remaining faculty had the opportunity to further their own training. On campus, both students and faculty worked with the Red Cross, organized bond drives, and sent packages to troops overseas.|$|E

25|$|The Abbasid Revolution was {{distinguished}} {{by a number}} of tactics which were absent in the other, unsuccessful anti-Umayyad rebellions at the time. Chief among them was secrecy.

As-Saffah would go on to become the first Abbasid caliph, but he did not come forward to receive <b>the</b> <b>pledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> from the people until after the Umayyad caliph and a large number of his princes were already killed.|$|E

25|$|Prominent legal {{challenges}} {{were brought in}} the 1930s and 1940s by Jehovah's Witnesses, a denomination whose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power other than God, and who objected to policies in public schools requiring students {{to swear an oath}} to the flag. They said requiring the pledge violated their freedom of religion guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The first case was in 1935, when two children, Lillian and William Gobitas, ages ten and twelve, were expelled from the Minersville, Pennsylvania, public schools that year for failing to salute the flag and recite <b>the</b> <b>Pledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Allegiance.</b>|$|E

He decided to support a New Jersey lawsuit in 2000 against the Boy Scouts of America, in an attempt to require the Boy Scouts to accept homosexual scout leaders. The Supreme Court ruled against Edmondson's position, ruling that the Boys Scouts of America had the authority to set the criteria for leadership within their organization.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March 2015, Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau pledged {{allegiance}} to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant via an audio message posted on the organisation's Twitter account.

ISIL publications from late March 2015 began referring to members of Boko Haram as part of Wilayat Gharb Afriqiya (West Africa Province). The group suffered a split in 2016, with ISIL appointing 'Abu Musab al-Barnawi' as the group's new leader, due to disagreements with Abubakar Shekau's leadership. This was rejected by Shekau and his supporters, who continued to operate independently.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{practice}} to involve hand motions to accompany these spoken words.

As the speaker recites the second line, they will place their right hand over their heart, much like during <b>the</b> <b>Pledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Allegiance.</b> For the third line, the speaker will present their hands, palm side up, before them. For the fourth line, the speaker will motion to their body down their sides. And for the final line, the speaker will usually place their right hand out for club, left hand for community, bring them together for country, and then bring their hands upwards in a circle for world.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 Bill, H.R. 2389, to {{prohibit}} the Supreme Court's and most federal courts from considering any legal {{challenges to the}} government's requiring or promoting of <b>the</b> <b>Pledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Allegiance,</b> died in the Senate after having passed in the House. This action is viewed in general as court stripping by Congress of the constitutional power of the Judiciary. Even if a similar bill is enacted, its practical effect may not be clear: proponents of the bill have {{said that it is}} a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution, but opponents say Congress does not have the authority to prevent the Supreme Court from hearing claims based on the Bill of Rights, since amendments postdate the original text of the Constitution and may thus implicitly limit the scope of Article III, Section 2. Judges and legal analysts have said that if Congress can remove from the judicial branch the ability to determine if legislation is constitutional, the US separation of powers would be disturbed, or rendered non-functional.|$|E
25|$|In 1892, Francis Bellamy created {{what was}} known as the Bellamy salute. It started with the hand outstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended with the palm up. Because of the {{similarity}} between the Bellamy salute and the Nazi salute, which was adopted in Germany later, the US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture as the salute to be rendered by civilians during <b>the</b> <b>Pledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>Allegiance</b> and the national anthem in the US would be the salute to replace the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy salute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag Code language first passed into law on June 22, 1942. Attached to bills passed in Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1)of title 36, United States Code), language was included which authorized all active duty military personnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute during the raising and lowering of the flag, when the colors are presented, and during the National Anthem.|$|E

Although it advertised <b>the</b> <b>pledges</b> <b>of</b> <b>allegiance</b> <b>of</b> several AQIM splinter factions during 2015, none of the groups involved are believed to be large, and the group did not claim responsibility for any attacks in the year following the kidnapping and killing of Gourdel.|$|R
