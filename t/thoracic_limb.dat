50|$|Decerebellate {{rigidity}} {{is caused}} by a lesion in the cerebellum. The function of the cerebellum is to coordinate muscular activity.

Mentation of decerebellate animals is generally adequate.|$|E
50|$|The {{skeletal}} {{system of the}} horse has three major functions in the body. It protects vital organs, provides framework, and supports soft parts of the body. Horses typically have 205 bones. The pelvic limb typically contains 19 bones, while the <b>thoracic</b> <b>limb</b> contains 20 bones.|$|E

40|$|A four-year-old, male Italian hound was {{presented}} with severe spasticity of both <b>thoracic</b> <b>limbs</b> that worsened with external stimuli. The remainder of the neurological and general physical examination was normal. Complete blood cell count, chemistry profile, and serology for protozoal diseases were within normal limits. Survey radiography of the cervicothoracic spine and abdominal ultrasonography showed no abnormalities. Electromyography of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>limbs</b> demonstrated the presence of 'doublets' and simultaneous activity in both agonist and antagonist muscles. These abnormalities {{may be explained by}} a defective glycinergic inhibition at the spinal cord level. Together with the history, progression of signs, and clinical findings, electromyography supported a presumptive diagnosis of focal tetanus. The dog received tetanus antitoxin and antibiotic treatment and gradually improved over four months. © 2006 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.

40|$|We {{revise the}} Holarctic genus Rhynchotalona Norman, 1903 (Anomopoda: Chydoridae). Palaearctic R. falcata (Sars, 1862) is redescribed, {{including}} morphology of <b>thoracic</b> <b>limbs</b> and gamogenetic stages. North American populations pre-viously identified as R. falcata, revealed two {{new species of}} the genus. R. weiri sp. nov. differs from R. falcata in smaller size, much shorter rostrum, different shape of main head pore and different morphology of postabdomen in male and fe-male. R. longisteta sp. nov. differs from R. falcata in long posterior setae of the valve postero-ventral portion. Both new species also differ {{from each other and}} from R. falcata in the morphology of <b>thoracic</b> <b>limbs.</b> Our data suggests that the Palaearctic R. falcata is absent in North America, confirming Frey's non-cosmopolitism paradigm for the Chydoridae. The genus diagnosis is emended, taking into consideration the newly described taxa. A key for species determination is pro-vided...|$|R
40|$|Members of {{the diverse}} {{butterfly}} families Nymphalidae (brush-footed butterflies) and Riodinidae (metalmarks) have reduced first <b>thoracic</b> <b>limbs</b> and only use two pairs of legs for walking. In order to address questions about the detailed morphology and evolutionary origins of these reduced <b>limbs,</b> the three <b>thoracic</b> <b>limbs</b> of 13 species of butterflies representing all six butterfly families were examined and measured, and ancestral limb sizes were reconstructed {{for males and females}} separately. Differences in limb size across butterflies involve changes in limb segment size rather than number of limb segments. Reduction of the first limb in both nymphalids and riodinids appears particularly extensive in the femur, but the evolution of these reduced limbs is suggested to be a convergent evolutionary event. Possible developmental differences as well as ecological factors driving the evolution of reduced limbs are discussed...|$|R
