40|$|Abstract — Data mining is an {{analytical}} tool which {{allows users to}} analyze data, categories it and summaries the relationships among the data. It discovers the useful information from large amount of relational databases. Security {{is an important issue}} while performing mining task at the end of third <b>party</b> <b>service</b> provider. When data owner outsources its mining needs to third <b>party</b> <b>service</b> provider, there should be security. Third <b>party</b> <b>service</b> provider has access to the data and can learn sensitive information from it. The result is security may break. As data is an important private property of the owner, it should be secure. This paper presents the algorithms used for mining purpose as well as for securing the data while transacting between Data owner and Third <b>party</b> <b>service</b> provider. It gives secure, efficient and faster results...|$|R

50|$|In the sixties, the Dutch society {{became more}} secularized and the pillars faded, and voters {{began to move}} away from the <b>three</b> Christian-democratic <b>parties.</b> In 1963 general {{election}} the <b>three</b> <b>parties</b> held 51% of the vote, whilst in 1972 general election they held only 32%. This decline forced the <b>three</b> <b>parties</b> to work closer together. In 1967 the Group of Eighteen was formed: it was a think-tank of six prominent politicians per party that planned the future cooperation of the <b>three</b> <b>parties.</b> In 1968 the three political leaders of the parties (Norbert Schmelzer (KVP), Barend Biesheuvel (ARP) and Jur Mellema (CHU) made a public appearance, stating that the <b>three</b> <b>parties</b> would continue to work together.|$|R
50|$|The third <b>party</b> <b>service</b> {{involves}} utilizing {{an external}} agency {{to inform the}} individuals {{at the top of}} the organizational pyramid of misconduct, without disclosing the identity of the whistleblower.

50|$|In March 2007, the PRS {{formed a}} three-party {{alliance}} with the PAIGC and the United Social Democratic <b>Party,</b> as the <b>three</b> <b>parties</b> sought {{to form a new}} government. This led to a successful no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Aristides Gomes and his resignation later in the month; on 9 April, the <b>three</b> <b>parties</b> nominated Martinho Ndafa Kabi of the PAIGC for Prime Minister, with President Vieira appointing him to the post. On 17 April a new government was named, composed of ministers from the <b>three</b> <b>parties.</b>|$|R
50|$|This caused {{progressive}} forces {{within the}} <b>three</b> <b>parties,</b> especially the ARP and KVP, to regret their political affiliation. In 1968 they founded the Political Party of Radicals (PPR), a left-wing party that sought {{cooperation with the}} Labour Party (PvdA). Locally and provincially however the <b>three</b> <b>parties</b> had long cooperated well, in some areas they formed one Christian-democratic parliamentary party and proposed one list of candidates.

50|$|With {{the current}} results there are arguably four options for a stable {{majority}} coalition: left-wing, centre-left, centre-right or right-wing.
