5|$|Due to {{copyright}} problems {{an official}} {{release of the}} animations has proven impossible. For the American release of the film, the rights <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the Playboy bunny costume was denied and the rights to Electric Light Orchestra's music was consequently not sought. However, a laserdisc featuring Daicon III & IV Opening Animation was unofficially released in Japan as bonus material to a ¥16,000 art book of the animations. This laserdisc is considered rare and highly valuable among collectors, easily fetching prices over a thousand dollars on online auctions.|$|E

The Venturing change will occur in late 2013 or early 2014; the Cub Scout change will take effect in mid-2015.|$|E
5|$|The city of Providence is {{geographically}} very compact, {{characteristic of}} eastern seaboard cities that developed prior <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the automobile. It {{is among the}} most densely populated cities in the country. For this reason, Providence has the eighth-highest percentage of pedestrian commuters. The street layout is irregular; more than one thousand streets (a great number for the city's size) run haphazardly, connecting and radiating from traditionally bustling places such as Market Square.|$|E

5|$|Uranium's average {{concentration}} in the Earth's crust is (depending on the reference) 2 to 4 parts per million, or about 40 times as abundant as silver. The Earth's crust from the surface to 25km (15mi) down is calculated to contain 1017kg (2lb) of uranium while the oceans may contain 1013kg (2lb). The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million (up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> phosphate fertilizers), and its {{concentration in}} sea water is 3 parts per billion.|$|E
5|$|An {{autonomous}} oblast {{during the}} Soviet era {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Azerbaijan SSR, Nagorno-Karabakh's population was approximately 75% ethnic Armenian. As the Soviet Union's disintegration approached during the late 1980s, the enclave's government expressed its desire to secede and unite with the neighboring Armenian SSR. By 1991, Armenia and Azerbaijan were independent countries but the nascent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic remained internationally unrecognized despite its government's declaration of independence. Small-scale violence had flared up between the two ethnic groups in February 1988 but soon escalated <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Soviet-built tanks, helicopters, and fighter bombers appropriated by both sides after the collapse of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} among patients undergoing {{hyperbaric oxygen therapy}} is rare, and is influenced {{by a number of}} a factors: individual sensitivity and treatment protocol; and probably therapy indication and equipment used. A study by Welslau in 1996 reported 16 incidents out of a population of 107,264 patients (0.015%), while Hampson and Atik in 2003 found a rate of 0.03%. Yildiz, Ay and Qyrdedi, in a summary of 36,500 patient treatments between 1996 and 2003, reported only 3 oxygen toxicity incidents, giving a rate of 0.008%. A later review of over 80,000 patient treatments revealed an even lower rate: 0.0024%. The reduction in incidence may be partly due <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a mask (rather than a hood) to deliver oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Ferry {{implementation}} required {{permission from}} several entities. Before the ferry could start service, the NYCDOT {{was required to}} approve a new transportation mode within its service area. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and United States Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) was supposed to give NYC Ferry permission <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the landings, with the United States Coast Guard advising the CoE's approval of a permit as well as monitoring the design of vessels. In addition, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had to allow ferries to use the landing at Gantry Plaza State Park, and the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was consulted so they could give permission for the Roosevelt Island landing to be built. By September 2016, the Gantry Plaza landing had been approved.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, the bald eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E

Assess what technical and policy tools cultural institutions are employing to control access <b>to</b> and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> online digital collections. 2. 	Investigate motivations for controlling access <b>to</b> or <b>use</b> <b>of</b> collections (e. g., copyright, privacy, protecting traditional restrictions, income generation etc.). 3. 	Investigate discouragers to the implementation <b>of</b> access and <b>use</b> control systems (e. g., preference for open collections, lack of resources, institutional mission, etc.). 4. 	Gauge interest in implementing technical systems to control access <b>to</b> and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> collections. 5. 	Determine what types of assistance IMLS could provide. 6.
