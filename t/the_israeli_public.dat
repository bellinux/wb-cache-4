25|$|The {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> opposes reverting to pre-1967 borders. A 2011 study found that, because of security concerns, 77% of Israelis oppose returning to pre-1967 lines, {{even if it}} would lead to peace between Israel and neighboring Arab states.|$|E
50|$|Bar {{was first}} elected mayor of the Ramat Gan in 1989.

2500|$|Since the {{outbreak}} of the violent Second Intifada in December 2000, Peace Now has arguably lost a certain degree of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public's</b> support. While <b>the</b> First Intifada was largely a popular movement {{on the part of the}} Palestinian public, the Second Intifada [...] consisted of far more violent confrontations between Palestinian militants and <b>the</b> IDF, <b>Israeli</b> settlers within <b>the</b> West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and [...] Israeli civilians. According to <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 132 Israeli individuals were killed by Palestinian militant bomb/suicide attacks within Israel proper between 2000 and 2004.|$|R
25|$|Violence in March {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} 8 Israelis, mostly civilians, and 26 Palestinians. In Hebron, a Palestinian sniper killed ten-month-old Israeli baby Shalhevet Pass. The murder shocked <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public.</b> According to the Israel police investigation the sniper aimed deliberately at the baby.|$|E
25|$|March 26: Shalhevet Pass, age 10 months, {{was shot}} dead by member of the Tanzim militant group at the {{entrance}} to the Avraham Avinu neighborhood in Hebron. The murder shocked <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> because the official investigation ruled that the Palestinian sniper had intentionally aimed for the baby.|$|E
25|$|The {{assassination}} of Rabin {{was a shock}} to <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public.</b> Rallies and memorials took place near Kings of Israel Square—later renamed Rabin Square in his honor—as well as near Rabin's home, the Knesset building, and the home of the assassin. Many other streets and public buildings around the country were named for Rabin as well.|$|E
50|$|The Public Affairs Branch: This {{branch is}} {{responsible}} for the IDF's direct, unmediated relationship with the public, both in Israel and around the world. The branch is split into three different units—the Military-Society Department, responsible for <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public's</b> access to <b>the</b> IDF; the Jewish Organizations and Foreign Governments Department, responsible for those groups' access to the IDF; and the Public Correspondence Department, responsible for responding to public requests for information, including under Israel's Freedom of Information Law.|$|R

25|$|The {{assassination}} of Ze'evi {{was a shock}} to <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> and left a lasting impression on many Israelis. Thousands of people attended the funeral of Ze'evi that took place a day after the assassination, at the Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem, where Ze'evi was buried. President Moshe Katsav and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon eulogized Ze'evi at his funeral.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial was}} criticised in Israel {{as a show}} trial, {{although}} strict Israeli military censorship of the press, at the time, meant that <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> was {{kept in the dark}} about {{the facts of the case}} and, in fact, were led to believe that the defendants were innocent. There were allegations that evidence had been extracted by torture.|$|E
25|$|Barak did not fare as well {{in public}} opinion polls. Only 25% of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> thought his {{positions}} on Camp David were just right as opposed to 58% of the public that thought Barak compromised too much.

25|$|Palestinian {{attacks against}} Israel have been costly for Israel. IDF reports show {{that from the}} start of the Second Intifada (in 2000) to the Year 2005, Palestinians killed 1,074 Israelis and wounded 7,520. Such losses {{generated}} immense public pressure from <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> for a forceful response, and ramped up targeted killings were one such outcome.|$|E
25|$|The attack shocked <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public,</b> and was {{classified}} by Amnesty International {{as a crime}} against humanity. On June 6, 2007, the IDF arrested Jihad Salah Saliman Abu Dahar, a Palestinian member of Islamic Jihad from the Khan Yunis area, who according to Shin Bet officials admitted to several acts of violence, including the attack on Hatuel and her daughters.|$|E
25|$|Another investigative {{committee}} took up {{the matter}} and sided with the Cohn inquiry. Ben-Gurion then resigned from his post as defense minister. This led to the expulsion of Lavon from the Histadrut labor union and an early call for new elections, the results of which changed the political structure in Israel. The specifics of Operation Susannah were kept secret from <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> {{at the time of}} the political upheaval.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the arguable {{decline in}} <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public's</b> support for <b>the</b> Oslo Peace Process, Peace Now succeeded in leading a {{demonstration}} of between 60,000 to 100,000 in May 2002, after Israeli military forces began on March 29 a large-scale military Operation Defensive Shield in the West Bank and as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was mobilizing reserve forces for a possible military invasion of Gaza. The demonstration was held under the banner [...] "Get Out of The Territories". According to [...] "Peace Now" [...] itself, shortly after {{the outbreak of the}} Second Intifada, it was instrumental in creating <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> Peace Coalition, which later evolved into the Israeli-Palestine Peace Coalition. Its main objective is to end <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> occupation of Palestinian lands, and to achieve a just, lasting and comprehensive peace based on a two-state solution.|$|R
25|$|On June 2, 2008 <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>Public</b> Utility Authority {{approved}} a feed-in tariff for solar plants. The tariff {{is limited to}} a total installation of 50MW during 7 years, whichever is reached first, with a maximum of 15 kWp installation for residential and a maximum of 50kWp for commercial. The National Infrastructures Ministry announced on December 2009 on expanding the feed-in tariff scheme to include medium-sized solar-power stations ranging from 50 kilowatts to 5 megawatts, though only one project was approved by June 2010.|$|E
25|$|In Israel, {{the only}} {{institutionalized}} form of Jewish marriage is the religious one, i. e., a marriage conducted {{under the auspices}} of the rabbinate. Specifically, marriage of Israeli Jews must be conducted according to Jewish Law (halakha), as viewed by Orthodox Judaism. One consequence is that Jews in Israel who cannot marry according to Jewish law (e. g., a kohen and a divorcée, or a Jew and one who is not halachically Jewish), cannot marry each other. This has led for calls, mostly from the secular segment of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public,</b> for the institution of civil marriage.|$|E
25|$|Increased Soviet {{antisemitism}} {{and enthusiasm}} {{generated by the}} 1967 victory led to a wave of Soviet Jews applying to emigrate to Israel. Those who left could only take two suitcases. Most Jews were refused exit visas and persecuted by the authorities. Some were arrested and sent to Gulag camps, becoming known as Prisoners of Zion. During 1971, violent demonstrations by the Israeli Black Panthers, made <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> aware of resentment among Mizrahi Jews at ongoing discrimination and social gaps. In 1972 the U.S. Jewish Mafia leader, Meyer Lansky, who had taken refuge in Israel, was deported to the United States.|$|E

25|$|The {{failure of}} the peace process and the {{eruption}} of the Second Intifada, which included increased Palestinian terror attacks being made against Israeli civilians, led much of <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> and political leadership to lose confidence in the Palestinian Authority as a peace partner. Due to an increase in terror attacks during the Second Intifada, mainly carried out by Hamas against Israeli civilians, Israeli troops began conducting regular raids and arrests inside the West Bank. In addition, Israel increased the selective assassinations against Hamas operatives. Initially this policy was aimed at active militants but later on it was also aimed at the Hamas leadership as well, including Sheikh Ahmad Yassin. This policy spurred controversy within Israel and worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his term, Netanyahu {{was opposed}} by the {{political}} left wing in Israel and lost support from the right because of his concessions to the Palestinians in Hebron and elsewhere, and due to his negotiations with Arafat generally. Netanyahu lost favor with <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> after a long chain of scandals involving his marriage and corruption charges. In 1997, police recommended that Netanyahu be indicted on corruption charges for influence-peddling. He was accused of appointing an attorney general who would reduce the charges and prosecutors ruled that there was insufficient evidence to go to trial. In 1999, Netanyahu faced another scandal when the Israel Police recommended that he be tried for corruption for $100,000 in free services from a government contractor; Israel's attorney general did not prosecute, citing difficulties with evidence.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, Netanyahu confessed on live {{television}} to having {{had an affair}} with Ruth Bar, his public relations adviser, claiming that a political rival had planted a secret video camera that had recorded him in a sexually compromising position with Bar, and that he had been threatened with the release of the tape to the press unless he quit the Likud leadership race. Benjamin and Sara repaired their marriage, and Netanyahu was elected to the leadership of Likud. In 1996, there were media reports of his 20-year friendship with Katherine Price-Mondadori, an Italian-American woman. During the 1990s, Netanyahu criticized this media intrusion into his private life, claiming that political rivals including David Levy had hired spies on him {{in order to try to}} gather evidence of alleged affairs, although it was noted that <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>public</b> are generally not interested in their politician's private lives and would prefer they remained private.|$|E

50|$|Yosef, however, had {{no sympathy}} towards Israeli Jews who profess a secular lifestyle, and {{saw them as}} {{effectively}} being non-Jewish.
