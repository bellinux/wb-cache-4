In a CNN interview about the show, he told Larry King [...] "no one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead. And <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said I {{was going to do}} with Phenomenon.

500|$|Pearson {{was born}} near Spartanburg, South Carolina. When Pearson was young, he climbed a tree {{at the local}} stock car racing track (Spartanburg Fairgrounds) to see the races. Pearson said, [...] "I'd always been {{interested}} in cars, and I decided right then <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do with my life." [...] He worked with his brother in a car body repair shop, and used the money to purchase a Ford coach. Pearson removed the fenders to convert the vehicle into a street rod. He jumped the car over ditches until he rolled it over. His mother paid him to junk the car and he used the money to purchase another car to build. In 1952, he raced a 1940 Ford at dirt tracks and won $30 in an outlaw class race. He kept winning and attracted the attention of Spartanburg's racing community, including Joe Littlejohn.|$|E
500|$|During 1965, Dylan {{composed}} prose, poems, {{and songs}} by typing incessantly. Footage in Dont Look Back of Dylan in his suite at London's Savoy Hotel captures this process. However, Dylan told two interviewers that [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] {{began as a}} long piece of [...] "vomit" [...] (10 pages long according to one account, 20 according to another) that later acquired musical form. Dylan has never publicly spoken of writing any other major composition in this way. In an interview with CBC radio in Montreal, Dylan called {{the creation of the}} song a [...] "breakthrough", explaining that it changed his perception of where he was going in his career. He said that he found himself writing [...] "this long piece of vomit, 20 pages long, and out of it I took 'Like a Rolling Stone' and made it as a single. And I'd never written anything like that before and it suddenly came to me <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do... After writing that I wasn't interested in writing a novel, or a play. I just had too much, I want to write songs." ...|$|E

500|$|Hiddleston is {{well known}} for his {{portrayal}} of Loki in the 2011 Marvel Studios film, Thor. He was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on Ivanov and Wallander. Hiddleston said of Branagh, [...] "Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'. It was massive and it's completely changed the course of what is available to me to do. Ken gave me my break." [...] In the beginning, he originally auditioned for the part of Thor. [...] "I initially auditioned to play Thor. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And it was in my auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. They saw some temperament that they liked." [...] The casting director gave Hiddleston six weeks to bulk up, so he went on a strict diet and gained twenty pounds of muscle. In the end, Branagh decided he was more suitable as the antagonist and cast him as Loki.|$|E
500|$|SEAL Team 10's quick-reaction force (QRF) commander. Bana {{had read}} the book Lone Survivor prior to production, and was willing {{to appear in the}} film, {{regardless}} of which role was offered to him. Upon being cast as Kristensen, Bana researched the fallen serviceman and his family. On joining the production of Lone Survivor, Bana stated, [...] "There are two factors that make this story special, and they are the reasons why I jumped on board. One is the story itself, and two is who chooses to direct a project like this. I knew how involved [...] would be and that he would know how to portray SEAL teammates. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to be a part}} of. The greatest way to honor these guys is to make a great film and have it stand the test of time." [...] Bana did not physically prepare for the role. [...] "My responsibility was really to understand the role of the mission commander and the relevant information with respect with the chain of command and what it means to go in the QRF and the processes involved", he explained. [...] "It was far more important to be the person that was responsible for that part of the story and understand that completely. There's no purpose in me going out and firing an M4 in this case." ...|$|E

In high school, Fortney was {{interested}} in baseball until the audience reaction he got playing John Mellencamp’s [...] "Small Town" [...] for the school talent show made an impression on him. Although he had played guitar for a while, he didn’t start writing music until he wrote a song for a friend’s funeral.

You'll look beautiful. We have a very limited budget but honest, you'll be proud.' And it was bad, very bad. At least <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was told.

2500|$|Two {{years after}} the release of her debut, Velasquez {{represented}} the Philippines in the 1989 Asia Pacific Singing Contest. She had initially felt apprehensive to compete and was skeptical about the idea of participating in another competition at that stage in her career. Velasquez said, [...] "I was scared at first of going there to compete. I felt I wasn't that good. Besides, I've gotten tired of competing. All my life <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did. I was tired of the pressure." [...] She eventually obliged at the urging of Henares and later won the contest in Hong Kong, performing the songs [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone" [...] from the 1945 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and [...] "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going" [...] from the musical Dreamgirls ...|$|E

In 1945, the 71st Reconnaissance Group employed them as armed forward air controllers during ground operations in the Philippines, until it received delivery of P-51s. They claimed 655 aerial victories.|$|E
