But the fractional property industry started in the U.S. in the Rocky Mountains ski resorts in the early 1990s. These first fractional developments recognized <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not want to buy whole homes, which they would use only for a few weeks a year in the mountains. According to research firm Ragatz Associates there were over 250 fractional developments in North America in 2006 and fractional properties can now be found throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Land, the {{immobile}} property, and its produce {{were both}} taxable, as {{the king was}} owed a share for being the administrator of the land. Landlords and Peasants paid the tax - the land tax was known as Irai or Karai and the tax on produce was called Vari. It is believed that one-sixth of the produce was collected as tax. During times of floods and famines, cultivation was much affected and the kings {{were known to be}} kind enough to make remissions. Taxes were collected by revenue officials known as Variya and Kavidi and they were assisted by accountants called Ayakanakkar. There were graneries, known as Kalanjiyam, in public places {{as well as in the}} houses of the farmers to store excess grain so <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not suffer in times of floods or famines. The Manram (council) of the village took necessary decisions to safeguard the interests of the people.|$|E

How empty the streets are and how melancholy, so many poor sick {{people in the streets}} full of sores… in Westminster, there is never a physician and but one apothecary left, all being dead." [...] <b>That</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not starve was down to the foresight of Sir John Lawrence and the Corporation of London who arranged for a commission of one farthing to be paid above the normal price for every quarter of corn landed in the Port of London. Another food source was the villages around London which, denied of their usual sales in the capital, left vegetables in specified market areas, negotiated their sale by shouting, and collected their payment after the money had been left submerged in a bucket of water to [...] "disinfect" [...] the coins.|$|E

A lot of the folks who represented summer and spring and fall had been killed and assassinated. The only season left is winter. ...Bobby Kennedy and Dr. King and John Kennedy, those were folks who represented spring and summer, and they killed them. So we wanted to do an album about where we were. And we weren't trying to depress people, hell, they were living it, they already knew but we were trying to describe it and were certainly not alone... we felt as though a part of it was the folks in charge of the political structure. They were snowmen..." ...|$|E

By the time Eden attains the favour of the publishers and the bourgeoisie who had shunned him, he has already developed a grudge against them and become jaded by toil and unrequited love. Instead of enjoying his success, he retreats into a quiet indifference, interrupted only to rail mentally against the genteelness of bourgeois society or to donate his new wealth to working-class friends and family. He felt <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not value him for himself or for his work but only for his fame.|$|E
2500|$|Senior Human Rights Watch adviser Alison Des Forges {{said the}} lack of legal {{representation}} was a serious concern. [...] "The authorities' view {{is that this is}} a quasi-customary kind of procedure, and there never used to be lawyers, so there's no need for lawyers now. The problem with that is that little is the same except for the name. In this system, there is considerable weight given to the official side. The office of the prosecutor provides considerable assistance to the bench [...] in terms of making its determination, so you no longer have a level playing field." [...] There may, however, be no alternative to the Gacaca trials, she added. [...] "Obviously the problem of delivering justice after the genocide is an overwhelming problem. Gacaca may not be ideal but there is at this point no alternative.... The official explanation I think is <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not speak openly until the Gacaca process and now many more accusations are surfacing. Also, the concession program, which requires the naming of all those who participated along with the accused , has led to a multiplication of names.

2500|$|An {{introductory}} paragraph {{added to}} the Book of Mormon in the LDS Church's 1981 edition stated in part: [...] "After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, {{and they are the}} principal ancestors of the American Indians." [...] In a 2006 edition, the statement was altered to indicate that [...] "the Lamanites ... are among the ancestors of the American Indians." [...] This change, church leaders said, was in harmony with the claims of the Book of Mormon itself, and what some Latter-day Saints had long perceived. For instance, in 1929 Anthony W. Ivins, of the LDS Church's First Presidency, cautioned church members: “We must be careful in the conclusions that we reach. The Book of Mormon teaches the history of three distinct peoples … who came from the old world to this continent. It does not tell us that there was no one here before them. It does not tell us <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not come after. And so if discoveries are made which suggest differences in race origins, it can very easily be accounted for, and reasonably, for we do believe that other people came to this continent. A thousand years had elapsed from the time the Book of Mormon closed until the discovery of America, and we know that other people came to America during that period.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwartz {{said that}} {{inspiration}} for the show came from being a fan of Larry Sanders, Cameron Crowe and other [...] "quirky character-driven shows like Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared, and My So-Called Life". Schwartz went to college at the University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television, and later said that The O.C. was [...] "very much based on sort of the experiences I had when I was in college" [...] as a [...] "Jewish kid from the East Coast ... surrounded by all these kids from Newport Beach who were water-polo players, and these very blonde girls who only wanted to date them. I felt very much like an outsider." [...] Although Orange County residents criticised the show's title, stating <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not call the county by the phrase, Schwartz claims that USC students did {{say that they were}} from [...] "The O.C." [...] He also stated that Cohen family in season one resembles his own family life, adding that [...] "The dynamic between Sandy and Seth is very much based on me and my dad." [...] Schwartz reasoned that, [...] "As much as our audience enjoys living vicariously in this wealthy world, I think the true wish fulfillment comes from wishing that they had a family like the Cohens— where the parents could be that cool and that grounded and that loving, but also real parents." ...|$|E
