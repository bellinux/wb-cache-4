5|$|Due to {{the nature}} of filming for a {{computer}} game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood {{in such a way that}} his arm appeared to be going <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> wall.|$|E
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show the shelves of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

Wright had initially intended that the ledge be cut flush with the floor, but this {{had been one of the}} Kaufmann family's favorite sunning spots, so Mr. Kaufmann suggested that it be left as it was.

25|$|Leonard's primary health {{concern is}} his lactose intolerance: his {{consuming}} melon or any dairy products (and {{according to the}} pilot episode, even corn) results in flatulence. Leonard wears eyeglasses because of astigmatism, and cannot see without them. On one occasion, when his glasses were broken at the movie theater, he had to surreptitiously return to his apartment and retrieve his backup glasses. In order to avoid detection by a sick Sheldon and Penny, who was nursing him, Howard and Raj helped him to navigate <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> by using a helmet camera.

500|$|The {{following}} day Dr. Markway's wife Grace arrives at Hill House to warn {{her husband that}} a reporter has learned of Markway's investigation of Hill House. Markway is concerned when Grace announces that she plans to join the group {{for the duration of}} the investigation. She demands a bed in the nursery despite her husband's warning that it is likely the center of the disturbances. That night the group experiences loud banging and an unseen force attempting to force its way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> in which they are staying. [...] The banging then proceeds to move its way up towards the nursery, where the sounds of it destroying the room are heard. This prompts Eleanor to run towards the source; however, Grace is nowhere to be found. Her disappearance is then confirmed the following [...] morning. Eleanor's mental instability worsens as she falls further under the spell of Hill House. She enters the library and climbs the dilapidated spiral staircase. Once she reaches the top, Grace appears unexpectedly at a trap door and the startled Eleanor nearly falls to her death. Markway rescues Eleanor but just misses seeing Grace, who has disappeared back into the house.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} an {{introduction}} to the special issue. The four articles collected here – which trace the movements of media and persons from the bedrooms of young women in Nigerian Calabar (Gilbert), <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>rooms</b> of Kinshasa’s elderly (Pype), to the taxis of rural Uganda (Vokes), and to the virtual spaces of a live radio show in Uganda (Brisset-Foucault) – offer rich ethnographic case studies of the temporalizing and spatializing work that various kinds of new media (electronic and non electronic) are allowed to do by their users. In these particular locales, mobile phones and radio sets are extensively used to experiment with new, sometimes virtual, identities, to initiate and deepen social relationships, and to open up new realms of the past and present. These same objects also facilitate new dreams for a better future. The particular assemblage of a media object in a space and associated with a new experience of time encourages us to think with the concept of ‘chronotopes’, as a useful tool for understanding how in different spaces and times, according to different generations, genders, religious groups and the like, the radio, the television, the smartphone bring in locally informed understandings of the here and now and the there and then (i. e. of the present, past and future). The introduction explores the analytical opportunities of the notion of the chronotope for our understandings of the experience of electronic modernity. status: accepte...|$|R

50|$|The {{dining room}} {{itself is a}} double-square in plan, and the triple-square of the service block is centred on it; the {{formality}} is entirely appropriate to the activity of dining and entertaining and can be interpreted, as Klaus Herdeg, an architect and author, has argued, as an architectural embodiment of the social traditions of the bourgeois family. Harry Gullichsen, {{as head of the}} household, occupied {{the head of the table}} facing towards the entrance. From there he could see along the axis to the entrance and beyond into <b>the</b> pine forest <b>through</b> <b>the</b> clerestory windows above the vestibule, and also diagonally <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Mrs. Gullichsen would occupy the seat at the opposite end of the table, conveniently close to the servery and kitchen, from where, as Herdeg writes, she ‘can contemplate her husband silhouetted against the dining room’s asymmetrical fireplace, while <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window she can see the sauna, the pool, the garden court, and the pine forest - things natural or traditional. Most of these views the father would only see reflected in an artifice, <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> windows.|$|R

50|$|This {{adaptation}} of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is essentially, and very intentionally, a modern riff {{on the classic}} tale: while trying to read the original Lewis Carroll book for a book report, Alice tries to fend off her little white dog Fluff, who's in a very playful mood, and tosses a ball for him to chase. It bounces toward and magically <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> TV screen—and Fluff, in hot pursuit, disappears right after it.

The {{main focus}} {{of this study is}} examining the activities that are performed in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> both private and public activities can be performed. Living room serves as a stage where dwellers reflect their identity to the outside world. In this study, the factors that affect the use and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> are defined. According to these factors, the group differences in the use and interior design of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> has been examined. A field survey was conducted in “Angora Evleri” which is an upper income suburb in Ankara. Results indicated that the existence of the family room affected the type, number and frequency of activities that were performed in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> existence of the family room also affected the intentions for the interior design and the selected interior design elements in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> selected interior design elements in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> varied according to different groups of users.
