5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television and Gene Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and was <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On {{the advice of a}} cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the first couple of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of Fighting Chance, a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club {{named the}} episode {{one of the}} [...] "10 must-see episodes" [...] of The X-Files, and wrote that it [...] "abruptly makes the series’ alien-conspiracy storyline {{relevant}} again." [...] His review concludes, [...] "t's {{a fine example of}} a show past its glory days, nevertheless finding a way to make itself relevant again." [...] VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and praised—in addition to its refreshing take on the alien mythology—the episode's location, noting that the oil rig's [...] "isolation and man-made island status, was definitely <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> that would look and feel different from just about every other episode of the show." [...] He also applauded the dynamic between Mulder and Doggett, and wrote that the episode successfully was a way for [...] "David Duchovny and Fox Mulder to pass the torch to Robert Patrick and John Doggett." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{happened}} {{mostly in}} Los Angeles, including location shooting at Sunset Strip, Silver Lake, Pacific Palisades, the Hollywood Hills and the Biltmore Hotel. Id Club, the nightclub {{featured in the}} film, was built within Hollywood's Pantages Theater, while the hills above Dodger Stadium near Elysian Park {{were used for the}} car chase and crash where Sil fakes her death. For the opening scenes in Utah, the Tooele Army Depot dubbed as the outside of the research facility—the interiors were shot at the Rockwell International Corporation laboratory in California—and a Victorian-era train station in Brigham City was part of Sil's escape. Other locations included the [...] Santa Monica Pier and the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico. The most complex sets involved the sewer complex and a tar-filled granite cavern where the ending occurs. Donaldson wanted a maze quality for the sewers, which had traces of realism (such as tree roots breaking through from the ceiling) and artistic licenses. Production designer John Muto intentionally designed the sewers wider and taller than real ones, as well as with walkways, but nevertheless aiming for a claustrophobic and realistic atmosphere. The underground tunnels were built out of structural steel, metal rod, plaster and concrete to endure the fire effects, and had its design based on the La Brea Tar Pits, with Muto describing them as [...] "just <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> in which a creature from another planet might feel at home." ...|$|E

That's big {{enough for you to}} find, even in the dark.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those are <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> they do go to. There {{is young}} Mrs. Bright Newdegate,--she {{had to go}} to South Shields, and her babies are all dreadfully delicate. She lost two, you know. I do think the Lord Chancellor ought to think about that. Reigate, or Maidstone, or {{anywhere}} about Great Marlow would not be so bad." [...] And in this way they discussed the coming event and the happy future, while Felix himself was listening to the judge's charge and thinking of his client's guilt.|$|R
5000|$|The Zhu Fan Zhi {{mentions}} {{a number}} of territories in its account of Ma-i, saying: [...] "San-hsu, Pai-p'u-yen, P'u-li-lu, Li-yin-tung, Liu-hsin, Li-han, etc., are all <b>the</b> same <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> as Ma-i" ...|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the hardships}} {{created by the}} nature of the Nullarbor, European {{settlers}} were determined to cross the plain. Although Edward John Eyre described the Plain as [...] "a hideous anomaly, a blot on the face of Nature, <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> one gets into in bad dreams", he became the first European to successfully make the crossing in 1841. Eyre departed Fowler's Bay on 17 November 1840 with John Baxter and a party of three Aboriginal men. When three of his horses died of dehydration, he returned to Fowler's Bay. He departed with a second expedition on 25 February 1841. By 29 April, the party had reached Caiguna. Lack of supplies and water led to a mutiny. Two of the Aborigines killed Baxter and took the party's supplies. Eyre and the third Aborigine, Wylie, continued on their journey, surviving through bushcraft and some fortuitous circumstances, such as receiving some supplies from a French whaling vessel anchored at Rossiter Bay. They completed their crossing in June 1841.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what about}} badgers?" [...] I asked. [...] "In such a rough-looking spot with woods and all, {{it strikes me}} as just <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where one would find that animal." ...|$|E

50|$|Hostile vehicle {{mitigation}} (HVM) is {{a generic}} term that covers {{a suite of}} anti-terrorist protective measures that are often employed around buildings or publicly accessible spaces/venues of particular significance. The design of these various vehicle security barriers and landscape treatments came about as security authorities across the globe sought to mitigate the effects of vehicle borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED). <b>The</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> that warrant consideration as potential terrorist targets in need of HVM include: government buildings, airports, large railway stations, sports venues, concentrations of entertainment and crowded night time economy, etc.|$|R
2500|$|Since 0-6-0 tender engines {{can pull}} fairly heavy trains, albeit slowly, the type was {{commonly}} used to pull short and medium distance freight trains such as pickup goods trains along both main and branch lines. The tank engine versions were widely used as switching (shunting) locomotives since the smaller 0-4-0 types were not {{large enough to be}} versatile in this job. [...] and larger switching locomotives, on the other hand, were too big to be economical or even usable on lightly built railways such as dockyards and goods yards, precisely <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> where switching locomotives were most needed.|$|R

6000|$|Stand at {{the bottom}} of a lift shaft and look upwards. Then you will get both the size and the design of the tiny {{courtyard}} round which one of these big dark houses is built. The central square may be perhaps ten feet every way, but the balconies that run inside it overhang, and seem to cut away half the available space. To reach the square a man must go round many corners, down a covered-in way, and up and down two or three baffling and confused steps. [...] "Now you will understand," [...] say the Police, kindly, as their charge blunders, shin-first into a well-dark winding staircase, [...] "that these are not <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>places</b> to visit alone."

5000|$|In September 2010, Ramsay Street {{came first}} in a poll {{to find out which}} {{television}} property is the best. The open plan houses in the street gained forty per cent of the vote. During a hostage situation in Number 32, Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury noted [...] "Ramsay Street becomes a disaster zone, it's almost as dangerous as Summer Bay these days". A Sunday Mail reporter observed, [...] "Ramsay Street is <b>the</b> friendly <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> where folk move into and out of each other's houses.

Before leaving Quivira, Coronado ordered the Turk strangled. The Coronado expedition had failed in its quest for gold.|$|R

But, at the same time, I could do nothing else, and one does not want to spend one's whole life as a detective.

60|$|My {{very heart}} stood still. The next moment, however, the gendarme had kicked {{open the door}} of No. 25, and I {{followed}} him into the room.

40|$|This article investigates how culinary taste {{contributes}} {{to the formation of}} middle class identity in a working class context in the UK. We explore practices of food consumption among a group of individuals working at a UK university located in a working class city. We find a rather limited and discrepant cosmopolitanism, in which culinary practices are evaluated in terms of those worth engaging in, and those not worth engaging in, based on their ‘user friendliness’ for cosmopolitan middle class dispositions. Depictions of the local food culture as lacking are also dominant, used as a negative ground against which these dispositions are hierarchically formulated. Here middle class culinary tastes seem to be driven by disengagement with <b>the</b> wrong <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>place</b> and a relatively closed alignment with the ‘proper’ and the ‘safe’ rather than by any open creative individuality...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{suggest that}} the concept of {{incitement}} as a way of identifying hate speech sometimes locates the harm caused by speech in <b>the</b> wrong <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> <b>places.</b> Hate speech expressed in the form of “reasoned argument” or academic debate by persons with the relevant authority or expertise potentially causes more harm, though perhaps in less obvious ways. Literature on the concept of authority has demonstrated the way authoritative speakers or speakers with perceived expertise are able to secure uptake for their views. In this paper, I demonstrate how authority and expertise can also be manufactured, enabling speakers to secure uptake in <b>the</b> same <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> ways as legitimately authoritative or expert speakers. While I am not suggesting legal penalties for speakers who manufacture authority in these ways, I am arguing that we should nevertheless be sensitive {{to the ways in which}} this can occur, how it might cause various kinds of harm, and how these harms might be mitigated...|$|R
