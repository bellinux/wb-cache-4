5|$|The {{first of}} the Navy uniforms were made in dark blue, but with the Southern style of rank {{insignia}} for the officers. The 1862 Confederate regulations ordered the uniform to be steel gray and lined with a dark black silk serge. They were also made in medium gray and cadet gray. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> wool, and these uniforms were not fit for {{the heat of the}} lower decks of a ship. Non-commissioned officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, so <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow {{access to the}} {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to duplicate {{the look of the}} real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
5|$|In medieval Europe, {{any effort}} to halt {{pregnancy}} was deemed immoral by the Catholic Church, although {{it is believed that}} women of the time still used a number of birth control measures, such as coitus interruptus and inserting lily root and rue into the vagina. Women in the Middle Ages were also encouraged to tie weasel testicles around their thighs during sex to prevent pregnancy. The oldest condoms discovered to date were recovered in the ruins of Dudley Castle in England, and are dated back to 1640. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> animal gut, and were most likely used {{to prevent the spread of}} sexually transmitted diseases during the English Civil War. Casanova, living in 18th century Italy, described the use of a lambskin covering to prevent pregnancy; however, condoms only became widely available in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The men {{inside them}} paddled fast on the treadmills, and the ships glided {{forwards}} {{as though they}} were flying, yet no one was visible on board. The enemy thought that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> paper. Then all of a sudden a thunderclap bomb was let off. It was made with paper (carton) and filled with lime and sulphur. (Launched from trebuchets) these thunderclap bombs came dropping down from the air, and upon meeting the water exploded with a noise like thunder, the sulphur bursting into flames. The carton case rebounded and broke, scattering the lime to form a smoky fog, which blinded the eyes of men and horses so that they could see nothing. Our ships then went forward to attack theirs, and their men and horses were all drowned, so that they were utterly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only was}} the supply of {{available}} aircraft poor, by the then Director of Organisation at the Air Ministry Charles Portal recognised {{there would be a}} future problem in procurement of aircraft. Coastal Command's operational nature would make twenty-four hour operations a basic requirement. Suitable aircraft for take-off and landing, in particular flying-boats, in all weather was vital for the safety of crews and the effectiveness of the Command. The new twin-engine Saro Lerwick had been touted as the ideal aircraft. It only came into service in April 1939 and was then found to be unsuitable. There was a need for long-range machines to cover the South-Western Approaches. In December 1939 to August 1940 the following reinforcements were sent: No. 10 Squadron RAAF received Sunderlands, No. 235 Squadron RAF, No. 236 Squadron RAF, No. 248 Squadron RAF and No. 254 Squadron RAF equipped with Bristol Blenheims from RAF Fighter Command in February 1940; in June 1940 No. 53 Squadron RAF and No. 59 Squadron RAFs with Blenheim on loan from RAF Bomber Command, and in August 1940, No. 98 Squadron RAF's Fairey Battles, also on loan from the Bomber Service and based in Iceland. By 15 June a further 15 squadrons were to have been handed over to Coastal Command, this was only achieved by the loan of seven squadrons from other commands, despite express agreement by the Air Ministry and Admiralty. The daily operational strength of Coastal Command amounted to 298 aircraft, most unsuitable for maritime operations. Within a month, that had risen to 39 squadrons and 612 aircraft. However <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> 11 different types, causing training and conversion problems.|$|E

25|$|Tools, {{originally}} {{made of wood}} or bone, {{were bound}} to handles with leather straps. During the Bronze Age, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> bronze with wooden handles. Due to its round hole, the tool head would spin on the handle. The Minoans developed oval-shaped holes in their tools to fit oval-shaped handles, which prevented spinning. Tools included double adzes, double- and single-bladed axes, axe-adzes, sickles and chisels.|$|E

25|$|During the 13th century, gloves {{began to}} be worn by ladies as a fashion ornament. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> linen and silk, and {{sometimes}} reached to the elbow. Such worldly accoutrements were not for holy women, according to the early 13thcentury Ancrene Wisse, written for their guidance. Sumptuary laws were promulgated to restrain this vanity: against samite gloves in Bologna, 1294, against perfumed gloves in Rome, 1560.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the 15th century, {{some use}} of glans condoms (devices {{covering}} only {{the head of}} the penis) is recorded in Asia. Glans condoms seem to have been used for birth control, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> tortoise shell or animal horn.|$|E

Modern rackets have maximum dimensions of 686mm (27.0in) long and 215mm (8.5in) wide, with a maximum strung area of 500 square centimetres (77.5sqin). The permitted maximum weight is , but most have a weight between 90 and 150grams (3–5.3oz.).|$|E

In fact the dragons were made of wood painted gold, and simply rotted away with the ravages of time. The walls of the building are composed of brick. The staircase, 253 steps, is in {{the centre of the}} building. During the Second World War holes were cut in each floor to allow for drop-testing of model bombs.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins and}} purpose of this die remain unknown. Both Hunt and the authors of Eagle and the Shield {{speculate}} {{it was meant to}} be used by either the President of the Congress or later by the President of the United States, but there is no other evidence to support this. In October and November 2007, two more dies were discovered in Rhode Island with exactly the same design (though cut in relief), even down to the same small flaws. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> silver-plated lead, which is sometimes used as an engraving test since it is a cheaper metal.|$|E

25|$|These are short, {{rigid points}} {{with a small}} cross-section. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> unhardened iron {{and may have been}} used for better or longer flight, or for cheaper production. It has been mistakenly {{suggested}} that the bodkin came into its own as a means of penetrating armour, but research has found no hardened bodkin points, so it is likely that it was first designed either to extend range or as a cheaper and simpler alternative to the broadhead. In a modern test, a direct hit from a hard steel bodkin point penetrated Damascus chain armour. However, archery was not effective against plate armour, which became available to knights of fairly modest means by the late 14th century.|$|E
25|$|Though it {{is unclear}} when these groups of hunters and gatherers turned to cultivation, pollen samples from Petén and the Pacific coast {{indicate}} maize cultivation as early as 3500BC. By 2500BC, small settlements were developing in Guatemala’s Pacific lowlands in such places as Tilapa, La Blanca, Ocós, El Mesak, and Ujuxte, where the oldest pieces of ceramic pottery from Guatemala have been found. Excavations in the Antigua Guatemala Urías and Rucal, have yielded stratified materials from the Early and Middle Preclassic periods (2000BC to 400BC). Paste analyses of these early pieces of pottery in the Antigua Valley indicate <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> clays from different environmental zones, suggesting people from the Pacific coast expanded into the Antigua Valley.|$|E
25|$|Bonoman long swords {{were used}} {{primarily}} by Ashanti cavalry and commanders, not infantry during the 10th to 15th centuries. In the 16th century {{and at the}} time of Denkyira, Akyem and Akwamu land warfare consisted mostly of spearmen and bowmen on foot, mounted archers using two-handed bows, and mounted swordsmen with two-handed swords (twin blades). Ashanti Swords were not a primary weapon for all Ashanti combat but were mostly for Ashanti shock attacks, defensive strokes and close combat. Blades were heavy as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>made</b> <b>of</b> bronze and later iron, and pommels were often knobbed and used as balances. Short swords may have been used in follow-up attacks, as short sword carriers were armoured completely and accompanied with a shield.|$|E
