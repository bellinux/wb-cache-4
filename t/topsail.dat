5|$|Bonnet {{returned}} to <b>Topsail</b> Island {{to find that}} Blackbeard had beached {{the majority of their}} former crew, robbed the Revenge and two other vessels of the squadron of most of their supplies, and sailed away for parts unknown aboard the sloop Adventure, carrying all the loot with him. Bonnet now (probably late June or early July 1718) resumed command of the Revenge. Few, if any, of his original crew from Barbados were still aboard. Bonnet reinforced the Revenge by rescuing a number of men whom Blackbeard had marooned on a sandbar in <b>Topsail</b> Island.|$|E
5|$|September 6, 1996– Hurricane Fran makes {{landfall}} near Wilmington with winds gusts peaking at 137mph and a 10-foot storm surge. In North <b>Topsail</b> Beach and Carteret County alone, {{the hurricane}} damages or destroys 6,688structures, while further inland, heavy rainfall causes river flooding. Across the state damage amounts to about $2.55billion (1996USD, $3.35billion 2007USD), becoming, at the time, the state's worst natural economic disaster. The hurricane causes {{a total of}} 14deaths in the state, of which eight were indirect.|$|E
5|$|As Cindy moved inland, tornadoes {{touched down}} in North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland along the outer bands of the storm. A tornado was {{observed}} near Nags Head around 17:40UTC on July 10, {{and a second}} was observed 25minutes later. Both tornadoes caused minimal damage– the first damaged four buildings and the second uprooted trees and toppled power poles. In addition, two waterspouts were noted offshore North Carolina, of which one was near New <b>Topsail</b> Beach in the mid-morning of July 8 and another near Sneads Ferry. No damage was reported from the waterspouts.|$|E
5000|$|Gaff <b>topsails,</b> like gaff rigs in general, {{may still}} be seen at Tall Ships gatherings. The gaff rig has been largely {{superseded}} by the Bermuda rig, which has no <b>topsails.</b> On a gaff-rigged sailing boat, <b>topsails</b> may take a few different forms: ...|$|R
50|$|The larger <b>topsails</b> were {{difficult}} and dangerous to handle in strong winds. Sometime in the 1680s, reef-bands {{were introduced to}} tie up part of the sail, with <b>topsails</b> eventually getting four of these, and reefing the sails became a regular occupation of sailors. In the mid 19th century, <b>topsails</b> of merchant vessels were split into separate upper and lower <b>topsails</b> that could be managed separately and far more easily by smaller crews.|$|R
25|$|And soon their <b>topsails</b> {{made them}} lower.|$|R
5|$|By mid-December the ship's {{supply of}} flour and butter for the voyage had been {{exhausted}} and Philip authorised Mason to broach the stores {{set aside for}} the future colony in order to continue to feed the convicts. A month later, on 20 January 1788, Prince of Wales reached Australia's Botany Bay. Six days later she sailed for Sydney Cove as part of the relocation of the convict settlement to Port Jackson. Leaving Botany Bay she collided with Friendship, losing her mainmast staysail and <b>topsail,</b> but the damage was swiftly repaired and she was able to enter Port Jackson in line with her fellow transports. There she landed 49 convicts, 31 marines and 23 civilians.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Senate called the Arctic Resolution, to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by the Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, successfully lobbied for, and received, a grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Congress to command the expedition and began recruiting personnel in late 1870. He secured the U.S. Navy tugboat Periwinkle, a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the Washington Navy Yard the ship was fitted as a fore <b>topsail</b> schooner, and renamed Polaris. She was prepared for Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber all over her hull, and the bow was sheathed in iron. A new engine was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or whale oil.|$|E
5|$|Boyles was {{not long}} able to enjoy his victory undisturbed: at 10:00 on 7 May, shortly after {{the removal of the}} French prisoners had been completed, sails were spotted on the horizon. These were rapidly {{identified}} as three French ships of the line that were making all haste to intercept and capture Swiftsure and Atalante. These ships were part of a squadron under Contre-Admiral Joseph-Marie Nielly that had sailed from Rochefort the day before in search of the American grain convoy shortly due in European waters. Issuing rapid orders, Boyles instructed Atalantes prize crew to separate their ship from Swiftsure in order to force the French to split their forces; the frigate and the ship of the line fleeing on different courses. Atalante soon outran pursuit and escaped into the Atlantic, the prize crew even managing to replace the damaged main <b>topsail</b> {{in the midst of the}} chase with the assistance of the French prisoners on board. Swiftsure was slower but Boyles was still able to increase the distance between his vessel and the French during the day, finally losing sight of his pursuers at 22:00.|$|E

60|$|But even as {{he spoke}} a strong gust filled the yacht's <b>topsails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although <b>topsails</b> {{of a kind}} {{were used}} at least as early as Roman times, they first came into use in Europe {{some time in the}} 15th century. Initially small and carried only on main and fore masts, they {{gradually}} increased in size and importance until {{by the middle of the}} 17th century and were the principal and largest sails of the ship, the first sails to be set and the last to be taken in. It was quite common for a ship to sail with <b>topsails</b> and jibs alone; the position of the <b>topsails</b> well above the sea ensured that they received a steady breeze even if the seas were rough.|$|R
5|$|Further inland, several weather {{stations}} reported hurricane-force winds. The Weather Bureau office in Wilmington, North Carolina, reported maximum sustained winds of 88mph (142km/h) and a peak gust of 135mph (220km/h), exceeding {{the previous record}} for fastest measured wind speed of 98mph (158km/h) set during Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Beach resorts there were heavily damaged. In Wrightsville Beach, located 10mi (15km) of Wilmington, 12houses were flattened by the hurricane. Damage to homes there were estimated by police to cost $300,000, and extensive damage to the water system was reported. In Long Beach, damage was less severe, with only minor property damage. Waves pushing past sand dunes caused cracks in seaside roads. Though surveys made no damage estimates, damage in Holden Beach {{was reported to have}} been worse than in Long Beach. A 300ft (90m) pier and a pavilion in Ocean Isle Beach were destroyed. In <b>Topsail</b> Beach and Kure Beach, several homes and businesses were either unroofed or destroyed. Yaupon Beach and Shallotte also had similar reports of unroofed homes. Two homes on <b>Topsail</b> Island were demolished, and extensive property damage was reported in Atlantic Beach. At Cape Fear, winds were estimated at 125mph (200km/h), with gusts as high as 160mph (260km/h), well into Category3 intensity. The powerful winds forced power to be cut off in Wilmington as a precautionary measure. As a result, 7,000telephones were knocked out of service. Damage to the Southern Bell Telephone Company's offices cost $150,000. Total damages in the city was estimated to cost nearly $2million. In Morehead City, a roof was blown from a yacht shed and multiple structures. Long-distance telephone services were also cut off. Off the coast on Ocracoke Island, power and communications failed during the storm after the island was battered by winds of 60mph (100km/h). Power outages were commonplace in other areas as well. In Southport, metal debris was scattered across city streets, and the damage there was described as worse than Hurricane Hazel. Half of its pier was swept away by the rough seas, and other buildings collapsed or sustained heavy damage. Numerous trees, including live oak, were uprooted by the winds. The United States Army provided the port with a temporary electrical generator, which provided power for water pumps and light. In Cape Hatteras, Helene caused an estimated $1million in damages. Although damage to infrastructure tapered off 10mi (15km) from the coast, crop damage was observed 40mi (65km) inland. Corn was the crop most affected by Helene.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1902, Geier began a long cruise {{south to}} the Dutch East Indies, which also {{included}} a stop in Singapore. The ship entered the dry dock in Nagasaki, Japan, for a major overhaul on 2 March 1903, which lasted until 26 April. At this time, Geier was formally assigned to the East Asia Squadron. The ship resumed its normal routine of cruises in East Asian waters with stops in various ports. In February 1904, the Russo-Japanese War broke out; from April to August, Geier was in Chemulpo, which had been captured by the Japanese. By 1905, the ship was suffering wear, having spent over seven years on foreign stations. The repair facilities in Tsingtao were insufficient {{for the amount of}} work that needed to be done, and so Geier was ordered to return to Germany. She left Tsingtao on 14 January and arrived in Kiel on 16 March, where she was decommissioned for a significant period of repair work. Her three-masted schooner barque rig was reduced to a two-masted <b>topsail</b> schooner rig.|$|E
5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main <b>topsail,</b> she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The damage incurred during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E

50|$|The {{foundation}} {{kept her}} as a live museum in Alexandria and sailed {{her as a}} goodwill ambassador {{for the city of}} Alexandria. She participated in several races and tall ship reunions sailing as far north as Boston and as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. During this time she was rigged with bowsprit, jib-boom, foremast, mainmast and mizzenmast, all three masts fitted with topmasts and gaffs for the gaff sails and the fore topmast fitted with three yards for the <b>topsails.</b> The sails were four headsails, three gaff sails and three gaff <b>topsails</b> (one on each mast), upper and lower square <b>topsails</b> on the foremast, a staysail between the fore and main masts and another staysail between the main and mizzen masts.|$|R

25|$|The mountain's name {{translates}} as Rock of the <b>Topsail,</b> {{and was given}} to it during the expedition of Captain Gaspar de Lemos, begun in 1501, and in which the Rio de Janeiro bay (today Guanabara Bay, but after which the city was named) also received its name. The mountain, {{one of the first}} in Brazil to be named in Portuguese, was named by the expedition's sailors, who compared its silhouette to that of the shape of a <b>topsail</b> of a carrack upon sighting it on January 1, 1502. That name in turn came to be given to the Gávea area of the city of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
25|$|Kankakee {{was either}} brig or <b>topsail</b> schooner-rigged for {{auxiliary}} sail power. Her armament {{consisted of a}} single 30-pounder Parrott rifle, and five 24-pounder Dahlgren guns, including two pivot guns. She had a crew complement of 41 officers and enlisted men.|$|E

25|$|A {{schooner}} has a mainmast {{taller than}} its foremast, distinguishing {{it from a}} ketch or a yawl. A schooner can have more than two masts, with the foremast always lower than the foremost main. Traditional <b>topsail</b> schooners have topmasts allowing triangular topsails sails to be flown above their gaff sails; many modern schooners are Bermuda rigged.|$|E
