500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, which were {{conducted}} by former Formula One driver Martin Brundle, Nico Rosberg expressed delight about his victory, but also remembered the events of Paris which, as he put it, rendered [...] "everything relative". Replying to Brundle's notion that driving <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{earlier in the season}} would have given him a chance for the championship, Rosberg replied: [...] "Thank you very much for that piece of advice, I could figure that out for myself!" [...] Lewis Hamilton on the other hand lamented {{the fact that he was}} unable to follow Rosberg closely on track without damaging his tyres too much, saying that he would have otherwise had the pace to pass him. Third placed Sebastian Vettel called it [...] "a good race", but also [...] "not very exciting", since the Ferrari drivers had been [...] "in no-mans land" [...] behind the Mercedes.|$|E

500|$|In August 2008, The Hindu {{reported}} that Manobala would be directing {{a remake of}} Kadhalikka Neramillai with R. Madhavan in the lead role. Plans for a contemporary remake drew criticism. In an interview with Rekhs, a celebrity columnist for Behindwoods, Gopu said, [...] "This film {{even if it is}} remade today, will not hold a candle to its original". Crazy Mohan said, [...] "Kadhalikka Naeramillai is Tamil Cinema’s Mount Everest of comedy. There’s no other Tenzing [...] in sight so far. I was aghast that some people even considered re-making Kadhalikka Naeramillai. None should attempt it. It is blasphemy". Sharadha Narayanan of The New Indian Express stated in February 2009, [...] "Recently when the news of Kadhalikka Neramillai remake was announced, every lip had one question that went unanswered: Who can actually do Nagesh’s role at least <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> if not better?" [...] An anonymous source close to the production team of Kavalai Vendam (2016) described it as a [...] "modern day version" [...] of Kadhalikka Neramillai to The Times of India.|$|E
500|$|During {{their writing}} sessions, Malay noticed Ocean's use of gender pronouns in his lyrics, but {{attributed}} it to Ocean's poetic license {{rather than his}} sexuality. In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E
500|$|Small Heath {{came back}} from a 2–1 half-time deficit to beat Grimsby Town 5–2, but the visit of Liverpool was eventful in a rather {{different}} manner. After the referee rejected the Liverpool players' claim that Small Heath's equaliser had entered the goal {{through a hole in the}} side netting, their play became rough, culminating in centre-half Joe McQue, a [...] "strapping fellow", kicking Frank Mobley in the abdomen, apparently intentionally. While the referee was cautioning McQue, Small Heath captain Caesar Jenkyns rushed in, knocked McQue to the ground, and was sent off. With a man advantage, it still took Liverpool until the stroke of time to score the winning goal. The Posts reporter suggested that, despite the provocation, Jenkyns should not have reacted <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> but [...] "the knowledge that it cost his side the game" [...] was sufficient punishment. Despite the referee in his report agreeing that [...] "the punishment of being sent off would meet case", and that Jenkyns had [...] "played a perfectly fair game" [...] and had expressed regret at his actions, both when dismissed and after the game, the Football Association imposed a four-week suspension, to begin on 31 October.|$|E

"Baby" [...] {{was written}} by Bieber with Christopher [...] "Tricky" [...] Stewart and Terius [...] "The-Dream" [...] Nash, both of whom worked with Bieber on [...] "One Time", R singer and The-Dream's then wife Christina Milian and labelmate, Ludacris. When asked how the {{collaboration}} initially came about, Bieber said, [...] " [...] both live in Atlanta. I met him a year prior to this and we figured {{it was a perfect}} collaboration for him, so we invited him out to do it." [...] Bieber first premiered the song performing on MuchMusic on December 28, 2009. A few days before the release of the single, Bieber posted an acoustic version of the song to his YouTube with his guitarist Dan Kanterr, similar to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> with [...] "Favorite Girl". Billboard said that: [...] "Bieber delivers his characteristically clean vocals with conviction: [...] "My first love broke my heart for the first time / and I'm like, 'baby, baby, baby, no!' I thought you'd always be mine." [...] Also in a review of the acoustic version Bill Lamb of About.com said that [...] "I think the vocals here will convince some that Justin Bieber really does have the vocal chops." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1963–64 U.S. Championship, Fischer {{achieved}} {{his second}} perfect score, this time against the top-ranked chess {{players in the}} country: [...] "This tournament became, as they say, the stuff of legend. The fact that Fischer won his sixth U.S. title was no surprise. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it was spectacular." [...] "One by one Fischer mowed down the opposition as he cut an 11–0 swathe through the field, to demonstrate convincingly to the opposition that he was now {{in a class by}} himself." [...] This result brought Fischer heightened fame, including a profile in Life magazine. Sports Illustrated diagrammed each of the 11 games in its article, [...] "The Amazing Victory Streak of Bobby Fischer". Such extensive chess coverage was groundbreaking for the top American sports' magazine. His 11–0 win in the 1963–64 Championship is the only perfect score {{in the history of the}} tournament, and one of about ten perfect scores in high-level chess tournaments ever. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld called it [...] "the most remarkable achievement of this kind". Fischer recalls: [...] "Motivated by my lopsided result (11–0!), Dr. [...] Kmoch congratulated [...] Evans (the runner up) on 'winning' the tournament...and then he congratulated me on 'winning the exhibition'." ...|$|E
500|$|Booth {{started the}} 196364 season strongly. He scored centuries {{in his first}} two innings, {{recording}} 121 and 169 not out against Queensland and Western Australia respectively. In his rapid innings against Western Australia at the SCG, which took only 165 minutes, Booth reached 100 in 94 minutes during the second session of the day. In the lead-up to the Tests, Booth scored 63 for his state against South Africa but was unable to prevent defeat. In the Tests, he began <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> in the previous season, with a century. Coming to the crease with Australia at 3/88 in the first innings of the First Test in Brisbane, Booth withstood an opening burst of bouncers from South African spearhead Peter Pollock. He went on to accumulate his Test best of 169 from 81 overs of batting, in a display that gained wide praise because of his elegant strokemaking. One newspaper proclaimed that his innings had [...] "more Grace than the Princess of Monaco." [...] Ray Robinson said [...] "it was a tailored innings, fit to be put on display in a showcase and unrumpled by a single chance". South African skipper Trevor Goddard later said [...] "We didn't mind the leather chasing, when he played so charmingly". Booth's innings was the highlight of a match that was uneventful in terms of cricket but notorious for the no-balling of Ian Meckiff. A broken finger sidelined Booth for a month and prevented him from playing in the Second Test, but he returned for the Third Test in Sydney, and began a sequence of 75, 16, 58 and 24. He finished the series in the Fifth Test in his home town, top-scoring in both of Australia's innings, with 102 not out and 87 in a draw. It capped off a productive fortnight for Booth; he had scored 162 not out against South Australia before the final Test. In four Tests, he aggregated 531 runs at 88.50. For the entire first-class season, Booth had struck five centuries and totalled 1,180 runs. According to Gideon Haigh, he had [...] "played exquisitely" [...] throughout the season, which was his career peak and saw him named the Australian Cricketer of the Year for 196364.|$|E

Silex Scintillans borrows the same themes, experience, and beliefs as The Temple. Herbert's influence is evident both in the shape and spirituality of Vaughan's poetry.

2500|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the Symposium is, like all of Plato’s dialogues, fiction.

[...] The reader, understanding that Plato was not governed by the historical record, can read the Symposium, and ask why the author, Plato, arranged the story <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and what he meant by including the various aspects of setting, composition, characters, and theme, etc.|$|E

Howe was widely considered the most complete player in all of hockey history. Once Howe began dominating the league, NHL scouts were given new directives to discover players that played <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Howe's strength, scoring ability, and speed exemplified the perfect example of the modern-day role of a power forward and someone who can play the 200-foot game.|$|E
