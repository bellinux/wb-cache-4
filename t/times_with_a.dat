5|$|Fears in Solitude {{was written}} after {{rumors of a}} French {{invasion}} spread across England. Although Coleridge was opposed to Prime Minister William Pitt's control over the British government, he sided with his homeland. He began work on the poem during April 1798 and it {{was first published in}} a small pamphlet along with Frost at Midnight and France: An Ode. It was eventually printed seven <b>times</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> later printing removing any anti-Pitt sentiment.|$|E

5|$|Three {{players have}} led their league in wins six times during their careers. Grover Cleveland Alexander led the National League in {{victories}} six <b>times,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> single-season career-high 33 wins in 1916. In the American League, two pitchers have accomplished the same feat: Walter Johnson, whose 36 wins in 1913—his first season leading the league—were a single-season career high, and Bob Feller.|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} factors that increase or decrease patient <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> physician, determine which combinations of factors {{are associated with the}} shortest and longest visits to physicians, quantify how much phy-sicians contribute to variation in the <b>time</b> they spend <b>with</b> patients, and assess how well patient <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> physician can be predicted. Data were acquired from a modified replication of the 1997 – 1998 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, administered by the Kentucky Ambulatory Network to 56 primary care clini-cians at 24 practice sites in 2001 and 2002. A regression tree and a linear mixed model (LMM) were used to dis-cover multivariate associations between patient <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> physician and 22 potentially predictive factors. Patient <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> physician was related to the number of diagnoses, whether non-illness care was received, and whether the patient had been seen before by the physi-cian or someone at the practice. Approximately 38 % of the variation in patient <b>time</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> physician was accounted for by predictive factors in the tree; roughly 33 % was explained by predictive factors in the LMM, with another 12 % linked to physicians. Knowledge of patient characteristics and needs could be used to sched-ule office visits, potentially improving patient flow through a clinic and reducing waiting times.

5|$|Two {{main reasons}} {{contributed to the}} cancellation. The XF-85's {{deficiencies}} revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters, and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical shortcoming that was never fully corrected. The development of practical aerial refueling for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also {{a factor in the}} cancellation. The two Goblins flew seven <b>times,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a successful hookup. Schoch was the only pilot who ever flew the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Chavundaraya II, a Shaiva Brahmin (Brahmin {{devotee of}} the god Shiva) by faith and a protege of King Jayasimha II, wrote Lokopakara (c.1025) in the champu metre. It is the {{earliest}} available encyclopaedia in the Kannada language, written at <b>times</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> poetic touch. It comprises twelve chapters and has found popularity in later references as well. The work is on various topics such as daily life, astronomy, astrology and forecasting of events based on the Indian calendar (panchanga phala), sculpture, construction of buildings (vastu vichara) and reservoirs (udakargala), omens, divination of water, preparation of medicine from herbs and plants (vrikshayurveda), general medicine (vaidya), perfumery, cookery and toxicology (vishavaidya). Mentioned in this book is the popular South Indian dish Idli and its preparation by soaking Urad dal (black gram) in butter milk, grinding it to a fine paste, and mixing with spices and the clear water of curd.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his 17-year major league career, Lefty Grove led the American League in ERA nine <b>times,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> career single-season low of 2.06 for the 1931 Philadelphia Athletics. Roger Clemens has won the second-most ERA titles, {{capturing}} six in the American League and one in the National League. Sandy Koufax led the National League in ERA for five consecutive seasons (1962–1966); Koufax' five awards are the most won consecutively by any player and are tied for the most awards by a player in the National League with Christy Mathewson and Clayton Kershaw. In the American League, Walter Johnson also won five ERA titles, and Pedro Martínez has won a total of five (four American League and one National League) with two different teams.|$|E

5|$|The River Itchen {{had been}} commercially {{important}} since before Norman <b>times,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> staithe for unloading boats recorded at Bishopstoke in 960, and stone for Winchester Cathedral, built when Winchester was {{the capital city}} of England, was probably transported by water from the quarries of Caen in France. The first recorded improvements to the river were made by Godfrey de Lucy, who was Bishop of Winchester between 1189 and 1204. He funded the works himself, and as a consequence, was granted the right to levy tolls on goods transported on the river by King John. There was considerable trade in wool and leather, but the centres for this moved to Calais and Melcombe Regis in 1353, and as the trade declined, so did the navigable parts of the river. It was noted to be in poor condition in 1452, and a report for the Commissioners of Sewers in 1617 suggested that much of it was obstructed by mills which had been built on the banks.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Vince McMahon (accompanied by Shane McMahon and Umaga) against Bobby Lashley in a Street Fight for the ECW World Championship. Shane and Umaga {{interfered}} in the match, helping Vince gain the advantage. Shane performed a flying elbow drop, sending Lashley through the announce table at ringside. Back inside the ring, as Umaga {{was holding a}} trash can in front of Lashley's face in the corner, Shane attempted to execute the Coast-to-Coast dropkick; however, Lashley moved away way, and Shane dropkicked the trash can into Umaga's face. Team McMahon kept the upper hand, as Umaga performed a Samoan Drop onto Lashley, which {{was followed by a}} spear from Vince. Lashley, however, gained the upper hand by hitting Vince several <b>times</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> steel chair. Lashley performed a spear on Shane and followed with a spear to Vince before pinning Vince to gain the victory and become the new ECW World Champion.|$|E
5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several <b>times,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E

Harry Redknapp has had six spells {{managing}} Premier League football clubs (West Ham United, Portsmouth, Southampton, Portsmouth again, Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers) winning a Manager of the Month award {{in each of}} those spells. Eight other managers have won an award with two or more clubs: Martin O'Neill with Leicester City, Aston Villa and Sunderland, Brendan Rodgers with Swansea City and Liverpool, Stuart Pearce with Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, Gordon Strachan with Coventry City and Southampton, Sam Allardyce with Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United, Mauricio Pochettino with Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur, Rafael Benítez with Liverpool and Chelsea and Claudio Ranieri with Leicester City and Chelsea. Eleven managers have won awards in consecutive months: Joe Kinnear, Kevin Keegan, Roy Evans, Ferguson, Arsène Wenger, David O'Leary, Paul Jewell, Rafael Benítez, Carlo Ancelotti, Manuel Pellegrini and Antonio Conte. Stuart Pearce also won consecutive awards; one {{at the end of the}} 2004–05 season, and the other at the start of the 2005–06 season. Antonio Conte is the only manager in Premier League history to have won the award in three successive months (with Chelsea from October to December 2016). The award has been shared on one occasion, in March 2002, when Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier was jointly awarded Manager of the Month with caretaker manager Phil Thompson, who had deputised while Houllier was absent for medical reasons.|$|E
