5|$|Harry Potter and <b>the</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Azkaban is {{the third}} book in the Harry Potter series. The first, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone in the US), was {{published}} by Bloomsbury on 26 June 1997 and the second, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, was published on 2 July 1998. Rowling started to write <b>the</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Azkaban the day after she finished The Chamber of Secrets.|$|E
5|$|His The Round of the Prisoners (1890) {{was painted}} after an {{engraving}} by Gustave Doré (1832–1883). Tralbaut {{suggests that the}} face of <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> in {{the centre of the}} painting looking towards the viewer is Van Gogh himself; Jan Hulsker discounts this.|$|E
5|$|Ian Hart as Quirinus Quirrell, the {{slightly}} nervous Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, and also Lord Voldemort's voice. David Thewlis auditioned for the part; {{he would later}} be cast as Remus Lupin in Harry Potter and <b>the</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Azkaban.|$|E
50|$|Corrections Commissary Service: This {{group is}} {{contracted}} to operate <b>the</b> <b>prisoner's</b> commissary. They {{are responsible for}} handling {{all aspects of the}} commissary services for <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> <b>The</b> program functions in a cost-effective manner, providing <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> with essential health and comfort items.|$|R
50|$|Kim {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> have no {{human rights and}} are treated at the guards’ mercy. To humiliate <b>the</b> <b>prisoners,</b> <b>the</b> guards would force them to get on their knees, and then spit into <b>the</b> <b>prisoner's</b> mouths and make them swallow <b>the</b> spit. If <b>prisoners</b> do not immediately obey, they are savagely beaten. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> are monitored almost continuously by security agents and are urged to spy on {{each other and to}} denounce other prisoners.|$|R
50|$|At breakfast {{the second}} day, the guards attempt to relieve their guilt, by {{offering}} {{one of the}} most valuable resources to <b>the</b> <b>prisoners,</b> food. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> are unhappy that the guards are only doing this out of guilt, so they decline despite eating little the day before. In denying the food the guards have offered, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> have denied their power. Later there was an announcement {{that there would be no}} further promotions, leaving <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> angry and resentful.|$|R
5|$|Juskalian died on July 4, 2010; funeral processions {{were held}} at the St. Mary's Armenian Apostolic Church in Washington D.C. He is buried in <b>the</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of War Section of the Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Next {{at the bar}} was William Beamiss {{indicted for}} highway robbery of Hugh Robert Evans, of Ely. Two witness were called. Mr Justice Abbott summed up and the jury {{returned}} a verdict of guilty on <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> Beamiss.|$|E
5|$|The duty officer, Captain Thomas Selvester, began {{a routine}} interrogation. Himmler {{admitted}} who he was, and Selvester had <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> searched. Himmler {{was taken to}} the headquarters of the Second British Army in Lüneburg, where Doctor Wells conducted a medical exam on him. The doctor attempted to examine the inside of Himmler's mouth, but <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> was reluctant to open it and jerked his head away. Himmler then bit into a hidden cyanide pill and collapsed onto the floor. He was dead within 15 minutes. Shortly afterward, Himmler's body was buried in an unmarked grave near Lüneburg. The grave's location remains unknown.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{the time}} is come that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> must {{go down to the}} camp, and appear before the Prince. And thus was the manner of their going down. Captain Boanerges went with a guard before them, and Captain Conviction came behind, and <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> went down bound in chains in the midst; so, I say, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> went in <b>the</b> midst, and the guard went with flying colours behind and before, but <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> went with {{drooping}} spirits.|$|R
50|$|The {{study shows}} that before <b>the</b> {{volunteer}} <b>prisoners</b> started showing signs of distress, they {{did not take the}} guards and their authority seriously. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> mocked <b>the</b> guards, trying to regain their individuality. This, however, was short-lived. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> soon realized that the attitude of the guards was very serious and that they demanded obedience. This began a long string of confrontational quarrels between <b>the</b> guards and <b>prisoners.</b> <b>The</b> guards used physical punishment and exercises, such as pushups, in order to show their authority to <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b>|$|R
50|$|In late April 1945 a {{group of}} 140 high-status prisoners were {{transferred}} to Tyrol, guarded by SS troops. A delegation from <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> contacted senior German army officers, made known the identity of <b>the</b> high-status <b>prisoners,</b> and conveyed <b>the</b> apprehension that those prisoners were to be executed. A regular German army unit {{under the command of}} Captain von Alvensleben moved in to protect <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Outnumbered, <b>the</b> SS guards moved out, leaving <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> behind. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> were then set free, with the majority taking sanctuary for a time in Pragser Wildsee until the arrival of U.S. troops.|$|R
5|$|The film {{adaptation}} of the novel was released in 2004, grossing more than $796 million and earned notable critical acclaim. Video games loosely based on Harry Potter and <b>the</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Azkaban were also released for several platforms, and most obtained favourable reviews.|$|E
5|$|An {{illustrated}} {{version of}} Harry Potter and <b>the</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Azkaban was released on October 3, 2017, and was illustrated by Jim Kay who illustrates {{the previous two}} instalments. This includes over 115 new illustrations and {{will be followed by}} Illustrated editions of the following 4 novels in the future.|$|E
5|$|As Olivia {{enters the}} park, she is {{passed by a}} man riding a penny-farthing bicycle. As these have not been shown elsewhere, {{it does not seem}} likely that they are a common means of {{transportation}} in the alternate universe, but rather that this is a reference to <b>The</b> <b>Prisoner,</b> in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held prisoner.|$|E
50|$|Virot {{was moved}} to camp Buchenwald. As the Allied forces were encroaching, one {{afternoon}} Virot and <b>the</b> other <b>prisoners</b> were called to an afternoon roll call. Virot knew this was suspicious, and immediately realized that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were to be shot. Suddenly, the Nazi officers ran: the Americans, who had arrived to liberate the city, threatened to kill the officers if they shot <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> were spared.|$|R
25|$|Helaman and Antipus win a {{great victory}} over the Lamanite army, taking many prisoners of war. They send <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> under guard to Zarahemla. The Lamanite armies attack the Nephites {{guarding}} <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> and free <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Helaman, Gid and Teancum defeat the Lamanites, defending the city of Cumeni and retaking the city of Manti.|$|R
5000|$|Compton {{accompanied}} the firing squad of about 11 {{men to the}} ridge overlooking the draw. He told the G.I.s to line up and they positioned themselves about six feet away from <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> started pleading for them not to shoot. Gazzetti, the interpreter, asked Compton if he had {{anything to say to}} <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Compton did not have anything he wanted to ask them. Compton told the men to commence firing on his order and that he [...] "didn’t want a man left standing when the firing was done." [...] Seeing that their fate was sealed, a few of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> began to run. The firing squad opened fire and killed all of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b>|$|R
5|$|Calleia {{was cast}} as the Spanish {{ambassador}} in the Broadway production of Princess Flavia (1925), Sigmund Romberg's musical adaptation of <b>The</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Zenda. While {{he was waiting for}} the elaborate production to be mounted he sold pianos, with such success that the store owner offered him a store of his own if he would stay.|$|E
5|$|David Mirkin {{conceived}} the initial {{idea for the}} episode, Steve O'Donnell was the lead writer, and Steven Dean Moore directed. The writers drew on many groups to develop the Movementarians, but were principally influenced by Scientology, Heaven's Gate, the Unification Church ("Moonies"), the Rajneesh movement, and Peoples Temple. The show contains many references to popular culture, including the title reference to The Joy of Sex and a gag involving Rover from the television program <b>The</b> <b>Prisoner.</b>|$|E
5|$|Farrow was posthumously given {{multiple}} awards. These {{included the}} Order of the Sacred Tripod (寶鼎勳章) of the Republic of China, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Purple Heart. He was also awarded <b>the</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of War Medal, which, by authorization of Congress in 1985, {{was given to}} {{all members of the}} United States Armed Forces who had been a prisoner of war after 5 April 1917.|$|E
50|$|The {{commander}} of the Gestapo in Hamburg later revealed that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were to be killed, possibly by scuttling the ships with <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> still aboard.|$|R
50|$|The {{guards were}} a wide {{collection}} of JNA reservists, military police, paramilitaries and local Serb civilians who sometimes {{came to the}} camp simply to abuse and beat up <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Five prison guards (aged 18-20) were JNA privates in KPD for military training. They regularly tortured the inmates and killed at least 18 prisoners. Four Serbs from Vukovar knew some of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> and inflicted <b>the</b> worst beatings and torture and were brought into interrogations of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> Two of them were called executioners by <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the film}} Captain Gilbert is graciously {{given the right}} to talk to <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> by Col. Andrus in {{exchange}} for a library and an exercise field. In reality Gilbert was specifically appointed to talk to <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> by <b>the</b> US military. The idea was that Andrus was informed by Gilbert about the state of mind of <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b>|$|R
5|$|Harry Potter and <b>the</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Azkaban is {{a fantasy}} novel written by British author J. K. Rowling {{and the third}} novel in the Harry Potter series. The book follows Harry Potter, a young wizard, in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Along with friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry investigates Sirius Black, an escaped {{prisoner}} from Azkaban who they believe is one of Lord Voldemort's old allies.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and <b>the</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Azkaban was {{released}} in hardcover in the UK on 8 July 1999 and in the US on 8 September. The British paperback edition {{was released}} on 1 April 2000, while the US paperback was released 2 October 2001.|$|E
5|$|In the aftermath, Strachwitz led his {{men in a}} {{successful}} breakout from their encirclement in Czechoslovakia to the U.S.-held region of Bavaria, where they surrendered to U.S. Army forces near Felgen. Strachwitz was taken to <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> of war camp at Allendorf near Marburg, where he was interned together with Franz Halder, Guderian and Adolf Galland.|$|E
50|$|Local {{newspapers}} {{had urged}} that local citizens donate items to assist <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> at <b>the</b> fort. Mayor Wightman endorsed giving aid to <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> at <b>the</b> fort.|$|R
50|$|The {{order to}} {{transfer}} <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> from <b>the</b> camps {{to the prison}} ships came from the Hamburg Gauleiter Karl Kaufmann who was himself acting on orders from Berlin. Kaufmann later claimed during a war crimes tribunal that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were destined for Sweden. However, at the same trial, {{the head of the}} Hamburg Gestapo, Georg-Henning Graf von Bassewitz-Behr, said that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were in fact slated to be killed in compliance with Himmler's orders, and {{it has been suggested that}} the plan called for scuttling the ships with <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> still aboard.|$|R
5|$|Using improvised weapons, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> capture {{an armored}} vehicle and the prison helicopter, which Yates uses to kill Zamorro. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> place {{a call to}} Wheeler's {{headquarters}} and inform him of the riot. Winter has little time to regain control before Wheeler will arrive to see the prison under siege, so orders the use of live ammunition against <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b>|$|R
5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{inspired}} by films such as <b>The</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Zenda, If I Were King and Viva Zapata!. Ramachandran, in an account about the film he wrote in 1959, mentioned three specific differences from <b>The</b> <b>Prisoner</b> of Zenda. In the original, the look-alike and the queen have an intimate relationship while in Nadodi Mannan, Veerangan rejects Manohari's advances. When she realises that Veerangan is not Marthandan, she addresses him as her brother instead. Secondly, the look-alike {{was related to the}} king and shared the same interests. Veerangan is not related to Marthandan and initially has contrasting qualities until they meet. Thirdly, the character of Vijayavarman, and the sequences in Kanni Theevu, do not feature in the original, while these were incorporated as part of Nadodi Mannans main plot.|$|E
5|$|Pratap chose six Hindu Afridi and Pathan {{volunteers from}} <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> of war camp at Zossen. Before the mission left Berlin, two more Germans joined the group: Major Dr. Karl Becker, who was {{familiar}} with tropical diseases and spoke Persian, and Walter Röhr, a young merchant fluent in Turkish and Persian.|$|E
5|$|The Vizier Ibrahim's {{life was}} saved {{by one of}} Zrinski's {{household}} who warned him of the trap when the Vizier and his troops searched for treasure and interrogated the survivors. While inquiring about treasure <b>the</b> <b>prisoner</b> replied {{that it had been}} long expended, but that 3,000lbs of powder were under their feet to which a slow match had been attached. The Vizier and his mounted officers had just enough time to escape but 3,000 Turks perished in the explosion.|$|E
25|$|In {{the morning}} of 27 April 1940, the camp was {{evacuated}} due to German forces advancing in the area, and <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> were marched westwards across the mountains to Sogn. By <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> and guards reached Sogn after an exhausting march, the resistance in South Norway was collapsing. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> were soon abandoned and left to themselves by the Norwegian guards.|$|R
50|$|Using improvised weapons, <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> capture {{an armored}} vehicle and the prison helicopter, which Yates uses to kill Zamorro. <b>The</b> <b>prisoners</b> place {{a call to}} Wheeler's {{headquarters}} and inform him of the riot. Winter has little time to regain control before Wheeler will arrive to see the prison under siege, so orders the use of live ammunition against <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Rockefeller, {{who refused}} to visit <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> during <b>the</b> rebellion, stated that <b>the</b> <b>prisoners</b> [...] "carried out the cold-blood killings they had {{threatened}} from the outset," [...] despite {{only one of the}} deaths being attributed to <b>the</b> <b>prisoners.</b> New York Times writer Fred Ferretti said the rebellion concluded in [...] "mass deaths that four days of taut negotiations had sought to avert".|$|R
