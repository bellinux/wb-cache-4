5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from the Kentucky General Assembly. He was summoned to appear before <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by the Kentucky Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals {{and replace it with}} a more sympathetic court.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, {{the makeup}} of <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> was altered again by Congress to a {{bicameral}} body. A House of Representatives was created and the representation was apportioned by population. The House was then to choose ten candidates from whom the President, through the governor, would choose five to form a council which served as the upper house of <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> Thereafter, the structure of <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> remained unchanged {{for the remainder of}} the territory's existence.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1835, Texians had {{expelled}} all Mexican {{troops from}} Texas. Believing the war ended, many Texians resigned from the army and returned home. In January, the provisional government essentially collapsed; {{despite a lack of}} authority for any branch of government to interfere with other branches, <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> impeached Governor Henry Smith, who in turn disbanded <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> No one in Texas was entirely sure who was in charge.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{accepted}} {{an appointment to}} the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817. It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred. In 1822, he struck down a debt relief law {{in the case of}} Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts. His decision was unpopular with <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it. An attempt by <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> to remove him from office fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. The following year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark's ruling. In retaliation, <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views. This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court-New Court controversy.|$|E

He also encouraged <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> to enact antitrust laws. These were passed March 30, 1889, a full year before the federal government enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act. His reform acts were beneficial for the state, leading Ross to become the only Texas governor to call a special session of <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> {{to deal with a}} treasury surplus.|$|E
5|$|During its 2002 annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganize <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all {{the seats in the}} MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E

5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, Stanley began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of Stanley, Byrd, and the others. Stanley called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged Stanley to call a special session of <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> The following day, Governor Stanley announced he would call <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> into special session in late August.|$|E

5|$|In 1846, Dow spoke before <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> {{in favor}} of statewide prohibition. The bill passed, but lacked the {{enforcement}} mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, {{he ran for the}} state legislature in a special election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. <b>The</b> <b>legislature</b> fell one vote short of overriding the veto.|$|E
5|$|In 1847 <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> met from December 7 to 28 at the Methodist Church in Oregon City. On {{the second}} day of this meeting at Main and Seventh streets, news of the Whitman massacre, which {{occurred}} on November 29, 1847, was delivered to <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> by Governor Abernethy. This event would dominate the remainder of the session as the Provisional Government worked with the Hudson's Bay Company to send an army east to Walla Walla. Forty-two men under the command of Henry A. G. Lee were sent immediately to The Dalles in what {{was the beginning of the}} Cayuse War. A large force under the command of Cornelius Gilliam was then organized and sent to punish those responsible for the massacre. On December 23, the group created Benton District out of the southern section of Polk District, naming the new district for Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton. In <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> Robert Newell was chosen as the speaker of the group with Calvin W. Cook as clerk.|$|E

This vessel was used to pilot ships across the Columbia Bar and thus improved maritime commerce for Portland. In 1870, he sold two blocks of land in downtown to the City of Portland, which would become the Plaza Blocks between Third and Fourth avenues at Main Street.|$|E
