Majumdar says that this was openly acknowledged by the Arab writers. He further notes that historians of India have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>Now</b> there seems little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Arabs beyond the confines of Sindh, their first conquest for nearly 300 years.|$|E

In 1909 the Club {{moved to a new}} building in the Malaya Dmitrovka (occupied by the Lenkom Theatre today) which was specially planned for its uses by the architect Illarion Ivanov-Sсhitz. At the end of the 19th century the Myatlev’s estate was bought by the Cloth-leather Factory Partnership of Alexey Bakhrushin and sons. The founder of the Partnership and the merchant dynasty Alexey Bakhrushin had died by that time.
