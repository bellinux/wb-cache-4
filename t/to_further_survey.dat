40|$|International audienceMost neogastropod species exhibit masculinization of {{the female}} when subject to {{tributyltin}} (TBT) pollution (a process known as 'imposex'). To date, the dog-whelk Nucella lapillus is seemingly unique in having a genetic deficiency (termed Dumpton syndrome or DS) that disrupts the development of normal male sex organs, its presence being readily recognizable by the underdevelopment, or non-development (aphally), of the penis, and incomplete formation (non-closure) of the vas deferens, causing a split prostate. In highly contaminated conditions, female carriers of DS can be identified by a lesser degree of masculinization (notably aphally) : they escape sterilization caused by the advanced stages of imposex. To date, DS has only been reported in areas with high TBT pollution which induces sterilization of normal females (i. e. non DS-affected females). DS is now, for the first time, observed at some locations where present TBT levels are low and some normal females lack penis development. In such conditions {{it is not possible}} to discriminate normal from DS-affected females using aphally. As DS-affected females must be discarded from the calculation of the imposex bioindicators to monitor TBT pollution, indirect tools such as molecular probe are now needed <b>to</b> <b>further</b> <b>survey</b> those areas where DS and TBT pollution may interact as, for example, in south-west Brittany...|$|E

In May 1842, {{he was involved in}} the attack on Chapu. Collinson was responsible for surveying the approaches to Chapu, and once the troops were landed, Bate accompanied them. He was involved in a hand-to-hand battle with a Chinese defender. Bate captured him, then opened the gates of the fort to the British, at which the Chinese fled. This earned him a Mention in Despatches from Vice Admiral William Parker who commanded the force. He returned to England in 1846, and took a series of scientific courses at the colleges at Woolwich and Portsmouth. He was promoted to Commander in 1848 and given command of HMS Royalist, with which he was <b>to</b> carry out <b>further</b> <b>surveys</b> of the Chinese coast.

40|$|Research {{examining}} police departments' use {{of technology}} is underdeveloped relative {{to other areas of}} policing. This gap in the literature is troubling as policing models are becoming more data-driven and thus, relying more heavily on information technologies.

This research seeks to inform this shortcoming by examining a police department that implemented a dedicated wireless mobile broadband system.

In combination with suitable communication methods a user with only one GPS receiver has the possibility to position himself very accurately (#+-# 1 cm) in a very short time (#<=# 30 min). This thesis deals with the different factors having influence on the functionality of a HPPS, appropriate results based on data from the state Lower Saxony are presented. One major topic is the practical use of the HPPS, covering the methodical aspects as well as the achievable accuracies.
