5|$|Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> hold a {{videoconference}} {{with their}} corrupt accountant, Lau, {{who has taken}} their funds for safekeeping and fled to Hong Kong. The Joker interrupts, warns them that Batman is unhindered by the law, and offers to kill him in exchange for half of their money, but Gambol puts a bounty on the Joker instead after he insults him. After escaping and smuggling himself as a corpse, the Joker kills Gambol and takes over his gang. The mob ultimately decides to take the Joker up on his offer.|$|E
5|$|Coleman Reese, an {{accountant}} at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman {{and tries to}} go public with the information. After observing the unpredictability of the Joker, Maroni informs Commissioner Gordon of the Joker's location. The Joker sets fire to the mob's money, burning Lau alive in the process, and kills <b>the</b> <b>Chechen.</b> Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker finds Dent in Gotham General and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel's death on Gotham's corrupt systems. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree based on a coin flip and targets people he holds responsible for Rachel's death, killing Wuertz and Maroni while sparing Ramirez.|$|E

50|$|The remains include dwellings, cobble bridges, altars, iron objects, bones, {{and clay}} and stone objects. There were sickles and stone grain grinders.

There were shops, where artisans worked on and sold pottery, stone-casting, bone-carving, and stone-carving. There {{is evidence of}} an advanced stage of metallurgy. There was differentiation of professionals organized within clans. Jaimoukha argues that while all these cultures probably were made by people included among the genetic ancestors of <b>the</b> <b>Chechens,</b> it was either the Koban or Kharachoi culture {{that was the first}} culture made by the cultural and linguistic ancestors of <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> (meaning <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> first arrived in their homeland 3000-4000 years ago).

25|$|In December 1994, {{when the}} First Chechen War broke out, {{he was the}} senior {{military}} figure on <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> side {{during the war and}} was widely seen as being instrumental to <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> victory over the Russian forces. As the First Deputy Chairman of the ChRI State Defence Council (ChRI President Dudayev was the chairman) and the chief of staff, Maskhadov organised defence of <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> capital during the Battle of Grozny. Maskhadov commanded the city from the Presidential Palace in Grozny, where on one occasion a Russian bunker buster bomb landed 20 meters from him but failed to explode. In February 1995, Dudayev promoted Aslan to Divisional General.|$|E
25|$|The First Battle of Grozny was the Russian Army's {{invasion}} and subsequent conquest of <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> capital, Grozny, {{during the early}} months of the First Chechen War. The attack lasted from December 1994 to March 1995, resulted in the military occupation of the city by the Russian Army and rallied most of <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> nation around the separatist government of Dzhokhar Dudayev.|$|E
25|$|On January 4 and January 5, <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> began {{retreating}} to villages {{south of}} Grozny with whatever combat vehicles {{they had at}} their disposal.

50|$|In {{order to}} secure {{communications}} with Georgia and other future regions of the Transcaucasia, the Russian Empire began spreading its influence into the Caucasus mountains. <b>The</b> <b>Chechens</b> were actually first drawn into conflict with Russia when Russia attacked the Kumyks (and established the fort of Kizlyar), whom <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> were allied to. Russia's Cossacks became imperial extensions and Russia sent its own soldiers to meet the escalating conflict (which was no longer simply between Russian and Kumyk). It soon met with fierce resistance from the mountain peoples. The Russians incorporated a strategy of driving <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> into <b>the</b> mountains, out of their lowland (relative) food source, thus forcing them to either starve or surrender. They were willing to do neither. <b>The</b> <b>Chechens</b> moved to retake the lowlands: in 1785, a holy war was declared on the Russians by Sheikh Mansur, who was captured in 1791 and died a few years later. Nonetheless, expansion into the region, usually known at this point as Ichkeria, or occasionally Mishketia (probably coming from Kumyk or Turkish; also rendered Mitzjeghia, etc.), was stalled due to <b>the</b> persistence of <b>Chechen</b> resistance.|$|R
25|$|In May 1990, Dudayev {{returned}} to Grozny, <b>the</b> <b>Chechen</b> capital, to devote himself to local politics.

5000|$|This {{historical}} narrative, however, {{ignores the}} spread of poverty and <b>the</b> suffering <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> have had to endure during periods where they {{lost control of the}} Terek and Sunzha rivers. In Medieval and Ancient times, the rivers' fertile valleys were necessary to support the populations living in the mountains, meaning that if a foreign people ( [...] the Cossacks,in example) manages to push <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> out of <b>the</b> area, it would cause frequent famines. There was, perhaps an option, to allow the population to decrease dramatically and return to a subsistence lifestyle, but not only would this probably result in the extinction of Chechendom, <b>the</b> <b>Chechens</b> had been civilized people for at least 7000 years (much before the Russians), as had all their neighbors, so a subsistence lifestyle would be unthinkable. <b>The</b> <b>Chechens</b> would still be dependent on the northern plains for food, but they would require the food by a long cultural established tradition of raiding Cossack stanitsas, and taking all the grain storage as well as other useful supplies, bringing it to the highlands (or to the Sunzha).|$|R

Novolaksky District was resettled mainly by Laks (hence the name [...] "Novolaksky"; literally [...] "New Lak District"), but some Russians and Avars were settled there too. <b>The</b> mainly <b>Chechen</b> toponyms were replaced with Russian, Avar, and Lak ones.|$|R

25|$|The Russian {{recognition}} of Abkhazia and South Ossetia {{is also an}} issue.
