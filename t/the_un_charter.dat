5|$|Amending <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter,</b> {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter,</b> is a commonly cited possibility. This {{is difficult because}} it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five {{permanent members of the}} Security Council. There have been only five amendments to <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter</b> since 1945, and none of them were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E

50|$|The EU {{supports}} <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> {{values of}} freedom, {{democracy and human}} rights. The preamble to the EU's treaty cites <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter's</b> human rights articles and is very active on <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Human Rights Council. The EU was also instrumental in setting up <b>the</b> system of <b>UN</b> Special Rapporteurs on human rights issues.|$|R
2500|$|The {{specialized}} {{agencies are}} autonomous organizations {{working with the}} United Nations and {{each other through the}} co-ordinating machinery of the Economic and Social Council.

5|$|There {{are also}} other {{provisions}} of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter</b> {{that deal with}} transitional arrangements, and thus are now spent. For example, article 61(3) and article 109(3). However, In Larger Freedom does not contain any proposals with respect to these provisions.|$|E

5|$|In April 1986 she {{permitted}} US F-111s to use Royal Air Force {{bases for}} the bombing of Libya {{in retaliation for the}} alleged Libyan bombing of a Berlin discothèque, citing the right of self-defence under Article 51 of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter.</b> Polls suggested that fewer than one in three British citizens approved of her decision.|$|E
50|$|A 2005 {{report by}} the United States Institute of Peace on UN reform said that, {{contrary}} to <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter's</b> principle of equality of rights for all nations, Israel is denied rights enjoyed by all other member-states, and that a level of systematic hostility against it is routinely expressed, organized, and funded within the United Nations system.|$|R
50|$|UN Watch participates at <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> as an {{accredited}} NGO in Special Consultative Status to <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) {{and as an}} Associate NGO to <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Department of Public Information (DPI). It is {{affiliated with}} the American Jewish Committee, a NGO established in 1906, which was a pioneer advocate of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter's</b> inclusion of international human rights guarantees, {{and the creation of}} the post of a High Commissioner of Human Rights.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, when Colban was retired, {{he wrote}} an article titled The United Nation As A Permanent World Organisation where he {{reflected}} on <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> and League of Nations. In the article he gave his thought {{on whether or not}} <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> would survive or if it would fail like its predecessor had. He especially focused on what had been done wrong in the League of Nations, and what, as a consequence, had been changed in <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>charters.</b>|$|R
5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s. Despite the political failure they remained the basis of international law. After World War II the legal principles were incorporated in <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter</b> and a host of international human rights treaties.|$|E
5|$|The International Court of Justice (ICJ), {{located in}} The Hague, in the Netherlands, {{is the primary}} {{judicial}} organ of the UN. Established in 1945 by <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter,</b> the Court began work in 1946 as the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges who serve 9-year terms and are appointed by the General Assembly; every sitting judge must be from a different nation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter</b> {{stipulates}} that each primary {{organ of the}} United Nations can establish various specialized agencies to fulfil its duties. Some best-known agencies are the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), the World Bank, and the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN performs most of its humanitarian work through these agencies. Examples include mass vaccination programmes (through WHO), the avoidance of famine and malnutrition (through {{the work of the}} WFP), and the protection of vulnerable and displaced people (for example, by UNHCR).|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{challenged}} {{the legitimacy of}} the war for several reasons. The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from U.S. Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of <b>the</b> <b>UN,</b> which violated <b>UN</b> <b>Charter</b> Article 32; and the fighting was beyond <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter's</b> scope, because <b>the</b> initial north-south border fighting was classed as a civil war. Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time, legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of all the six permanent members including the Soviet Union.|$|R
50|$|The Charter of the United Nations, its 1945 {{constituent}} document, did not expressly {{provide for}} official languages of <b>the</b> <b>UN.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Charter</b> was enacted in five languages (Chinese, French, Russian, English, and Spanish) and provided (in Article 111) that the five texts are equally authoritative.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter's</b> {{prohibition}} of member states of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> attacking other UN member states {{is central to}} the purpose for which <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> was founded {{in the wake of the}} destruction of World War II: to prevent war. This overriding concern is also reflected in the Nuremberg Trials' concept of a crime against peace [...] "starting or waging a war against the territorial integrity, political independence or sovereignty of a state, or in violation of international treaties or agreements..." [...] (crime against peace), which was held to be the crime that makes all war crimes possible.|$|R
5|$|The {{status of}} the {{treaties}} was questioned by the United Nations Secretariat in 1950, but a modern-day Chairman-Rapporteur of the UN Working Group on Minorities subsequently advised that no competent UN organ had made any decision which that extinguish the obligations under those instruments. He added that it was doubtful whether that could even {{be done by the}} United Nations. The provision that 'No discrimination of any kind shall be made between the inhabitants on the ground of race, religion, language or sex.' is enshrined in a multitude of international human rights conventions and <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|For example, the Security Council passed no resolutions on {{most major}} Cold War conflicts, {{including}} the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Vietnam War, and the Soviet–Afghan War. Resolutions addressing more current problems, {{such as the}} conflict between Israel and Palestine and Iran's suspected development of nuclear weapons, are also heavily influenced by the veto, actual or threatened. Additionally, the veto applies to {{the selection of the}} UN's Secretary-General, as well as any amendments to <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter,</b> giving the P5 great influence over these processes. Recently China also exercised its VETO on India's Resolution to put Masood Azhar on list of Global terrorist list. He is proclaimed head of Jaish E Mohammad a terror Outfit which is already designated as Global terrorist group by UNSC.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter</b> {{was drafted}} {{at a conference}} between April–June 1945 in San Francisco, and was signed on 26 June 1945 at the {{conclusion}} of the conference; this charter took effect 24 October 1945, and the UN began operation. The UN's mission to preserve world peace was complicated in its early decades by the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union and their respective allies. The organization participated in major actions in Korea and the Congo, as well as approving the creation of the state of Israel in 1947. The organization's membership grew significantly following widespread decolonization in the 1960s, and by the 1970s its budget for economic and social development programmes far outstripped its spending on peacekeeping. After the end of the Cold War, the UN took on major military and peacekeeping missions across the world with varying degrees of success.|$|E
5|$|The {{resolution}} {{requires that}} Syria eliminate its chemical stockpile and allow complete access to UN and OPCW chemical weapons inspectors. If {{it does not}} comply with either demand, the Security Council would need to adopt a second resolution regarding imposition of military or other actions against Syria under <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter's</b> Chapter VII. <b>The</b> vote on the resolution was delayed until 27 September because the OPCW needed to vote first on its detailed implementation plan. Syria vowed {{to abide by the}} resolution.|$|R
50|$|Operation Apollo was the codename for an {{operation}} conducted by Canadian Forces {{in support of}} the United States in its military operations in Afghanistan. The operation took place from October 2001 to October 2003. In addition, the sequence of events that led to the full manifestation of Operation Apollo started on September 12, 2001, when the United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 1368. The resolution had condemned the attacks of 9/11 and reaffirmed via <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter's</b> Article 51 that allied nations had the obligation to eradicate global terrorism.|$|R
5000|$|Buchman and {{his team}} were in San Francisco {{at the time of}} the first United Nations conference in 1945. A dispute over the [...] "Trusteeship Chapter" [...] in <b>the</b> {{proposed}} <b>UN</b> <b>Charter</b> was averted by the change in General Romulo, attributed to MRA.|$|R
25|$|President Osmeña {{sent the}} Philippine delegation, which was headed by Carlos P. Romulo, to the San Francisco {{gathering}} for the promulgation of the Charter of the United Nations on 26 June 1945. Other {{members of the}} delegation were Maximo Kalaw, Carlos P. Garcia, Pedro Lopez, Francisco Delegado, Urbano Zafra, Alejandro Melchor, and Vicente Sinco. The 28th signatory nation of the United Nations, the Philippines {{was one of the}} fifty-one nations that drafted <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter.</b> Once approved by Philippine delegation, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter</b> was ratified by the Congress of the Philippines and deposited with the U.S State Department on 11 October 1945.|$|E

5000|$|Some have {{questioned}} whether <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> might be relevant in the 21st century.While <b>the</b> <b>UN’s</b> {{first and second}} Charter mandates require the UN: “To maintain international peace and security.... (and if necessary to enforce the peace by) taking preventive or enforcement action,”due to its restrictive administrative structure, the {{permanent members of the}} Security Council themselves have sometimes prevented <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> from fully carrying out its first two mandates.Without the unanimous approval, support (or minimally abstention) of all 5 of the permanent members of <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> Security Council, <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> <b>charter</b> only enables it to [...] "observe", report on, and make recommendations regarding international conflicts [...] Such unanimity on the Security Council regarding the authorization of armed UN enforcement actions has not always been reached in time to prevent the outbreak of international wars.|$|R
5000|$|Article 109 {{provides}} for the convening of a [...] "General Conference of the Members of the United Nations" [...] to consider amendments. In 1955, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> General Assembly established a committee to meet and report on this possibility annually. The committee did so until 1967. The requirement that a [...] "proposal to call such a conference shall {{be placed on the}} agenda" [...] of the 1955 General Assembly reflects the intent of <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter's</b> framers that <b>the</b> original charter would only be a provisional document, until the establishment of a more perfect union within a decade or two. Many organizations have launched lobbying efforts and petition drives in an attempt to invoke the provisions of Article 109.|$|R
25|$|The White House {{stated that}} Ahmadinejad's rhetoric {{showed that it}} was correct in trying to halt Iran's nuclear program.

40|$|During mid- 2014, the {{international}} community was rocked by the unprecedented spread of the Ebola virus. Having first taken hold {{in a number of}} West African states, the virus began to appear outside of the region as potentially catastrophic consequences were forecast by health experts, international organisations, politicians, and media outlets alike. In September, <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Security Council labelled Ebola a ‘threat to the peace’ and {{the international}} community was urged to provide aid to the worse effected areas in order to eradicate its threat. This paper considers the nature of the Ebola outbreak as a ‘threat to the peace’ under <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> <b>Charter’s</b> collective security framework and attempts to place it within the wider context of discourse on the concept of collective security, in particular its human security dimension. Importantly, it will demonstrate the relationship between a threat of this kind and other recognised threats to the peace...|$|R
50|$|Of all her contributions, Bernardino is {{best known}} for arguing in favor of gender-inclusive {{language}} {{in the early stages of}} <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> development. At <b>the</b> 1945 United Nations Conference on International Organization, although she was technically a delegate of the Dominican Republic—sent by dictator Rafael Trujillo as a “low-risk opportunity to appear progressive”—Bernardino entered the conference with her own agenda, representing the interests of the Inter-American Commission of Women (IACW). Bernardino and her colleague Berta Lutz were acknowledged as “instrumental” in the inclusion of the phrases “equal rights of men and women,” “faith in fundamental human rights” and “the dignity and worth of the human person” in the preamble to <b>the</b> <b>UN's</b> <b>charter.</b> She is also credited with the wording “equal rights of men and women” in the preamble for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—she believed that omitting “and women” would have seemed intentional and invited discrimination.|$|R
