5|$|Soon {{after the}} liberation, the {{reestablished}} government in Brussels attempted to disarm and demobilize the resistance. In particular, the government feared the organizations would degenerate into armed political militias which could threaten the country's political stability. In October 1944 the government ordered {{members of the}} resistance to surrender their weapons to the police and, in November, threatened to search the houses and fine those who had retained them. This provoked significant anger among resistance members, who had hoped {{that they would be}} able to continue fighting alongside the Allies in the invasion of Germany. On 25 November, a large demonstration of former resistance members took place in Brussels. As the crowds moved towards the Parliament, British soldiers fired on the crowd, which they suspected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to make left-wing coup d'état. 45 people were wounded.|$|E
5|$|In 1326, however, Edward was deposed by an {{alliance}} of Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer. Edward was eventually captured by Isabella's forces and {{the custody of the}} king was assigned to Henry, Earl of Lancaster, who had backed Isabella's invasion. Henry, reoccupying most of the Lancaster lands, was made constable of Kenilworth and Edward was transported there in late 1326; Henry's legal title to the castle was finally confirmed the following year. Kenilworth was chosen for this purpose by Isabella probably both because it was a major fortification, and also because of the symbolism of its former owners' links to popular ideals of freedom and good government. Royal writs were issued in Edward's name by Isabella from Kenilworth until the next year. A deputation of leading barons led by Bishop Orleton was then sent to Kenilworth to first persuade Edward to resign and, when that failed, to inform him that he had been deposed as king. Edward formally resigned as king in the great hall of the castle on 21 January 1326. As the months went by, however, it became clear that Kenilworth was proving a less than ideal location to imprison Edward. The castle was in a prominent part of the Midlands, in an area that held several nobles who still supported Edward and were believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to rescue him. Henry's loyalty was also coming under question. In due course, Isabella and Mortimer had Edward moved by night to Berkeley Castle, where he died shortly afterwards. Isabella continued to use Kenilworth as a royal castle until her fall from power in 1330.|$|E

25|$|Probably Delacroix's best-known painting, Liberty Leading the People is {{an unforgettable}} image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward {{under the banner}} of the tricolour {{representing}} liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, he seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to convey the will and character of the people, rather than glorifying the actual event, the 1830 revolution against Charles X, which did little other than bring a different king, Louis-Philippe, to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly, as if in a spotlight.|$|E
25|$|In drawing {{attention}} {{to a number of}} preliminary studies, the so-called primary project, that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of Guernica, Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as Las Meninas by Diego Velázquez. In his chef d'oeuvre, Picasso seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, Guernica should be seen as Picasso’s comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.|$|E

While Ryan is searching for Braden, Jonathan kidnaps Greenlee, Kendall and Lily Montgomery, and reveals that he actually is responsible for poisoning Greenlee, shooting Ryan, and murdering both Edmund Grey and Braden. Though Jonathan claimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to save Ryan, Ryan is forced to shoot his Jonathan, who is presumed dead.

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 10 May, as Little Belt was some 48 miles east of Cape Charles at the {{entrance}} to Chesapeake Bay, she sighted a strange sail in the distance. Bingham made signal #277, which requested the strange ship, if a British warship, to show her number. The other ship did not reply and Bingham concluded that the mystery ship was a United States Navy frigate. He hoisted his colours and began to round Cape Hatteras. The frigate followed, catching up to Little Belt, and appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to maneuver into a position to rake the sloop. Bingham veered three times to foil the American's attempts, while calling for the frigate to identify herself. Each time though the American demanded the same of Bingham. The frigate, actually the 44-gun USS President under Commodore John Rodgers had mistaken Little Belt for another British warship which had recently been observed impressing American sailors. Bingham claimed President then opened fire on Little Belt, although the Americans claimed the same of the British. Regardless, an engagement began, lasting three-quarters of an hour. The British observed that President had a fire onboard as she drew away.|$|E

[...] He further complimented the show because he felt that [...] "it scarcely appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> too hard to attract attention, yet it does just that". He did note that [...] "the short-form format leaves some emotional substance to be desired", although he noted this was inevitable for a series with such short episodes.|$|E
