25|$|In 2006, a {{study by}} Margaret Roth Woodhouse, Michael Freeling, and Damon Lisch {{identified}} a gene that inhibits the transcription of both transposons and paramuted color gens in maize (Woodhouse, 6). The gene, called Mediator of paramutation1 (Mop1), codes for an RNA-processing enzyme <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> for making the small RNAs {{that are responsible for}} silencing the transposon MuDR. A second gene, Mu killer (MuK), is then needed to establish heritable silencing (Gross, 1).|$|E

We initially consider precisely what market discipline means in this context, who exercises it and the preconditions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for it to operate effectively. We explore the incentives <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> for PCA and market discipline to reinforce rather than cancel each other and in particular consider the limits to market discipline in this context from corporate governance and from difficulties in valuation. While our analysis is primarily aimed at advanced countries, we also examine problems in emerging markets and how deposit insurance arrangements might conflict with the aims of both PCA and market discipline. market discipline, banks, prompt corrective action...|$|R

25|$|An {{advantage}} of parabolic antennas {{is that most}} of the structure of the antenna (all of it except the feed antenna) is nonresonant, so it can function over a wide range of frequencies, that is a wide bandwidth. All <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> to change the frequency of operation is to replace the feed antenna with one that works at the new frequency. Some parabolic antennas transmit or receive at multiple frequencies by having several feed antennas mounted at the focal point, close together.|$|E

All of these modifications to the normal mammal skull are, of course, {{to make room for the}} proboscis. This proboscis caused a retraction of bones and cartilage in the face during the evolution of the tapir, and even caused the loss of some cartilages, facial muscles, and the bony wall of the nasal chamber.|$|E
