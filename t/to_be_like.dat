5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving to be happy, while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E
5|$|His second book, It Doesn't Have <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Like</b> This, {{an outline}} of his views on the environment, was {{published}} in 1989, and he was regularly invited to high-profile events. That year he discussed animal rights during a televised debate at the Royal Institution, alongside Tom Regan, Mary Warnock and Germaine Greer, and in 1990 his name appeared on advertisements for a children's charity, along with Audrey Hepburn, Woody Allen and other celebrities.|$|E
5|$|The Goth. sibja, OHG. sippia, sippa, AS. sib gen. sibbe, denote peace, friendship, kindred; {{from these}} I infer a divinity Sibja, Sippia, Sib, {{corresponding}} to ON. Sif gen. Sifjar, {{the wife of}} Thôrr, for the ON. too has a pl. sifjar meaning cognatio, sifi amicus (OHG. sippio, sippo), sift genus, cognatio. By this sense of the word, Sif would appear <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>like</b> Frigg and Freyja, a goddess of loveliness and love; as attributes of Oðinn and Thôrr agree, their wives Frigg and Sif have also a common signification.|$|E

5|$|The survey {{continued}} {{to the south}} in Patagonia. They stopped at Bahía Blanca, and in cliffs near Punta Alta Darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. He identified the little-known Megatherium by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a giant version of the armour on local armadillos. The finds brought great interest when they reached England.|$|E
5|$|The type {{remains of}} Hypacrosaurus remains were {{collected}} in 1910 by Barnum Brown for the American Museum of Natural History. The remains, a partial postcranial skeleton consisting of several vertebrae and a partial pelvis (AMNH 5204), came from along the Red Deer River near Tolman Ferry, Alberta, Canada, from rocks {{of what is now}} known as the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (early Maastrichtian, Upper Cretaceous). Brown described these remains, in combination with other postcranial bones, in 1913 as a new genus that he considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> Saurolophus. No skull was known at this time, but two skulls were soon discovered and described.|$|E
5|$|Von Stroheim {{did not see}} Greed as {{political}} and told a journalist that he considered it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a Greek tragedy. Despite the characters' struggles with poverty and class, von Stroheim followed the naturalist technique of portraying characters whose lives are driven by fate and their inner nature. Von Stroheim employed variations of this theme in his other films, which often involved a commoner {{falling in love with}} an aristocrat or royal.|$|E

5|$|At Chuck's hotel, Chuck saves Blair while Raina stops her father. With {{the police}} arriving, Chuck offers Blair a limo ride, and a homesick Raina breaks up with Nate, {{intending}} {{to return to}} Chicago. Chuck proposes avoiding the Constance party by going to a bar mitzvah {{in a similar fashion}} to Death Takes a Holiday, which Blair accepts. Chuck and Blair have sex while Prince Louis (Hugo Becker) waits for Blair at Constance. While looking for Charlie at the loft, Vanessa spots Dan's novel and reads it. Dan calls her and is upset that she has been reading the novel, which she suggests that he publish despite the possible backlash. Realizing that he no longer cares about writing, Vanessa steals the novel after Dan angrily dismisses her. Serena stops Charlie from jumping off a window and Charlie expresses her envy towards Serena, aspiring <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> her until Serena admits her personal flaws to Charlie, who comforts her. Dan and Nate find Charlie and Serena and return to the party. Charlie makes a suspicious call to her mother and piques Georgina's interest, who gives her her number. Blair finds herself in a dilemma as her feelings for Chuck have resurfaced, arriving at the party to inform Louis of her decision but Chuck interrupts her, informing him that he has their blessing. Blair confronts Chuck for making a decision for her, but the two eventually settle their issues, and he lets her go.|$|E

40|$|Although it is {{suggested}} that linguistic alignment can be influenced by speakers' relationship with their listener, previous studies provide inconsistent results. We tested whether speakers' desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> affects syntactic alignment, and simultaneously assessed whether alignment affects perceived likeability. Primed participants (PPs) were therefore primed by another naive participant (Evaluator). PP and Evaluator took turns describing photographs with active/passive sentences. Unknown to PP, we controlled Evaluator's syntax by having them read out sentences. PPs' desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> <b>was</b> manipulated by assigning pairs to a Control (secret evaluation by Evaluator), Evaluation (PPs were aware of evaluation), or Directed Evaluation (PPs knew about the evaluation and <b>were</b> instructed <b>to</b> make a positive impression) condition. PPs showed significant syntactic alignment (more passives produced after passive primes). However, there was no interaction with condition: PPs did not align more in the (Directed) Evaluation than in the Control condition. Our results thus do not support the conclusion that speakers' desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>liked</b> affects syntactic alignment. Furthermore, there was no reliable relationship between syntactic alignment and how likeable PPs appeared to their Evaluator: there was a negative effect in the Control and Evaluation conditions, but no relationship in the Directed Evaluation condition...|$|R
