The mass spectra of the obtained tetra‐ and triorganotin derivatives are given as analytical evidence for their obtainment. Copyright © 1973 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Hexamethylditin in {{methanol}} solution reacts rapidly with {{mercuric chloride}} to yield mercury and trimethyltin chloride. With alkylmercuric salts {{the reaction is}} complex, yielding <b>tetraalkyltin</b> and/or dialkylmercury, depending upon the reactivity of the alkylmercuric salt. An electrophilic substitution mechanism involving trimethylstannyl mercurials as transient intermediates is suggested. The reaction of hexaalkylditin with diarylmercury is suggested to follow a homolyric pathway...|$|E

40|$|The {{rates of}} the {{reactions}} of <b>tetraalkyltins</b> (R 4 Sn) with bromine in dimethylformamide and acetic acid solutions and with iodine in acetic acid are found to depend on steric effects (kMe> kEt > knPr), caused by the R 3 Sn leaving group. Trialkyltin bromides (R 3 SnBr) are cleaved by bromine in acetic acid in a reactivity sequence (kMe knPr) which is best explained by an increasing importance of inductive effects.

40|$|The mass {{spectra of}} mixed <b>tetraalkyltins</b> are {{described}} and analysed. The fragmentation pattern is {{in agreement with}} the hypothesis of prefered Sn(IV) and Sn(II) valence states in the tin‐containing fragments. These states are reached by losing an alkyl radical from the next higher unfavourable valence state, or by losing an alkene or alkane molecule from a favourable valence state. The ease of cleavage of a carbon‐tin bond in the molecular ion parallels the stabilization of the leaving alkyl radical by hyperconjugation. The findings are tentatively extrapolated to the general behaviour of tetraalkyl derivatives of group IV organometallics. Copyright © 1968 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|A highly {{efficient}} catalyst system {{consisting of a}} nickel complex, a trialkylamine, and a tetraaklyltin was studied for the isomerization of methyl formate to acetic acid. The effects of temperature, solvent, methyl formate concentration and CO partial pressure on the rate and selectivity of the reaction were investigated. The role of promoter <b>tetraalkyltin</b> as a Lewis acid and synergistic effects between promoters are explained using a proposed mechanismclose 9...|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of simple alkyl groups in Stille reactions usually requires special solvents (HMPA) or certain organotin reagents (stannatranes, monoorganotin halides) to be efficient. Using low-melting mixtures of sugar, urea and inorganic salt as solvent, a fast and efficient palladiumcatalyzed alkyl transfer with <b>tetraalkyltin</b> reagents was observed. The high polarity and nucleophilic {{character of the}} solvent melt promotes the reaction. Stille biaryl synthesis using electron-poor and electron- rich aryl bromides proceeds with quantitative yields in the sugar-urea-salt melt. Catalyst loading may be reduced to 0. 001 mol...|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{sensitive}} {{method for}} multielemental speciation analysis of volatile metal and metalloid compounds in air has been developed. The analytes are sampled simultaneously {{in the field}} by cryofocusing on a small glass wool-packed column at - 175 °C. Detection is performed in the laboratory by low-temperature GC hyphenated with ICPMS. Oxygen addition in the carrier gas was used to reduce interferences originating from the presence of volatile carbon-containing species in the samples. Plasma stability during analysis was monitored continuously by internal standardization (Xe). This system provides routine absolute detection limits of 0. 06 - 0. 07 pg (as Pb) for tetraalkyllead species (Me 4 Pb, Et 4 Pb), 0. 2 pg (as Sn) for <b>tetraalkyltin</b> species (Me 4 Sn, Et 4 Sn), 0. 8 pg (as Hg) for mercury species (Hg 0, Me 2 Hg, Et 2 Hg), and 2. 5 pg (as Se) for selenium species (Me 2 Se). This instrumentation {{makes it possible to}} collect small air sample volumes and has been successfully applied to the determination of volatile metal and metalloid species in the atmosphere in urban and rural locations. Qualitative application in the semiconductor industry is also reported with regard to the detection of arsenic (ASH 3, tert-butylarsine), phosphorus (PH 3, tert-butylphosphine), alkylindium, and gallium species...|$|E
