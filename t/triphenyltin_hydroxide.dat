40|$|The {{etiology}} and epidemiology of web blight {{of beans}} (Thanatephorus cucumeris) are reviewed and its control through cultural practices, use of tolerant cv. and fungicides is discussed. Cultural practices that have proved effective in controlling the disease include use of pathogen-free seed, elimination of crop residues, crop rotation with nonhost species (grasses and some vegetables), use of soil mulches, and intercropping. Tolerant cv. are Turrialba 1, Porrillo 70, Porrillo Sintetico, S 630 B, Talamanca, Negro Huasteco 81, and Huetar; bean lines that have shown intermediate resistance are BAT 76, XAN 112, BAT 450, HT 7719, and ICTA 883 - 2 -M.

40|$|Two organotin pesticides, {{triphenyltin}} acetate (TPTA) and <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (TPTH), were evaluated {{for their ability}} to induce micronuclei (MN) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in vitro using cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and in vivo BALB/c mouse erythrocytes. Both pesticides induced a dose-dependent increase but only TPTH induced a significant increase in MN at the highest dose (150 ng/ml) tested in CHO cells. With adding S 9 microsomal fractions, both pesticides induced a meaningful MN induction at 150 ng/ml and a dose-dependent significant increase in SCE. In vivo MN induction in erythrocytes was conducted by treating BALB/c mice orally or intraperitoneally with these pesticides either in a single or triple treatments. Oral gavage (p. o.) of TPTA resulted in a dose-related significant increase of MN induction in peripheral blood and of TPTH induced a significant increase in micronucleated reticulocyte (MNRETs) only in a single treatment. Intraperitoneal administration of TPTA or TPTH, however, resulted in meaningless random increases in MN though these increases might be attributable to toxic effects. The MNRETs levels in the treatment with both pesticides were independent to the sampling time. This study demonstrated that TPTA and TPTH was potential chromosome mutagens.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} the effects of pre- and peripubertal exposure (PND 15 – 45) to <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (TPT: 0, 1. 875, 3. 75, 7. 5 and 15 mg/kg bw/d po) on mouse sexual maturation and fertility. Half of the mice were euthanized on PND 46 and the remaining mice were submitted to fertility tests on PND 65 – 75. TPT caused a transient decrease of weight gain at 3. 75 mg/kg bw/d, and deaths and body weight deficits at higher doses. Delays of testes descent (TD), vaginal opening (VO) and first estrus (FE) occurred at doses ≥ 3. 75 (TD) and ≥ 7. 5 mg/kg bw/d (VO, FE), respectively. Body weight {{on the days of}} TD, VO and FE did not differ among groups. TPT at doses ≥ 3. 75 mg/kg decreased sperm and spermatid counts at the end of treatment (PND 46) but no alteration was noted later on PND 75. Testicular histopathology (PND 46) showed a dose-dependent reduction of seminiferous tubules diameter, a greater degree of vacuolation in Sertoli cells and germ cell degeneration and necrosis in TPT-treated mice. TPT did not affect the outcome of fertility tests. Study-derived NOAEL was 1. 875 mg TPT/kg bw/d for males and 3. 75 mg TPT/kg bw/d for females.

40|$|ABSTRACT Three {{types of}} primary cell {{cultures}} were established from organs of hybrid catfish (Clarias gariepinus x Clarias macrocephalus) namely, caudal trunk, gill and liver. Cell cultures from caudal trunk and gill were composed of mixed cells of fibroblasts and epitheloids, while cell cultures from the liver were composed of fibroblastic cells only. All cultures grew well in either Eagle’s essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 15 - 20 % {{fetal calf serum}} (FCS) or Leibovitz’s L- 15 medium supplemented with 5 - 20 % FCS. The optimum growth temperature was 27 °C in an atmosphere either with or without 5 % carbon dioxide. The modal chromosome number as determined from the 19 th passage of caudal trunk cell culture was 56. The cell cultures could be stored at 4 °C for at least 2 months. Experiments were then performed to investigate the feasibility of the established catfish cell culture for screening toxicity of organotin pesticides (<b>triphenyltin</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> TPTH). The {{results showed that the}} culture was highly suitable for the purpose. The effect of TPTH on cell culture was recognized at the concentration of 3 mg l- 1 when cell detachment was used as the criterion of the test. Established cell culture from hybrid catfish has great potential as a powerful tool in tropical aquatic toxicology as a method of screening chemicals prior to in vivo testing...|$|E

40|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} exchanged laponites (Quat-laponites) show selectivity in the adsorption of phenols and chlorinated phenols. Strong adsorbate-adsorbent {{interactions are}} indicated by adsorption isotherms. Adsorption of phenols and chlorinated phenols by Quat-smectites {{is greater than}} that by the Bi Quat-Smectites prepared in this study. It is thought that the quaternary ammonium exchanged smectite components of the Bi Quat-smectites {{interact with each other}} (adsorbent-adsorbent interactions) reducing the number of sites available for adsorbate-adsorbent interactions. Solidification/stabilisation studies of 2 -chlorophenol show that a blend of ground granulated blast furnace slag and ordinary Portland cement attenuates 2 -chlorophenol more effectively than ordinary Portland cement alone. Tetramethyl ammonium- (TMA-) and tetramethyl phosphonium- (TMP-) montmorillonites were exposed to solutions of phenol or chlorinated phenols. TMP- montmorillonite was the better adsorbent and preferentially adsorbed 4 -chlorophenol over phenol. Hydration of the interlayer cations occurs to a greater extent in the TMA-montmorillonite than the TMP-montmorillonite restricting interlayer adsorption. Contrary to that observed for phenols and chlorinated phenols, the Quat-smectites were ineffective as adsorbents for <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>hydroxide</b> and bis(tributyltin) oxide at room temperature. Under microwave conditions, only bis(tributyltin) oxide was adsorbed by the quaternary ammonium exchanged smectites. Bis(tributyltin) oxide was adsorbed from ethanol {{on the surface of the}} smectite clays at room temperature and under microwave conditions. The adsorbate-adsorbent interactions were weak. Adsorption is accompanied by conversion of bis(tributyltin) oxide to a different tin(IV) species and the release of sodium cations from the montmorillonite interlayer region. Attempts to introduce conditions suitable for charge transfer interactions between synthesised quaternary ammonium compounds and 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol are documented. Transition metal complex exchanged clays adsorb 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol and phenol. Strong adsorbate-adsorbent interactions (Type I isotherms) occur when the adsorbate is 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol and when the adsorbent is [Fe(bipy) 3] 2 + exchanged montmorillonite or [Co(bipy) 3] 3 + exchanged montmorillonite. The 2, 2 '-bipyridyl ligands of the adsorbents are electron rich and the 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol is electron deficient. This may have enhanced adsorbate-adsorbent interactions...|$|E
40|$|Two {{examples}} are considered: (1) The effects-of organotin agricultural fungicides on soil Acarina; (2) The effects of reclamation of intertidal land on overwintering shorebirds at Seal Sands, Teesmouth, The effect of triphenyltin acetate and <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>hydroxide</b> was examined by field experiments {{and the results}} are discussed in relation to the dose level, regime and season of treatment. Numbers of soil Acarina were reduced by both clianicals when applied in autumn at recctmended doses. The Mesostigmata and an abundant Prostigmatid, Ttarsonemus floricolus. were particularly affected and the magnitude of reductions was related to the quantity of chemical applied. Not all species of mites were affected and treatment of half the recommended dose resulted in an increase in seme families, of Prostigmata, Seasonal changes in the abundance of mites are described and compared with the results of studies elsewhere in Britain, Suitable laboratory culturing techniques were devised for small Prostigmatid mites. Reclamation of Seal Sands between 1972 - 74 resulted in a loss of feeding area and reduced feeding time. The effects of reclamation are considered in relation to the overwintering numbers of five waders: Grey Plover (Pluvialis squatarola), Curlew (Numenius arauata). Godwit (Limosa lapponica). Redshank (Trinqa tetanus) and Dunlin (Calidris alpina) and to the Shelduck (Tadorna tadorna). Monthly counts of each species are described and compared with counts in previous winters. Changes in numbers are discussed in relation to progressive reclamation. The relative importance of the reduction in feeding area and feeding time in determining the overwintering numbers after reclamation is considered by examination of: (a) the time spent feeding, and (b) the foraging behaviour and diet. The waders overwintered in lower numbers than previously but Shelduck numbers were unchanged. To satisfy their food requirements. Grey Plovers adapted by feeding at night while the other waders fed on adjacent fields in mid-winter. Shorebirds did not change their diet or foraging behaviour. Reduction in numbers was related to the reduced feeding area and food resources available, but for Dunlins loss in feeding tine was more important...|$|E
40|$|Short-term {{toxicity}} {{studies have been}} carried out in rats and guinea-pigs fed diets containing triphenyltin acetate (TPTA), <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>hydroxide</b> (TPTH) or triethyltin hydroxide (TETH) for 90 days at levels ranging from 0 to 50 ppm. The lowest dietary levels found to retard growth in rats and guinea-pigs respectively are as follows: 5 and 10 ppm for TETH; 25 and 5 ppm for TPTA; 50 and 20 ppm for TPTH. An increase in mortality was found in the following groups: rats on 10 ppm or more of TETH; guinea-pigs on 20 and 50 ppm TPTA and on 50 ppm TPTH. In rats and guinea-pigs given TETH, paralysis and pronation of the hindlegs developed. These toxic signs were not found in the TPTA- and TPTH-treated animals. This observation was correlated with the finding that only the TETH-treated animals developed interstitial oedema of the central nervous system. The water content of the brain and spinal cord was increased in rats and guinea-pigs at respective minimum levels of 5 and 10 ppm of TETH and in guinea-pigs on 20 ppm TPTA. In female rats given 50 ppm TPTA or TPTH the water content of the spinal cord was only increased. The changes in organ weights which could be related to the administration of the organotin compounds were confined to an increase of brain weight in rats and guinea-pigs given TETH, and in guinea-pigs given 5 ppm or more of TPTA and a decrease of thymus and/or spleen weights in rats and guinea-pigs receiving TETH. Guinea-pigs given 5 – 20 ppm TPTA or 2 · 5 – 20 ppm TPTH displayed lymphopenia accompanied in a number of animals by histological changes in the lymphopoietic system, viz. atrophy of the white pulp of the spleen was found. This possibly induced a decrease of general resistance, so that a mycotic infection developed in the animals. Hitherto, damage to the central nervous system was considered to be the most sensitive criterion for assessing the toxicity of organotin compounds, but the present work shows that the effect on lymphopoiesis is a more sensitive index of toxic action for triphenyltin compounds...|$|E
40|$|Insect {{glutathione}} S- transferases (GST) {{have been}} studied extensively due to their role in insecticide resistance and oxidative stress. The conjugations of the endogenous or exogenous toxins are catalysed by nucleophilic attack provided by side chains of active residues (Tyr, Ser or Cys) located at position 5 or 6 of the N-terminal of the polypeptide. Delta class Drosophila melanogaster glutathione S- transferases D 3 (DmGSTD 3) has however a truncated N-terminal sequence (15 amino acids) suggesting {{the absence of the}} previously mentioned active residue for catalysis. Our study was to characterise the recombinant GSTD 3 and investigate the role of the amino acid residue associated to catalysis of GSTD 3. DmGSTD 3 gene was cloned into the pET- 30 a and expressed in an Escherichia coli production system. The GSTD 3 protein was purified using an anion exchange chromatography. Substrate specificity test showed that the recombinant protein was only reactive towards 1, chloro- 2, 4 - dinitrobenzene (CDNB) (7. 3807 μmol/min/mg), a common substrate for GSTs, suggesting a possible involvement of other residues in the polypeptide that contribute to the catalysis. No activity was observed with 1, 2 -dichloro- 4 -nitrobenzene, pnitrophenyl chloride, trans- 2 -octenal, trans- 2 -hexanal, ethacrynic acid, trans- 4 -phenyl- 3 - butene- 2 -one, hexa- 2, 4 -dienal, trans,trans-hepta- 2, 4 -dienal, cumene hyperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme activity was optimal at pH 8. 2 and at 25 ° C. GSTD 3 enzymatic activity was inhibited by the addition of <b>triphenyltin</b> <b>hydroxide</b> whereas; no difference in activity was detected in the presence of other inhibitors like quercetin, trans- chalcone, tetradecanedioic acid, sebacid acid and triphenyltin acetate. Homology modelling reveals that the side chains of Tyr 89 and Tyr 97 were facing towards the substrate cavity, proposing their possible role in catalyzing the conjugation. The potential Tyr residues were mutated to alanine via side directed mutagenesis. Specific activity towards CDNB lowered to half when the Tyr 89 (3. 51 μmol/min/mg) and Tyr 97 (3. 01 μmol/min/mg) were mutated individually. GSTD 3 with Y 97 A and Y 89 A gave large changes in Km, Vmax, and Km/Kcat values for GSH as compared to unmutated GSTD 3 suggesting the significant role of Tyr 89 and Tyr 97 in the catalysis of substrate conjugation to GSH in GSTD 3. The study has confirmed the limited detoxification function of GSTD 3 and the importance of Tyr 89 and Tyr 97 in GSTD 3 catalysis...|$|E
