5|$|After {{the appeals}} had been exhausted, Illinois Governor Richard James Oglesby {{commuted}} Fielden's and Schwab's sentences <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison on November 10, 1887. On {{the eve of}} his scheduled execution, Lingg committed suicide in his cell with a smuggled blasting cap which he reportedly held in his mouth like a cigar (the blast blew off half his face and he survived in agony for six hours).|$|E

5|$|Garza, {{troubled by}} what he had done, confessed to the police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder. He cooperated with the police to incriminate Martínez, who then aided in Cisneros' arrest. Cisneros and Garza were eventually sentenced <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison by a state court in 1994, but Cisneros' sentence was overturned due to a legal technicality. She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and sentenced <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|However, in November Justice Lloyd Hibbert sentenced them <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison, stipulating {{that they}} must serve a minimum of thirty years before {{becoming}} eligible for parole.

5|$|On June 11, {{two days}} after the murder, police arrested their suspect. Hayden {{provided}} a confession and subsequently pleaded guilty in court. Hayden's legal representative, Randolph Williams, urged the judge to show leniency because the suspect had shown remorse for his crime from the moment of his arrest. The judge, Justice Basil Reid, sentenced Hayden <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison with the possibility of parole after fifteen years.|$|E

Some experts and politicians argue that their assassination was masterminded by Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan.

5|$|The trial, {{which was}} held from 22 July to 4 October 1948, was marked by {{numerous}} irregularities. The principal {{witness for the prosecution}} was shot dead three days before the trial, and much of the evidence against the defendants was obtained through torture. All three were found guilty of conspiracy against the state and endangering national security. Although these points were raised at the trial, Ravoahangy was sentenced to death, along with Raseta and four other nationalists, while Rabemananjara was sentenced <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison. In July 1949, the convicts' death sentences were commuted <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison, and the trio remained imprisoned until they were granted amnesty in 1958. Few individuals, with the notable exception of Monja Jaona, the founder of Jiny in the south, have claimed responsibility for a leadership role in the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|A European innovation, castles {{originated}} in the 9thand 10thcenturies, {{after the fall of}} the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them, and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from enemies. Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration and symbols of power. Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.|$|E
5|$|According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Cisneros {{was jailed}} in the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee, Florida. Years after her imprisonment, she {{maintained}} {{that she did}} not order Fischer's murder. Martínez, a non-US citizen subject to deportation {{as a result of her}} conviction, was released from prison in April 2001 and later died in Matamoros. Garza, who was sentenced <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison, turned to religion and became a devout Catholic. In a letter written to the press in 2013, he thanked God for saving his life after two ruptured stomach ulcers, and a heart attack that nearly killed him in 2012. He was imprisoned at the age of 42 and will not be eligible for parole until June 2028 (when he is 78 years old). He has spent time in several Texas prisons, including the Louis C. Powledge Unit, the Terrell Unit, and the Eastham Unit.|$|E

5|$|After a {{difficult}} start <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the First Division, Cardiff secured their first {{victory in the}} top division by beating Middlesbrough 3–1. Keenor had been switched to centre-half for the match, a move Fred Stewart had resisted for some time due to his concern of Kennor's lack of height, away from his usual position at right-half and his performance impressed {{so much that he}} would go on to play the position for the remainder of his career. The 1921–22 season was also Keenor's tenth year at Ninian Park and he was subsequently awarded a testimonial match against Bristol City. In the following five years, Cardiff became an established side in the First Division, missing out on the league title in the 1923–24 season to Huddersfield Town on goal average after drawing the final game of the season when a win would have guaranteed them the championship.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} first wife, Elizabeth, he married {{for the second}} time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, {{achieving}} still greater notoriety {{as he had been}} conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, was a happy union, notwithstanding the disparity in their ages and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society {{for the rest of her}} days, accustomed herself <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Brudenell spent large sums of money making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained on good terms with Brudenell's principal mistress, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and tolerated his other affairs.|$|E
5|$|By 1984, Nicky {{is working}} as a {{successful}} photographer, and Mary has divorced Tosker, who has remarried and is rapidly becoming a rich businessman. Nicky and Mary renew their earlier relationship during the turbulent events of the miners' strike and eventually marry. By 1987, however, their marriage is falling apart. Nicky has {{an affair with a}} young student and is also forced to confront his father's Alzheimer's disease. He meets Geordie, now a homeless, drunken vagrant, by chance in London, but his old friend disappears before {{he has a chance to}} help him. Eventually Geordie is sentenced <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> prison as a danger to the public after setting fire to a mattress in a hostel. Despite her failing marriage to Nicky, Mary's life is becoming an increasing success, and she is now a councillor. Tosker, meanwhile, has lost his fortune in the stock market crash.|$|E
