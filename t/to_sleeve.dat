25|$|From 1980 to 1988, the Kings {{modified}} {{their uniforms}} {{to include a}} contrasting yoke that extends from sleeve <b>to</b> <b>sleeve.</b> White was also added to the socks, on the tail stripes, and {{at the bottom of}} the yoke, but the color was removed from the pants. The names and numbers were also modified to a standard NHL block lettering.|$|E
25|$|Just in {{time for}} Wayne Gretzky's arrival, the Kings' colors changed to black and silver. The new uniforms didn't deviate much from the prior design, save for the color scheme, a new primary Kings logo, and a switch from a {{contrasting}} yoke color <b>to</b> <b>sleeve</b> stripes. With {{minor changes to the}} text and pant striping, the uniforms were used until the 1997–98 season.|$|E
6000|$|But it is {{affirmed that}} there is {{something}} innately vulgar in the Yankee dialect. M. Sainte-Beuve says, with his usual neatness: 'Je définis un patois une ancienne langue qui a eu des malheurs, ou encore une langue toute jeune st qui n'a pas fait fortune.' The first part of his definition applies to a dialect like the Provençal, the last to the Tuscan before Dante had lifted it into a classic, and neither, it seems to me, will quite fit a patois/, which is not properly a dialect, but rather certain archaisms, proverbial phrases, and modes of pronunciation, which maintain themselves among the uneducated {{side by side with the}} finished and universally accepted language. Norman French, for example, or Scotch down to the time of James VI., could hardly be called patois, while I should be half inclined to name the Yankee a lingo rather than a dialect. It has retained a few words now fallen into disuse in the mother country, like to tarry, to progress, fleshy, fall, and some others; it has changed the meaning of some, as in freshet; and it has clung to what I suspect to have been the broad Norman pronunciation of e (which Molière puts into the mouth of his rustics) in such words as sarvant, parfect, vartoo, and the like. It maintains something of the French sound of a also in words like ch[)a]mber, d[)a]nger (though the latter had certainly begun to take its present sound so early as 1636, when I find it sometimes spelt dainger). But in general it may be said that nothing can be found in it which does not still survive in some one or other of the English provincial dialects. There is, perhaps, a single exception in the verb <b>to</b> <b>sleeve.</b> <b>To</b> <b>sleeve</b> silk means to divide or ravel out a thread of silk with the point of a needle till it becomes floss. (A.S. sléfan, to cleave=divide.) This, I think, explains the 'sleeveless errand' in 'Troilus and Cressida' so inadequately, sometimes so ludicrously darkened by the commentators. Is not a 'sleeveless errand' one that cannot be unravelled, incomprehensible, and therefore bootless? ...|$|E

50|$|From November 1944 through February 1945, a {{conversion}} process {{began to use}} sleeve bearings in the Panther tank, as there was a shortage of ball bearings.

5000|$|Rifle {{bearings}} {{are similar}} <b>to</b> <b>sleeve</b> bearings, but are quieter and have {{almost as much}} lifespan as ball bearings. The bearing has a spiral groove in it that pumps fluid from a reservoir. This allows them to be safely mounted with the shaft horizontal (unlike sleeve bearings), since the fluid being pumped lubricates {{the top of the}} shaft. The pumping also ensures sufficient lubricant on the shaft, reducing noise, and increasing lifespan.|$|E

5000|$|In 1982, {{the primary}} logo patch {{was removed from}} the left sleeve of the road jerseys, to which were added thick [...] "racing stripes" [...] (blue with orange borders) on the {{shoulders}} from neck <b>to</b> <b>sleeve</b> cuff, {{on the sides of the}} jerseys from armpit to hip, and on the sides of the pants from beltline to cuff; the collar and sleeve-cuff striping were removed.

50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy procedure, a 200 cm {{segment of}} ileum is prepared while preserving the last 30 cm {{part of the}} small intestine and then ‘’interposed’’ to the proximal part of the small intestine. Thanks to this, food continue to pass throughout the entire small intestine. No malabsorption is in question in this technique, and the food is absorbed by the duodenum as well. Since negative hormones secreted from the duodenum are quite effective in the surgical treatment of diabetes, this operation offers effective weight control, but has limited effect on blood sugar control.|$|E

The {{decision was made to}} sail for Salvador, then proceed to Rio. The fleet arrived in Salvador on 11 July. Around this time, One and All had reached the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal, but was forced to make for Gibraltar when a weakened topmast became evident.|$|E
40|$|A passive ball capture joint has {{a sleeve}} with a {{plurality}} of bores distributed about a circumference thereof and formed therethrough at an acute angle relative <b>to</b> the <b>sleeve's</b> longitudinal axis. A spring-loaded retainer is slidingly fitted in each bore and is biased such that, if allowed, will extend at least partially into the <b>sleeve</b> <b>to</b> retain a ball therein. A ring, rotatably mounted about the bores, has an interior wall defining {{a plurality of}} shaped races that bear against the spring-loaded retainers. A mechanized rotational force producer is coupled to the ring. The ring can be rotated from a first position (that presses the retainers into the <b>sleeve</b> <b>to</b> lock the ball in place) to a second position (that allows the retainers to springback out of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>to</b> release the ball) ...|$|R

50|$|In the novel's {{somewhat}} dystopian world, human personalities can {{be stored}} digitally and downloaded into new bodies, called sleeves. Most people have cortical stacks in their spinal columns that store their memories. If their body dies, their stack {{can be stored}} indefinitely. Catholics have arranged {{that they will not}} be resleeved as they believe that the soul goes to Heaven when they die, and so would not pass on to the new sleeve. This makes Catholics targets for murder, since killers know their victim will not be resleeved to testify. A UN resolution to alter this legal position forms one strand of the novel's plot, to allow the authorities <b>to</b> <b>sleeve</b> a deceased Catholic woman temporarily to testify in a murder trial.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>sleeve</b> gastrectomy procedure, {{the connection}} between the stomach and the duodenum is closed off from the level of the second segment of the duodenum. While preserving the last 30 cm part of the small intestine, a 170 cm segment of ileum is prepared and connected to the first segment of the duodenum, which {{is at the end of}} the stomach. The other end of the ileum segment is connected to the proximal part of the small intestine. Thus, distal part of the small intestine is ‘’interposed’’ between proximal part of the small intestine and the stomach. Since duodenum and the proximal part of the small intestine is disabled, a partial bypass is in question. Patients who undergo this operation achieve better weight and blood sugar control, but face anemia (iron deficiency) risk because of the bypass procedure.|$|E
5000|$|The Mess dress uniform is worn {{to formal}} or semi-formal {{occasions}} such as Dinings-in, Dinings-out, the annual Air Force Ball, weddings and other formal functions where civilian [...] "black tie" [...] would be prescribed. Until the early 1980s, this uniform {{differed from the}} current version, previously consisting of separate mess jackets, a white mess jacket worn in spring and summer and a black mess jacket worn in fall and winter, combined with black trousers and ties for males and an options of a black cocktail length or black evening length skirt for females. Black cummerbunds {{for males and females}} and white and black service hats for males were also prescribed, although wear of these hats was often optional. The current mess dress uniform in use since the early/mid-1980s consists of a dark blue mess jacket and mess dress trousers for males and a similar color evening length skirt for females. The jacket features ornate silver buttons, and is worn with the service member's awarded medals in miniature size, wings in miniature size, or other specialty insignia over the left breast, command insignia over the right breast for colonels and below (if applicable), satin air force blue bow-tie for males or tab for females, and a satin air force blue cummerbund. Cufflinks are to be either shined or flat round silver, or have the air force star and wing emblem, dark blue suspenders may also be worn, but remain hidden while the jacket is on. Commissioned officers, USAFA and AFROTC cadets, and OTS officer trainees wear hard shoulder epaulets (i.e., shoulder boards) similar to those worn by commissioned officers of the U.S Navy. Cadets and officer trainees wear insignia on their shoulder boards as applicable to their pre-commissioning rank position in their respective officer accession programs. Commissioned officer shoulder boards for colonels and below feature an officer's rank insignia in raised metallic thread, bordered by two silver vertical metallic stipes similar <b>to</b> <b>sleeve</b> braid. General officers wear shoulder boards covered nearly the entire length and width in silver metallic braid, with silver stars in raised metallic thread in number appropriate to their rank. Enlisted personnel wear the same large rank insignia that they would wear on their service dress coats. Officers also wear a single silver metallic sleeve braid on the lower sleeves of the Mess Dress coat, with sleeve braid coming in two widths, in a 1/2 inch width for colonel and below, and in a 3/4 inch width for Brigadier General and above. Enlisted personnel wear no sleeve braid. No hat or nametag is worn with the Air Force Mess Dress Uniform.|$|E
