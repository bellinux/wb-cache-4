25|$|The {{standard}} way {{to express}} <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> levels (the amount of ozone in a given vertical column) in the atmosphere is by using Dobson units. Point measurements are reported as mole fractions in nmol/mol (parts per billion, ppb) or as concentrations in μg/m3. The study of ozone concentration in the atmosphere started in the 1920s.|$|E
25|$|It is more {{accurate}} to speak of ozone depletion in middle latitudes rather than holes. Total column ozone declined below pre-1980 values between 1980 and 1996 for mid-latitudes. In the northern mid-latitudes, it then increased from the minimum value by about two percent from 1996 to 2009 as regulations took effect {{and the amount of}} chlorine in the stratosphere decreased. In the Southern Hemisphere's mid-latitudes, <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> remained constant over that time period. There are no significant trends in the tropics, largely because halogen-containing compounds have not had time to break down and release chlorine and bromine atoms at tropical latitudes.|$|E
25|$|Ilan Ramon was Israel's first astronaut. Ramon was {{the space}} shuttle payload {{specialist}} on board the fatal STS-107 mission of Space Shuttle Columbia, in which he and the six other crew members {{were killed in a}} re-entry accident over the southern United States. Ramon had been selected as a payload specialist in 1997 and trained at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, from 1998 until 2003. Among other experiments, Ramon was responsible for the MEIDEX project in which he was required to take pictures of atmospheric aerosol (dust) in the Mediterranean area using a multispectral camera designed to provide scientific information about atmospheric aerosols and the influence of global changes on the climate, and data for the <b>Total</b> <b>Ozone</b> Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. Researchers from Tel Aviv University (TAU) were responsible for the scientific aspect of the experiment. The TAU team also worked with a US company, Orbital Sciences Corporation, to construct and test special flight instruments for the project.|$|E
40|$|Systematic {{ozonation}} {{tests were}} conducted {{by means of a}} mobile pilot plant. Water source 1 was a low turbidity stream with very low solids content and very low turbidity, apparent color and alkalinity. Water source 2 was reservoir water with higher turbidity, solids content and alkalinity than source 1. The ozone plant was a counter-current contactor composed of four columns in series. Variations in contact time, in the feed gas concentration (in terms of percent by weight of ozone) and in splitting of the <b>total</b> applied <b>ozone</b> dosage between columns 1 and 2 were tested. Concentration - time (CT) products were calculated and decay coefficients K were estimated from experimental data. The relative importance of water quality and certain operational parameters with regard to CT products and ozone decay was assessed. Total CT values seemed to increase with: (a) <b>total</b> applied <b>ozone</b> dosage, (b) percent by weight of ozone in the feed gas to the bubble contactor, (c) increasing contact time and (d) higher water quality, with regard to turbidity, apparent color, total organic carbon and particle counts. As the <b>total</b> applied <b>ozone</b> dosage was increased, the more important the contact time and ozone dosage configuration became for the total CT value. The apparent first order ozone decay rate constant (K) decreased with increasing <b>total</b> applied <b>ozone</b> dosage. The contact time appeared to exert a much stronger influence on total CT values than on K values, particularly so as the <b>total</b> applied <b>ozone</b> dosage was increased...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1990 s {{a series of}} surface-based direct sun and zenith sky {{measurements}} of <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> were made with SBUV/ 2 flight models and the SSBUV Space Shuttle instrument in Boulder, Colorado which were compared with NOAA Dobson Instrument direct sun observations and TOMS instrument overpass observations of column ozone. These early measurements led to {{the investigation of the}} accuracy of derived <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> amounts and aerosol optical depths from zenith sky observations. Following the development and availability of radiometrically stable IAD narrow band interference filter and nitrided silicon photodiodes a simple compact multifilter spectroradiometer was developed which {{can be used as a}} calibration transfer standard spectroradiometer (CTSS) or as a surface based instrument remote sensing instruments for measurements of <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> and aerosol optical depths. The <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> derived from zenith sky observations agrees with Dobson direct sun AD double wavelength pair measurements and with TOMS overpass ozone amounts within uncertainties of about 1 %.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the <b>total</b> amount of <b>ozone</b> content {{with the development of}} a cyclonic system that occurred in the period 17 to 28 January 2005 has been studied.

There is also a good correlation between <b>total</b> amount of <b>ozone</b> with the thickness of height between 1000 - 500 hPa and tropopause pressure.

40|$|The Montreal Protocol {{has succeeded}} in {{limiting}} major ozone-depleting substance emissions, and consequently stratospheric ozone concentrations are expected to recover this century. However, {{there is a large}} uncertainty in the rate of regional ozone recovery in the Northern Hemisphere. Here we identify a Eurasia-North America dipole mode in the <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> over the Northern Hemisphere, showing negative and positive <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> anomaly centres over Eurasia and North America, respectively. The positive trend of this mode explains an enhanced <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> decline over the Eurasian continent in the past three decades, which is closely related to the polar vortex shift towards Eurasia. Multiple chemistry-climate-model simulations indicate that the positive Eurasia-North America dipole trend in late winter is likely to continue in the near future. Our findings suggest that the anticipated ozone recovery in late winter will be sensitive not only to the ozone-depleting substance decline but also to the polar vortex changes, and could be substantially delayed in some regions of the Northern Hemisphere extratropics...|$|R

40|$|Long-term {{trends of}} <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> (TCO), {{assessments}} of stratospheric ozone recovery, and satellite validation are underpinned by {{a reliance on}} daily best representative values from Brewer spectrophotometers and other ground-based ozone instruments. In turn reporting of these daily <b>total</b> column <b>ozone</b> values to the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Radiation Data Centre (WOUDC) has traditionally been predicated upon a simple choice between direct sun (DS) and zenith sky (ZS) observations. For mid- and high-latitude monitoring sites impacted by cloud cover we discuss the potential deficiencies of this approach {{in terms of its}} rejection of otherwise valid observations and capability to evenly sample throughout the day. A new methodology is proposed that makes full use of all valid direct sun and zenith sky observations, accounting for unevenly spaced observations and their relative uncertainty, to calculate an improved estimate of the daily mean <b>total</b> column <b>ozone.</b> It is demonstrated that this method can increase the number of contributing observations by a factor of 2. 5, increases the sampled time span, and reduces the spread of the representative time by half.

No effect on longer-term trends is detected, though for the sample data analysed we observe a mean increase of 2. 8  DU (0. 82  %) with respect to the traditional direct sun vs. zenith sky average choice.
