The research highlights the opportunities offered by IS (including online technologies) for generally improving the provision of business services e. g. automating supply chain processes. More specifically, though, it investigates the potential IS have for integrating information flows and providing timely, in-depth and better presented information and the options for online filing. It also explores the capabilities for improving interactions with clients and enhancing relationships with key stakeholders in the supply chain e. g. government agencies, overseas patent agents and lawyers. The paper additionally outlines key challenges that are at the forefront and need to be addressed when using IS within the IP sector such as identity management, security and authentication. The key findings of the research will be of value to researchers and practitioners in the IP field but many of the issues and challenges faced will also be applicable to other sectors...|$|E

40|$|At {{the core}} of every {{successful}} business are the <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> the business uses to identify its goods or services. If properly protected, <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> can last forever; and can provide the business with a unique and immediately visible identification to its customers and the world beyond. A <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> cannot be protected by the law unless it is registered, since registration is considered as a basis of the legal protection. The <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 together with its Rules organize all matters concerning registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> and provide the procedure to be followed in obtaining such registration. This thesis examines the registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in Sudan under the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969. Chapter One highlights {{the historical development of}} the <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> laws in the Sudan and discusses the definition of the <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> under both the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Ordinance 1931 and the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 and the various functions of the <b>trade</b> <b>marks.</b> The discussion in Chapter Two is mainly about the registrability of <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Chapter Three concentrates on the procedure of registration.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} for the first time, a history of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia. Its {{focus is on the}} latter to middle part of the 19 th century and early into the 20 th century, predating the Commonwealth <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act. This is because it was during this period when the legislative framework for <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> protection was first established under the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime and the most important, characteristic features of modern <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law developed. With a specific focus on this critical period, the legal narrative and this thesis considers the inception of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime, contextualising its genesis. It also examines the architecture of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The final part of the narrative focuses on the operation of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The key reason for this particular doctrinal focus is twofold. The primary reason relates to the lack of consideration given to the historical development of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia to date, and in particular, the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The second ancillary reason relates to the potential importance of this thesis to modern debates about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, which often refer back to and rely upon the assumed traditional principles of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, without any inquiry or deep understanding as to what those traditional foundations actually are, at least from an Australian perspective. In taking a doctrinal and empirical approach, this thesis draws on the relevant legal archive, containing the limited primary and secondary sources available relating to the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. Here, particular attention is paid to the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registers, which have been examined in detail. However, the relevant legal archive also includes the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> statutes, the related Hansard reports, colonial newspapers and the case law reported as arising out of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. This thesis further draws on the body of 19 th century British (and to a lesser extent American) <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and other treatises as the authoritative legal texts of the time, as well as the statutory protection afforded to <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in the United Kingdom and the extrinsic material concerning early British <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, so far {{as it relates to the}} colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime...|$|R
40|$|Modern <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> perform {{multiple}} functions {{taken up}} in a functional matrix. Amongst them the distinguishing function is invariable whilst the other functions are variable. A legal-historical and comparative investigation {{of the law of}} <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U. S. A. and South Africa reveals that only certain <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> functions have traditionally been afforded protection under law. This is mainly because of a historical resistance to accepting <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> as property in the Anglo and American <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> systems and the primacy of origin theory in the European Community <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> system. The bedrock of South African <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law has been the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law of the United Kingdom. The restrictions brought about by common law property theory have been carried over into the South African law of <b>trade</b> <b>marks.</b> The South African law of property is however derived from the civil law and not the common law. The historical break in continuity of the common law <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> tradition {{as a consequence of the}} interposition of the European Union and the reception of EC <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in the United Kingdom affords the opportunity for a theory of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> rights to be established in South Africa which is derived from concepts already present in South African law. The thesis proposes that the legal right to the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> in South African law is an independent subjective right of the kind proposed by Joubert. The legal object of this right is the <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> The entitlements of use of the holder of the right are the functions which the holder is entitled to have the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> perform. A range of values in which the property in a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> is to be found are associated with the functions. Unlawful impingement upon any function infringes the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right. This theory provides the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act, 1993 with a needed theoretical base. Mercantile LawLL.

In {{the thesis}} {{entitled}} "Law Protection on <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> and Effort to Prevent <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Right Violation after issue <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law No. 19 / 1992 Jo. <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law No. 14 / 1997 " {{there are three}} important problems exposed. The first problem is about law protection for the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner and <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right holder in the new <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law, {{the second is the}} role of government and law enforcement officer in preventing and to overcome law violation on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right, and the third is about consumer's law culture in relation with consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> The law protection for owner or right holder of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> has been regulated comprehensively covering administrative, civil and crime sides in a juridical way which is stated in the new <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law.. From administrative side by implementing constitutive system, the owner of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> is acknowledged and given exclusive right, that is being protected as the one and only person who has the right of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> In case of law violation on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right, the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner can do legal remedy through administrative action, sue a person for civil liability as well as crime liability. Based on its authority, the government plays important role in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right violation. As the authority holder, the government has the rights to make rule and policy on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Through the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office the government has a role as <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> administrator, consultant and controller on the use of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> in the community, as well as a law enforcement officer by a way of appointing the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office employee as Civil Investigator. From the analysis of field research result, it is revealed that the cancellation of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> within constitutive system still happens due to weak performance of the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> office in examining the substansial requirements during <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registration request. Beside that the absence of implementation guidance of some rules in <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law has influenced law enforcement on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Meanwhile, the lack of knowledge and understanding about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> among law enforcement officer has influenced them in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation. They tend to give minor punishment to those who violate the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law. This condition shows the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law protection is not effective yet because the role of government through the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office and law enforcement officer in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation, need to be improved. On the other hand, <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law protection and <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation preventing action are also influenced by community's law culture as consumers who consume the goods and the services. The consumer's law culture gives negative response or does not support consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> which happens in the community whose opinion and behaviour do not give symbolical meaning on <b>trade</b> <b>mark,</b> the communal values which consider <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> imitation as something acceptable {{as long as it does}} not harm the consumers, especially their lives, and submissive behaviour to keep peace and harmony in life, and the tendency to avoid conflict in consumer dispute. The community will give positive response or support the consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> if their opinion and behaviour are meaningful on symbolical <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and they realise that <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right violation considered illegal, since it harms not only the consumers, but also blurs symbolical meaning of a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> since a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> means symbol, prestige, as well as certain lifestyle to the user. ...|$|R
