5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of {{the skin of a}} related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been smooth and well-provided with glands. Dimetrodon also may have had large scutes on the underside of its tail and belly, as other synapsids did.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was {{not dangerous}} {{to life on}} Earth. Even if it had headed towards lower parts of the atmosphere it would have heated so much <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> exploded high above the ground and only some small particles (meteorites) eventually might {{have made it to}} Earth's surface.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{may have}} been formed near the Scorpius-Centaurus Association. The {{collapse}} of the gas cloud {{which resulted in the}} formation of Beta Pictoris {{may have been}} triggered by the shock wave from a supernova explosion: the star which went supernova may have been a former companion of HIP 46950, which is now a runaway star. Tracing the path of HIP 46950 backwards suggests <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been {{in the vicinity of the}} Scorpius-Centaurus Association about 13 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Cooper's {{early years}} in the {{entertainment}} industry were marred with difficulties. When his role in the second season of Alias was demoted to a minuscule part, he considered quitting show business. His substance addiction, and doubts about his career, triggered thoughts of suicide. Cooper has abstained from alcohol since 2004, remarking <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> destroyed his life.|$|E
5|$|Ender's Game: Battle Room was {{a planned}} {{digitally}} distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms. It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games Undertow and Shadow Complex. Chair had sold the licensing of Empire to Card, {{which became a}} best-selling novel. Little was revealed about the game, save its setting in the Ender universe and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> focused on the Battle Room.|$|E
5|$|Nash's father Bob Senior {{collapsed}} {{and died in}} 1958 while at the MCG watching Collingwood win the 1958 VFL Grand Final. Laurie Nash later said <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been the perfect way for his father to die. Nash's brother Bob Junior died of emphysema in the early 1970s, while in 1975 Irene Nash, {{who had been in}} poor health for some time, died, leaving Nash heartbroken. Every day for five years he visited the cemetery where her remains were scattered.|$|E

5|$|On January 27, 2010, an {{official}} from the U.S. State Department said that Abdulmutallab's visa was not revoked because federal authorities believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> compromised a larger investigation. The official, Patrick F. Kennedy, said intelligence officials {{had told the}} State Department that letting Abdulmutallab keep his visa would allow for a greater chance of exposing the terrorist network.|$|E
5|$|On June 27, 1985, Wiggins {{was traded}} to the Orioles for {{pitchers}} Roy Lee Jackson and Richard Caldwell. Padres owner Joan Kroc said that the team had warned Wiggins that he would not remain with the team if he had further problems with drugs. She stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been self-serving to keep Wiggins after his relapse when he could instead pursue a fresh start with another team. Nonetheless, Gwynn felt that Wiggins had been shortchanged by the Padres.|$|E
5|$|On Wednesday, 15 March 2006, the United Nations General Assembly voted {{overwhelmingly}} {{in favour}} of establishing a new United Nations Human Rights Council, the successor to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, with the resolution receiving approval from 170 members of the 191-nation Assembly. Only the United States, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Israel voted against the Council's creation, claiming <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> too little power {{and that there were}} insufficient safeguards to prevent human rights-abusing nations from taking control.|$|E

5|$|The Klondike's {{choice of}} {{programming}} earned it a negative reputation, and Towne Cinema {{was unable to}} run the Klondike profitably. The company sought buyers for the theatre as early as 1976, asking $600,000. But, despite all of the theatre's problems under Towne Cinema, it is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been returned to its original use without the money they poured into its renovation. Their efforts to restore the building are a significant reason why the Princess is a cinema today.|$|E
5|$|When {{firing the}} same shell, the 16-inch/45 Mark 6 {{had a slight}} {{advantage}} over the 16-inch/50 Mark 7 when hitting deck armor—a shell from a 45cal gun would be slower, meaning <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a steeper trajectory as it descended. At , a shell from a 45cal would strike a ship at an angle of 45.2degrees, as opposed to 36degrees with the 50cal.|$|E
5|$|Without the cost-sharing subsidies, the {{government}} estimated that premiums would increase by 20 percent to 30 percent for silver plans. In 2017, the uncertainty {{about whether the}} payments would continue caused Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina to try to raise premiums by 22.9 percent the next year, {{as opposed to an}} increase of only 8.8 percent <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> sought if the payments were assured.|$|E

50|$|Of {{much larger}} size, the Silbervogel {{antipodal}} bomber spaceplane was planned by the Germans late in World War II, however later calculations showed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> worked, and <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been destroyed during reentry.|$|R
50|$|Given {{the weight}} of the coins, <b>it</b> is thought <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> been {{possible}} to carry the filled pot to the site: the pot <b>would</b> probably <b>have</b> been buried and the coins tipped in.|$|R
5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, thought <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been more}} {{profitable}} {{to have a}} new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio {{just a couple of months}} before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|For {{financial}} and scripting reasons the last book {{was divided into}} two films, shot back to back, which drew criticism from the series' fanbase. Radcliffe defended the split, stating <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film. He added that the last movie {{was going to be}} extremely fast-paced with a lot of action, while the first part would be far more sedate, focusing on character development; he added that, had they combined them, those things would not have made it to the final cut. Filming lasted for a year, concluding in June 2010 and {{on the last day of}} shooting, like most of the cast and crew, Radcliffe openly wept.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, Serbia {{voted to}} {{recognize}} Palestine as UNESCO's 195th member, against Israel's wishes. Belgrade declared <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> opposed a resolution recognizing Palestinian sovereignty, had one {{come before the}} UN General Assembly.|$|R

5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings {{given the number of}} buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E
5|$|Further {{armament}} was {{to consist}} of a 128mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four {{of them as a}} Flakvierling quad mount. The 128mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret {{at the rear of the}} Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 a {{paper was}} {{published}} that hypothesised {{the existence of}} a binary nucleus to fully explain the observed pattern of comet Hale–Bopp's dust emission observed in October 1995. The paper was based on theoretical analysis, and did not claim an observational detection of the proposed satellite nucleus, but estimated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> a diameter of about 30km, with the main nucleus being about 70km across, and would orbit in about three days at a distance of about 180km. This analysis was confirmed by observations in 1996 using Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope which had taken images of the comet that revealed the satellite.|$|E
50|$|During the {{run up to}} {{the first}} Sun Military Awards in 2008, The Sun {{suggested}} <b>that</b> had <b>it</b> been awarded the previous year, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone to Sadie and her handler.|$|R
