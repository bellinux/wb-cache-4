40|$|Trapping is {{a general}} {{phenomenon}} of photoelectron cloud. Photoelectron can be strongly <b>trapped</b> by <b>the</b> positron/proton beam electric field and mirror magnetic field.

The photoelectrons in drift region can be strongly <b>trapped</b> by <b>the</b> positron or proton beam electric field. There is a novel photoelectron-trapping phenomenon in the quadrupole and sextupole magnetic fields. <b>The</b> <b>trapping</b> phenomenon is strongly beam-dependent, especially on the bunch length. <b>The</b> <b>trapped</b> electron cloud can cause multi-bunch instability due to <b>the</b> long <b>trapping</b> time. <b>The</b> phenomenon and mechanism of photoelectron trapping in different magnetic and electric fields are studied. ...|$|R

5|$|After a month {{engaged in}} {{reorganisation}} and training at Sidi Azeiz, the New Zealanders re-entered {{the campaign in}} mid-December at El Agheila {{in an attempt to}} <b>trap</b> <b>the</b> Panzer Army Africa. On 11 December, the division carried out a flanking move to the south and west, led by the 6th Brigade with the 25th Battalion on the right of the advance. The move was unopposed for five days until the evening of 15 December, when a reconnaissance element that included the brigade's commander, Brigadier William Gentry, came under fire from a ridge. The 25th Battalion supported the 24th Battalion's subsequent attack on the ridge but {{it was found that the}} trap had failed, with the Germans slipping through the gap between the 5th and 6th Brigades. A second attempt to <b>trap</b> <b>the</b> Germans was made at Nofilia a few days later but this also failed when the rearguard prevented the 5th Brigade from closing the road along which the retreat was being made. The advance continued and on 23 January 1943, the 2nd New Zealand Division entered Tripoli. Shortly after reaching the city, Bonifant was given command of the New Zealand Divisional Cavalry with Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Morten taking over the 25th Battalion. Initially stationed outside of Tripoli, it moved into the city proper later in February with the rest of the 6th Brigade as part of the occupying force.|$|E
5|$|Approaching Artemisium {{towards the}} end of summer, the Persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia and lost around a third of their 1200 ships. After {{arriving}} at Artemisium, the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of Euboea in an attempt to <b>trap</b> <b>the</b> Greeks, but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked. The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however, the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.|$|E

5|$|As the US X Corps {{was pushing}} towards the reservoir, the Chinese {{formulated}} their strategy, {{based on their}} experiences in the Chinese Civil War. Working from the assumption that only a light UN presence {{would be at the}} reservoir, the Chinese 9th Corps Army was first to destroy the UN garrisons at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni, then push towards Hagaru-ri. Believing the bulk of the US X Corps would move to rescue the destroyed units, the 9th Army would then block and <b>trap</b> <b>the</b> main UN forces on the road between Hagaru-ri and Hungnam. The 9th Army initially committed eight divisions for the battle, with most of the forces concentrated at Yudami-ni and Sinhung-ni.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits.

However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended up there (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E

Nickelodeon conducted focus groups and concluded that children enjoyed watching game shows with adults, but they did not have a game show targeted at their demographic. Dee LaDuke, Robert Mittenthal, Michael Klinghoffer, and Geoffrey Darby worked to develop a new format, basing it on a combination of trivia, truth or dare, and the board game Mouse <b>Trap.</b> <b>The</b> pilot presentation was recorded in May 1986, hosted by Darby.

5|$|Most useful ATP analogs {{cannot be}} hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they <b>trap</b> <b>the</b> enzyme in a {{structure}} {{closely related to}} the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.|$|E

In Night <b>Trap,</b> <b>the</b> player takes the role of a special agent tasked to watch over teenage girls (starring Dana Plato) visiting a house which, unbeknownst to them, is full of danger. The player watches live surveillance footage of the house and triggers traps to capture anyone seen endangering the girls. The player can freely switch their view between different cameras to keep watch over the girls and eavesdrop on conversations to follow the story and listen for clues.|$|E
