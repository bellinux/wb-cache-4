500|$|Henn {{revealed}} that {{he was drawn to}} [...] "Mulan's story [...] was so unique and compelling that it just captivated me from the beginning". Animating the characters' distinct emotions using the traditional Chinese style turned out to be somewhat challenging for Henn. The animator explained, [...] "We don't create realism in the sense that if you're doing a human character, it's not going to look realistic... the balance is finding an appealing way of drawing using the visual tools <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the design to convey the believable emotions that you want to get across." [...] In addition to Mulan, Henn was also responsible for animating Fa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father. He described the complex relationship between the two characters as [...] "the emotional heart of the story". Fathering one daughter himself, Henn drew inspiration from his own emotions as well as past personal experiences while animating several intimate scenes shared by the two characters.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{included on the}} DVD release of The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959), Lee said of his friend's death: [...] "I don't want to sound gloomy, {{but at some point}} of your lives, every one of you will notice <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your life one person, one friend whom you love and care for very much. That person is so close to you that you are able to share some things only with him. For example, you can call that friend, and from the very first maniacal laugh or some other joke you will know who is {{at the other end of}} that line. We used to do that with him so often. And then when that person is gone, there will be nothing like that in your life ever again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You have managed, at any rate, to {{surprise}} me very much, your Grace," [...] I said. [...] "I am eager to receive employment of any sort. May I ask {{what it was}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> view?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only, sir, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{mentioned}} a king's name," [...] replied Rankeillor; [...] "and as {{there has never}} yet been a King Thomson, or his fame at least has never come my way, I judged you must refer to <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> baptism." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I fancy <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{never known}} {{how much you}} bore about with <b>you.</b> Your modesty <b>has</b> been so perfect <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not thought of {{yourself}} as more than other men. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> forgotten <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> your hand the disposal to some one woman of a throne in Paradise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{when that}} happens," [...] said William, [...] "why {{should we not}} have two weddings, beausire, as well as one? I hear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> Crowland a fair daughter, and marriageable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have some}} new purpose in view now," [...] {{retorted}} Mrs. Travers with spirit. [...] "But you won't {{make it clear}} to me. What is it <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your mind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Cox," [...] he said, [...] "I wish I could {{understand}} what it is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your mind. Those are not real voices that you hear; you cannot believe that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will do so," [...] Malcolm said; [...] "but in {{any case}} I am sure your wit would {{have come to the}} rescue, and <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> said <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> fact bought them from your savings; but that {{thinking}} your husband might grumble at your little economies <b>you</b> <b>had</b> thought it best to say that they came from your brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] he said. [...] "And if it be {{an insult}} {{to tell you what}} a kiss would do for me, I {{withdraw}} the word. But the feeling it would convey, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> truth given yourself to me, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were really, really my own, would I think cure me, though a dozen bullets had gone through me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he replied, [...] "is {{for her to}} decide. Personally, from {{enquiries}} I have made, I believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> encouraged <b>in</b> her <b>that</b> ridiculous superstition {{about the}} ghost of your son. I also believe <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> kept alive <b>in</b> her that spirit of unreasonable hatred which she has felt towards me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You may {{not have}} noticed, Miss Wilfer, that she has {{the same kind of}} {{interest}} in you, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> her. Just as you are attracted by her beaut--by her appearance and manner, she is attracted by yours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've paid {{a ridiculous}} fee," [...] he argued, [...] "and all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> return is the fellow's promise {{to see you}} through. It isn't like you to part with money so easily, Richard. Did he hypnotise you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Granted, even, {{that the}} man is as {{dangerous}} as you say," [...] he remarked, [...] "it is certainly creating a new precedent for you to bring him into the bosom of your family. Is it conversion, bribery, or poison <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your thoughts?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{the way you}} did feel? Well, it {{was very}} simple. <b>You</b> said <b>you</b> <b>had</b> had from your {{earliest}} time, as the deepest thing within you, the sense of being kept for something rare and strange, possibly prodigious and terrible, that was sooner or later to happen to <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> your bones the foreboding and the conviction of, and that would perhaps overwhelm you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is evidently {{come up to}} Jerusalem to see {{the festival}} {{like the rest of}} us: and on that account is {{probably}} living not so very far away. He had the same hankering for the university <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> a milder form. I don't think he saw me, though he must <b>have</b> heard <b>you</b> speaking to the crowd. But he seemed not to notice." ...|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. Besides, you shouldn't {{cut your}} old friends now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> risen <b>in</b> the world. That's {{what we call}} snobbery.|$|R
6000|$|... "It 's {{no matter}} what he has--six {{thousand}} a year is n't much! And we don't do things in that way in our country. We have n't those horrid match-making arrangements <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your dreadful country. American mothers are not like English mothers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I understand, then," [...] said Lord Marney to his brother, as on {{the evening}} of the same day they were seated {{together}} in the drawing-room, in close converse [...] "I understand then, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> fact paid nothing, and that my mother will give you a thousand pounds. That won't go very far." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We cannot spare {{him quite}} so soon," [...] he declared. [...] "We must avail {{ourselves}} of this wonderful chance afforded us by my brilliant young nephew. We must keep him {{with us for}} a little time. What is it <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your hands, Doctor? Telegrams, I think. Let me look at them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thirteen years! Thir-teen years! Many Lodgers {{have come}} and gone, in the {{thirteen}} years <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lived <b>in</b> the parlours Major." ...|$|R
6000|$|Their interlocutor's {{reply was}} not too rapid to {{anticipate}} Mrs. Brook herself. [...] "My dear Jane, that only proves his having reached some extravagance {{in the other sense}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mere decency to match. The truth is probably in the 'mean'--isn't that what they call it?--between you. Don't YOU now take him away," [...] she went on to Vanderbank, who had glanced about for some better accommodation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{world was}} never conquered by intrigue: it was conquered by faith. Now, I {{do not see}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> faith <b>in</b> anything.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{will come}} round directly, young lady. Pour a spoonful {{or two from}} this glass between her lips. It is {{stronger}} than <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your hand. She has had a terrible shock, {{but as soon as}} she hears that your father is alive, it will do more for her than all our services." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> {{the whole}} series this much given {{you to think}} of: first, the law of St. Francis's conscience; then, his own {{adoption}} of it; then, the ratification of it by the Christian Church; then, his preaching it in life; then, his preaching it in death; and then, the fruits of it in his disciples.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{will be your}} state-room," [...] {{the captain}} said, opening a door. [...] "I have the one aft, and the first mate has the one {{opposite}} to you. The others are empty, so you can stow any baggage <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> one of them; {{the second and third}} officers and the apprentices are in the deck-house cabins." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "At long last, {{we have a}} {{dictionary}} for Bengali. The concise grammar for Bengali <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> included <b>in</b> the appendix is also wonderful." ...|$|R
6000|$|CONFUCIUS. It {{does not}} matter. I understand. [To the Archbishop] Am I to assume <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lived <b>in</b> your ancestors, or by metempsychosis-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is known}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> letters <b>in</b> your {{possession}} from escaped traitors now in England, to La Noue, Duplessis Mornay, and other heretics.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me for venturing to interfere," [...] he said [...] "There is {{a serious}} reason for what I have done, which I will explain to you at a fitter time. In the {{meanwhile}} I offer no further obstruction to the course which you propose taking. On the contrary, I have just assisted you in gaining the end <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> view." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear cousin," [...] I said, [...] "I {{know all}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> your mind. I admit--I covet her. You can't make me more jealous than I am. She's clean and sweet--it is marvellous how the God {{of the rest}} of the world can have made a thing so brave and honest and wonderful. She's better than flowers. But I think I'm going away to-night, nevertheless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{at such a}} {{time the}} family ought to come together. Of course they will take it very much amiss if you refuse. What will Lady Wharton think if you refuse after her writing such a letter as that? It is my duty to tell you that you ought to go. You cannot think that it is right to throw over every friend <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never heard}} that story before, cousin Forester," [...] said Marco. [...] "And I did not know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> stories <b>in</b> your pocket-book." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think you'll {{find that}} they will console Mr. Finn with {{something}} less gorgeous than <b>that.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> succeeded <b>in</b> seeing him, of course?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bravo, sir, bravo! I {{shall not}} fail to mention the service <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{rendered}} <b>in</b> my report of the affair. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> lost any men?" ...|$|R
