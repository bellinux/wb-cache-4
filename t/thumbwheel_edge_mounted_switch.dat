40|$|Abstract: A tunable {{electrically}} small PIFA-as-a-package antenna for miniature {{wireless device}} applications {{has been developed}} using conventional printed circuit board processing techniques and commercial-off-the-shelf surface <b>mount</b> <b>switches.</b> The design is scalable to any frequency and form factor, while enabling adaptive tuning of the characteristically narrow band resonance of electrically small antennas. Our UHF prototype measures less than 2 ” (. 08 λ) on its longest side and provides approximately- 9 dBi of gain from 419 - 472 MHz.
