5|$|Because of {{high demand}} and limited {{availability}} of <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> tickets, some people planned {{to offer their}} tickets for sale through ticket brokers, Internet auctions and classified listing services. Sales offers for tickets reached as high as $1,750 each for <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> standing room section behind the Capitol Reflecting Pool, $5,500 each for <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> standing room section {{in front of the}} Reflecting Pool and $20,000 each for the VIP section on the Capitol grounds. In one case, a former legislative aide to Representative Ted Poe was exposed by a prospective buyer after the former aide used Craigslist and e‑mail to offer five tickets to the buyer for $4,500.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{branches}} {{of political parties}} on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> seats. Hamas gained {{the majority of the}} open seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.|$|E
5|$|To {{prepare for}} the move to Triple-A, renovations {{continued}} prior to the 1985 season {{with the addition of}} 1,200box seats, which replaced some of <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> grandstand seating, as well as more seating past the right field foul pole. A 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3.0m) high replaced the stadium's original, which was relocated to far left field to serve as an out-of-town scoreboard, providing scores for American League, National League, and American Association baseball games.|$|E
50|$|The Skyhook {{system is}} {{engineered}} {{so that it}} should not interfere with reserve deployment activated by directly pulling <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> rip cord in situations where no main parachute had been deployed. The key component in the system, from which the Skyhook derives its name, is a cantilevered hook that grasps <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> bridle about midway between <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> pilot chute and the bag containing <b>the</b> packed <b>reserve</b> chute. If <b>the</b> departing main parachute applies more pull force on the bridle than <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> pilot chute, then the main parachute will remain hooked onto <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> bridle, and so it will pull <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> parachute out of <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> compartment. If <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> pilot chute exerts more pull force on the bridle than the main parachute, then the main parachute will unhook and <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> pilot chute will deploy <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> parachute normally.|$|R

5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. Vehicular traffic is banned in <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> areas. Taking {{samples from the}} lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E
5|$|Arp and Janco {{drifted away}} from the {{movement}} ca. 1919, when they created the Constructivist-inspired workshop Das Neue Leben. In Romania, Dada was awarded an ambiguous reception from Tzara's former associate Vinea. Although he was sympathetic to its goals, treasured Hugo Ball and Hennings and promised to adapt his own writings to its requirements, Vinea cautioned Tzara and the Jancos in favor of lucidity. When Vinea submitted his poem Doleanțe ("Grievances") {{to be published by}} Tzara and his associates, he was turned down, an incident which critics attribute to a contrast between <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> tone of the piece and the revolutionary tenets of Dada.|$|E
5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> seating along the first base line in right field. A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.|$|E
50|$|True and sparse forests occupy 16 {{per cent}} of <b>the</b> <b>reserve,</b> open grasslands 20 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and rock-dwelling xerophylous {{communities}} cover 64 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> <b>The</b> flora of <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> numbers 1849 species from 588 genera and 207 families. The rich flora are {{a mixture of}} endemic, rare and endangered species. Over 80 flora species found in <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> are in <b>the</b> Red Data Book of Armenia of 1990 while 24 Armenian endemic plants are found in <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} other major rivers in <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> <b>The</b> Tjulån River {{originates}} at the Tjulträsk lakes and joins the Vindel River in Ammarnäs. The Juktån River passes the great lake Överst Juktan and continues outside <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> to Ume River {{for a total}} length of 170 km. Finally the Tärnaån River originates at Lake Tärnasjön before joining into the Ume River just outside <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> <b>The</b> Ume River itself is located outside <b>the</b> <b>reserve,</b> between <b>the</b> Artfjället mountain ranges {{and the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and unlike <b>the</b> rivers within <b>the</b> <b>reserve,</b> its waters have been regulated and used for hydroelectric power.|$|R
50|$|At present several {{villages are}} located inside <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and many rural {{communities}} near <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> In 1985 {{a number of}} agricultural lands were taken from their owners to be incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and land grants were compensated elsewhere. Now 40 households use 20 hectares of ranges inside <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and to an extent overlap between <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> and land-use boundaries allows locals to violate the legal protection of <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> An example of this, is the Gorovan Sands Sanctuary which near <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> {{is known to be}} Armenia's only protected true desert reserve has been exploited from sand mining and livestock grazing.|$|R
5|$|From February through mid-summer 1984, major renovations and {{additions}} {{were made}} to the stadium. A full-service restaurant, The Hall of Fame Stadium Club, and a mini-roof, to cover the last five rows of <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> seating section and the main concourse, were built. A new press box included accommodations for members of the media, 2separate booths for home and visiting radio broadcasts, and 2separate booths for home and visiting television broadcasts. Ten sky boxes were built adjacent the press box; by 1989, the number of sky boxes had increased to 18.|$|E
5|$|The Presidential Inaugural Committee {{and members}} of the 111th U.S.Congress {{distributed}} invitations and color-coded tickets to both dignitaries and ordinary citizens for <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> sections on or near the U.S.Capitol grounds to view the swearing-in ceremony. Invitations and tickets were sent to ambassadors and chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and their spouses, but not to other representatives of foreign countries, and invitations were distributed to U.S.politicians and an array of dignitaries across the spectrum of business and industry. House and Senate congressional members distributed free tickets for the inaugural ceremony to the public by lottery or on a first‑come, first served basis because of overwhelming requests to attend the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts and}} tribunals were {{initially}} housed in a building in Birgu. After the Order moved their headquarters to Valletta, a new Castellania {{was built in the}} new capital. Meanwhile, the original Castellania in Birgu was converted into the Inquisitor's Palace in 1574. The building of a Castellania was made in the original plans of Valletta. One of the plans for the Castellania was also to be built within <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> area of the auberges of the knights, known as the Collacchio, but limiting access to a vast area in Valletta was found to be unpractical and the initiative was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} major rivers in <b>the</b> <b>reserve,</b> <b>the</b> Lircay {{that is a}} {{tributary}} of the Claro River, the Claro that flows north to south through <b>the</b> <b>reserve,</b> and <b>the</b> Blanquillo that joins the latter river in <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} quarter of 2008, rural {{schoolchildren}} in the largest villages adjoining <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> were involved in an awareness-raising program about <b>the</b> <b>reserve.</b> Among <b>the</b> programs was the campaign on leopard conservation as <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> is one of the 'hotspots' for the Persian leopard. On 9 September 2008 the Visitor Centre in the Garni district of <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> was opened for the visiting public and tourists to educate visitors and bring awareness about <b>the</b> <b>reserve</b> on its natural and human history.

5|$|The {{story begins}} {{in the spring of}} 1194 in the English county of Nottinghamshire. Lady Marian FitzWalter attends a festival held at Huntington Castle by the Earl of Huntington, who wishes to honour the return of his only {{surviving}} heir, Lord Robert of Locksley, from the Crusades. Marian seeks an audience with Robert to learn the manner of her father, Sir Hugh's, death the previous year, as Robert was a witness. <b>The</b> <b>reserved,</b> mentally scarred Robert reacts strongly, having flashbacks to Sir Hugh's violent murder at the hands of Saracens. He informs her that Hugh wished for Marian to marry William DeLacey, the harsh and scheming Sheriff of Nottingham, to her dismay. DeLacey knows naught of this, but intends to make her marry him anyway.|$|E

5|$|United States v. Washington, 384 F.Supp. 312 (W.D. Wash. 1974), aff'd, 520 F.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1975), {{commonly}} known as the Boldt Decision (from the name of the trial court judge, George Hugo Boldt), was a 1974 case heard in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. It reaffirmed <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> right of American Indian tribes in the State of Washington to act alongside the state as co-managers of salmon and other fish, and to continue harvesting them in accordance with the various treaties that the United States had signed with the tribes. The tribes of Washington had ceded their land to the United States but had reserved the right to fish as they had always done, including fishing at their traditional locations that were off the designated reservations.|$|E

5|$|Within the year, Edward {{caused a}} {{constitutional}} crisis by announcing {{his desire to}} marry his twice-divorced American mistress, Wallis Simpson. Mary disapproved of divorce, which was against {{the teaching of the}} Anglican church, and thought Simpson wholly unsuitable to be the wife of a king. After receiving advice from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Stanley Baldwin, as well as the Dominion governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward abdicated. Though loyal and supportive of her son, Mary could not comprehend why Edward would neglect his royal duties in favour of his personal feelings. Simpson had been presented formally to both King George V and Queen Mary at court, but Mary later refused to meet her either in public or privately. She saw it as her duty to provide moral support for her second son, <b>the</b> <b>reserved</b> and stammering Prince Albert, Duke of York, who ascended the throne on Edward's abdication, taking the name George VI. When Mary attended the coronation, she became the first British dowager queen to do so. Edward's abdication did not lessen her love for him, but she never wavered in her disapproval of his actions.|$|E
