It is shown that the columnar nanocrystals with hexagonal faceting exhibit the lowest <b>threshold</b> power <b>of</b> optical excitation for the diameters of the nanocavities are 100 - 200 nm, comparable to the absorption length for the excitation light. Different mechanisms of lasing are established for nanocrystals shaped as prisms and pyramids with a hexagonal base. Variations in the decay times and lasing thresholds can be attributed to different local densities of photon states in regularly shaped nanocrystals...|$|R

These techniques have been employed to directly measure absorption and luminescence specific to the local Si nanocrystal core. Profound changes occur in the absorption spectrum of the nanocrystals compared with bulk Si, and new features are observed in the nanocrystal RIXS. Clear signatures of core and valence band exciton formation, promoted by the spatial confinement of electrons and holes within the nanocrystals, are observed, together with band narrowing due to quantum confinement. XEOL at 12 K shows an extremely sharp feature at the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> orange <b>luminescence</b> (i. e., at ~ 1. 56 eV (792 nm)) which we attribute to recombination of valence excitons, providing a lower limit to the nanocrystal band gap...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{stimulation}} of bioluminescence in the dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra is described. With this technique, in which cells flow through a capillary coil, {{it is possible}} to graduate the intensity of the stimulus by varying the flow rate. In continuous darkness, the threshold stimulus for cells {{in the middle of the}} day phase is greater than that for cells in the middle of the night phase. Some evidence suggests heterogeneity of sensitivity to stimulation among either cells or individual luminescent sources within a cell. At stimulus intensities much above <b>threshold,</b> the <b>luminescence</b> <b>of</b> both day- and night-phase cells is proportional to the number of cells within the capillary coil. Night-phase cells emit about 14 times as much light as do day-phase cells in continuous darkness...|$|R

40|$|Time-resolved optical {{stimulation}} <b>of</b> <b>luminescence</b> {{has become}} {{established as a}} key method for measurement <b>of</b> optically stimulated <b>luminescence</b> from quartz, feldspar and α-Al 2 O 3 :C, all materials of interest in dosimetry. The aim of time-resolved optical stimulation is to separate in time the stimulation and emission <b>of</b> <b>luminescence.</b> The luminescence is stimulated from a sample using a brief light pulse and the emission monitored during stimulation {{in the presence of}} scattered stimulating light or after pulsing, over photomultiplier noise only. Although the use of the method in retrospective dosimetry has been somewhat limited, the technique has been successfully applied to study mechanisms in the processes leading up to luminescence emission. The main means for this has been the temperature dependence <b>of</b> the <b>luminescence</b> intensity as well as the luminescence lifetimes determined from time-resolved luminescence spectra. In this paper we review some key developments in theory and applications to quartz including methods of evaluating lifetimes, techniques of evaluating kinetic parameters using both the dependence <b>of</b> <b>luminescence</b> intensity and lifetime on measurement temperature, and of lifetimes on annealing temperature. We then provide an overview of some notable applications such as separation of quartz signals from a quartz-feldspar admixture and the utility of the dynamic throughput, a measure <b>of</b> <b>luminescence</b> measured {{as a function of the}} pulse width.

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>luminescence</b> <b>of</b> {{the marine}} dinoflagellate Gonyaulax polyedra shows an {{endogenous}} diurnal rhythm. The effect of light during the phase <b>of</b> low <b>luminescence</b> capacity may be observed as an enhancement <b>of</b> <b>luminescence</b> during the subsequent bright phase. During the bright phase, however, illumination diminishes {{the capacity for}} luminescence. The action spectra for these two effects of light have been determined, and the major pigments of Gonyaulax have been examined. A consideration of the action spectrum and the pigment complement of Gonyaulax suggests that photosynthesis during the day is responsible, directly or indirectly, for the enhancement <b>of</b> <b>luminescence</b> during the following night. Photoinhibition <b>of</b> <b>luminescence</b> is in part attributable to light absorbed by the photosynthetic pigments. However, activity observed in the far red region of the spectrum beyond the absorption maximum of chlorophyll a suggests that an additional pigment, present in small amounts, may also act as sensitizer for photoinhibition...|$|R
