Only at the highest concentration of microparticles (1 mg/mL) less than 90 % cell viability was seen in DX loaded sodium alginate microparticles (DXSA, 87. 2 %), starch microparticles (DXST, 85. 1 %) and carbopol microparticles (DXCP, 82. 7 %) preparations after 48 h of exposure to alveolar cells. The results clearly indicate that sodium carboxymethyl cellulose-based microparticles may serve as an ideal carrier for inhalation delivery of doxycycline hyclate...|$|R
40|$|Spray drying is an {{important}} method used by the food industry {{in the production of}} microencapsulated flavors to improve handling and dispersion properties. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of the process conditions on the properties of rosemary essential oil microencapsulated by spray drying using gum Arabic as encapsulant. The effects of the wall material concentration (10 - 30 %), inlet air temperature (135 - 195 ºC), and feed flow rate (0. 5 - 1. 0 L. h- 1) on the moisture content, hygroscopicity, wettability, solubility, bulk and <b>tapped</b> <b>densities,</b> particle density, flowability, and cohesiveness were evaluated using a 2 ³ central composite rotational experimental design. Moisture content, hygroscopicity and wettability were significantly affected by the three factors analyzed. Bulk density was positively influenced by the wall material concentration and negatively by the inlet air temperature. Particle density was influenced by the wall material concentration and the inlet air temperature variables, both in a negative manner. As for the solubility, <b>tapped</b> <b>density,</b> flowability, and cohesiveness, the models did not fit the data well. The results indicated that moderate wall material concentration (24 %), low inlet air temperature (135 ºC), and moderate feed flow rate (0. 7 L. h- 1) are the best spray drying conditions...|$|R
