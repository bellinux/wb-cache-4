5|$|DuMont {{survived the}} early 1950s {{only because of}} WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone {{commercial}} VHF station {{in what was then}} the sixth-largest market. WDTV's only competition came from UHF stations and distant stations from Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Wheeling, West Virginia. No other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a bargaining chip <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>its</b> programs cleared in other large markets.|$|E

5|$|DuMont {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>its</b> programs {{aired in}} many parts of the country, in part due to technical limitations of network lines maintained by the telephone company AT Corporation. During the 1940s and 1950s, television signals were sent between stations via coaxial cable and microwave links which were owned by AT The service provider did not have enough cable lines and microwave circuits to provide signal relay service from all four networks to all of their affiliates at the same time, so AT allocated times when each network could offer live programs to their affiliates. In 1950, AT allotted NBC and CBS each over 100 hours of live prime time network service, but gave ABC only 53 hours, and DuMont just 37. AT also required each television network to lease both radio and television lines. DuMont was the only television network without a radio network, but was forced to pay for a service it did not use. DuMont protested AT's actions with the Federal Communications Commission, and eventually received a compromise.|$|E
