50|$|Most of {{the species}} are poorly known, but the highfin <b>tadpole</b> <b>fish</b> (Guentherus altivelis) is of {{potential}} interest for commercial fishing.|$|E
50|$|The tadpole cod is {{distinct}} from the <b>tadpole</b> <b>fish,</b> Raniceps raninus. This fish was formerly classified in the family Ranicipitidae, called the tadpole cods, as its sole member. The family {{was placed in a}} different order of fish, the Ophidiiformes (cusk-eels and brotulas). However, it is now regarded {{as a member of the}} same family as cods, Gadidae.|$|E
50|$|It {{feeds on}} frogs, frog eggs, <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish,</b> small birds and lizards.|$|R

25|$|They {{have been}} seen eating <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish,</b> aquatic insects, crayfish, frogs, small mice and birds, and even French fries. There are two {{recognized}} subspecies, the Northern smallmouth bass (M. dolomieui dolomieui) and the Neosho smallmouth bass (M. dolomieui velox).|$|R
50|$|Raniceps raninus, the <b>tadpole</b> <b>fish,</b> is {{a species}} of Gadidae fish native to the {{northeast}} Atlantic Ocean around the coasts of France, Ireland, and the United Kingdom and the North Sea. This species grows to a total length of 27.5 cm. It is of no importance to the commercial fishery industry, though {{it can be found}} in the aquarium trade and is displayed in public aquaria.|$|E
50|$|GuernseySt Peter Port Breakwater - (Location of 8 Bailiwick Records (Angler Fish, Couchs Sea Bream, Lesser Spotted Dogfish, Flounder, Smooth Hound, <b>Tadpole</b> <b>Fish,</b> Whiting and Ballan Wrasse)). As {{the records}} show, the St Peter Port {{breakwater}} is good fishing for many species. Located just passed Castle Cornet {{in the town}} of St Peter Port. The breakwater is a light house {{on the end of a}} pier. It offers easy access and safe fishing although it can be a very busy site due to this facts.|$|E
5000|$|The jellynose <b>fishes</b> or <b>tadpole</b> <b>fishes</b> are {{the small}} order Ateleopodiformes. This group of ray-finned fish is monotypic, {{containing}} a single family Ateleopodidae. It has {{about a dozen}} species in four genera, but these enigmatic fishes {{are in need of}} taxonomic revision.|$|R
50|$|The olive keelback feeds {{mainly on}} frogs, <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish</b> and crabs which it catches with a side-stroke motion that is {{characteristic}} of watersnakes. The snake swims past the prey and suddenly snaps its head to the side. The olive keelback is also known to eat mosquito larvae (Whitaker).|$|R
50|$|It preys on shrimps, frogs (including <b>tadpoles),</b> and <b>fish.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the wild, the {{juvenile}} turtles eat the following: <b>tadpoles,</b> crustaceans, <b>fish,</b> insects and insect larvae.|$|R
50|$|Larvae are predators but tend to sit {{and wait}} for their food to come to them. Usually they feed on small {{invertebrates}} and some small vertebrates. This can include <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish,</b> and other salamanders. Adults usually feed on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates. They will eat things as large as shrews, mice, and small snakes, along with other salamanders. They will eat anything that they can catch.|$|R
25|$|Keelbacks are oviparous. Mating {{is thought}} to take place during the {{aestivation}} period. Gravid females have been found from April to August and eggs are laid in underground holes from May to September. The snake lays a clutch of 5 to 10 pure white eggs. Females remain with eggs till they hatch. The young snakes are 13 to 17cm at birth and eat small frogs, <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish,</b> earthworms and insects.|$|R
50|$|The Queensland {{lungfish}} {{is primarily}} nocturnal, and is essentially carnivorous. In captivity, it will feed on frogs, earthworms, pieces of meat, and pelleted food. In the wild, its prey includes frogs, <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fishes,</b> {{a variety of}} invertebrates, and plant material. No quantitative dietary data are available, but anecdotal observations clearly indicate the diet of the lungfish changes with development. This is proven to be correlated with a change in dentition.|$|R

50|$|P. ibericum is an omnivore, eating detritus, {{filamentous}} {{algae and}} plant matter, {{as well as}} a variety of animals, including worms, amphipod crustaceans, aquatic insect larvae, molluscs, frogs and <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish</b> and carrion. It feeds on land during the night and, if the air is humid enough, also during the day. In the areas where it occurs, P. ibericum is a major food item for the European otter, Lutra lutra, alongside a variety of fish species.|$|R
50|$|The African {{pied wagtail}} is mainly insectivorous but also feeds on other invertebrates, grass seeds, <b>tadpoles,</b> small <b>fish</b> and scraps of human food.|$|R
25|$|When Morgan {{returned}} to Bryn Mawr in 1895, {{he was promoted}} to full professor. Morgan's main lines of experimental work involved regeneration and larval development; in each case, his goal was to distinguish internal and external causes to shed light on the Roux-Driesch debate. He wrote his first book, The Development of the Frog's Egg (1897). He began a series of studies on different organisms' ability to regenerate. He looked at grafting and regeneration in <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish</b> and earthworms; in 1901 he published his research as Regeneration.|$|R
50|$|By 1919, T.G. Ni had {{received}} his M.S. and worked towards his doctorate degree with Professor Warren P. Lombard. He {{was also a}} member of the Cosmopolitan Club and Chinese Student Club. T.G. Ni's graduate studies at the University of Michigan Medical School lasted until 1922, when he was awarded a degree of Doctor of Science. His doctoral dissertation, The Active Response of Capillaries of Frogs, <b>Tadpoles,</b> <b>Fish,</b> Bats and Men to Various Forms of Excitation, was published in the American Journal of Physiology that same year.|$|R
50|$|Mating {{takes place}} in the water. Suitable {{terrestrial}} area is required for egg-laying by nesting females, who will normally lay 6-10 eggs at a time, with larger females capable of bearing more. The eggs incubate for 2-3 months and the hatchlings will usually stay with the nest through winter. Hatchlings are almost entirely carnivorous, feeding on insects, spiders, crustaceans, <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish,</b> and carrion. As they age, adults eat less and less meat, and up to 95% of their nutritional intake eventually comes from plants.|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} fragmentary reports {{suggest that the}} {{endangered}} diving beetle Cybister japonicus larvae feed on <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish,</b> and aquatic insects. However, no quantitative study on the feeding habits of C. japonicus larvae has been reported. In this study, field observations and rearing experiments were carried out to show the feeding ecology of C. japonicus larvae. Unlike previous commentaries, the first- and second-instar larvae of C. japonicus preyed on insects, mainly Odonata nymphs and Notonecta triguttata, irrespective of prey availability, but did not eat vertebrates such as <b>tadpoles</b> and <b>fish</b> in the field. On the contrary, the third-instar larvae fed on both insects and vertebrates. Rearing experiments showed {{that the number of}} Odonata nymphs consumed was significantly more than the number of tadpoles consumed by the first and second instars but third-instar larvae ate both the Odonata nymphs and tadpoles in the tadpole-Odonata nymph mixture experiment. The total body lengths of C. japonicus new adults in the Odonata nymph and tadpole-Odonata nymph mixture treatments were statistically equal. These results suggested that the first- and second-instar larvae of C. japonicus prey mainly on insects and do not eat vertebrate animals (insectivore), whereas the third-instar larvae fed on both insects and vertebrates (generalist) ...|$|R
50|$|The Arizona {{mud turtle}} can {{be located in}} the Lower Colorado River Lower Colorado River Sonoran Desertscrub,Arizona Upland Sonoran Desertscrub, and Semidesert Grassland communities. The Arizona mud turtle’s {{activity}} occurs during the day. It also is active at night but specifically in July and August in monsoon season. Because it is warm during this period, they tend to {{spend most of their time}} in the water, hence why they are known as semi aquatic. During the winter months, they hibernate in an underground burrow. Their diet consists of toads, <b>tadpoles,</b> <b>fish,</b> invertebrates and carrion. The Arizona mud turtle lays one to seven eggs and mates primarily in the summer.Female turtles tend to grow between 12 and 13 cm and have life span from 6 to 10 years age.|$|R
5000|$|The eastern long-necked turtle is carnivorous, {{eating a}} variety of animals. This {{includes}} insects, worms, <b>tadpoles,</b> frogs, small <b>fish,</b> crustaceans, and molluscs.|$|R
