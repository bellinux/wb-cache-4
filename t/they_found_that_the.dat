5|$|Mayfly {{phylogeny}} {{was further}} studied using morphological and molecular analyses by Ogden {{and others in}} 2009. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Asian genus Siphluriscus was sister to all other mayflies. Some existing lineages such as Ephemeroidea, and families such as Ameletopsidae, were found not to be monophyletic, through convergence among nymphal features.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 {{paper for}} the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, authors Anna Eaglin and Shaowen Bardzell {{discussed}} the Magic Wand {{within the context}} of devices used in sexual behavior that were not originally created for that purpose. A 2012 study published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy evaluated seven vibrators for use with clinical therapy for sexual stimulation. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Magic Wand displayed a high degree of movement and oscillation. The researchers suggested that their data could be used by therapists to select the optimum vibrator which could deliver both effectiveness and sensitivity for their clients.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{also found}} that the deicing {{procedures}} at LaGuardia were substandard. While the jet encountered a delay of up to 35 minutes, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deicing fluid that was being used at the airport, and by the majority of commercial airlines across the United States, was effective for only fifteen minutes. The accident led to a number of studies into the effect that ice has on aircraft, and several recommendations into prevention techniques.|$|E

5|$|The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having been created in 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. In the months following the spill, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> in-line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also withheld in-line inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} first {{revealed}} by Atari at the Games Convention 2008. The game was poorly received after its release; video game critics gave it an aggregated score of 49% at Metacritic.

5|$|In early 1934, Szilard {{began working}} at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Working {{with a young}} {{physicist}} on the hospital staff, Thomas A. Chalmers, he began studying radioactive isotopes for medical purposes. It was known that bombarding elements with neutrons could produce either heavier isotopes of an element, or a heavier element, a phenomenon known as the Fermi Effect after its discoverer, the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi. When they bombarded ethyl iodide with neutrons produced by a radon-beryllium source, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> heavier radioactive isotopes of iodine separated from the compound. Thus, they had discovered a means of isotope separation. This method {{became known as the}} Szilard–Chalmers effect, and was widely used in the preparation of medical isotopes. He also attempted unsuccessfully to create a nuclear chain reaction using beryllium by bombarding it with X-rays. In 1936, Szilard assigned his chain-reaction patent to the British Admiralty to ensure its secrecy.|$|E

5|$|On August14, roughly 24hours after degenerating into {{a remnant}} low, {{convection}} began to redevelop over the system. Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance plane deployed dropsondes into the system. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> system was regenerating and shortly after, the NHC began re-issuing advisories on the depression {{when it was}} located roughly 1,075mi (1,735km) east of the Leeward Islands. The depression continued to track westward {{in response to an}} upper-level high over the north Atlantic. Early on August15, the NHC upgraded the depression to a tropical storm, giving it the name Ana as deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, wind shear caused convection to become displaced from the circulation, exposing the center of Ana again.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1835, a {{detachment}} of 100 dragoons, led by Francisco de Castañeda, left San Antonio de Béxar, carrying an official order for Ponton to surrender the cannon. Castañeda had {{been instructed to}} avoid using force if possible. When the troops neared Gonzales on September 29, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> settlers had removed the ferry and all other boats from the Guadalupe River. On {{the other side of}} the swiftly moving river waited eighteen Texians. Albert Martin, captain of the Gonzales militia, informed the soldiers that Ponton was out of town, and until his return the army must remain on the west side of the river.|$|E
5|$|Only {{three people}} were {{involved}} in the production of Daicon III, Hideaki Anno, Hiroyuki Yamaga and Takami Akai. Takeda, who {{was a part of the}} group, explains in Notenki Memoirs that Anno knew how to make anime, but he never worked with animation cels. They were referred to Animepolis Pero, an anime hobby store chain, but <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cost of the cels were too expensive, so a single cel was purchased and taken to a vinyl manufacturer in east Osaka, where they purchased a roll for 2000 yen. After cutting and preparing the vinyl cels, they discovered that the painted cels would stick together when stacked and dry paint would peel off the cels. To keep costs low, they made their own tap to punch holes in the B5 animation paper used in the production.|$|E

5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may not predict communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after this}} incident, {{the family moved}} from the Ardennes to Brussels after a message from their father that the {{financial}} problems had ended. When they reached Brussels <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> situation was actually worse than previously, and the family moved between cheap hotels, each one worse than the one before. Desperate for a job, Hastings accepted the offer of an apprenticeship with an English engineer {{who claimed to have}} made a machine to extract gold in North Wales.

5|$|Szilárd {{teamed up}} with Fermi {{to build a nuclear}} reactor from natural uranium at Columbia University, where they were {{fortunate}} in having a sympathetic head of the physics department in George B. Pegram. At the time there was disagreement about whether it was uranium-235, which made up less than 1% of natural uranium, or the more abundant uranium-238 isotope, as Fermi maintained, that was primarily responsible for fission. Fermi and Szilárd conducted a series of experiments, and concluded that a chain reaction in natural uranium could be possible if they could find a suitable neutron moderator. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hydrogen atoms in water slowed neutrons, but tended to capture them. Szilárd then suggested using carbon as a moderator. They now needed large quantities of carbon and uranium to create a reactor. Szilárd was convinced that they would succeed if only they could get the materials.|$|E
30|$|Surfactants and {{polymers}} {{are used}} extensively in enhanced oil recovery to recover more oil from sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Son et al. (2013) used nanoparticles to stabilize oil/water emulsions for enhanced oil recovery. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stabilized emulsion by nanoparticles yielded 11  % oil recovery after seawater flooding. The recovery increase {{was attributed to}} the piston-like displacement achieved by the high-viscosity emulsion. Fu et al. (2013) used novel cationic starch polymer for enhanced oil recovery. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cationic starch enhanced the oil recovery and reduced the water cut and yielded better results than other commercial polymers used in the enhanced oil recovery processes.|$|R

5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-33 {{like all}} other state trunkline highways in the state. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks traffic volumes using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This figure is a calculation of the traffic along a roadway segment for any average day of the year. In MDOT's surveys in 2009, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> peak AADT along M-33 was the 6,928vehicles a day along {{a section of the}} M-72 concurrency. The lowest traffic counts were measured immediately south of the Onaway city limits at 956vehicles daily. The only section of M-33 that has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) is the segment concurrent with M-32 in Montmorency County. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The Terra Nova Expedition, officially the British Antarctic Expedition, was an {{expedition}} to Antarctica which took place between 1910 and 1913. It was led by Robert Falcon Scott and had various scientific and geographical objectives. Scott wished to continue the scientific work that he had begun when leading the Discovery Expedition to the Antarctic in 1901–04. He also {{wanted to be the}} first to reach the geographic South Pole. He and four companions attained the pole on 17 January 1912, where <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen had preceded them by 34 days. Scott's entire party died on the return journey from the pole; some of their bodies, journals, and photographs were found by a search party eight months later.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} a {{financial}} {{success for the}} NZRFU. The NZRFU had asked for a £500 financial guarantee from the SRU for the game, but because of their poor finances, the SRU offered instead to give the entire gate (minus expenses). Due to a big attendance, the NZRFU received a fee of over £1700 for the game. Although the SRU were very happy with this (they offered the same terms to the Springboks when they toured in 1906), there were also concerns about the three shillings a day each All Black received whilst on tour. After <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rugby Football Union had approved the payments, a Calcutta Cup match was cancelled.|$|E
40|$|Electrical synapses and {{synchrony}} {{are nearly}} synonymous. In {{this issue of}} Neuron, Vervaeke et al. broaden this longstanding association. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> Golgi cell network of the cerebellum, electrical synapses synchronize resting activity, and cause surround inhibition and desynchronization in response to excitatory input...|$|R
30|$|From {{their results}} in Table  7, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> raising <b>the</b> {{hydrocarbon}} partial pressure increased {{the amount of}} dry gas and coke {{at the expense of}} gasoline. They attributed the higher coke yield to a higher rate of oligomerization, which is a bimolecular reaction and favored at high pressure. <b>They</b> also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> increasing <b>the</b> hydrocarbon partial pressure substantially lowered the C 3 and C 4 olefinicities leading to a decrease in the yield of propylene and butylene. These yield shifts suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rate of hydrogen transfer increases with hydrocarbon partial pressure, as would be expected for a bimolecular reaction [26, 49].|$|R

5|$|The {{sight of}} the burning wrecks in the night once again spread panic {{throughout}} the French fleet, the grounded ships opening a heavy fire on the scuttled ships in the assumption that they were fireships. Captain Lacaille of Tourville was so unnerved that he immediately ordered his crew to abandon ship {{and set it on}} fire. The evacuation was so hasty however that the fires did not spread effectively, and the following morning the ship was found to still be intact, the crew returning to their prematurely abandoned vessel. There <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ship's quartermaster Eugéne-Joseph-Romain Bourgeois had remained aboard, unconvinced by Lacaille's order, and had single-handedly driven off an attempt by a British boat to board and capture the ship. During the night about 30 sailors had joined him, keeping Touville in French hands until dawn came {{and the rest of the}} crew returned.|$|E
5|$|The terrain in {{this part}} of the bay offered {{significant}} advantage to defending forces, lined as it was with numerous creeks which slowed movement and obscured firing lanes. Throughout 3 September, the 2/9th Infantry Battalion came up against significant resistance; in one engagement that took place around mid-morning along a stream to the west of Elevada Creek they lost 34 men killed or wounded as they attempted to force their way across a creek. Engaged with sustained machine gun fire, the two assault platoons withdrew back across the creek while elements of another company that was in support moved to the northern flank. Launching their assault, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese had withdrawn, leaving about 20 of their dead.|$|E
5|$|At the {{suggestion}} of C. J. Gorter, the team attempted to use an oscillating field. This {{became the basis for}} the nuclear magnetic resonance method. In 1937, Rabi, Kusch, Millman and Zacharias used it to measure the magnetic moment of several lithium compounds with molecular beams, including lithium chloride, lithium fluoride and dilithium. Applying the method to hydrogen, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> moment of a proton was 2.785±0.02 nuclear magnetons, and not 1 as predicted by the then-current theory, while that of a deuteron was 0.855±0.006 nuclear magnetons. This provided more accurate measurements of what Stern's team had found, and Rabi's team had confirmed, in 1934. Since a deuteron is composed of a proton and a neutron with aligned spins, the neutron's magnetic moment could be inferred by subtracting the proton's magnetic moment from the deuteron's. The resulting value was not zero, and had a sign opposite to that of the proton. Based on curious artifacts of these more accurate measurements, Rabi suggested that the deuteron had an electric quadrupole moment. This discovery meant that the physical shape of the deuteron was not symmetric, which provided valuable insight into the nature of the nuclear force binding nucleons. For the creation of the molecular-beam magnetic-resonance detection method, Rabi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1944.|$|E
25|$|Bernardino Pérez Pérez-Moreno {{and others}} {{performed}} another phylogenetic {{analysis of the}} Tyrannosauridae and found additional support for reclassifying the family as coelurosaurs. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> within <b>the</b> coelurosaurs, tyrannosaurs were arctometatarsalians.
