50|$|From ancient times, {{chemical}} additives {{were used}} to facilitate the mechanical washing of clothing with water. The Italians used a mix of sulfur and water with charcoal to clean cloth. Egyptians added ashes and silicates to soften water. Soaps were the first detergents. The detergent effects of certain synthetic surfactants were noted in Germany in 1917, in response to shortages of soap during World War I. In the 1930s, commercially viable routes to fatty alcohols were developed, and these new materials were converted to their sulfate esters, key ingredients in the commercially important German brand FEWA, produced by BASF, and Dreft, the US brand produced by Procter and Gamble. Such detergents were mainly used in industry until after World War II. By then, new developments and the later conversion of aviation fuel plants to produce <b>tetrapropylene,</b> used in household detergents, caused a fast growth of domestic use in the late 1940s.|$|E
50|$|Detergent, a {{replacement}} for soap, introduced in the postwar years, was used to keep clothes and dishes clean through the action of its active ingredient, <b>tetrapropylene,</b> a derivative of petroleum. The popular Tide brand became available in 1948. In 1964 permanent press fabrics were invented in the US by Ruth Rogan Benerito, a scientist at the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Chemical Reactions Laboratory and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter. The press resulted from {{the treatment of the}} fabric with formaldehyde. Invented by DuPont scientist Dr. Roy J. Plunkett in 1938, polytetrafluoroethylene, a polymer considered the world’s most slippery substance, was introduced commercially as Teflon, in 1946 in the US. It is used {{in a wide variety of}} applications, including as a non-stick coating on the cooking surface of pots and pans and is manufactured in Canada by DuPont in Mississauga, Ontario. Krazy Glue (ethyl cyanoacrylate) was introduced to Canada in 1973.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{application}} of the Peatross-Beyler (P&B) correlation (Fire and safety science-Proceedings of the fifth international symposium, 1997) to calculate the Mass loss rate (MLR) for a pool fire in a confined and ventilated enclosure for a range of conditions. The experimental references considered are the PRISME-SI-D 1, D 2 and D 6 tests (Pr,trel et al. in 9 th International seminar on fire safety in nuclear power plants and installations, 2005), conducted by the Institut de Radioprotection et de SA >> ret, Nucl,aire. The dimensions of the enclosure used in the experiment are 5 m in length, 6 m in width and 4 m in height. A pool fire, hydrogenated <b>tetrapropylene</b> (TPH,), is located in the center of the room. The compartment is connected to the outside through an inlet and outlet. The P&B correlation is implemented as a boundary condition in computational fluid dynamics calculations. The MLR outcome depends on the average concentration in a predefined volume and the characteristics of the fuel. The influence of the size and location of the predefined volume, the ventilation branch position (at 1 m and 3. 65 m from the floor) and the Renewal Rate () (and) are studied. Two types of predefined volumes have been tested: layer and ring. The layer volume is located in the low part of the compartment, the base of the volume spanning the compartment floor. The ring is a volume around the pit. It is assumed for both approaches that the measured is representative of the available oxygen for the flame. The P&B boundary condition predicts the influence of the vitiation on the MLR. Other methods, such as imposing the MLR expected in open condition, overpredict the amount of injected fuel. The results show that the P&B correlation provides good agreement with the experimental data. The deviation between experimental data and numerical prediction for the average MLR in the best case is - 5. 0 % with absolute values of 0. 004 kg/s and 0. 0038 kg/s for the experiment and the simulation respectively for case PRS-SI-D 1. The MLR calculation is influenced by the position of the ventilation opening and the. The temperature and concentration profiles are significantly influenced by the ventilation configuration. These differences are related to the transport of the injected air from the inlet to the floor by density difference...|$|E
40|$|LE SYSTEME D'EXTRACTION LIQUIDE-LIQUIDE UTILISE DANS LE PROCEDE DIAMEX-SANEX, DEVELOPPE POUR LA SEPARATION ACTINIDES(III) /LANTHANIDES(III) EST BASE SUR L'UTILISATION DE MELANGES DU MALONAMIDE DMDOHEMA ET D'UN ACIDE DIALKYLPHOSPHORIQUE (HDEHP OU HDHP), DILUES DANS LE TETRAPROPYLENEHYDROGENE. LA COMPLEXITE DE CES SYSTEMES A CONDUIT A METTRE EN PLACE UNE DEMARCHE ORIGINALE POUR COMPLETER L'APPROCHE CONVENTIONNELLE (THERMODYNAMIQUE, EXTRACTION LIQUIDE-LIQUIDE) QUI NE REND PAS TOUJOURS COMPTE DES PHENOMENES MACROSCOPIQUES (3 E PHASE, SUR-STOECHIOMETRIE) OBSERVES. CETTE DEMARCHE A CONSISTE A COMBINER DES ETUDES DE SPECIATIONS SUPRAMOLECULAIRE (VPO, DNPA, DXPA) ET MOLECULAIRE (EXTRACTION LIQUIDE-LIQUIDE, ESI-MS, IR, EXAFS) SUR LES SYSTEMES D'EXTRACTION UNITAIRES (DMDOHEMA OU HDHP DANS LE N-DODECANE) ET SUR LEUR MELANGE. MALGRE LES FORTES CONTRAINTES INHERENTES A LA MANIPULATION D'ISOTOPES RADIOACTIFS, LA PLUPART DE CES TECHNIQUES A ETE MISE EN ŒUVRE AVEC DES RADIOELEMENTS, COMME L'AMERICIUM(III) DANS LES EXPERIENCES DE DXPA, CONSTITUANT UNE PREMIERE MONDIALE. DANS CHAQUE SYSTEME ETUDIE, LES ACTINIDES ET LES LANTHANIDES SONT EXTRAITS EN PHASE ORGANIQUE, AU SEIN DE CŒURS POLAIRES DE MICELLES INVERSES. LES COMPOSITIONS DES SPHERES INTERNES ET EXTERNES DE CES ESPECES SONT PROPOSEES. AINSI, LES CATIONS METALLIQUES 4 F OU 5 F SONT EXTRAITS, PAR LES SYSTEMES A UN EXTRACTANT, DANS DES MICELLES INVERSES : [(DMDOHEMA) 2 M(NO 3) 3]INT[(DMDOHEMA) X(HNO 3) Z(H 2 O) W]EXT ET M(DHP) 3 (HDHP) Y- 3 (H 2 O) W AVEC Y = 3 A 6. DANS LE CAS DU MELANGE, L'EXTRACTANT MINORITAIRE JOUE LE ROLE DE CO-SURFACTANT LORS DE LA FORMATION D'AGREGATS MIXTES [(DMDOHEMA) 2 M(NO 3) 3 -V(DHP) V]INT[(DMDOHEMA) X(HDHP) Y(HNO 3) Z(H 2 O) W]EXT. ]ext. THE SOLVENT EXTRACTION SYSTEM USED IN THE DIAMEX-SANEX PROCESS, DEVELOPED FOR THE ACTINIDE(III) /LANTHANIDE(III) SEPARATION, IS BASED ON THE USE OF MIXTURES OF THE MALONAMIDE DMDOHEMA AND A DIALKYLPHOSPHORIC ACID (HDEHP OR HDHP), IN HYDROGENATED <b>TETRAPROPYLENE.</b> THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE SYSTEMS URGES ON A NOVEL APPROACH TO IMPROVE THE CONVENTIONAL METHODS (THERMODYNAMICS, SOLVENT EXTRACTION) WHICH HARDLY EXPLAIN THE MACROSCOPIC BEHAVIORS OBSERVED (3 RD PHASE, OVER-STOICHIOMETRY). THIS APPROACH COMBINES STUDIES ON BOTH SUPRAMOLECULAR (VPO, SANS, SAXS) AND MOLECULAR (LIQUID-LIQUID EXTRACTION, ESI-MS, IR, EXAFS) SPECIATIONS OF SINGLE EXTRACTANT SYSTEMS (DMDOHEMA OR HDHP IN N-DODECANE) AND THEIR MIXTURE. IN SPITE OF SAFETY CONSTRAINTS DUE TO THE HANDLING OF RADIOMATERIAL, THEY WERE USED IN THE STUDIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, LIKE FOR SAXS MEASUREMENTS ON AMERICIUM-CONTAINING SAMPLES, A WORLDWIDE FIRST-TIME. IN EACH OF THE INVESTIGATED SYSTEMS, ACTINIDES(III) AND LANTHANIDES(III) ARE EXTRACTED TO THE ORGANIC PHASE IN POLAR CORES OF REVERSED MICELLES, THE INNER AND OUTER-SPHERE COMPOSITIONS OF WHICH ARE PROPOSED. THUS, THE 4 F AND 5 F CATIONS ARE EXTRACTED BY REVERSED MICELLES SUCH AS [(DMDOHEMA) 2 M(NO 3) 3]INN[(DMDOHEMA) X(HNO 3) Z(H 2 O) W]OUT AND M(DHP) 3 (HDHP) Y- 3 (H 2 O) W WITH Y = 3 TO 6, FOR THE SINGLE EXTRACTANT SYSTEMS. IN THE CASE OF THE TWO EXTRACTANTS SYSTEM, THE LESS CONCENTRATED ONE ACTS LIKE A CO-SURFACTANT REGARDING THE MIXED AGGREGATE FORMATION [(DMDOHEMA) 2 M(NO 3) 3 -V(DHP) V]INN [(DMDOHEMA) X(HDHP) Y(HNO 3) Z(H 2 O) W]OUT.
