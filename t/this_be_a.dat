500|$|Process {{theology}} typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather {{than seeing}} God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as [...] "the fellow sufferer who understands", {{and as the}} being who is supremely affected by temporal events. [...] Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why would <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> praise-worthy quality in God? [...] Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world. [...] However, process theology has been formulated {{in a wide variety}} of ways. [...] C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a [...] "process naturalism", i.e. a process theology without God.|$|E

Harriet Malinowitz {{wrote that the}} story is an [...] "utterly captivating, high octane narrative" [...] and Mel Steel of The Independent wrote, [...] "Could <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> new genre? The bawdy lesbian picaresque novel? Whatever it is, take it with you. It's gorgeous." [...] Kirkus Reviews also praised it, writing [...] "Waters' debut offers terrific entertainment: swiftly paced, crammed with colorful depictions of 1890s London and vividly sketched Dickensian supporting characters", comparing the depiction of Nancy's parents to the fishing community in David Copperfield, and adding that it [...] "pulsat with highly charged (and explicitly presented) erotic heat". John Perry in The San Francisco Chronicle stated that it [...] "has the qualities of an extravagantly upholstered armchair. Tricked out in gaudy fabric and yards of fringe, it offers a sensual experience that leaves the reader marveling at the author's craftsmanship, idiosyncrasy and sheer effort." [...] Perry did acknowledge, however, that modern optimism was probably the impetus driving Waters' vision of a lesbian past.|$|E

500|$|The {{complete}} Coleman material, in {{a collection}} edited by James Booth, was finally published in 2002. [...] Booth thought that the material would probably cause [...] "a huge amount of confusion and smoke because the politically correct brigade will jump on it". Anticipating the publication, Emma Hartley and Vanessa Thorpe in The Observer doubted the literary value of the works, citing [...] Motion's [...] view that the stories were [...] "little more than mild pornography" [...] which the mature poet would never have wished to see published. On publication, Booth's collection provoked a particularly hostile reaction from The Guardians critic Jenny Diski, whose review dismissed the Coleman writings as [...] "drivel" [...] and [...] "sad ramblings", unworthy of publication or critical attention, and not even valid pornography: [...] "Not a breast, not a clitoris is seen or mentioned." [...] Unlike serious pornographers, [...] "Larkin sketches a mere outline and then walks away with a snigger". Diski mocks Booth's reverential descriptions of the typescripts [...] "as though they were slivers of the True Cross", and concludes: [...] "Let <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lesson, at least, to anyone who hasn't got around to chucking out the crap they wrote in their teens and early twenties." ...|$|E

On the contrary, it is the case of convicting a citizen as a punishment for not submitting to imprisonment in a concentration camp, based on his ancestry, and solely because of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his loyalty and good disposition towards the United States.

2500|$|A common view is {{that the}} [...] "art", {{particular}} in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for Leonardo da Vinci, art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. Rembrandt's work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of John Singer Sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, Pablo Picasso, was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.|$|E

2500|$|The monster was {{designed}} by artist Neville Page. He sought a biological rationale for the creature, though many of his ideas would not show up on screen. Page designed the creature as immature and suffering from [...] "separation anxiety". He compared the creature to a rampaging elephant, saying [...] "there's nothing scarier than something huge that's spooked". Page said of the creature's backstory, [...] "For me, {{one of the most}} key moments in our collective brainstorming was the choice to make the creature be something that we would empathize with. It is not out there just killing. It is confused, lost, scared. It's a newborn. Having <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> story point (one that the audience does not know), it allowed for some purposeful choices about its anatomy, movement and, yes, motivations". The creature was developed by visual effects supervisor Kevin Blank and Phil Tippett's company Tippett Studio. Blank described the intended goal of the creature, [...] "Rather than the monster having a personality , it's more of an entity or an event".|$|E

I will blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife" [...] "Lee Harvey Oswald." [...] The note allegedly contained some sort of threat, but accounts vary as to whether Oswald threatened to [...] "blow up the FBI" [...] or merely [...] "report this to higher authorities". According to Hosty, the note said, [...] "If you have anything you want to learn about me, come talk to me directly. If you don't cease bothering my wife, I will take the appropriate action and report this to the proper authorities." [...] Agent Hosty said that he destroyed Oswald's note on orders from his superior, Gordon Shanklin, after Oswald was named the suspect in the Kennedy assassination.|$|E
2500|$|Both Kate Blanchard and Scholz {{note that}} there are several {{passages}} in the Book of Isaiah, Book of Jeremiah, and Book of Ezekiel that utilize rape metaphors. Blanchard expressed outrage over this fact, writing [...] "The translations of these shining examples of victim-blaming are clear enough, despite the old-fashioned language: I'm angry and you're going to suffer for it. You deserve to be raped because of your sexual exploits. You're a slut {{and it was just}} a matter of time till you suffered the consequences. Let <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lesson to you and to all other uppity women." [...] Scholz discussed four passages—Isaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word pōt as [...] "forehead" [...] or [...] "scalp". Also often translated as [...] "genitals", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is [...] "cunt". Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, [...] "The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God." ...|$|E

2500|$|The United States, while {{intending}} {{never to}} acquire lands from the Indians otherwise than peaceably, {{and with their}} free consent, are fully determined, in that manner, progressively, and in proportion as their growing population may require, to reclaim {{from the state of}} nature, and to bring into cultivation every portion of the territory contained within their acknowledged boundaries. In thus providing for the support of millions of civilized beings, they will not violate any dictate of justice or of humanity; for they will not only give to the few thousand savages scattered over that territory an ample equivalent for any right they may surrender, but will always leave them the possession of lands more than they can cultivate, and more than adequate to their subsistence, comfort, and enjoyment, by cultivation. If <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> spirit of aggrandizement, the undersigned are prepared to admit, in that sense, its existence; but they must deny that it affords the slightest proof of an intention not to respect the boundaries between them and European nations, or of a desire to encroach upon the territories of Great Britain. [...] They will not suppose that that Government will avow, as the basis of their policy towards the United States a system of arresting their natural growth within their own territories, for the sake of preserving a perpetual desert for savages.|$|E
2500|$|I now {{consider}} whether the facilities of the [...] institutions are separate but equal, within {{the requirements of}} the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Are the separate facilities and educational opportunities offered to these Negro plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, [...] "equal" [...] in the constitutional sense, to those available at Claymont High to white children, similarly situated? The answer to this question is often much more difficult than appears, because many of the factors to be compared are just not susceptible of mathematical evaluation, e. g., aesthetic considerations. Moreover, and of real importance, the United States Supreme Court has not decided what should be done if a Negro school being compared with a white school is inferior in some respects and superior in others. It is easy, as some courts do, to talk about the necessity for finding substantial equality. But, under this approach, how is one to deal with a situation where, as here, the mental and physical health services at the Negro school are superior to those offered at [...] the white school while the teacher load at the Negro school is not only substantially heavier than that at the white school, but often exceeds the State announced educationally desirable maximum teacher-pupil ratio. The answer, it seems to me is this: Where the facilities or educational opportunities available to the Negro are, as to any substantial factor, inferior to those available to white children similarly situated, the constitutional principle of [...] "separate but equal" [...] is violated, even though the State may point to other factors as to which the Negro school is superior. I reach this conclusion because I do not believe a court can say that the substantial factor as to which the Negro school is inferior will not adversely affect the educational progress of at least some of those concerned. Moreover, evaluating unlike factors is unrealistic. If <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> harsh test, then I answer that a State which divides its citizens should pay the price.|$|E
