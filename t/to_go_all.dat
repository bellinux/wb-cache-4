5|$|In the 1999–2000 season, Arsenal {{participated in}} the Premier League. Despite the loss of striker Nicolas Anelka to Real Madrid, the club {{significantly}} strengthened in the summer, signing defenders Oleg Luzhny and Sylvinho as well as forwards Davor Šuker and Thierry Henry. Inconsistent performances in the league against lowly opposition meant Arsenal never posed a serious title challenge, ending the campaign as runners-up, 18 points behind Manchester United. The club had another poor season in the Champions League, finishing third in their group; this won them a consolation place in the UEFA Cup and Arsenal managed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> {{the way to the}} final, where they faced Galatasaray in Copenhagen. The match ended in a 0–0 draw with few chances for either side to score; it went to penalties and Arsenal lost after Šuker and Patrick Vieira missed their spot-kicks.|$|E
5|$|Reyes {{received}} his first yellow {{card in the}} 76th minute, when he was late in tackling Silvestre after the French defender had played a backpass to Carroll. The break in play allowed Manchester United to make their first substitution, bringing on Fortune for O'Shea, {{who appeared to be}} struggling with a calf injury. With six minutes left in normal time, United won a corner on the left hand side, which Ronaldo played short to Scholes. Scholes returned the ball to Ronaldo, who crossed it into the penalty area, where Keane was unmarked at the back post. The ball eventually broke to the United captain, who shot, only to see four Arsenal players between him and the goal, ready to block his effort behind for another corner. Lehmann came to meet the second corner kick, but missed the ball, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> the way through to Van Nistelrooy; the Dutchman headed the ball goalwards, but Ljungberg was on the line and headed it up onto the crossbar and away.|$|E

500|$|In {{his only}} {{season on the}} {{football}} team (1950), he was Army's statistical leader in rushing, averaging 7.3 yards per carry, and in scoring, with 83 total points. Prior to Army's game with Penn, a scout for the latter team said Pollard was the best fullback in college football. In December, the Helms Athletic Foundation named him to their 1950 All-American team, along with fellow Army cadet Dan Foldberg. He was also named to the Associated Press and United Press All-East teams. The Associated Press praised his running capabilities, commenting that [...] "any time he lugs the ball he's liable <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> the way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Golden Ticket" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with several}} reviewers {{commenting on the}} selfishness and mean behavior of Michael in the episode. In a New York magazine article entitled [...] "Michael Finally Goes Too Far", Will Leitch describes it as [...] "one of the funnier recent episodes", but found Michael's willingness to sell out Dwight unsettling: [...] "Usually, when he’s about to do something over-the-top (like plant drugs on Toby), he backs off at the last second. This time, he's willing <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> the way and sell out Dwight, his most loyal friend. It's a little jarring." [...] Leitch, however, said {{the sweetness of the}} subplot involving Kevin and Lynne offset some of the darker aspects of the episode, and praised several of the jokes including Michael's [...] "Shoe-La-La" [...] shoe store idea, Dwight's idea for a [...] "Horse Boat" [...] invention and the KGB knock knock jokes.|$|E

Rachel's reasoning, however, came in for harsh criticism: Brett Berk of Vanity Fair said it was [...] "neither believable nor even amusing" [...] that she would try intercourse for such a reason, Bell called her a [...] "dunce", and VanDerWerff didn't believe that she would just blurt it out to Finn. The Star-Ledger Vicki Hyman felt her decision <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> the way did not [...] "ring quite true", and Poniewozik called it [...] "essentially pity sex". Ausiello had a different view—"I would hardly call it pity sex"—and West said she was [...] "going to choose to believe" [...] that Rachel did not have her first time [...] "just to make him feel better".|$|E

500|$|Rhyolite {{began to}} decline before the final closing of the mine. At roughly {{the same time that}} the Bullfrog mines were running out of {{high-grade}} ore, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake diverted capital to California while interrupting rail service, and the financial panic of 1907 restricted funding for mine development. As mines in the district reduced production or closed, unemployed miners left Rhyolite to seek work elsewhere, businesses failed, and by 1910, the census reported only 675 residents. All three banks in the town closed by March 1910. The newspapers, including the Rhyolite Herald, the last <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>all</b> shut down by June 1912. The post office closed in November 1913; the last train left Rhyolite Station in July 1914, and the Nevada-California Power Company turned off the electricity and removed its lines in 1916. Within a year the town was [...] "all but abandoned", and the 1920 census reported a population of only 14. A 1922 motor tour by the Los Angeles Times found only one remaining resident, a 92-year-old man who died in 1924.|$|E
500|$|Axelrod {{composed}} Song of Innocence in {{one week}} and began recording in mid-1968. He recorded the album at Capitol Studios in Los Angeles and enlisted his close-knit group of veteran studio musicians, including keyboardist and conductor Don Randi, guitarist Al Casey, bassist Carol Kaye, and drummer Earl Palmer. He had worked with them when producing sessions for other recording artists. Axelrod did not play any instruments on Song of Innocence; he instead wrote arrangements for his orchestra and utilized 33players to perform his notated charts. He {{had learned how to}} read and orchestrate complex music charts from jazz musicians during the 1950s. Randi conducted the orchestra and played both piano and organ on the record. Axelrod preferred listening to a session from a recording booth like his contemporary Igor Stravinsky. [...] "That way the sounds don't seem <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> over the place", he later said. [...] "Music seems so small in a studio." [...] Axelrod originally wanted some of the album's compositions to feature a large-scale choir but was uncertain if he could find the appropriate ensemble, so he recorded an entirely instrumental album and included one Blake setting for each section of the score.|$|E
500|$|Early in the season, as the Ohio Works team {{prepared}} for a second game with the Zanesville Moguls (close rivals in the 1905 championship games), the club manager, Hogan, spoke confidently on their chances of capturing the league pennant. [...] "If the boys go through the season as they are playing now, we will have no trouble winning out", he said to a reporter with The Youngstown Daily Vindicator. [...] "Our pitchers are in good condition and are holding the opposing batsmen to few hits. It is the pitching staff that has saved many a game for us. We have no [...]350 batters on the club, but any man on it is liable {{to step in and}} break up a game". A local newspaper confirmed Hogan's assessment of the team, observing that only one player, outfielder Will Thomas, had worked up a batting average of [...]306. Nevertheless, as Hogan predicted, the team defeated the Moguls, with a final score of 11–8. The game's highlights included the pitching of [...] "Long John" [...] Kennedy, who kept the Moguls to seven hits, and the batting of Edward Hilley, who [...] "unloosened a drive to middle field that permitted him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> the way around".|$|E

500|$|Wilton {{accepted}} the domino theory and never wavered in {{his commitment to}} Vietnam, but as early as mid-1967 he doubted that the war could be won unless the US was prepared <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> out and invade the North. Cautious about expanding Australia's involvement, he advocated deploying a Centurion tank squadron rather than a third infantry battalion when calls came to increase {{the strength of the}} task force in Vietnam, but in the end the Federal government announced both commitments in October 1967. Wilton also advised the government to reject any requests from the US command in Vietnam to rotate the Australian task force out of Phuoc Tuy and display its capabilities in a wider operational arena, reasoning that it was more important for the troops to remain in the countryside they knew and continue to build relations with the local people. He nevertheless strongly backed the Australian task force commander, Brigadier Ronald Hughes, when the latter was criticised at home for conducting [...] "American style operations" [...] outside the immediate vicinity of Phuoc Tuy, such as the set-piece battles of Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral in mid-1968. Conflict continued to simmer between the Army and the RAAF regarding air support, and Wilton oversaw discussions between Daly and Murdoch that secured a separate Army air organisation, leading to the formation of the Australian Army Aviation Corps in July 1968. On 22August, the Federal government announced that Wilton would be promoted to general, effective 1September, in recognition of his [...] "outstanding contribution to the Commonwealth in his present appointment". He was the first Australian officer to attain the rank since Blamey, twenty-seven years before.|$|E
500|$|The art {{style of}} the game world drew acclaim from many reviewers, who welcomed the {{departure}} from Oblivions Cyrodiil. Jason Schreier of Wired described the land of Skyrim as a [...] "Viking-inspired treasure trove of flavor and charm", noting its contrast to Cyrodiil, which he considered generic by comparison. The Staff at Edge magazine described Cyrodiil as a [...] "patchwork of varying terrains", praising the more consistent design of Skyrim. Shibley praised [...] "the lack of copy-and-paste level design that's plagued Bethesda's previous games,... giving a lived-in and handcrafted look to the world". Bedford noted that the improved graphical fidelity over Oblivion allowed the game world to feel more lifelike, praising the [...] "misty mountain setting, complete with swirling fog and high-altitude snowstorms". An editor for PC PowerPlay praised {{the diversity of the}} dungeon design. Andrew Reiner of Game Informer cited criticisms that Oblivion faced for repetitive dungeons, noting that [...] "the composition of each dungeon is largely unique and individualized" [...] in Skyrim. He also favored the design choice to have a quick route out of a dungeon leading from its last room, eliminating a problem he identified Oblivion as having, where the player would clear a dungeon and then have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> {{the way back to the}} beginning to exit it. Many reviewers praised the large amount of things to do in the world outside of the main story. Tom Francis of PC Gamer noted that it was difficult to explore the world without becoming distracted by things to do, stating that, [...] "it's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, [...] a haunted fort".|$|E

2500|$|The {{mainstream}} of Roman philosophy, {{such as the}} Stoics, advocated contemplation and acceptance of the inevitability of death of all mortals. [...] "It is necessary for some to stay and for others <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>all</b> the while rejoicing {{with those who are}} with us, yet not grieving for those departing." [...] To grieve bitterly is to fail to perceive and accept the nature of things. Famously, Epictetus encouraged contemplation of one's loved ones as a [...] "jar" [...] or [...] "crystal cup" [...] which might break and be remembered without troubling the spirit, since [...] "you love a mortal, something not your own. It has been given to you for the present, not inseparably nor forever, but like a fig... at a fixed season of the year. If you yearn for it in the winter, you are a fool." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historians {{are divided}} {{as to the}} {{location}} of this battle. At the time, the name [...] "Ourique" [...] designated a large area south of Beja. Since 12th century chroniclers were unfamiliar with the region where the battle took place, they might have decided to call the location [...] "field of Ourique" [...] for lack of a more precise term. Nonetheless, the great distance that separated Ourique from the Christian lines farther north has led some historians to suggest various localities in central Portugal, abandoning the traditional idea that the combat occurred in Ourique in the Alentejo. It would have been difficult for the then Count of Portugal, with a realm little beyond the Mondego River, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>all</b> the way south to battle five Moorish Kings. One plausible alternative is Vila Chã de Ourique, located some ten miles from Santarém.|$|E
