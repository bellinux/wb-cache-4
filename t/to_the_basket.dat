5|$|Beilein {{is known}} for his Princeton {{offensive}} system, which emphasizes constant motion, passing, disciplined teamwork, and precision shooting. The offense usually starts out with four players outside the three-point arc, and one player {{at the top of the}} key (though at times a post player may operate closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket).</b> From this formation, Beilein's teams not only try to open up space for players to cut <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> but also are known for their high number of three-point attempts. On defense, Beilein has become known for employing the 1–3–1 halfcourt zone defense, which is considered to be an unconventional zone defense – though he also regularly employs man-to-man and 2-3 zone defenses.|$|E

5|$|In a December 22, 1990, {{win against}} in-state rival Western Kentucky, Farmer posted {{a new career}} high with 22 points, despite missing his first five three-point {{attempts}} of the game. He would not approach such scoring numbers again until a February 3, 1991, contest against Georgia, when he scored 16 points after seeing extended minutes due to Woods being in foul trouble. Farmer suffered a black eye during the game, which was notable for its physicality. Messenger-Inquirer sportswriter Jake Jennings also noted that Farmer relied on drives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> to score, as opposed to his usual penchant for shooting three-point shots.|$|E
25|$|Making <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> {{required}} great {{skill and}} knowledge in collecting and preparing the needed materials. Materials for weaving <b>baskets</b> changed with <b>the</b> seasons and years, {{so did the}} materials used for <b>the</b> <b>baskets.</b> <b>The</b> Pomo usually covered a <b>basket</b> completely with <b>the</b> vivid red feathers of the pleated woodpecker until the surface resembled the smoothness of the bird itself. With <b>the</b> feathers, 30-50 <b>to</b> every inch, beads were fastened <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket’s</b> border and hung pendants of polished abalone shell from <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> itself. Pomo women sometimes spent months or years making such gift baskets.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>baskets</b> were dug {{out when}} the plants were at the third, fifth, and seventh leaf stages (Figure  1 G and H). <b>The</b> soil {{attached}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>baskets</b> was removed carefully without cutting the primary roots. Each basket was divided into four angle areas: < 0 °, 0 – 30 °, 30 – 60 °, and 60 – 90 °. The gravitropic and horizontal directions were 90 ° and 0 °, respectively. We counted the number of primary roots emerging from <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> in each angle area.|$|R

5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, drove <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, {{kept up with}} Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E
5|$|The ad {{opens on}} a young man {{dribbling}} in place. The music starts with a simple ostinato C–G–B–C line played by a muted synth bass. At 0:05, a young man wags his tongue while dribbling. This is a signature move of Jordan's. At 0:09, a player drives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> with his tongue hanging out. He recreates a moment from the 1991 NBA Finals, game 2: Jordan scored a layup after switching hands in midair to avoid Sam Perkins of the Los Angeles Lakers.|$|E
5|$|After Kansas {{failed to}} convert a shot on their next possession, North Carolina {{proceeded}} {{to pass the}} ball {{around the perimeter of}} the court for close to two minutes. After finding the right setup, Lennie Rosenbluth drove <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> and scored. Following that possession, Kansas began to make outside jump shots. When combined with Carolina's inability to score, Kansas' improved jump shots led to a 102 Kansas run, with Kansas taking the lead nine minutes into the second half. In addition, as North Carolina players continued to foul Chamberlain in order to make him score from the free throw line, they began to get into foul trouble. Kansas' coach Dick Harp then began to hold the ball beginning with their next possession. Harp's plan worked for a while as Carolina was not able to overcome Kansas' three point lead; Kansas did not attempt a shot for over five minutes.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara cited two textual proofs for the {{instruction}} of [...] that one waved the first fruits ( [...] , bikkurim). Rabbi Judah interpreted the words [...] "you shall set it down" [...] in [...] <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waving. The Gemara explained that these words could not refer literally <b>to</b> setting <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> down because [...] already accounted for setting <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> down. Alternatively, Rabbi Eliezer ben Jacob deduced <b>the</b> requirement <b>to</b> wave <b>the</b> first fruits from the word [...] "hand" [...] occurring in both [...] {{and in the case}} of the peace-offering in [...] which says, [...] "His own hands shall bring the offering unto the Lord." [...] The Gemara concluded that just as [...] explicitly directs <b>the</b> priest <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> and wave it, so in [...] <b>the</b> priest was <b>to</b> take <b>the</b> offering and wave it, even though [...] refers only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> donor. And just as [...] explicitly directs <b>the</b> donor <b>to</b> wave <b>the</b> offering, so in [...] <b>the</b> donor was <b>to</b> wave <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> <b>The</b> Gemara explained that it was possible for both the priest and <b>the</b> donor <b>to</b> perform <b>the</b> waving because the priest placed his hand under the hand of the donor and they waved <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> together.|$|R
5|$|On October 6, 1993, Jordan {{announced}} his retirement, citing {{a loss of}} desire to play the game. Jordan later stated that {{the death of his}} father three months earlier also shaped his decision. Jordan's father was murdered on July 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in Lumberton, North Carolina, by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery, who carjacked the luxury vehicle. The assailants were traced from calls that they made on James Jordan's cell phone. The two criminals were caught, convicted at trial, and sentenced to life in prison. Jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time he drove <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> In 1996, he founded a Chicago area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{returned}} to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leading the series 3–2. Jordan executed a series of plays, considered {{to be one of}} the greatest clutch performances in NBA Finals history. With the Bulls trailing 86–83 with 41.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When play resumed, Jordan received the inbound pass, drove <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket,</b> and hit a shot over several Jazz defenders, cutting the Utah lead to 86–85. The Jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to forward Karl Malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by Rodman. Malone jostled with Rodman and caught the pass, but Jordan cut behind him and took the ball out of his hands for a steal. Jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, Jazz guard Bryon Russell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan gave Chicago an 87–86 lead with a game-winning jumper, the climactic shot of his Bulls career. Afterwards, John Stockton missed a game-winning three-pointer. Jordan and the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship and second three-peat. Once again, Jordan was voted the Finals MVP, having led all scorers averaging 33.5 points per game, including 45 in the deciding Game 6. Jordan's six Finals MVPs is a record; Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, LeBron James and Tim Duncan are tied for second place with three apiece. The 1998 Finals holds the highest television rating of any Finals series in history. Game 6 also holds the highest television rating of any game in NBA history.|$|E
5|$|The teams traded baskets for the {{majority}} of the second half, with the largest advantage being four points by Georgetown with over twelve minutes to go in the game. After five more minutes of game play, North Carolina managed to cut the lead to two, 56–54. The Tar Heels then obtained a single point lead with 5:50 to play and set up in their four corners offense,\ to run out the game clock. The Tar Heels were quickly fouled and Jimmy Black converted two free throws, while Fred Brown made two his own on the other end to bring the score to 59–58 in favor of North Carolina. With three and a half minutes left in the contest, Michael Jordan drove <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> and made a shot off of the backboard to increase the Tar Heels' lead to three, 61–58. On Georgetown's following possession, Ewing made a jump shot to bring his team within one. North Carolina again set up in the four corners. While making an attempt to steal the ball from Matt Doherty, the Hoyas' Eric Smith was called for a foul. This sent Doherty to the line for a one-and-one, which he missed and Ewing got the rebound. Smith then hit a twelve-foot jump shot with 57 seconds left to go to give Georgetown the lead, 62–61. Then, Jordan received a pass from Black and connected on a shot with fifteen seconds remaining in the game to give North Carolina a one-point lead. On the Hoyas' ensuing possession, Fred Brown passed the ball away to Worthy, who proceeded to run out some of the clock before being fouled. Because the Hoyas were in the double bonus, Worthy received two free throw attempts, both of which he missed. Floyd got the rebound and attempted a last second shot that also missed.|$|E

25|$|However, Toronto was {{not about}} to give up on Bargnani yet and {{committed}} the entire summer coaching him to become a more effective interior player, forcing him to drive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> more and settle less for jump shots. The arrival of six-time NBA All-Star Jermaine O'Neal also meant that Bargnani was likely to come off the bench in most games, with Bosh and O'Neal forming the starting frontcourt. During the summer he worked hard on his body, putting up some more weight (adding some 15 pounds of muscle); this work showed his effects in the first games of the regular campaign, when the Italian was more willing to rebound in traffic and drive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> He also seemed to rediscover his shooting stroke, had better shot selection and became a consistent shot-blocker, and he was soon moved to the starting line-up as small forward.|$|E
25|$|In Game 4 of the finals, {{with the}} Celtics {{trailing}} {{in both the}} game and the series, McHale delivered a hard foul to Kurt Rambis, violently flinging him down by his throat, as the Lakers' forward raced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> The physical play touched off a bench-clearing scuffle. Boston came back to win the game in overtime and tie the series at two games apiece. They eventually prevailed in seven games to win the franchise's fifteenth championship.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} the timing of optical information pick-up in basketball jump shooting using an intermittent viewing technique. We expected shooters to prefer <b>to</b> look at <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> as late as possible under the shooting style used. Seven experts with a high shooting style and five experts with a low shooting style took 50 jump shots while wearing liquid-crystal glasses that opened and closed at pre-set intervals. In principle, under this constraint, the participants could control when they saw <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> by actively modulating the timing of their movements. Analyses of the phasing of <b>the</b> movements relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> events defined on the glasses revealed that low-style shooters preferred <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> just before <b>the</b> ball passed their line of sight, whereas high-style shooters tended <b>to</b> view <b>the</b> <b>basket</b> from underneath <b>the</b> ball after it passed their line of sight. Thus, most shooters preferred to pick up optical information as late as possible given the adopted shooting style. We conclude that, in dynamic far aiming tasks such as basketball jump shooting, late pick-up of optical information is critical for the successful guidance of movements...|$|R

25|$|On offense, Pippen relied {{primarily}} on his remarkable athleticism {{to gain an}} advantage over his defender; he slashed towards the basket for higher percentage shots. Early in his career, Pippen was not an adept jump shooter; he struggled when shooting directly on a line <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>basket.</b> He favored shooting his jump shots—mid-range and three pointers—on an angle. He could regularly bank the ball off the backboard into the basket. He honed his jump shot {{over the course of}} his career and became more effective at scoring from distance later in his career.|$|E

He led the NBA in field goal percentage in the 1986-87 and 1987-88 seasons, shooting 60.4 percent each season. Also a standout defensive player, McHale was selected to the NBA All-Defensive First or Second Team six times. He twice blocked nine shots in a game, the most ever by a Boston Celtics' player (blocked shots did not become an official NBA statistic until the 1973-74 season).|$|E
25|$|Basket interference, or goaltending is a {{violation}} charged when a player illegally interferes with a shot.
