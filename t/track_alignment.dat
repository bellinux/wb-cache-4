5|$|Construction {{began in}} earnest on 18 April 2013 after {{completion}} of remedial and preparatory works such as land acquisition, removal of vegetation, demolition of certain structures and remedial works on old mines in Midlothian, for which over £54 million was spent by Network Rail. The first task was the excavation of the <b>track</b> <b>alignment</b> through Monktonhall and the clearing of the site for Shawfair station. Construction of the line's first bridge, Rye Haugh Bridge at Millerhall, were underway on 6 August 2013 as part of works to deviate the line out of Edinburgh from Newcraighall before it returns to the original alignment. The 23-arch Newbattle Viaduct (or Lothianbridge Viaduct) was used by lorries removing spoil from the construction site which eased traffic on local roads.|$|E
25|$|One {{alternative}} is to establish an extra locomotive at Loenga, which would require an upgrade of the <b>track</b> <b>alignment</b> at Loenga. Although this would cut some costs, it would still delay each train by about 25 minutes and requires additional tracks at both Loenga and Alnabru. Although freight trains from the Østfold Line pass through Loenga, those from the Sørlandet Line do not, causing additional delays.|$|E
25|$|On October 27, 1976, loose {{chunks of}} {{concrete}} were falling from a retaining {{wall on the}} southbound side of the BMT Brighton Line {{just south of the}} Beverley Road station. After many temporary reroutes and usage of the Manhattan-bound express track in both directions, the southbound <b>track</b> <b>alignment</b> had to be changed; all trains had to use a single track and a shuttle had to be created between Beverley Road and Prospect Park. Starting November 1, 1976 and continuing until February 25, 1977, hundreds of trains were cancelled and/or rerouted due to the construction.|$|E
50|$|The line runs {{mostly on}} {{reserved}} <b>track</b> <b>alignments</b> with short sections of street-running. The southern {{half of the}} route mostly uses the wide grass verges alongside roads.|$|R
50|$|The {{signal box}} and the through roads have been removed, and all {{services}} use the platform roads, although these have improved <b>track</b> <b>alignments</b> to allow fast running. The former goods yard is now the station car park.|$|R

25|$|The {{first section}} of the {{extension}} to Bull Street tram stop was opened on 6 December 2015. The rest of the extension to Grand Central was due to open on 22 May 2016, but this was delayed to allow further <b>track</b> <b>alignment</b> work. The extension eventually opened on 30 May 2016, with revisions to the timetable. The track extends past the New Street Station tram stop, almost to the junction with Pinfold Street, providing a spur to allow trams arriving from the Wolverhampton direction to reverse and switch to the opposite track for the return journey.|$|E
25|$|The {{line from}} Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells (via East Grinstead High Level and Groombridge) opened on 1 October 1866, with the {{connecting}} line from Uckfield via Eridge opening on 3 August 1868. The {{connection between the}} LBSCR station at Tunbridge Wells West and Tunbridge Wells Central opened on 1 February 1876. This single-line section passed through the short Grove Tunnel to Grove Junction, sited a little south of the South Eastern Railway station on its Hastings Line. In 1881 a new <b>track</b> <b>alignment</b> was built between Polegate and Hailsham allowing trains to run into Polegate at {{the west end of}} the station and direct to Eastbourne.|$|E
500|$|Construction was {{completed}} on a [...] long {{segment of the}} Montclair Branch from East Orange to Glen Ridge and was opened to rail service on November 15, 1912. The project laid [...] of track in addition to steel ties and stone ballast. The station has concrete crossings at Dodd Street, Arlington Avenue and Watsessing Avenue along with a new crossing of the Erie Railroad's Orange Branch {{just south of the}} station. The design of Watsessing Avenue's new station was difficult due to the limited right-of-way. While making the separation, a new trench had to be dug, which included retaining walls that prevented moving the existing <b>track</b> <b>alignment</b> to delay railroad traffic. When the station was finished, tracks were shifted to make room for a second track. The station depot was built over the railroad tracks with four concrete arches to support the building. A four-inch (10cm) ceiling was constructed on the arches, and the station was widened to take more volume of train service.|$|E

50|$|The {{station is}} a popular {{location}} for railway photographers and enthusiasts owing to the secluded location, long views of <b>track</b> <b>alignments</b> and the low number of station users at off-peak times. When a special train is due, the footbridge and platforms will usually have {{a large number of}} photographers and enthusiasts along them.|$|R

40|$|The energy {{cost of a}} rail {{transport}} system is very big especially for the tractions of trains in its daily operation. Continual effort on decreasing the traction energy cost intensities of various {{rail transport}} modes has been made by many researchers and practitioners on different aspects for a long time. From the rail transport operation perspective, this study reviews such energy-saving research mainly focusing on the optimizations of train coasting schemes, the rational designs and utilizations of <b>track</b> <b>alignments,</b> the ameliorations of train attributes, and the improvements of system operations. According to the review work, {{it is confirmed that}} in sound responses to distinct <b>track</b> <b>alignments,</b> dynamically optimizing control programs of trains with their reasonably improved attributes ought to be further studied in view of the systematic transport operation of a rail line or network in an integrated manner as much as possible in the future research on traction energy saving of rail transport...|$|R

50|$|Stirling Highway {{initially}} {{developed as}} a rough track linking the new townsites of Perth and Fremantle following {{the establishment of the}} Swan River Colony in 1829. Construction of a formal road along the <b>track's</b> <b>alignment</b> did not take place for several decades, due to labour shortages, the slow initial development of the colony, the initial absence of a bridge across the Swan River {{at the southern end of}} the track, and the use of the river itself as the principal means of transport between the towns.|$|R

50|$|The sleek, {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} the Class 93 would have allowed maximum speeds of up to 250 km/h. The maximum speed however would initially have been 125 mph because of signalling and <b>track</b> <b>alignment</b> limitations.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for concurrently optimizing station locations and the rail transit alignment connecting these stations, by accommodating multiple system objectives, formulating various design constraints, and integrating the analysis models with a {{geographical information system}} (GIS) database. The methodology incorporates demand and station costs in the evaluation framework and employs a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing the decision variables for station locations, station types, and <b>track</b> <b>alignments.</b> It is expected that transit planners may greatly benefit from the proposed methodology, with which they can conveniently and efficiently optimize alternatives.|$|R

50|$|The St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company {{experienced}} {{financial difficulties}} and {{was bought by}} the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company in 1862. The track, bridge and trestles between St Kilda station and Punt Road were dismantled; however, a siding from Windsor to Hoddle Street remained. Due to the <b>track</b> <b>alignments</b> there were now two level crossings within 100 metres on Union Street, as the siding continued {{to be used for}} shunting trains from the Brighton line, and to carry screenings from the Richmond quarries to a commercial depot on Punt Road (then known as Hoddle Street).|$|R
