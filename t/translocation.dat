5|$|The gate {{formed by}} the α {{subunits}} prevents peptides longer than about four residues from entering {{the interior of the}} 20S particle. The ATP molecules bound before the initial recognition step are hydrolyzed before <b>translocation.</b> While energy is needed for substrate unfolding, it is not required for <b>translocation.</b> The assembled 26S proteasome can degrade unfolded proteins {{in the presence of a}} non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, but cannot degrade folded proteins, indicating that energy from ATP hydrolysis is used for substrate unfolding. Passage of the unfolded substrate through the opened gate occurs via facilitated diffusion if the 19S cap is in the ATP-bound state.|$|E

5|$|After {{a protein}} has been ubiquitinated, it is {{recognized}} by the 19S regulatory particle in an ATP-dependent binding step. The substrate protein must then enter {{the interior of the}} 20S particle to come in contact with the proteolytic active sites. Because the 20S particle's central channel is narrow and gated by the N-terminal tails of the α ring subunits, the substrates must be at least partially unfolded before they enter the core. The passage of the unfolded substrate into the core is called <b>translocation</b> and necessarily occurs after deubiquitination. However, the order in which substrates are deubiquitinated and unfolded is not yet clear. Which of these processes is the rate-limiting step in the overall proteolysis reaction depends on the specific substrate; for some proteins, the unfolding process is rate-limiting, while deubiquitination is the slowest step for other proteins. The extent to which substrates must be unfolded before <b>translocation</b> is not known, but substantial tertiary structure, and in particular nonlocal interactions such as disulfide bonds, are sufficient to inhibit degradation. The presence of intrinsically disordered protein segments of sufficient size, either at the protein terminus or internally, has also been proposed to facilitate efficient initiation of degradation.|$|E

In contrast to myeloid and B-cell neoplasms, <b>translocations</b> in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are poorly understood. Here, we identified recurrent <b>translocations</b> involving the multiple myeloma oncogene- 1 /interferon regulatory factor- 4 (IRF 4) locus in PTCLs. IRF 4 <b>translocations</b> exist in myeloma and some B-cell lymphomas, {{but have not}} been reported previously in PTCLs. We studied 169 PTCLs using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} and identified 12 cases with IRF 4 <b>translocations.</b> Two cases with t(6; 14) (p 25;q 11. 2) had <b>translocations</b> between IRF 4 and the T-cell receptor-alpha (TCRA) locus. Both were cytotoxic PTCLs, unspecified (PTCL-Us) involving bone marrow and skin. Eight of the remaining ten cases were cutaneous ALCLs without TCRA rearrangements (57 % of cutaneous ALCLs tested). These findings identified IRF 4 <b>translocations</b> as a novel recurrent genetic abnormality in PTCLs. Cytotoxic PTCL-Us involving bone marrow and skin and containing IRF 4 /TCRA <b>translocations</b> might represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity. <b>Translocations</b> involving IRF 4 but not TCRA appear to occur predominantly in cutaneous ALCLs.

Robertsonian <b>translocations</b> were identified in 39 cases. ResultsThe percentage of Robertsonian <b>translocations</b> in all amniocentesis cases was 0. 23 % (39 / 16, 749); 31 were balanced and eight were unbalanced. De novo abnormality occurred in 17 cases, or in 43. 6 % of all Robertsonian <b>translocations.</b> The two major indications for amniocentesis with a diagnosis of Robertsonian <b>translocations</b> were AMA (41. 0 %, n =  16) and a parent with abnormal karyotypes (18. 0 %, n =  7). The highest percentage of Robertsonian <b>translocations</b> was found in parents with abnormal karyotypes (2. 8 %, 7 / 252), but neither of the indications were clearly superior for detecting de novo Robertsonian <b>translocations.</b> ConclusionAlthough AMA is an indication for amniocentesis in approximately two-fifths of cases with Robertsonian <b>translocations,</b> the indication of parent with abnormal karyotypes was more likely to lead to the detection of non-de novo Robertsonian <b>translocations,</b> suggesting that parents with abnormal karyotypes need careful prenatal consultation...|$|R

We have used a model in which chromosomal <b>translocations</b> are generated in mice de novo by Cre-loxP-mediated recombination (translocator mice) to compare the functionally relevant haematopoietic cell contexts for Mll fusions, namely pluripotent stem cells, semicommitted progenitors or committed cells. <b>Translocations</b> between Mll and Enl or Af 9 cause myeloid neoplasias, initiating in pluripotent stem cells or multipotent myeloid progenitors. However, while Mll-Enl <b>translocations</b> can also cause leukaemia from T-cell progenitors, no tumours arose with Mll-Af 9 <b>translocations</b> in the T-cell compartment.

The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the <b>translocation</b> of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation.

We demonstrate that developmentally regulated Cre-loxP-mediated interchromosomal recombination between the Mll gene, whose human counterpart is involved in a spectrum of leukemias, and the Enl gene creates reciprocal chromosomal <b>translocations</b> that cause myeloid tumors. There is a rapid onset and high penetrance of leukemogenesis in these translocator mice, and high proportions of cells carrying chromosomal <b>translocations</b> can be found in bone marrow as early as 12 days after birth.

40|$|Most Robertsonian <b>translocations</b> are dicentric, {{suggesting}} that the location of chromosomal breaks leading to their formation occur in the acrocentric short arm. Previous cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic {{studies have shown that}} few Robertsonian <b>translocations</b> retain ribosomal genes or beta-satellite DNA. Breakpoints in satellite III DNA, specifically between two chromosome 14 -specific subfamilies, pTRS- 47 and pTRS- 63, have been indicated for most of the dicentric 14 q 21 q and 13 q 14 q <b>translocations</b> that have been studied. We have analyzed the structure of 36 dicentric <b>translocations,</b> using several repetitive DNA probes that localize to the acrocentric short arm.

In 10 / 11 <b>translocations</b> involving chromosome 15, the presence of satellite III DNA was observed.

40|$|Three {{different}} {{samples of}} <b>translocations</b> were considered {{in an attempt}} to identify those chromosomal bands preferentially involved in variant Philadelphia chromosome (PH 1) <b>translocations,</b> and to compare them with bands preferentially broken in constitutional and sporadic <b>translocations.</b> The first sample included 204 cases of variant Ph 1 <b>translocations</b> with 221 identified break-points (bp), the second consisted of 106 cases of non-Robertsonian constitutional <b>translocations</b> with 213 bp identified, and the third one of 185 bp identified in sporadic <b>translocations</b> found occasionally in single cells of subjects with normal karyotypes and without haematological disorders. A statistical analysis demonstrated that there are some bands preferentially broken in each of the samples, and this {{with a high level of}} significance (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} {{with five}} biotin-labeled probes (three alphoid probes, a probe specific for beta-satellite sequences in all acrocentric chromosomes, and an rDNA probe) was used to characterize 30 different Robertsonian <b>translocations,</b> including three t(13; 13); one t(15; 15), four t(21; 21), three t(13; 14), two t(13; 15), two (13; 21), two t(13; 22), one t(14; 15), eight t(14; 21), two t(14; 22), and two t(21; 22). Of 8 de novo homologous <b>translocations,</b> only one t(13; 13) chromosome was interpreted as dicentric, while 19 of 22 nonhomologous Robertsonian <b>translocations</b> were dicentric.

40|$|Chromosomal <b>translocations</b> {{and other}} {{abnormalities}} {{are central to}} the initiation of cancer in all cell types. Understanding the mechanism is therefore important to evaluate the evolution of cancer from the cancer initiating events to overt disease. Recent work has concentrated on model systems to develop an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of <b>translocations</b> but naturally occurring events are more ideal case studies since biological selection is absent from model systems. In solid tumours, nonreciprocal <b>translocations</b> are most commonly found, and accordingly we have investigated the recurrent nonreciprocal t(3; 5) chromosomal <b>translocations</b> in renal carcinoma to better understand the mechanism of these naturally occurring <b>translocations</b> in cancer. Unexpectedly, the junctions of these <b>translocations</b> can be associated with site-specific, intrachromosomal inversion involving at least two double strand breaks (DSB) in cis and rejoining by nonhomologous end joining or micro-homology end joining. However, these <b>translocations</b> are not necessarily associated with transcribed regions questioning accessibility per se in controlling these events. In addition, intrachromosomal deletions also occur. We conclude these naturally occurring, nonreciprocal t(3; 5) chromosomal <b>translocations</b> occur after complex and multiple unresolved intrachromosomal DSBs leading to aberrant joining with concurrent interstitial inversion and that clonal selection of cells is the critical element in cancer development emerging from a plethora of DSBs that may not always be pathogenic. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
