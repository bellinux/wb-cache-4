5|$|After {{the threat}} from {{invasion}} muted in 1941, the Command's attention turned to the Battle of the Atlantic. During this time, the Command used the Martin Maryland, which excelled in PR work. On 13 July 1941, the first PR Mosquito arrived, though it was some time before the aircraft was operational. By September 1941, the operational strength of the PRU's first flight was 37 Spitfires, two Marylands and two Mosquitoes. The long-range Spitfires and Mosquitoes could reach deep into German airspace, and photograph the Baltic Sea ports and monitor German surface ships. Flights of eight hours were not uncommon. One Spitfire reached Gdynia, searching for the German battleship Tirpitz. Tactics needed to vary to avoid Spitfires being intercepted by German patrols at heights of 30,000ft. Constant trips alerted the Germans to the British operations, but the Admiralty insisted in the volume of flights so they could keep <b>tabs</b> on German capital ships. With surprise lost, the only solution was to change the height and directions of approach.|$|E
40|$|The cytokines IL- 1 and TNF induce {{expression}} {{of a series of}} genes that regulate inflammation through activation of NF-κB signal transduction pathways. TAK 1, a MAPKKK, is critical for both IL- 1 - and TNF-induced activation of the NF-κB pathway. <b>TAB</b> 2, a TAK 1 -binding protein, is involved in IL- 1 -induced NF-κB activation by physically linking TAK 1 to TRAF 6. However, IL- 1 -induced activation of NF-κB is not impaired in <b>TAB</b> 2 -deficient embryonic fibroblasts. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel protein designated <b>TAB</b> 3, a <b>TAB</b> 2 -like molecule that associates with TAK 1 and can activate NF-κB similar to <b>TAB</b> 2. Endogenous <b>TAB</b> 3 interacts with TRAF 6 and TRAF 2 in an IL- 1 - and a TNF-dependent manner, respectively. Further more, IL- 1 signaling leads to the ubiquitination of <b>TAB</b> 2 and <b>TAB</b> 3 through TRAF 6. Cotransfection of siRNAs directed against both <b>TAB</b> 2 and <b>TAB</b> 3 inhibit both IL- 1 - and TNF-induced activation of TAK 1 and NF-κB. These results suggest that <b>TAB</b> 2 and <b>TAB</b> 3 function redundantly as mediators of TAK 1 activation in IL- 1 and TNF signal transduction...|$|R

5|$|In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became Secretary-General of the Soviet Communist Party. A reformer, he {{implemented}} {{measures to}} increase {{freedom of the}} press (glasnost) and economic decentralization (perestroika) in an attempt to strengthen socialism. Like many orthodox Marxist critics, Castro feared that the reforms would weaken the socialist state and allow capitalist elements to regain control. Gorbachev conceded to U.S. demands to reduce support for Cuba, with Soviet-Cuban relations deteriorating. When Gorbachev visited Cuba in April 1989, he informed Castro that perestroika meant an end to subsidies for Cuba. Ignoring calls for liberalization in accordance with the Soviet example, Castro continued to clamp down on internal dissidents and in particular kept <b>tabs</b> on the military, the primary threat to the government. A number of senior military officers, including Ochoa and Tony de la Guardia, were investigated for corruption and complicity in cocaine smuggling, tried, and executed in 1989, despite calls for leniency. On medical advice given him in October 1985, Castro gave up regularly smoking Cuban cigars, helping to set an example {{for the rest of the}} populace. Castro became passionate in his denunciation of the Third World debt problem, arguing that the Third World would never escape the debt that First World banks and governments imposed upon it. In 1985, Havana hosted five international conferences on the world debt problem.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Kabuto's defeat and needing answers, Sasuke exposes Orochimaru's survival as the Cursed Seals are revealed to hold a copy of Orochimaru's consciousness in it along with the cells of Orochimaru that Kabuto injected into himself and subjugated. Using the Cursed Seal Orochimaru placed on his former student, Anko Mitarashi, Sasuke releases Orochimaru and gives him a new body which Jugo provides with an absorbed part of Kabuto's flesh. Despite expressing {{no interest in the}} ongoing war and still desiring to claim Sasuke's body, Orochimaru then joins Sasuke in his quest for answers over the nature of ninja, taking him and Taka to the Nara Shrine where he undoes the Reaper Death Seal and regains the use of ninjutsu before transferring his being into one of the White Zetsu clones placed on Sasuke. In his new body, Orochimaru then brings the first four Hokage back to life with the Reanimation Jutsu to give Sasuke the answers he wants. Once Sasuke got his answer from Hashirama, out of curiosity to see his former apprentice's new path while the actions of Madara and Obito jeopardize his laboratories, Orochimaru offers to help the Allied Shinobi Forces by first coming to the aid of Tsunade and the Kage and assist in subduing the Shinju. After the Fourth Great Ninja War ended, among those caught under Madara's Infinite Tsukiyomi before being freed, Orochimaru resumes his experiments with Team Taka (minus Sasuke who returns to Konoha) supporting him as lab assistants, though Konoha remains suspicious of him and keeps <b>tabs</b> on him in case he resumes his former human experimentation activities.|$|E

40|$|Macrophages play diverse {{roles in}} tissue {{homeostasis}} and immunity, and canonically activated macrophages are critically associated with acute inflammatory responses. It {{is known that}} activated macrophages undergo cell death after transient activation in some settings, and the viability of macrophages impacts on inflammatory status. Here we report that TGFb-activated kinase (TAK 1) activators, TAK 1 -binding protein 1 (<b>TAB</b> 1) and TAK 1 -binding protein 2 (<b>TAB</b> 2), are critical molecules in the regulation of activated macrophage survival. While deletion of Tak 1 induced cell death in bone marrow derived macrophages even without activation, <b>Tab</b> 1 or <b>Tab</b> 2 deletion alone did not profoundly affect survival of naı̈ve macrophages. However, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -activated macrophages, even single deletion of <b>Tab</b> 1 or <b>Tab</b> 2 resulted in macrophage death with both necrotic and apoptotic features. We show that <b>TAB</b> 1 and <b>TAB</b> 2 were redundantly involved in LPS-induced TAK 1 activation in macrophages. These results demonstrate that TAK 1 activity {{is the key to}} activated macrophage survival. Finally, in an in vivo setting, <b>Tab</b> 1 deficiency impaired increase of peritoneal macrophages upon LPS challenge, suggesting that TAK 1 complex regulation of macrophages may participate in in vivo macrophage homeostasis. Our results demonstrate that <b>TAB</b> 1 and <b>TAB</b> 2 are required for activated macrophages, making <b>TAB</b> 1 and <b>TAB</b> 2 effective targets to control inflammation by modulating macrophage survival...|$|R
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} β-activated kinase 1 (TAK 1) kinase is an {{indispensable}} signaling intermediate in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 1, and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways. TAK 1 -binding protein 2 (<b>TAB</b> 2) and its closely related protein, <b>TAB</b> 3, are binding partners of TAK 1 and have previously {{been identified as}} adaptors of TAK 1 that recruit TAK 1 to a TNF receptor signaling complex. <b>TAB</b> 2 and <b>TAB</b> 3 redundantly mediate activation of TAK 1. In this study, we investigated the role of <b>TAB</b> 2 by analyzing fibroblasts having targeted deletion of the <b>tab</b> 2 gene. In <b>TAB</b> 2 -deficient fibroblasts, TAK 1 was associated with <b>TAB</b> 3 and was activated following TNF stimulation. However, <b>TAB</b> 2 -deficient fibroblasts displayed a significantly prolonged activation of TAK 1 compared with wild type control cells. This suggests that <b>TAB</b> 2 mediates deactivation of TAK 1. We found that a TAK 1 -negative regulator, protein phosphatase 6 (PP 6), was recruited to the TAK 1 complex in wild type but not in <b>TAB</b> 2 -deficient fibroblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that both PP 6 and <b>TAB</b> 2 interacted with the polyubiquitin chains and this interaction mediated the assembly with TAK 1. Our results indicate that <b>TAB</b> 2 not only activates TAK 1 but also plays {{an essential role in}} the deactivation of TAK 1 by recruiting PP 6 through a polyubiquitin chain-dependent mechanism...|$|R
