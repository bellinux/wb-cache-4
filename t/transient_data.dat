The leakage signals can be captured and analysed using side-channel analysis techniques. This paper describes a current research project to explore the application of statistical analysis to measured electromagnetic emissions from a smart card system. Experimental results showed that logic state switching transient currents contain information related to the hamming weights of processed data. A differential side channel analysis (DSCA) technique was applied and it demonstrated that good correlation could be obtained when a correct sub-key was encountered.

Specifically, an action accepts data passed to it via the current information — the <b>transient</b> <b>data</b> given to it, the bindings received by it, and {{the current state of}} storage — and, from this, gives new <b>transient</b> <b>data,</b> creates new bindings, updates the state of storage, or any combination of these.

40|$|The Internet-of-Things (IoT) {{paradigm}} envisions {{billions of}} devices all {{connected to the}} Internet, generating low-rate monitoring and measurement data to be delivered to application servers or end-users. Recently, the possibility of applying innetwork data caching techniques to IoT traffic flows has been discussed in research forums. The main challenge {{as opposed to the}} typically cached content at routers, e. g. multimedia files, is that IoT data are transient and therefore require different caching policies. In fact, the emerging location-based services can also benefit from new caching techniques that are specifically designed for small <b>transient</b> <b>data.</b> This paper studies in-network caching of <b>transient</b> <b>data</b> at content routers, considering a key temporal data property: data item lifetime. An analytical model that captures the trade-off between multihop communication costs and data item freshness is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that caching <b>transient</b> <b>data</b> is a promising information-centric networking technique that can reduce the distance between content requesters and the location in the network where the content is fetched from. To the best of our knowledge, this is a pioneering research work aiming to systematically analyse the feasibility and benefit of using Internet routers to cache <b>transient</b> <b>data</b> generated by IoT applications...|$|E

30|$|With {{permanent}} down-hole gauges (PDGs) widely {{installed in}} oilfields {{around the world}} in recent years, a continuous stream of <b>transient</b> pressure <b>data</b> in real time is now available, which motivates a new round of research interests in further developing pressure transient processing and analysis techniques. Transient pressure measurements from PDG are characterized by long term and high volume data. These data are recorded under unconstrained circumstances, so effects due to noise, rate fluctuation and interference from other wells cannot be avoided. These effects make the measured pressure trends decline or rise and then obscure or distort the actual flow behavior, which makes subsequent analysis difficult. In this paper, the problems encountered in analysis of PDG transient pressure are investigated. A newly developed workflow for processing and analyzing PDG <b>transient</b> pressure <b>data</b> is proposed. Numerical well testing synthetic studies are performed to demonstrate these procedures. The results prove that this new technique works well and the potential for practical application looks very promising.|$|R
