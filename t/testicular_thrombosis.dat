40|$|A 24 -y-old {{male who}} {{developed}} necrotic lesions {{on the lower}} extremities together with <b>testicular</b> <b>thrombosis</b> necessitating orchiectomy, demonstrated high level IgG anticardiolipin (aCL) asso-ciated with acute HIV infection. This {{is one of the}} first cases describing a close relationship between viral infection and the classic antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). It is well documented that HIV patients may produce antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), but the full-blown picture of the APS is distinctly uncommon with HIV or any other viral infection, possibly due to the overproduction of the IgM isotype rather than IgG aCL as in this case. The induction of thrombosis following infections has been well described in patients with catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) but not in patients with the ‘classic or simple ’ APS.

40|$|Methoxamine, a pure alpha-adrenergic {{stimulating}} agent, {{has little}} cardiac stimulating capacity {{but is a}} very potent vasoconstrictor. Currently, its clinical use is limited to correction of hypotensive crises during anaesthesia and surgical shock. A single injection of methoxamine will produce hypertension and marked medial arterial necrosis in animals. In this connection, we subjected arteriosclerotic and non-arteriosclerotic animals to a single injection of methoxamine and sacrificed the animals 4 hours, 2, 5 and 7 days later {{in order to determine}} whether the arteriosclerotic animals would differ from the non-arteriosclerotic animals in their response to the medial necrosis inducing effects of methoxamine. Within minutes after injection, the animals became prostrate, developed congestive heart failure and mortality was high. Myocardial infarction, adrenocortical haemorrhage and thymic, involution, intestinal gangrene as well as splenic, renal and <b>testicular</b> <b>thrombosis</b> and infarction were prevalent. Serum CPK, SGOT, glucose, triglyceride, free fatty acids, cholesterol, BUN and corticosterone manifested dynamic increases but the pattern of response was quite different in the arteriosclerotic vs. non-arteriosclerotic animals. Although extensive medial necrosis was produced in the medium-sized arteries of animals with previously normal arteries, the damage was promptly repaired; the animals with pre-existing arteriosclerosis were not affected by the pressor effects of methoxamine. The induction of myocardial infarction, and extensive thrombosis and infarction are ascribed to the bradycardia-inducing effects of methoxamine and the medial necrosis-inducing effects are ascribed to its intense vasopressor activity...|$|E
40|$|Objective - Serine {{protease}} inhibitors (serpin) play {{a central}} role in various pathological processes including coagulation, fibrinolysis, malignancy, and inflammation. Inhibition of serpins may prove therapeutic. As yet, however, only very few small molecule serpin inhibitors have been reported. For the first time, we apply a new approach of virtual screening to discover novel, orally active, small molecule serpin inhibitors and report their effectiveness. Methods and Results - We focused on a clinically important serpin, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), whose crystal structure has been described. We identify novel, orally active molecules able to enter into the strand 4 position (s 4 A) of the A beta-sheet of PAI-I as a mock compound. In vitro they specifically inhibit the PAI- 1 activity and enhance fibrinolysis activity. In vivo the most effective molecule (TM 5007) inhibits coagulation in 2 models: a rat arteriovenous (AV) shunt model and a mouse model of ferric chloride - induced <b>testicular</b> artery <b>thrombosis.</b> It also prevents the fibrotic process initiated by bleomycin in mouse lung. Conclusions - The present study demonstrates beneficial in vitro and in vivo effects of novel PAI- 1 inhibitors. Our methodology proves to be a useful tool to obtain effective inhibitors of serpin activity...|$|R
