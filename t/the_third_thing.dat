5|$|Mac {{decides to}} move to Sheffield {{to get a better}} job, taking Emily with him. Before he leaves, Mac bets Guy that he cannot sleep with Joanna. Guy accepts the bet and takes her home. However, Martin has {{discovered}} some shocking news and tries his best to stop them having sex, but is distracted by Karen's affections. Caroline does her best to break up the relationship between Mac and Emily, but it is Emily who breaks up with Mac. Caroline accused Emily of being a fake but was proved wrong. Mac found this amusing and so Emily dumps him. Mac then tells Caroline that he felt three things when she had accused his then girlfriend: he was impressed and amused, but instead of saying <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> he kisses her.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} {{a case of}} corpse {{contamination}} of three things in succession (where two are rendered impure with seven-day impurity and one with an impurity until the evening) occurs when a utensil touching a corpse becomes a [...] "father of fathers of impurity" [...] ( [...] , avi avot ha-tumah) like the corpse, as [...] says, [...] "whoever in the open field touches one that is slain with a sword, or one that died [...] [...] [...] shall be impure seven days," [...] and from the words [...] "slain with a sword," [...] the Rabbis deduced that [...] "a sword is like the one slain" [...] ( [...] , cherev harei hu kechalal), and thus a utensil that touches a corpse is a [...] "father of fathers of impurity" [...] ( [...] , avi avot ha-tumah) like the corpse. And another utensil touching this first utensil is rendered impure — a [...] "father of impurity" [...] ( [...] , av ha-tumah) — and both utensils acquire a seven-day impurity. But <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> in this series, whether a person or a utensil, is then rendered impure with an impurity lasting until the evening — a first-grade impurity ( [...] , rishon l'tumah).|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, it helped me a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E
60|$|Stukeley, in alarm, ordered Cotterell to get {{his master}} back to bed and to foment him, which was done. But {{on the next day}} there was no improvement, and on <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>things</b> were in far more serious case. The skin of his brow and arms and breast was inflamed, and covered with horrible purple blotches--the result of an {{otherwise}} harmless ointment with which the French empiric had supplied him.|$|R
50|$|Joel Keller, {{reviewer}} at TV Squad {{described the}} casting of Harvey Fierstein as Lily's smoking voice as only <b>the</b> <b>third</b> funniest <b>thing</b> in <b>the</b> episode.

6000|$|She was <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> {{feminine}} to kiss Lewisham {{since the}} promiscuous {{days of his}} babyhood. [...] "I was so afraid--There!" [...] She laughed hysterically.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> quarter, <b>things</b> {{got worse}} for Maryland as the Cavaliers added {{a field goal}} and another touchdown. In a final drive for 46yards, Maryland {{attempted}} to avert a shutout. The effort fell short when a Turner pass was intercepted. The final result was 31–0.|$|R
60|$|Third, Having shown you wherein this unity consists, I {{now come}} to <b>the</b> <b>third</b> general <b>thing</b> propounded, and that is, {{to show you the}} fruits and {{benefits}} of unity and peace; together with the mischiefs and inconveniences that attend those churches where unity and peace are wanting.|$|R

6000|$|Note the abruptness {{and vigor}} of the style. Where {{does it seem}} effective? Where unduly harsh? Why does the poet welcome <b>the</b> <b>third</b> bard? What <b>things</b> does the poem satirize? ...|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> quarter, <b>things</b> {{continued}} {{to get worse}} for the Browns as running back Ray Rice got a 9-yard touchdown run. In the fourth quarter, Cleveland would manage {{to get on the}} board as kicker Billy Cundiff made a 29-yard field goal. Afterwards, Baltimore closed out the game as quarterback Joe Flacco completed a 72-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Derrick Mason.|$|R
6000|$|... "My darling, {{what else}} is there to do?" [...] {{reasoned}} the Irishman. [...] "What other occupation is there for an active man on this earth, except to marry you? What's the alternative to marriage, barring sleep? It's not liberty, Rosamund. Unless you marry God, as our nuns do in Ireland, you must marry Man--that is Me. <b>The</b> only <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> is to marry yourself-- yourself, yourself, yourself--the only companion that is never satisfied-- and never satisfactory." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ethel laughed. [...] "That's <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> {{you have}} taught me--to thread a needle, tie a bow, and stick in a pin! I never could learn those things {{of any one}} else; they show, but don't explain the theory." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{here was}} the best and easiest {{opportunity}} of doing <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> which Kate {{had asked him to}} do; but his heart did not bound to do it. He sat and looked at the man on the river bank.|$|E

"By <b>the</b> <b>third</b> day, <b>things</b> being much quieter, {{my friend}} the preacher and I, being calm {{in the hand}} of God, journeyed up Mauna Loa and gazed into the awful pit of Kilauea.

2500|$|In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> quarter, <b>things</b> {{started to}} get grim for San Diego as Minnesota took the lead with Peterson getting a 64-yard TD run and QB Brooks Bollinger {{completing}} a 40-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. [...] In the fourth quarter, the Chargers tried to come back as kicker Nate Kaeding nailed a 36-yard field goal. [...] Unfortunately, the Vikings sealed the win with Peterson getting a 46-yard TD run, along with RB Chester Taylor getting a 2-yard TD run.

60|$|I will omit making mention {{again of}} the encouragements spoken of before, and shall now come to <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> {{specified}} {{in this part of}} the text, to wit, to show more distinctly, who, and what particular persons they are, who are concerned in this exhortation to hope.|$|E
6000|$|Then <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> needed was, I said, that a {{man should}} be a good judge of his work; and this chiefly {{that he may not}} be {{dependent}} upon popular opinion for the manner of doing it, but also that he may have the just encouragement of the sense of progress, and an honest consciousness of victory: how else can he become ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} the subject {{had to be}} hastily dropped. Lady Susan bore down upon them, leaning {{on the arm of}} Clovis's mother, to whom she was confiding the fact that she {{disapprove}}d of the craze for Pekingese spaniels. It was <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> she had found time to disapprove of since lunch, without counting her silent and permanent disapproval of the way Clovis's mother did her hair.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>third</b> lap <b>things</b> {{had changed}} yet again. With two laps left {{a group of three}} Belgians (Goossens, Peeters and Schuermans) was in the lead, Nieuwenhuis falling a few seconds behind. In the fourth lap Schuermans fell after a {{downhill}} section, taking Goossens down with him. This gave Peeters a small lead on everyone without particularly trying. This gap was quickly bridged by another Belgian, Aerts, creating a group of two Belgians with just over one lap to go. Nieuwenhuis followed closely behind and reached the two just {{at the start of the}} last lap.|$|R
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>third</b> quarter, <b>things</b> {{got worse}} for the Niners as Giants DE Osi Umenyiora sacked Dilfer, causing a fumble, picked up the loose ball, and ran 75 yards for a touchdown. San Francisco would manage to get a safety as FB Moran Norris blocked a punt, which went out of bounds in the endzone. In the fourth quarter, New York sealed its win with Manning {{completing}} a 2-yard TD pass to TE Jeremy Shockey. The Niners ended its day with Dilfer completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR Darrell Jackson (with a failed 2-point conversion).|$|R

6000|$|Dickory still sat motionless, {{gazing at}} Newcombe. He didn't {{want to tell}} this man {{anything}}. He didn't {{want to have anything}} to do with him. He hesitated, but he could not forget <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> he had been asked to do, and who had asked him to do it.

6000|$|... 2. As this {{unity and}} peace may consist in the ignorance of many truths, {{and in the}} holding some errors, so it must consist with, and it cannot consist without, the believing and practising those things which are {{necessary}} to salvation and church communion; and they are, (1.) Believing that Christ the Son of God died {{for the sins of}} men. (2.) That whoever believeth ought to be baptized. (3.) <b>The</b> <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> essential to this communion is a holy and a blameless conversation.|$|E
60|$|A Measure of Value,(224) in the {{ordinary}} {{sense of the word}} measure, would mean something by comparison with which we may ascertain what is the value of any other thing.

50|$|There {{are plenty}} of mavericks and weirdoes in the Autobot ranks, {{but most of them}} are down and dirty warriors {{fighting}} for freedom against the Decepticons. Sunstreaker is in a totally different class, and he makes no secret {{of the fact that he}} knows it. In fact, he thinks hes the hottest thing on wheels. When it comes to a fight, winning is only <b>the</b> second or <b>third</b> <b>thing</b> on his list, after protecting his artillery-resistant hide from scuffs and scratches, and making sure reflected laser light glints just so off his paint job.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Spencer has {{misunderstood}} me {{in another}} particular. He supposes [...] that the co-existence spoken {{of in the}} axiom, of two things with <b>the</b> [...] same <b>third</b> <b>thing,</b> means simultaneousness in time. The co-existence [...] meant is that of being jointly attributes of the same subject. The [...] attribute of being born without teeth, and the attribute of having [...] thirty-two teeth in mature age, are in this sense co-existent, both [...] being attributes of man, though ex vi termini never of the same [...] man at the same time.|$|R
