5|$|At the Red Electoral Alliance's city {{convention}} Folkvord {{was elected}} their lead candidate in Oslo for the 2005 election. Folkvord, along with Torstein Dahle, {{were the only}} representatives from the party who had a chance of gaining a seat in parliament. Jens Stoltenberg, leader of the Labour Party, was negative towards {{the idea of having}} any representatives from the Red Electoral Alliance in parliament, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> should do anything in their power to stop them from earning a seat in parliament.

5|$|In November 1960, Lord Stansgate died. Benn {{automatically}} {{became a}} peer, preventing him from {{sitting in the}} House of Commons. The Speaker of the Commons, Sir Harry Hylton-Foster, did not allow him to deliver a speech from the bar of the House of Commons in April 1961 when the by-election was being called. Continuing to maintain his right to abandon his peerage, Benn fought to retain his seat in a by-election caused by his succession on 4 May 1961. Although he was disqualified from taking his seat, he was re-elected. An election court found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> were fully aware that Benn was disqualified, and declared the seat won by the Conservative runner-up, Malcolm St Clair, {{who was at the}} time also the heir presumptive to a peerage.|$|E

25|$|During the {{existence}} of this constituency, Bristol was a city with the status of being a county of itself. That meant that the city was not subject to the administration of the officials of the geographic counties in which it was situated. In electoral terms it meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> for the parliamentary borough included those qualified on the same 40 shilling freeholder franchise as that for a county constituency. Other electors qualified as freemen of the borough. These were the ancient right franchises, applicable to Bristol, preserved by the Reform Act 1832, which also introduced a broader occupation franchise for all borough constituencies.|$|E

When League Commissioner Gary Bettman visited Columbus {{to meet with the}} community's leaders about the franchise proposal, there was concern <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> might not pass the needed referendum. The civic leaders told Bettman {{that they would not be}} willing to foot the bill for the team if the referendum failed. However, just after the meeting adjourned, John H. McConnell (one of those who entered the bid) privately guaranteed Bettman that an arena would be built, referendum or not.|$|E

500|$|The {{by-election}} {{was triggered}} {{by the death of}} Sibu's incumbent Member of Parliament, Robert Lau Hoi Chew on 9 April 2010. The Election Commission subsequently set down the by-election for 16 May 2010, with candidate nominations to occur on 8 May. [...] Within a few days, the Sibu branch of SUPP recommended Robert Lau Hui Yew to contest the by-election for the governing Barisan Nasional coalition. Hui Yew was the second cousin of Hoi Chew and the son of Lau Swee Nguong, chairman of the KTS Group of companies. On 14 April, the opposition has decided that a DAP candidate should contest the by-election. Opposition Leader and People's Justice Party (PKR) adviser Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim scheduled a visit to Sibu on 18 April. On the same day, Sarawak Pakatan Rakyat was formed as an opposition coalition composed of the DAP, PKR, and the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) — all members of the national Pakatan Rakyat coalition — and the local Sarawak National Party. The Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin visited Sibu on 19 April, expressing confidence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> were leaning towards supporting Barisan Nasional.|$|E

The DAP has also challenge candidate Robert Lau to make his stand about the ban on non-Muslims using the word “Allah” with DAP MP Teresa Kok stating that [...] "If Robert Lau intends to be a Member of Parliament that speaks up for a Christian-majority constituency, Sibu, then he has the moral duty to declare his stand on this thorny issue, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> in Sibu can decide whether they can count on him to speak up on this issue," [...] Another issue that was brought up during the by-election was {{the decision of the}} Home Ministry to destroy the 5,000 copies of Indonesian Bibles confiscated.|$|E

Boisclair said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> clearly did not support a strategy of a rapid referendum in the first mandate of a PQ government.

Pye acknowledged his difficulty expressing himself, writing that 'I had the mortification to be neglected in my education, went to sea at 14 without any, and a man of war was my university.'

2500|$|On November 19, 2006, Governor Romney led a rally {{against the}} legislature's delaying tactics {{in front of}} the Massachusetts State House. Romney said: [...] "The issue before us is not whether {{same-sex}} couples should marry. The issue before us today is whether 109 legislators will follow the constitution." [...] He said he would ask a justice of the SJC to order the initiative placed on the ballot because the legislators were refusing to fulfill their constitutional obligations. The next day he sent the 109 legislators a copy of the state constitution with a letter underscoring the document's provision that the legislators sitting as a constitutional convention shall vote on initiatives: [...] "Not 'may' vote ... not 'could' vote ... not 'perhaps' vote ... It's very clear." [...] His reference was to the clause: [...] "final legislative action in the joint session ... shall be taken only by call of the yeas and nays". He filed the lawsuit as one member of a group of private citizens on November 24, citing 5 occasions in 24 years in which the legislature failed to vote on valid initiatives. Other plaintiffs included Ray Flynn and officials of VoteOnMarriage.org and the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. Named as defendants were the Massachusetts Secretary of State, who oversees the preparation of election ballots, William F. Galvin, and the President of the Massachusetts Senate who chairs joint sessions of the legislature, Senator Travaglini. After a 20-minute hearing on November 30, Associate Justice Judith A. Cowin ordered an expedited hearing before the full SJC on December 20. At that hearing both sides agreed that the SJC could not enforce an order against the legislature. An attorney for the plaintiffs said: [...] "We're not asking you to tell the Legislature how to do their business. We're only asking you to declare what their constitutional obligations are." [...] An Assistant Attorney General representing the legislature countered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>voters</b> were free to replace the legislators at the next election.|$|E

The old warriors have retired, and many are dead; the good old methods are becoming obsolete. We never bothered about those mischievous things called primaries.
