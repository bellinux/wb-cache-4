The instrument of Accession to the Common Market made provision for Suriname {{to implement the}} arrangements relating to the Common Market effective 1 January 1996. Suriname's accession to the Community and the Common Market led to significant changes in Suriname's external trade policy as prior to accession, a multiple tariff regime ranging from 0 to 100 percent under the Brussels <b>Tariff</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> (BTN) classification system was in force. In preparation for CARICOM membership, this system was replaced in 1994 with the Harmonized System (HS) {{used as the basis}} for determining duty-free entry of goods of CARICOM origin and for applying the common external tariff. Suriname's 1996 entry into the free trade area was immediate with no major transition phase contemplated in the accession agreement apart from some exceptions granted under the Treaty of Chaguaramas and a few others negotiated by Suriname upon entry.|$|E

40|$|Resume The {{submitted}} thesis {{deals with}} customs {{as an instrument}} of custom tarrif regulation in European Union and in the Ukraine. This thesis defines in detail customs tariff regulation from prospective of financial and custom law in both legal systems. It further represents the views of the main principles of customs regulation, defines customs tarrif, its basic elements and types, and also compares legislation in the Ukraine and in European Union. The legal sources in the field of customs tarrif regulation valid for both in the Ukraine and in European Union are also stated. The main part of the work is dealing with the Community Customs Code, Code's implementing provisions (Commision Regulation No 2454 / 93), Common Customs tariff of the EU, which is the external tariff applied to products imported into the European Union, and Combined <b>Nomenclature</b> as the <b>tariff</b> and statistical <b>nomenclature</b> of the Customs Union. The Ukrainian Customs tariff Act and the Ukrainian Clasification of Comodities in foreign trade contain the comodity nomenclature of foreign trade. The last part of the thesis deals with value of goods and contry of origin of goods. I describe here the definition of value of goods and methods of its assessment in Ukraine and European Union.

As part of the function desired by trading system for Singapore Customs, an auto-categorization system is expected to accurately classify products into HS codes based on the text description of the goods declaration so to increase the overall usability of the trading system. Background Nets approach has been adopted as the key technique for the development of classification engine in the system. Experimental results indicate the potential of this approach in text categorization with ill-defined vocabularies and complex semantics...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} a {{quantitative assessment of}} the potential impacts {{of the formation of}} a COMESA customs union, specifically of having free trade among COMESA countries while imposing a common external tariff against imports from outside COMESA. The study uses an expanded version of the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database and capitalizes on the Modeling International Relationships in Applied General Equilibrium (MIRAGE) Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for analysis. Two different assumptions are made regarding the number of sensitive products excluded from the CET rates— 2 percent or 5 percent. The simulation exercise involved four scenarios to compare the impacts of the customs union under two alternative specifications of sensitive products, and the impacts of three alternative membership assumptions on the COMESA region. The alternative COMESA customs union scenarios are designed at the detailed Harmonized System at the six digit level (HS 6), combining information on the current applied protection from the 2004 MAcMap data base and the COMESA <b>Tariff</b> <b>Nomenclature...</b>|$|E
40|$|The member {{countries}} of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) have agreed to launch a customs union by December 2008. We provide a quantitative assessment of the likely impacts {{of the formation of}} a COMESA customs union, specifically of having free trade among COMESA countries while imposing a common external tariff (CET) against third countries. Along with the MIRAGE CGE model, we use an expanded version of the GTAP Data Base that provides more regional disaggregation in Africa. Alternative COMESA customs union scenarios are designed at the detailed HS 6 level, combining information on current applied protection from the 2004 MAcMap data base and the COMESA <b>Tariff</b> <b>Nomenclature.</b> Adoption of the COMESA CET will result in significant liberalization for most COMESA countries but some countries will have to increase protection. We find that the customs union will result in expansion of trade and will be beneficial for some but will result in negative real income for most COMESA countries. The results are diverse due to the heterogeneity of the COMESA economies in terms of their economic structure and trade and protection patterns...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: {{whiplash}} is {{a frequent}} post traumatic pathology caused by muscle, tendon and capsular elements over stretching. The authors conducted a short term prospective randomised study to test {{the effectiveness of a}} multi wave High Power Laser Therapy (HPLT) versus conventional simple segmental physical rehabilitation (PT) included in Italian <b>tariff</b> <b>nomenclature</b> performance physiotherapy Study Design: prospective randomised study (Level II). Material and methods: the authors identified 135 homogeneous patients with whiplash grade 1 - 2 of the Quebec Task Force classification (QTFC). INAIL, the Italian National Workers Insurance, based in Milan, was reliable source for identifying patients. All patients with whiplash injuries grade 1 or 2 QTFC, were eligible for the study, starting from April 28 2010 to September 30 2010. Patients referred to a Coordinator (C. M.) who applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients who agreed to participate were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the two treatment groups. Dates for initial treatment session were arranged, including cervical spine X-ray, and assessment. Each patient gave informed consent for participation and agreed to adopt only the study treatment for 6 weeks. Group A (84 patients) was treated with High Power Laser Therapy (HPLT), Group B (51 patients) received conventional simple segmental physical rehabilitation (PT). During the treatment period, no other electro-medical therapy, analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs were allowed. All patients were assessed at baseline (T 0) and at the end of the treatment period (T 1) using a Visual Analogical Scale (VAS), (T 2) the date of return to work was registered afterwards. Results: there was a reduction in VAS pain scores at T 1. Group A (VAS = 20) Group B (VAS = 34, 8) (p = 0. 0048). Laser treatment allowed quick recovery and return to work (T 2). Group A after 48 days against 66 days of Group B (p= 0. 0005). Conclusions: results suggest that High Power Laser Therapy - is an effective treatment in patients with whiplash injury, compared to conventional simple segmental physical rehabilitatio...|$|E
40|$|Information, Communications and Technologies (ICTs) play {{a crucial}} role in {{improving}} the quality of lives by facilitating the promotion of economic, social and human development. ICTs enable trade in other sectors by enhancing market access and broadening the customer base, facilitating customs, transport and logistics. Computer and internet usage is generally recognized for its significant contribution to a broad variety of activities and economic growth. However, Cambodia is lacking behind other countries in terms of promoting and facilitating trade of ICT goods with the rest of the world. As compared to countries with per capita incomes below US$ 1, 000, Cambodia’s Personal Computer (PC) penetration rate is 5. 4 times less than its potential. This is mainly due to the high tariff rates for ICT products thereby resulting into low computer penetration and preventing the country from the benefits of ICT use. Currently ICT products and particularly PCs are subjected to 15 percent tariff. Besides, the tariff duty of 15 percent, PC related products are subjected to a Value Added Tax (VAT) of 10 percent. According to the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA), Cambodia has approved the importation tariff duty of 5 percent on some of the IT related products but the implementation of the Harmonized System Code (HS) and ASEAN Harmonized <b>Tariff</b> <b>Nomenclature</b> (AHTN) are yet to be put in force. Additionally, the e-ASEAN framework, which Cambodia has signed, requires members to eliminate import tariffs and non-tariff barriers on intra-ASEAN trade of ICT products in three tranches. Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and VietNam (CLMV) will implement the three tranches in January 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively. There is a compelling argument to encourage Cambodia to adopt tax rates similar to countries that have signed the ITA, where duties have been reduced to zero or near zero to expand the market and increase PC penetration. Cambodia joined the WTO in October 2004, and is yet to be a signatory of the IT Agreement. Compared to other developing countries like the Philippines and Thailand, the nonzero tariff scheme on computers has led Cambodia to a slower adoption of ICT. The high tax rates has resulted in high prices to end consumers, hampering wider scale PC adoption and encouraging informal imports. Informal imports hinder the ability for legitimate distributors to compete legally on price and deprive the government of import tax revenue. Cambodia recently announced a reduction of import duty to zero percent on IT products from ASEAN countries. However, finished IT products can arrive from any parts of the world in the global supply chain or some components may originate from within ASEAN countries. The new “zero duty on ASEAN originated product” is in the process of implementation. Apart from tax, there are other factors that contribute to the price of the ICT products in Cambodian market, especially PCs. Some of the causes include price differential resulting from unpaid tariffs of informal importation of PC which make the formal ones face high competition as they need to pay all tariffs and other necessary legal fees. Another barrier is the poor infrastructure of importation procedures making Cambodia less competitive compared to neighboring countries. Low level of investment incentive for the ICT industry also affects the price of ICT products in the country. The study comes out with specific suggestion to increase the potential growth for PC related products. ICT agreement among ASEAN members is quite beneficial in improving the ICT intertrade within ASEAN countries. It is important for Cambodia to sign the ITA agreement with WTO to expand the trade facilitation with other non-ASEAN member states. Awareness generation among the business community on CEPT and ASEAN agreement is vital for an informed IT business community.
