The Vitaphoned songs and some dialogue have been introduced most adroitly. This in itself is an ambitious move, for in the expression of song the Vitaphone vitalizes the production enormously. The dialogue is not so effective, for it does not always catch the nuances of speech or inflections of the voice so that one is {{not aware of the}} mechanical features.|$|E
2500|$|Aguilera's fifth studio album, Back to Basics, which {{consists}} of two discs, was released in August 2006. The second disc, described by Aguilera herself as [...] "a '20s, '30s vibe," [...] was solely produced by her longtime collaborater–producer Linda Perry. During the recording session, Aguilera wanted to record a song about the pain of losing a loved one and asked Perry for help. Perry developed the idea while thinking about her father, who had died less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> She revealed, [...] "And she [...] came to me, and had these two chords that her and this guy wrote, and she was like 'I really like these chords, can you turn this into a song? I want the song to be about losing someone'. And inside of me, I'm going 'You little fucking bitch, you totally know I lost my dad, and now you're gonna milk my emotions.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing for {{the album}} began shortly after Adele {{separated}} from her lover. Within a day of her break-up, she contacted producer Paul Epworth, intent on capturing her emotion in a song: [...] "We'd had a fuming argument the night before ... I'd been bubbling. Then I went into the studio and screamed." [...] Although she had initially planned on completing a ballad that she had begun writing with Epworth more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> the producer suggested that she aim for a more aggressive sound. Together, they restructured the song and re-wrote lyrics to reflect Adele's recent experience, deciding on the title [...] "Rolling in the Deep." [...] The instrumentation evolved organically—after trying out various jazz riffs, Adele attempted the first verse a cappella, inspiring Epworth to improvise a melody on his acoustic guitar. A thumping drum beat was set to mimic her racing heartbeat. In two days, a demo was recorded to be produced by Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin later that year. However, Adele re-approached Epworth months later to complete production of the song.|$|E
2500|$|On Monday August 18 CMLL {{announced}} the second match of the show, an eight-woman elimination match called La Copa 81 Aniversario ("The 81st Anniversary Cup"). The announced participants included the then reigning CMLL World Women's Champion Marcela, the Mexican National Women's Champion Estrellita, CMLL-Reina International Champion La Amapola, Dalys la Caribeña, Goya Kong, Princesa Sugehit, Tiffany and Zeuxis. The exact teams or format was not {{announced at the}} time. On Monday August 25 CMLL announced another match, the opening match of the show, {{which was to be}} a Best two out of three falls tag team match featuring the brother duo of Puma and Tiger taking on the rookie team of Cachorro and Dragon Lee. The match would mark the first Anniversary Show appearance of both Cachorro and Dragon Lee as both had made their debut less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> as well as Tiger, who while having been in CMLL for a number of years, had yet to wrestle a match on an Anniversary Show. Puma had wrestled on the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show two years prior where he defeated and unmasked Rey Cometa in one of the feature matches. Throughout 2014 Tiger and Puma had developed a storyline rivalry with another team of second generation brothers, Cachorro and Black Panther, a storyline that also included Tiger and Puma's father El Felino and Cachorro and Black Panther's father Blue Panther. Cachorro and Dragon Lee had not teamed on a regular basis before the match was announced, in fact the two had faced off in friendly competition in CMLL's La Copa Junior and En Busca de un Ídolo ("In search of an idol") tournaments. On September 6 CMLL announced a change to the match, adding Blue Panther and El Felino to the two sides, making it a traditional Six-man [...] "Lucha Libre rules" [...] tag team match and an extension of the long running storyline between Los Divinos Laguneros ("The Divine from the Lagoon", Blue Panther, Cachorro and Black Panther) and La Dinastia Casas (The Casas Dynasty", Felino, Tiger, Puma).|$|E
