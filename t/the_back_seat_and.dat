25|$|Children in {{the three-year}} old age group {{are more likely}} to have a {{fatality}} because it is the age where positioning is crucial. In some countries, children transition from facing the rear of the car to facing the front at this age. A study was done on restraints and positioning of three-year olds. It was concluded that being restrained and in the front seat has a lower fatality rate than children positioned in the back seat but not restrained. The safety results indicated that children should be placed in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> restrained. It also suggests that restraints have a bigger impact on safety than seating positions. A lap belt used on children will not provide as much safety as it would for an adult, due to the flexibility of children. An adult seatbelt could do more harm to a child than good, which is why children should properly be utilizing the Child Restraint System instead. This system includes a booster seat and a proper belt that fits the child's criteria including age, weight and height.|$|E

500|$|For the defence, Robin Grey QC, {{explained}} to the jury that such was the extent of Hodgson's compulsive lying that he had confessed to 200 different crimes, including murders that had not happened. The Crown's case against Hodgson was that he [...] "under the influence of drink, broke into the deceased's car, intending to steal it, but then fell asleep on the back seat. When the deceased returned to her car she put her handbag onto <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> brushed against [...] He seized her by {{the back of her}} jumper, twisted it and strangled her, and when she was dead or dying he raped her, removing her underwear and tights with such force that one leg of the tights was torn from the other.

The jury retired to consider their verdict at 11:00a.m. on 5February 1982, and their unanimous guilty verdict was returned at 14:15 (2:15p.m.) the same day.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Ironic" [...] was {{directed}} by Stéphane Sednaoui.|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}} In {{the beginning of the}} video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile {{with a cup of coffee}} in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her [...] "passengers" [...] have disappeared.|$|E

2500|$|Richard L. Griffin, age 29, and {{his girlfriend}} of six weeks, Polly Ann Moore, age 17, were found dead in Griffin's 1941 Oldsmobile sedan on Sunday, March 24, 1946 between 8:30 and 9:00a.m. by a passing {{motorist}}. The motorist saw the parked car on a lovers' lane named Rich Road (now South Robison) near a railroad spur 100yards south of US Highway 67 West close to a nightspot called Club Dallas. At that time, Club Dallas was about [...] west outside the city limits. The motorist at first {{thought that they were}} asleep. Griffin was found between the front seats on his knees with his head resting on his crossed hands, and his pockets were turned inside out. Moore was found sprawled face-down in the back seat. Griffin had been shot twice while still in the car and both had been shot once {{in the back of the}} head and were fully clothed. Moore's purse was beside her in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> contained the photo of her that was used in the following morning's paper. The motorist contacted the city police who then contacted Bowie County Sheriff W. H. Presley. According to a police report written by Arkansas State Trooper Max Tackett, one of the lead investigators of the Phantom cases, Moore was killed on a blanket in front of the vehicle before being placed back inside.|$|E

50|$|An A40 Farina Mark II was {{introduced}} in 1961. It had a 3.5 in longer wheelbase to increase the space for passengers in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> front grille and dashboard were redesigned. The Mark II had more power (37 hp/28 kW) and an SU replaced the previous Zenith carburettor but was otherwise similar mechanically. An anti-roll bar was fitted at the front. The 948 cc engine was replaced {{in the autumn of}} 1962 by a larger 1098 cc version with an output of 48 bhp. The A40 shared this engine with the Morris Minor, which was also rear-wheel drive - both models retaining the traditional north-south engine layout - and also with the recently introduced front-wheel drive, transverse-engined Morris 1100. An improved gearbox was fitted to the A40 at the same time.|$|R

5000|$|Though {{based on}} a {{utilitarian}} hatchback, the Clio V6 is not a practical family car. With an average fuel consumption of 24 mpgimp, this resulted in an empty fuel tank in just over 300 mi. The loss of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats</b> <b>and</b> most of <b>the</b> boot space, due to the engine placement, results in a severe restriction in luggage space - {{there is only a}} small space in the front where the engine used to be, suitable for a holdall or week-end groceries, a small netted area behind the seats plus a small stash area under the tailgate. The enhanced steering makes tight manoeuvring a little challenging, the turning circle is 13 m - around three car lengths - turning what might normally be a three-point turn into a five-point turn. The Clio V6 Phase 2 gained even more weight, but offset it with an additional 25 horsepower. This resulted in a reduced 0-60 mph run at 5.9 seconds and a top speed of 153 mph.|$|R

From the letters that Willy Croup wrote her, she knew that people were coming to the front in Plainton who ought to be on <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>seats,</b> <b>and</b> that she, who could occupy, if she chose, the best place, was thought of only as a poor widow who was companion to a lady who was travelling.
