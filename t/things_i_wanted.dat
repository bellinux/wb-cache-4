500|$|After {{completing}} the album Hu Hu Hu (2009) Lafourcade experienced writer's block, {{and felt that}} the songs she was writing were too {{similar to those in}} her previous albums. For her new work, she sought inspiration from Agustín Lara's repertoire and her native country, Mexico. [...] "One of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to happen with this record was to find the connection with Mexico and its people again". She said she was a Mexican and proud of the [...] "very many" [...] positive parts it has. Musically, she wanted more simplicity in her songs. Lafourcade forced herself to write [...] "without judgement", recording voice memos on her phone as part of the writing process. She was inspired by the works of Latin American songwriters such as Simón Díaz, Violeta Parra, Mercedes Sosa, Chavela Vargas, and Caetano Veloso. While recording demos, Lafourcade realized that the songs were more direct and emotional than her previous work. The writing took three years, resulting in approximately 30songs. Since the album was about her personal life, she selected what she felt were [...] "the strongest ones", saying, [...] "more than making an album, I wanted to have songs... that could stand on their own".|$|E

500|$|For the 2009 {{version of}} Friday the 13th, effects artist Scott Stoddard took {{inspiration}} from Carl Fullerton's design in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's work in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard {{wanted to make}} sure that Jason appeared human and not like a monster. Stoddard's vision of Jason includes hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face, but he attempted to craft Jason's look in a way that would allow for a more human side to be seen. Stoddard took inspiration from the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. The make-up artist managed to acquire an original set piece, which he studied and later sculpted. Although he had a model of one of the original masks, Stoddard did not want to replicate it in its entirety. As Stoddard explains, [...] "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed, there were things I thought were great, but there were <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit, break them up." [...] In the end, Stoddard crafted six versions of the mask, each with varying degrees of wear.|$|E

500|$|For Jason's wardrobe, Mears {{was given}} a pair of combat boots and a [...] "high-priced t-shirt" [...] that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt.

Mears {{wanted to use the}} hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his [...] "kill movements." [...] The top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed {{over the top of the}} military jacket. Mears called it a [...] "giant Frankenstein jacket." [...] He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back.

500|$|Nintendo first {{confirmed}} {{an unnamed}} Metroid title {{would be released}} for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console on March 23, 2001. Despite speculation that the game {{would be based on}} Super Metroid, Ken Lobb, Nintendo of America's Director of Game Development, quelled rumors by stating, [...] "One of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to get across in today's meeting is that Metroid is not Super Metroid. It's something new. [...] And that's something that will hopefully be seen at E3 for our sweet little Game Boy Advance." [...] The first video footage from the game, a 10-second clip, was shown to the public on May 18, 2001, at the 2001 Electronic Entertainment Expo; by then, the game was titled Metroid IV. At the E3 convention the following year, IGN awarded the game, titled Metroid Fusion, their Best of Show and Best Action Game awards. The game was scheduled for a North American release date of November 18, 2002. On August 22, 2002, Nintendo announced that the game can connect to Metroid Prime for the GameCube, a Metroid game that was released on the same day as Fusion. In Europe, the game was released on November 22, 2002, followed by the Australian release on November 29. The game was also released in Japan on February 14, 2003, and in China on March 2, 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Dance in the Rain is the {{follow-up}} to Coulter's third studio album Fear & Freedom (2012), which debuted at number seven on the ARIAAlbumsChart and became her first top-ten album. Coulter {{began working on}} Dance in the Rain shortly {{after the completion of}} Fear & Freedom. As executive producer of Dance in the Rain, Coulter had full control over the songwriters and producers she wanted to work with. She also spent her own money to travel overseas to write and record material for the album. Coulter intended for DanceintheRain to be an honest album and wanted to avoid following a certain sound and concept. She worked on it for two years in various places around the world, including Bali, Brisbane, Los Angeles, Melbourne, Nashville, New York City, Paris, Sweden and Sydney. Stuart Crichton co-produced a majority of the album's songs alongside Coulter. Speaking of the inspiration behind Dance in the Rain, Coulter stated: [...] "Life throws so much at you and I write about it all...I figured I had a lot to say and there were so many <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to express – and I managed to pull it all together for this one album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cage is seen {{wearing a}} black hoodie {{throughout}} the series, which, beyond being practical for a character trying to lie low, was a nod to Trayvon Martin and Black Lives Matter. Colter said {{it was meant to}} invoke [...] "the idea that a black man in a hoodie isn’t necessarily a threat. He might just be a hero." [...] The series also features a political campaign with the slogan [...] "Keep Harlem Black", [...] "in the face of gentrification that threatens to homogenize Harlem’s cultural history." [...] Discussing these racial undertones, Coker asked, [...] "how does the presence of a bulletproof black man change the ecosystem of a neighborhood? Not just in terms of the street-level crime. How do the cops react to someone like that? What are the ripple effects of doing that? That’s one of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to explore on the show". He added that [...] "when you’re a black superhero you can’t erase the notion that you’re black. If you’re black living in the community and you want to change things, {{there are going to be}} things that happen." [...] He did caution comparisons to recent headlines involving racial tension given when they had begun working on the show, stating that his focus had been on [...] "identity", which he saw as a common element in all black art.|$|E

Relapse was the first album and first recordings that I did when the lights went on and I was sober. I {{was still trying to}} figure things out...It's interesting. Fun time. I had a fun time." [...] and reiterated his feeling about the album [...] "I felt Relapse was, I don't know. I don't know if people know what I really had to go through {{to be able to make}} Relapse and to be able to write again and to be able to think again and just normal everyday bodily functions and functions in my mind. I don't want to say I wasn't in a place to record again, but I needed time. I needed time to be able to figure out <b>things.</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to be able to make my songs feel like something again. I know a lot of stuff on Relapse was comical and funny punchline jokes, but a lot of the songs didn't really feel like anything. I had to go back and listen to some of my older music to try to figure out what I was doing wrong. Once I felt like I figured that out, I started making songs that felt like something again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Denisof {{had earlier}} {{stated that he}} thought [...] "it's better for the father [...] {{to be kept in}} the {{background}} and not become part of the story." [...] When Wesley's father finally did appear in Angel season five, he said:I had mixed feelings [...] It was {{a lot of pressure to}} have to define something that had been speculated about for many years. I was worried that by making it specific, it would lose its power, both in the mind of the character and in the minds of the audience. All my concerns disappeared as soon as I read it. There are responses to powerful figures in your life, like your parents, that you can't necessarily control. Wesley's a very controlled person on the exterior and presents a very collected persona to the people around him, being with his father he would no longer be able to control his responses. That's one of the <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to explore with this, the subtle ways in which you respond to the conditioning of your parents. Wesley has difficulty around his father on a physical level, on an emotional scale, and on an intellectual scale. He is extremely intimidated by his father, and at the same time, still seeking the approval that we all essentially want from our parents when we're children. The shooting [...] was an exhilarating moment in which there was the most dangerous person in his life on every level, and there is a woman he is obsessed with. And to have the woman jeopardized by something as dangerous as his father [...] I played that moment as a moment of pure instinct. Wesley is centered in his intellect and is more uncertain in his emotional life, but in that moment, he becomes pure instinct because he has to choose between the woman he loves and his father.|$|E
