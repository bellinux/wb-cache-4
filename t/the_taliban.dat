5|$|Despite {{the initial}} success in driving <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> from power in Kabul, by early 2003 <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> was regrouping, {{amassing}} new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings showed that <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had returned. In 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional {{troops to the}} country in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} with <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees {{appointed by the}} Pakistani Government and <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called {{for the implementation of}} Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held {{within the framework of the}} Pakistani constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, Laila {{gives birth to}} Zalmai, Rasheed's son. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> has risen to power and imposed harsh rules on the Afghan population, prohibiting women from {{appearing}} in public without a male relative. There is a drought, and living conditions in Kabul become poor. Rasheed's workshop burns down, and he is forced to take jobs {{for which he is}} ill-suited. He sends Aziza to an orphanage. Laila endures a number of beatings from <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> when caught alone on the streets in attempts to visit her daughter.|$|E

5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b> Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able to hide from <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> fighters.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Opium of <b>talibans</b> (L'opium des talibans) is a 2001 French {{documentary}} film and road movie {{written and directed}} by Olivier Weber and François Margolin, dealing with the effects of <b>the</b> <b>talibans</b> rule in Afghanistan. It premiered at the 2001 FIPA Festival, and received the Special Prize at the 14th edition of the Festival.|$|R
25|$|As the Pakistani Army began offensives against <b>the</b> Pakistani <b>Taliban,</b> many {{unfamiliar}} with the region thought incorrectly that the assault was against <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> of Mullah Omar which was not the case.|$|R

5|$|Norgrove's captors {{demanded the}} release of Aafia Siddiqui in {{exchange}} for her return. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> released the three Afghans on 3 October 2010 during negotiations. The United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group conducted a predawn rescue attempt five days later on <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> mountain hideout where Norgrove was held captive, amid concerns {{that she would be}} killed or moved by her kidnappers. US forces killed several kidnappers and three local farmers during the assault. They subsequently located Norgrove, badly wounded in a nearby gully, and she died later from her injuries.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Musa Qala (also Qaleh or Qal'eh) was a British led {{military}} action in Helmand Province, southern Afghanistan, launched by the Afghan National Army and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) against <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> on 7 December 2007. After three days of intense fighting, <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> retreated into the mountains on 10 December. Musa Qala was officially reported captured on 12 December, with Afghan Army troops pushing into the town centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban,</b> however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas seized from <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> in southern Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|According to the Wall Street Journal, Shahzad {{received}} bomb-making training from <b>the</b> Pakistani <b>Taliban.</b> <b>The</b> Pakistani <b>Taliban</b> {{are made}} up overwhelmingly of Pashtun tribesmen.

50|$|The {{next phase}} of Pakistani Army's {{offensive}} was the formidable Waziristan region. A US drone attack killed the leader of <b>the</b> Pakistani <b>Taliban,</b> Baitullah Mehsud in August in a targeted killing. A power struggle engulfed <b>the</b> Pakistani <b>Taliban</b> for <b>the</b> whole of September but by October a new leader had emerged, Hakimullah Mehsud.

5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> government also {{made it impossible for}} Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games after the fall of <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E
5|$|After boys' schools reopened, <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> lifted {{restrictions}} on girls' primary education, {{where there was}} co-education. Girls-only schools were still closed. Yousafzai wrote that only 70 pupils attended, out of 700 pupils who were enrolled.|$|E
5000|$|Recently {{following}} the TTP's Peshawar school massacre, {{the leaders of}} <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> condemned <b>the</b> TTP's actions on the school, saying it was [...] "Un-Islamic" [...] Future relations between <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> and TTP are unknown.|$|R
2500|$|The {{night of}} 31 October passed quietly. The Panzerhaubitze 2000 in Kunduz loosed flares to {{illuminate}} the area west of Isa Khel. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Talibans</b> used to avoid night combat because of the German army night vision capabilities.|$|R
50|$|The News International {{reported}} in December 2011 that <b>the</b> TTP-associated Punjabi <b>Taliban</b> {{had been involved}} in the attack.

5|$|December 2001: During {{the opening}} {{stages of the}} war in Afghanistan {{launched}} following the September 11 attacks, the U.S. and its allies believed that bin Laden was hiding in the rugged mountains at Tora Bora.

5|$|Musa Qala was {{the only}} {{significant}} town held by <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{at the time of}} the assault, and they had imposed a strict rule on its inhabitants. Special tribunals were set up, pronouncing sentences of stoning, amputation, or death by hanging against those who were considered enemies, or who contravened a strict interpretation of the Sharia. Four men are known to have been hanged as spies during this period. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> also levied heavy taxes, closed down schools, and drafted local men into their ranks by force. Other deprivations were reminiscent of previous Taliban rule: men attacked for not wearing beards; music banned and recordings smashed; women punished for not wearing the burqa. The town is situated in a major opium poppy growing area and a BBC correspondent has reported it to be the centre of the heroin trade in Afghanistan.|$|E

50|$|Although the TTP {{has claimed}} {{allegiance}} with <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> in <b>the</b> Afghan Taliban's insurgency in Afghanistan, {{the two groups}} have no direct affiliation. The TTP has almost exclusively targeted elements of the Pakistani state. <b>The</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> however have historically relied on support from the Pakistani army in their campaign to control Afghanistan. Regular Pakistani army troops fought alongside <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> in <b>the</b> War in Afghanistan (1996-2001). Major leaders of <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> including Mullah Omar, Jalaluddin Haqqani and Siraj Haqqani are believed to enjoy safe haven in Pakistan. In 2006, Jalaluddin Haqqani was called a 'Pakistani asset' by a senior official of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence.
