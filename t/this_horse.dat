5|$|One of {{the most}} notable Crabbet-bred stallions Brown {{eventually}} kept at Maynesboro was *Astraled, {{who had come to}} America in 1909. <b>This</b> <b>horse</b> had been sold by Wilfrid Blunt to an American buyer from Massachusetts, but after siring only two purebred foals in New England, was sold to the remount, shipped west, and lived in obscurity in Oregon, where he sired no purebred Arabian offspring. *Astraled was ultimately obtained by Brown in 1923, who shipped the aged horse by rail from Idaho to New Hampshire. *Astraled only sired one foal crop at Maynesboro, but that group of foals included his most notable American-bred son, Gulastra.|$|E
5|$|W3 {{is found}} in Arabian horses descended from R Khasper, a near-white {{stallion}} born in 1996. Neither of his parents were white, and the causative mutation (c.706A>T) {{is thought to have}} originated with <b>this</b> <b>horse.</b> It is a nonsense mutation on Exon4. Horses with the W3 allele often retain interspersed flecks or regions of pigmented skin and hair, which may fade with time. Some members of this family possess blue eyes, but these are thought to be inherited separately from the white coat. Based on similar studies in mice, researchers have named W3 as potentially homozygous nonviable.|$|E

5|$|Tizamazing {{is a full}} {{sister to}} Tiznow, who was 2000 American Horse of the Year and won the Breeders' Cup Classic twice. Tizamazing sold for $1million at Keeneland as a yearling, but owing to a {{training}} injury she never raced. Tizamazing's dam, Cee's Song, is credited with raising the respect breeders have for her female breeding line, Thoroughbred family 26, {{as one of the}} top distaff lines in America. Five full siblings out of Cee's Song were either race winners or the dams of race winners: Tiznow, Tizbud and Tizdubai are all stakes winners, Oxbow's dam Tizamazing and Paynter's dam Tizso both produced stakes winners. Another offspring of Cee's Song, the gelding Budroyale, was second in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic. Oxbow's pedigree is outcrossed for four generations, with very little inbreeding. Oxbow is only inbred 4x5x5 to Northern Dancer, meaning that <b>this</b> <b>horse</b> appears once in the fourth and twice in the fifth generation of Oxbow's pedigree.|$|E
5|$|Maylam {{concluded}} {{that at the}} time, {{there was only one}} hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit Sarre, Birchington and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. <b>This</b> <b>horse</b> came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30pm, accompanied by two musicians – one playing the tambourine and the other the concertina – and a man named Robert Laming who lead the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.|$|E

25|$|The {{only known}} {{individual}} {{to be photographed}} was the so-called Cherson-tarpan, which was caught as a foal near Novovorontsovka in 1866. It died in 1887 in the Moscow Zoo. The nature of <b>this</b> <b>horse</b> was dubious in its lifetime, because it showed almost none of the wild horse features described in the historic sources. Today it is assumed this individual either was a hybrid or a feral domestic horse.|$|E
25|$|Lydford {{is located}} on the former stage-coach route between Tavistock and Okehampton, now the A386. On this old toll road near Beardon is a 'Take-off' stone set in the verge.

Very few of these stones still exist in situ.|$|E
25|$|One {{hundred years}} after the first warmbloods were bred at Marbach, the {{direction}} changed from practical farm horse to high-performance sport horse. <b>This</b> <b>horse</b> became today's modern Württemberger. The original breed was saved by the formation of the Association for the Preservation of the Old-Württemberger Horses in 1988. Today there are 8 stallions and 55 mares, though the breed is receiving federal support. The brand is the hart's horn with three prongs on the left hip.|$|E

25|$|The {{badly injured}} animal {{was found on}} the fatal battlefield, and nursed back to health as the 7th Cavalry's regimental mascot, which he {{remained}} until his death in 1890. <b>This</b> <b>horse,</b> Comanche, is considered the only U.S. military survivor of the battle, though several other badly wounded horses were found and destroyed at the scene. Keogh's bloody gauntlet and the guidon of his Company I were recovered by the army three months after Little Bighorn at the Battle of Slim Buttes.|$|E
25|$|Langtry and Baird {{met at a}} race {{course when}} {{he gave her a}} betting tip and the stake money to place on the horse. The horse won and, at a later luncheon party, Baird also offered her the gift of a horse named Milford. She at first demurred, but others at the table advised her to accept, as <b>this</b> <b>horse</b> was a very fine prospect. The horse won several races under Langtry’s colours; he was {{registered}} to “Mr Jersey” (women were excluded from registering horses at this time). Langtry became involved in a relationship with Baird, from 1891 until his death in March 1893.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Burns {{was hired}} to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. <b>This</b> <b>horse</b> was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, {{who had once been}} a trainer at Paul Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already {{suffered}} from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would have to be put down by a vet. Burns decided to sub-contract the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar.|$|E

25|$|Snorri also relates that Aðils loved good {{horses and}} had the best horses in his days (interestingly, the {{contemporary}} Gothic scholar Jordanes noted that the Swedes were famed for their good horses). One horse was named Slöngvi and another one Raven, which he had taken from Áli. From <b>this</b> <b>horse</b> he had bred a horse also named Raven which he sent to king Godgest of Hålogaland, but Godgest could not manage it and fell from it and died, in Omd {{on the island of}} Andøya. Aðils himself died in a similar way at the Dísablót. Aðils was riding around the Disa shrine when Raven stumbled and fell, and the king was thrown forward and hit his skull on a stone. The Swedes called him a great king and buried him at Uppsala. He was succeeded by Eysteinn.|$|E
25|$|Archer {{travelled}} to Melbourne by steamboat {{again the}} following year (1862) {{to run in the}} second Melbourne Cup. This time he won 810 gold sovereigns (£810) cash and a gold watch before a crowd of 7,000, nearly twice the size of the previous years large crowd in a time of 3.47.00, taking to two the number of Melbourne Cup wins by <b>this</b> <b>horse.</b> Archer had already won the 1862 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Randwick, Sydney, and returned to win his second Melbourne Cup carrying 10 stone 2 pounds. He defeated a field of twenty starters by eight lengths, a record that has never been beaten, and that was not matched for over 100 years. Mormon again running second. Winning the Melbourne Cup twice was a feat not repeated until more than seventy years later when Peter Pan won the race in 1932 and 1934, and winning the Melbourne Cup {{two years in a row}} was a feat not repeated until more than 30 years later when Rain Lover won in 1968 and 1969.|$|E
