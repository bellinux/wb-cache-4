40|$|Nowadays pulps for the {{industrial}} manufacture of medium density fibre boards (MDF) are prepared {{by using the}} thermo-mechanical technique. Thermo-mechanical pulps (TMP) are mostly bonded with acid curing urea formaldehyde resins (UF-resins) and melamine modified urea formaldehyde resins (MUF-resins). During <b>thermo-mechanical</b> <b>pulping</b> <b>wood</b> is degraded by hydro-thermal treatment leading to formation of different chemical compounds. Evidence has been adduced that degradation products have a negative bearing on the bondability of the fibres with binders such as alkaline curing phenol formaldehyde resins (PF-resins) or polymers based on 4, 4 ´-diphenylmethandiisocyanat (PMDI) for making moisture resistant bonded boards. Results of research work {{carried out by the}} University of Göttingen, the Fraunhofer-Institute of Wood Research (WKI) in Braunschweig and the Institute of Wood Technology Dresden (IHD) have proved that chemo-thermo-mechanical pulps (CTMP) are superior to TMP on bonding with moisture resistant binders including PF-resins and PMDI binders. MDF made from CTMP pulps are of higher mechanical strength and superior hydrolysis resistance compared to boards from TMP. The paper explains the difference in behaviour of TMP and CTMP towards bonding and elucidate in depth the possibilities of using the chemo-thermo-mechanical pulping method for making moisture resistant bonded MDF...|$|R

Large group of renewable materials composes of plant fibres having high tensile strength are used as fillers into building material with reinforcement function of composite.

These materials were then cooked in the Laboratory of Pulp and Paper at São Paulo State University (UNESP, Botucatu, SP, Brazil) and the physico-mechanical properties of the pulps were determined. The results showed that: (1) the pulp yields of mature wood were up to 4. 4 % greater in comparison to the juvenile wood, (2) the juvenile <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> required a shorter refining time than mature wood to reach the same Schopper-Riegler degree, (3) the juvenile <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> presented lower specific volume, and (4) the mature <b>wood</b> <b>pulp</b> presented greater air resistance, tensile, tear and burst index values, stress-strain factor, and stretch than the juvenile <b>wood</b> <b>pulp...</b>|$|R
