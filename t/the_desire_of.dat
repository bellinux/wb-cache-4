5|$|The wave of anti-Chinese {{violence}} in the western United States following the Rock Springs Riot spread further, {{to the state of}} Oregon.

5|$|Æthelred (or Ethelred; died 30 June 888) was an Anglo-Saxon Archbishop of Canterbury {{in medieval}} England.

Much of Æthelred's time in office was spent dealing with the dislocations caused by the invasion of England by Vikings.

5|$|Disagreements arose between Allied commanders {{over the}} {{operational}} plan, {{which called for}} a series of dispersed landings, based on <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> the air, naval, and logistical planners concerning the early capture of ports and airfields. General Bernard Montgomery, the commander of the British Eighth Army, objected to this aspect of the plan, since it exposed the Allied forces to defeat in detail. Montgomery put forward an alternate plan that involved American and British forces landing side by side. He convinced Smith that his alternate plan was sound, and the two men then persuaded most of the other Allied commanders. Montgomery's plan provided for the early seizure of airfields, which satisfied Tedder and Cunningham. The fears of logisticians like Major General Thomas B. Larkin that supply would not be practical without a port were resolved by the use of amphibious trucks.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Y.Kobayasi {{reported}} the form L.mokusin f. sinensis, {{which he said}} differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top; the form sinensis was also reported in Korea in 1995. Some authors have attempted to define forms of L.mokusin as new species based {{on the degree of}} separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of Lysurus in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus Lloydia was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the tips of the arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of L.mokusin, and <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of synonyms over the years.|$|E
5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have been}} advanced {{to explain the}} swiftness and ease of the initial Lombard advance in northern Italy.

The Byzantine decision not to contest the Lombard invasion reflects <b>the</b> <b>desire</b> <b>of</b> Justinian's successors to reorient the core of the Empire's polices eastward.|$|E
