50|$|Breeding {{with these}} species has some {{inherent}} difficulties summarized by Roy Chowdhury (2006) as ranging from pseudogamy and apomixis, differences in chromosome number and varying times of flowering. In {{spite of these}} drawbacks breeding work {{is being done to}} enhance the value of the plants as ornamentals. Because of the nature of botanical restriction, breeding programs often encounter impediments. Reciprocal crosses may be difficult because the apomictic parent cannot be used as female parents. However interspecific crosses are well documented. There are tri-hybrids and quad-hybrids being produced (crossing 3 or 4 distinct species). Such work indicates that complex hybrids should be possible. One constraint remains that seedlings may still carry the apomictic trait, and it is necessary to have progeny from a <b>test</b> <b>cross</b> to determine this.|$|E
50|$|Early in the 1900s William Bateson and Reginald Punnett were {{studying}} genetic inheritance and {{they noted that}} some combinations of alleles appeared more frequently than others.
