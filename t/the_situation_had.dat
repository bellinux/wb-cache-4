5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem. <b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> improved since then, but the 2010 budget crisis, which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E
5|$|By 1877 it {{was clear}} that <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> become impractical. After letters were {{published}} in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to unite the kicking game under one set of laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E

5|$|By July 1940 <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> {{improved}} somewhat with uniforms, {{a modicum}} of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
5|$|For the regency, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> become desperate. Empress Anna's {{requests}} for aid from foreign powers proved unsuccessful, as both Orhan and the beylik of Karasi rebuffed her overtures for assistance. Only Balik, {{the ruler of}} Dobruja, sent an elite force of 1,000 men under his brothers Theodore and Dobrotitsa, but they were routed by a Kantakouzenist army under protostrator George Phakrases. The emirate of Saruhan offered a more substantial force of 6,000 men {{in the summer of}} 1346, but instead of fighting, they plundered Thrace and then defected to join Kantakouzenos' army. Revenue remained scarce for the regency, the Genoese once again seized the imperial possessions of Chios and Phocaea, and on 19 May 1346, a part of the Hagia Sophia cathedral collapsed, a terrible omen {{in the eyes of the}} capital's inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|From 18 November 1945, {{the daily}} Oslo–Bergen trains again ran via Roa, while the local trains from Oslo to Hønefoss {{increased}} to three daily round trips. Three weekly night trains were introduced from 1946. From 2 January to 1 May 1947, there was four weekly express services from Oslo to Geilo on the Bergen Line. By 1950, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> normalized {{and there were}} daily day and night trains and three weekly express trains—the latter with no stops between Hønefoss and Oslo. Kvellsrud Station opened on 18 August 1952.|$|E

5|$|He {{also said}} that <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> been looked at in the wrong way by police, members of {{parliament}} and the security services; rather than asking if Profumo had committed adultery they should have asked if his conduct had led ordinary people to believe he committed adultery. His analogy was with divorce law; a man {{does not need to}} have committed adultery for his wife to have grounds to divorce him, but rather she simply has to believe that he has committed adultery. This is because such a belief would destroy the trust and confidence within the relationship. This brought criticism from several government ministers including Sir John Hobson, the Attorney-General for England and Wales, saying that it would mean condemning a man on the basis of suspicion rather than evidence.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the 4th Rifle Battalion, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Harold Barrowclough and positioned {{a distance from}} the west wall of the ramparts, had carried out scouting expeditions to explore the defences. Gradually, the German posts around the fortifications fell to the attacking platoons of the battalion. As on the northern side of the town, machine-gun fire from the ramparts prevented any further advance. One party reached the outer rampart but became pinned down by gunfire for several hours. By midday, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> settled into a temporary stalemate. In the afternoon, some German prisoners of war were sent into the town with an invitation to surrender but this approach was rebuffed, as had been a similar attempt earlier that morning.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{at another}} press conference, a {{reporter}} reveals that Graham was exiled from India, his former home, after {{he failed to}} kill a tiger that slaughtered over 200 people. The sheriff visits Graham that night and he explains that <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> been beyond his control. Later that night, Roy dreams the tiger killed Graham and runs to his tent to check on him. Graham offers to walk him home, but they end up going to the store where Rose works when Roy says she is working late.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon had {{previously}} sent dispatches to Marshal Soult, {{commander of the}} Army of the South, urging him to send assistance to Masséna in Portugal. However, the Emperor's orders, which called for only a small force, were based on outdated intelligence and <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> changed considerably by the time Soult received them. Thirty thousand Allied troops and six major fortresses now stood between the French army and the Portuguese capital, making an attack against Lisbon virtually impossible. Nevertheless, compelled to act, Soult instead gathered an army of 20,000 men, mainly from VCorps, and launched an expedition into Extremadura {{with the aim of}} capturing the Spanish fortress at Badajoz, thereby drawing some of the Allied forces away from Masséna and the Lines of Torres Vedras.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the war, the {{artillery}} worked independently and {{was taught to}} support the infantry {{to ensure a successful}} attack. In 1914, the heaviest artillery gun was the 60-pounder, four in each heavy battery. The Royal Horse Artillery employed the 13-pounder, while the Royal Field Artillery used the 18-pounder gun. By 1918, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> changed; {{the artillery}} were the dominant force on the battlefield. Between 1914 and 1918, the Royal Field Artillery had increased from 45 field brigades to 173 field brigades, while the heavy and siege artillery of the Royal Garrison Artillery had increased from 32 heavy and six siege batteries to 117 heavy and 401 siege batteries.|$|E
5|$|Shazly {{then went}} southward to 7th Division's {{bridgehead}} in Third Army's sector, where traffic was almost at a standstill. Shazly met with 7th division commander Brigadier General Badawy, who informed {{him of the}} bridge-laying problems experienced by 19th Division's engineers further south, leading all Third Army supplies and reinforcements to be sent over 7th Division's already congested bridges, creating a solid traffic jam. Despite Sunday's lull, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> not yet improved. This created complications, as soldiers and tank crews lost contact with their units and consequently {{had no idea of}} their designated positions. Many troops were low on supplies, and some even returned to {{the west bank of the}} canal to replenish their food and water supply.|$|E

5|$|The {{rescue of}} Bat 21 was a {{watershed}} {{event for the}} military and led them {{to find a new}} approach to high-threat search and rescue. They recognized that, if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, it should not be attempted, and other options, such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> <b>had</b> to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions.|$|E
5|$|The ship's Seafires flew 75 sorties on {{the first}} day of {{operations}} and 60 on 10 September, but the Seafire was not well suited to carrier landings in low wind conditions and many were damaged in landing accidents. 44 sorties were flown on 11 September and only 18 on 12 September, even though Unicorns mechanics had managed to repair ten Seafires over the previous night. The fighter shortage grew so acute during the operation that fighters from the carriers Illustrious and , intended to provide distant cover against an attempt by the Italian fleet to interfere with the invasion, staged forward to Unicorn in order to provide air cover over the landings. By 12 September, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> improved so that 887 Squadron was able to fly off six Seafires to a temporary airfield ashore.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> changed {{again by}} 1918, when tank attacks would have one tank every 100 or , with a tank company of 12–16 tanks per objective. One section of each {{company would be}} out in front, with the {{remainder}} of the company following behind and each tank providing protection for an infantry platoon, who were instructed to advance, making use of available cover and supported by machine gun fire. When the tanks came across an enemy strong point, they would engage the defenders, forcing them into shelter and leaving them to the devices of the following infantry.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> {{escalated}} when, in 40 AD, Caligula {{announced to}} the senate {{that he planned to}} leave Rome permanently and to move to Alexandria in Egypt, where he hoped to be worshipped as a living god. The prospect of Rome losing its emperor and thus its political power was the final straw for many. Such a move would have left both the senate and the Praetorian Guard powerless to stop Caligula's repression and debauchery. With this in mind Chaerea convinced his fellow conspirators to put their plot into action quickly.|$|E
5|$|By October 1963, {{according}} to Woods, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> become critical and some officials {{were beginning to}} examine alternative options, such as conventional fighter aircraft {{in the form of}} the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. By November1963, the RAF reportedly still found the P.1154 to be a suitable platform, while the Royal Navy appeared to be considering the F-4 Phantom II as being a better fit for its needs. In response, HSA elected focused its efforts on the RAF version. In late 1963, dissatisfied with the progress of the 'bi-service' model, the government examined three alternative options for the programme; to proceed with an RAF-orientated P.1154 while the Naval version would be delayed, pursue the development of a full dual-service P.1154 model with only limited differences between the services, or the complete termination of the program with the service's requirements to be re-appraised.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from {{other members of the}} Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers. Nevertheless, Brandenburg took up patrol duties in the area {{surrounding}} the mouth of the Yangtze River, and in October participated in the occupations of the coastal fortifications protecting the cities of Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao before returning to the Yangtze. Since <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>had</b> calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or Nagasaki, Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls; Brandenburg went to Hong Kong for her overhaul in January and February 1901. After the work was completed, she steamed to Tsingtao in the German Kiautschou Bay concession, where she took part in training exercises {{with the rest of the}} expeditionary force.|$|E
