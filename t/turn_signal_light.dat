2500|$|Turn {{signals are}} {{required}} to blink on and off, or [...] "flash", at a steady rate of between 60 and 120 blinks per minute (1â€“2Hz). International UN Regulations require that all turn signals flash in simultaneous phase; US regulations permit side marker lights wired for side turn signal functionality to flash in opposite-phase. An audio and/or visual tell-tale indicator is required, to advise the driver when the turn signals are activated and operating. This usually {{takes the form of}} one or two green indicator lights on the vehicle's instrument cluster, and a cyclical [...] "tick-tock" [...] noise generated electromechanically or electronically. It is also required that the vehicle operator be alerted by much faster- or slower-than-normal flashing in the event a <b>turn</b> <b>signal</b> <b>light</b> fails.|$|E
