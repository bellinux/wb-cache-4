5|$|New Labour {{also used}} the party's brand to {{continue}} this modernisation, and {{it was used to}} communicate the modernisation of the party to the public; the party also began to use focus groups to test whether their policy ideas were attractive to swing voters. Its purpose was <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> the public that the party would provide a new kind of governance and mitigate fears that a Labour government would return to the labour unrest that had characterised its past.|$|E
5|$|Republicans in Congress {{claimed a}} mandate for abolition, having gained in the {{elections}} for Senate and House. The 1864 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Representative George H. Pendleton, led opposition to the measure. Republicans toned down their language of radical equality in order to broaden the amendment's coalition of supporters. In order <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> critics worried that the amendment would tear apart the social fabric, some Republicans explicitly promised that the amendment would leave patriarchy intact.|$|E

Hague felt that if Operation Backstop triggered an armed clash with the HV the UNPROFOR would be forced to withdraw through Croatia, exposing the peacekeepers to grave danger.|$|E
5|$|After his arrest, Edwards {{was imprisoned}} in the Tombs, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, {{he had more}} than $44,000 in a trunk in his room. While in jail {{awaiting}} trial, Edwards forged a letter alleging he had funds in New Orleans, and then showed the letter {{to one of his}} lawyers in order <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> the lawyer about Edwards' ability to pay for legal counsel. In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and {{would not be able to}} come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.|$|E
5|$|Because the Manhattan Project was an Allied endeavor, Groves had {{to obtain}} {{permission}} from the British and American governments to publish the Smyth Report. A meeting was held on August 2, 1945 {{in the office of}} the Secretary of War, Henry Stimson. Accompanying Stimson were his two assistants, Harvey Bundy and George L. Harrison, and his military aide, Colonel William H. Kyle. Groves, Conant, and Tolman represented the Manhattan Project. James Chadwick, the head of the British scientific mission to the Manhattan Project, and Roger Makins from the British Embassy represented Britain. The meeting went on for two hours, as Groves and Conant sought <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> Stimson that the report would not give vital secrets away to the Soviet Union.|$|E

He becomes {{stressed}} at being late for his exam, so Lois persuades Peter to revive The A-Team one last time and drive Brian to his test, which is successful, and Brian arrives on time. He fails his test, but remains proud of himself for not cheating, much to the dismay of the family, who tells him that he probably should have cheated. Brian tries <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> them that he finished what he started and labels his pride of that 'something', but the Griffins shoot him down for that.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's {{territorial}} ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him. However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance of the powerful Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> the Olynthians by offering them an alliance on very advantageous terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in {{the territory of the}} Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Bahrain was invaded {{by both the}} Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the Omani ruler Sayyid Sultan {{installed}} his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, {{received a letter from}} the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> the Sheikh that {{this was not the case}} and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.|$|E

5|$|On 14 January 1858, an Italian {{refugee from}} Britain called Felice Orsini {{attempted}} to assassinate Napoleon III with a bomb made in England. The ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government, and Palmerston resigned. Derby was reinstated as prime minister. Victoria and Albert attended {{the opening of}} a new basin at the French military port of Cherbourg on 5 August 1858, in an attempt by Napoleon III <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> Britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere. On her return Victoria wrote to Derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the Royal Navy in comparison to the French one. Derby's ministry did not last long, and in June 1859 Victoria recalled Palmerston to office.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack at}} Sinsinawa Mound, {{compounded}} by other incidents around the region, helped {{contribute to the}} fear gripping the settlers. The people of Platteville, in present-day Wisconsin, contemplated fleeing to Galena, about 25 miles (40 km) south, {{as a direct result}} of the Sinsinawa Mound raid. Colonel Dodge dispatched one of his men, Frederick Hollman, to Platteville <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> its nervous residents. However, by the time Hollman arrived the settlers had already been informed that the local Native American Ho-Chunk tribesmen were friendly. This and the subsequent delivery of promised supplies from Galena further placated Platteville's residents, and the threatened exodus was called off.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett's initial {{plan had}} been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on {{together}} to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs), and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow. As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett did his best <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> him as they moved slowly forward.|$|E
5|$|Despite the BJP's {{shift away}} from {{explicit}} Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders. He did, however, maintain relations with Dawoodi Bohra. His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. He had published a Gujarati book titled Jyotipunj in 2008, containing profiles of various RSS leaders. The longest was of M. S. Golwalkar, under whose leadership the RSS expanded and whom Modi refers to as Pujniya Shri Guruji ("Guru worthy of worship"). According to The Economic Times, his intention was to explain {{the workings of the}} RSS to his readers and <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> RSS members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. Modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.|$|E

5|$|In August 1936, {{he removed}} Nicolae Titulescu {{from the office}} of Foreign Minister, {{replacing}} him with Victor Antonescu. This caused an uproar, with most of Romania's diplomatic corps voicing their dissatisfaction. Over the following months, virtually all of Titulescu's supporters were themselves recalled (including, among others, Constantin Vișoianu, the ambassador to Poland, Constantin Antoniade, Romania's representative to the League of Nations, Dimitrie Ghyka, the ambassador to Belgium, and Caius Brediceanu, the ambassador to Austria) while Titulescu's adversaries, such as Antoine Bibesco, were returned to office. Bibesco subsequently campaigned in France and the United Kingdom, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> Romania's main allies that the move did not signify a change in Romania's priorities. Tătărescu was later blamed by his own party for having renounced the diplomatic course on which Romania had engaged.|$|E
5|$|One of Dekanozov′s primary goals was the {{organization}} of a puppet government that would legitimize the occupation. On June 16, the Lithuanian government, exceeding its authority, decided that Smetona's emigration was in effect a resignation and granted Merkys full presidential powers. On June 17, Merkys appointed Justas Paleckis the new Prime Minister and confirmed the new government, known as the People's Government. Merkys and Urbšys then resigned; both would later be arrested and deported to Russia. Paleckis assumed the presidency and appointed writer Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius as Prime Minister. The People's Government included several well-known politicians and public figures <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> the public that the new government was not a tool of Soviet occupation, but a simple replacement of the authoritarian Smetona regime. Since there had been strong opposition to Smetona's rule, it was interpreted by some Lithuanians as a destruction of presidential power {{rather than as a}} loss of independence.|$|E
5|$|The film begins {{during the}} thirtieth {{year of the}} show. During the day, Truman notices strange occurrences that all seem {{centered}} on him (a falling spotlight, rain that only falls on him). Truman spots a disheveled man and recognizes him as his father, who had snuck back into the set, but actors quickly drag the man away. Despite efforts by Meryl and Truman's best friend Marlon <b>to</b> <b>reassure</b> Truman, Truman becomes even more suspicious about his life. One day, he takes Meryl by surprise by going on an impromptu road trip, but their way is blocked by apparent and increasingly implausible emergencies. Meryl begins to break down from the stress, and during an argument with Truman, breaks character and is later taken off the show. Truman, depressed and confused, is consoled by Marlon, and Christof uses the opportunity to re-introduce Truman's father to the show properly, {{under the guise of}} having lost his memory after the boating accident, in the hope of bringing Truman back to some emotional stability and a controllable state.|$|E
