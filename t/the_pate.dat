40|$|None of the {{quantitative}} scale for public attitudes toward epilepsy was translated to Chinese language. This study aimed to translate {{and test the}} validity and reliability of a Chinese version of the Public Attitudes Toward Epilepsy (<b>PATE)</b> scale. Methods: <b>The</b> translation was performed according to standard principles and tested in 140 Chinese-speaking adults aged more than 18 years for psychometric validation. Results: The items in each domain had similar standard deviations (equal item variance), ranged from 0. 85 - 0. 95 in personal domain and 0. 75 - 1. 04 in general domain. The correlation between an item and its domain was 0. 4 and above for all, and higher than the correlation with the other domain. Multitrait analysis showed <b>the</b> Chinese <b>PATE</b> had a similar variance, floor and ceiling effects, and relative relationship between the domains, as <b>the</b> original <b>PATE.</b> <b>The</b> Chinese <b>PATE</b> scale showed a similar correlation with almost all demographic variable except age. Item means were generally clustered in the factor analysis as hypothesized. The Cronbach’s α values was within acceptable range (0. 773) in the personal domain and satisfactory range (0. 693) in the general domain. Conclusion: <b>The</b> Chinese <b>PATE</b> scale is a validated and reliable translated version in measuring the public attitudes toward epilepsy...|$|R

60|$|This last argument, however, by {{no means}} commended itself to the pupil of Ockham, who plucked a great stick {{from the ground and}} {{signified}} his dissent by smiting the realist over <b>the</b> <b>pate</b> with it.

60|$|Linda {{had already}} perceived, perturbed {{as she was}} in her mind, that Herr Steinmarc had {{prepared}} himself carefully for this interview. He had brought a hat with him into the room, but it was not the hat which had so long been distasteful to her. And he had got on clean bright shoes, as large indeed as the old dirty ones, because Herr Steinmarc was not a man to sacrifice his corns for love; but still shoes that were decidedly intended to be worn only on occasions. And he had changed his ordinary woollen shirt for white linen, and had taken out his new brown frock-coat which he always wore on those high days in Nuremberg on which the magistrates appeared with their civic collars. But, perhaps, the effect which Linda noted most keenly was the debonair fashion in which the straggling hairs had been disposed over the bald pate.

6000|$|Bertrand is {{the simple}} {{recipient}} of Macaire's jokes, and makes vicarious atonement for his crimes, acting, in fact, the part which pantaloon performs in the pantomime, who is entirely under the fatal influence of clown. He is {{quite as much}} a rogue as that gentleman, {{but he has not}} his genius and courage. So, in pantomimes, (it may, doubtless, have been remarked by the reader,) clown always leaps first, pantaloon following after, more clumsily and timidly than his bold and accomplished friend and guide. Whatever blows are destined for clown, fall, by some means of ill-luck, upon <b>the</b> <b>pate</b> of pantaloon: whenever the clown robs, the stolen articles are sure to be found in his companion's pocket; and thus exactly Robert Macaire and his companion Bertrand are made to go through the world; both swindlers, but the one more accomplished than the other. Both robbing all the world, and Robert robbing his friend, and, in the event of danger, leaving him faithfully in the lurch. There is, in the two characters, some grotesque good for the spectator--a kind of [...] "Beggars' Opera" [...] moral.|$|E
60|$|Father Lejeune, in 1637, gives a case {{which reminds}} us of Home. According to Home, and to Mrs. S. C. Hall, and other witnesses, when 'in power' he could not only handle live coals without being burned, but he {{actually}} placed a large glowing coal, {{about the size of}} a cricket-ball, on <b>the</b> <b>pate</b> of Mr. S. C. Hall, where it shone redly through Mr. Hall's white locks, but did him no manner of harm. Now Father Pijart was present, tesmoin oculaire, when a Huron medicine- man heated a stone red hot, put it in his mouth, and ran round the cabin with it, without receiving any harm. Father Brebeuf, afterwards a most heroic martyr, sent the stone to Father Lejeune; it bore the marks of the medicine-man's teeth, though Father Pijart, examining the man, found that lips and tongue had no trace of burn or blister. He reasonably concluded that these things could not be done 'sans l'operation de quelque Demon'. That an excited patient should not feel fire is, perhaps, admissible, but that it should not scorch either Mr. Hall, or Home, or the Huron, is a large demand on our credulity. Still, the evidence in this case (that of Mr. Crookes and Lord Crawford) is much better than usual.|$|E
60|$|October 20.

In the morning they found all their trenchers, pots, and spits, upon and about their beds, and all such things as were of common use scattered about the rooms. This night there were also, in several parts of the room and outer rooms, such noises of beating at doors, and on the walls, as if that several smiths had been at work; and yet our captains shrunk not from their work, but went on in that, and lodged as they had done before.|$|E
