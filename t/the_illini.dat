Fitzgerald Toussaint ran for 121 yards in the first quarter, including a 65-yard run on the second {{play of the game}} to set up a nine-yard touchdown run by Denard Robinson. In the second quarter, Robinson scored his second rushing touchdown of the game on a two-yard run. Michigan lost another scoring opportunity in the second quarter after tight end Kevin Koger gained 40 yards on a pass from Robinson. Robinson ran for an apparent touchdown from the eight-yard line, but the call was reversed when replay officials ruled that Robinson had stepped out of bounds at the two-yard line. On fourth down from the one-yard line, Robinson was stopped after a low snap slowed his momentum. A fumble by Robinson ended another drive, and Brendan Gibbons missed a 38-yard field goal with one minute left in the half. Michigan's defense held Illinois to 30 total yards in the first half. In the third quarter, Gibbons kicked a 27-yard field goal, but Illinois responded with a touchdown on a one-yard run by Nathan Scheelhaase. Denard Robinson left the game in the third quarter after sustaining a blow to his wrist. In the fourth quarter, J.T. Floyd intercepted a Scheelhaase pass and returned it 43 yards into Illinois territory. Shortly thereafter, backup quarterback Devin Gardner threw a 27-yard touchdown pass to Martavious Odoms to put Michigan ahead 24–7. Illinois closed the gap to 24–14 on an 18-play drive capped by a one-yard touchdown run by Jason Ford.

Back-to-back three-and-outs for both teams gave the ball back to <b>the</b> <b>Illini</b> late in the first quarter. <b>The</b> <b>Illini</b> were driving the ball into Wisconsin territory as the first quarter came to a close, the Badgers leading 21–0. <b>The</b> <b>Illini</b> would continue to move the ball and got down to the Wisconsin 3-yard line but on third down, Nathan Scheelhaase was sacked by LB Derek Landisch. <b>The</b> <b>Illini</b> K Taylor Zalewski kicked a 31-yard field goal and got Illinois on the board. Wisconsin would punt on their next drive and then Illinois responded with a quick 4-play drive that was capped with a 1-yard touchdown run by RB Josh Ferguson. The Badgers would then extend their lead with a 10-play scoring drive with Melvin Gordon punching in a 1-yard touchdown run.
