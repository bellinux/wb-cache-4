40|$|Market-based {{economic}} instruments {{have become}} increasingly important as alternatives to conventional methods of environmental regulation, as public policy makers are increasingly aware of the ineffectiveness of command and control regulation. A remarkable breakthrough {{in the search for}} lasting solutions to pressing environmental problems is the emergence of the <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits.</b> They recognize the need for establishing property rights prior to addressing the issues of environmental degradation, and offer solutions that are cost-effective, without requiring complex technical information about industry structures to monitor compliance. However, the current literature provides little guidance for evaluating the overall effectiveness of this new economic instrument. The lack of simultaneous emphasis on all of the important dimensions of market-based regulation led to conflicting views among economists as to the significance of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> and the circumstances under which they perform effectively. In an attempt to resolve these different viewpoints, this dissertation undertakes an in-depth inquiry into three fundamental facets of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> namely political economy aspects, cost aspects and efficiency aspects. The primary emphasis is on the U. S. SO 2 emissions trading program which was accompanied by the Amendments to the U. S. Clean Air Act in 1990 (CAAA). Using a political economy framework, the dissertation examines the institutional dimensions of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> and explores how they influence the instrument choice at different stages of the policy making process. The investigation uncovers a number of important linkages of political, social, legal and market conditions, whose interactions determine the desirability of market-based economic instruments over other alternatives. Using examples mainly from the United States, it demonstrates how the performance of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> depends on situation-specific characteristics of the above factors. The dissertation then considers the cost aspects of the <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> in order to elucidate the behaviour of the affected firms, and to resolve conflicting views of the potential effects of the <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> on the production costs of regulated industries. The investigation is based on an econometric framework and a large-scale data set representing coal-fuelled electric utilities operating in the United States. It reveals that there has been an upward pressure on the production costs of electric utilities {{in the aftermath of the}} CAAA, and that as a result, the utilities have adjusted their optimal mix of inputs by shifting away from pollution-intensive inputs. The empirical analysis of market-based regulation then explores efficiency aspects of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and a Tobit model. This reveals that <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> created an incentive to search for "greener" production technologies as part of the compliance with the new market-based regulation. In particular, the resulting improvements to the existing power generation technologies surpass the increases in production costs. Therefore, the CAAA resulted in a net improvement in production efficiency of the U. S. electric utilities. This evidence is consistent with the latest findings of the literature, and supports the Porter hypothesis, that environmental regulation confers to firms a dynamic incentive to innovate...|$|R

Using this model, which draws on search theory tools more frequently used in labour and monetary economics, we compare market-based and command-and-control pollution control instruments {{with respect to}} the incentives each provides for abatement technology search and adoption, expected emissions reductions, and expected compliance costs. We motivate our work by examining firm-level decisions in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada, where firms are developing new abatement technologies to reduce fluid tailings associated with mining operations. We show that the polluting firm always has more incentives to search for and adopt a more efficient abatement technology under either an emissions tax or a <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> system than under an equivalently stringent emissions standard. We also show that while expected incentives for innovation are comparable under emissions taxes and <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> regimes, the likelihood for total future compliance costs to be reduced after an increase in the stringency of environmental policy - the so-called Porter hypothesis - is higher with a <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> regime...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> {{systems for}} allocating rights to impact the {{environment}} {{have become an}} important part of the regulatory toolkit over the last 35 years. Informed by elegant neoclassical economic thought, these regulatory markets promise lowest-cost environmental benefit by delegating decision-making to market participants. This article examines tradeable permits systems, including cap-and-trade carbon markets, tradeable water quality permits, and individual transferable quotas for fisheries, to understand the actual outcomes of attempts to transfer environmental governance to markets. Drawing on heterodox economic thought and the neoliberal natures literature, this article examines the institutional forms <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> systems engender in conjunction with a neoclassical definition of ‘market’ to provide an internal critique of environmental marketization. In general, <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> systems do not facilitate highly liquid financial markets that might signal the increasing importance of regulatory markets as an accumulation strategy for capital. Instead, market-based regulation tends to behave rather differently, acting as performance standards, quotas, or environmental taxes. The article concludes by reflecting on the political possibilities afforded by the recognition that regulatory markets, for the most part, bear little resemblance to high-flying financial markets...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I specify CO 2 {{abatement}} cost Junctions for five different world regions. A cost-effective CO 2 agreement {{is defined by}} the emissions that follow from minimising the total abatement costs, given a specified CO 2 emission limit. Under the cost-effective agreement, the industrialised countries bear all reductions, while developing countries are actually allowed to increase emissions compared to the 1990 level. The developing countries will, nevertheless, bear the highest burdens under this treaty. The agreement is also analysed under different <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> regimes and compared to uniform percentage reductions. The transfers from <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> systems are high, and may be difficult for political leaders to justify.

40|$|Since the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol to that Convention, {{came into}} force in 2005, {{emissions}} trading {{has been the}} preferred approach for any international efforts to control, and eventually reduce, greenhouse gas emissions. There are several emission trading schemes already in operation {{and others at the}} planning stage. The purpose of this note is to provide the reader with a brief overview of emissions trading, the types of trading schemes and an examination of existing and proposed schemes. Emissions trading schemes are based around the concept of setting a desired level of emissions and issuing a number of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> or allowances, allowing this level of emissions to be made. The number of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> is fixed, in effect limiting the total quantity of emissions that can be made in any one period. <b>Tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> are quotas, allowances or ceilings on emissions levels that, once allocated to an emitter, can be traded subject to a set of prescribed rules...|$|R
40|$|Australia's {{ability to}} meet its {{commitment}} to reduce greenhouse gases under the Kyoto convention will probably require at least some government intervention. Traditionally, approaches to reducing pollution in Australia have {{tended to focus on}} the adoption of emission standards. Theoretical criticism by environmental economists has, in part, resulted in a movement toward the adoption of market based mechanisms for pollution abatement; and flirtations with carbon taxes and <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each instrument is subject to significant weaknesses. <b>Tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> are administratively complex for both polluter and administrator and can lead to production bottlenecks where polluters cannot find requisite permits. A carbon tax is simpler to administer and offers much more flexibility, but can have regressive and inequitable economic impacts. Of these approaches, <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> offer greater potential for achieving set emissions reductions, but tend to be restricted in application to large emitters such as industry. It is argued here that to be truly cost effective, incentives to reduce emissions need to be targeted {{as close as possible to}} the point of fuel consumption-and hence greenhouse emission: by both industry and the household consumer. This paper explores the benefits and limitations of adopting a mixed incentive scheme applied to the energy consumer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed consumer carbon reduction incentive (CBCRI) incorporates elements of <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits,</b> carbon taxes and emission reduction subsidies. ...|$|R

40|$|Revenue-raising {{environmental}} policy instruments, such as carbon taxes, {{tend to be}} politically controversial.

We compare a system of differentiated carbon taxes, exemplified by the current Norwegian carbon tax regime, to uniform carbon taxation and grandfathered <b>tradeable</b> emission <b>permits.</b> In this particular case, differentiated taxes are welfare superior to grandfathered permits. Nevertheless, uniform carbon taxes outperform both. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} how {{hybrid systems}} of carbon taxes and <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> optimize some conflicting dimensions of political acceptability {{related to the}} design of these instruments. Pure systems like taxes without exemptions or auctioned <b>tradeable</b> <b>permits</b> cause problems for political acceptability in open economies due to high overall costs (abatement cost plus payments on the tax or auctions) for current polluters. Unfortunately, pure systems based on grandfathering of emission rights across the board do not provide a feasible alternative because of monitoring and enforcement problems. In contrast, consciously designed hybrid systems employ grandfathering of emission rights together with either carbon taxes or auctioned carbon permits in order to overcome acceptability problems of pure systems, while leaving incentives to reduce emissions at the margin untouched. Moreover, monitoring and enforcement costs of the hybrid systems are less due to the lower number of participating agents compared with the pure systems, while opportunities for costor burden-sharing exist as well.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{advocate}} a new initial allocation mechanism for a tradable pollution permit market.

This ranking is achieved by ordering firms based on an observable 'external action' where the external action is an activity or characteristic of the firm that is independent of their choice of emissions in the <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> market.

We determine the symmetric equilibrium strategy of each firm in choosing their external action and find the choice {{is influenced by the}} firm's cost structure and the regulator's choice of permit allocation schedule (distribution of permits to the market).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the design of}} a compliance system for a <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> market as an informal mechanism design problem in an international situation with limited information, and weak enforcement. We specifically consider the embryonic <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> market associated with the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC). We outline the practical constraints on the compliance system for this market in terms of information flows, incentives and capacities. Then we use a heuristic contracting model to apply results from contract theory, and find the important elements of an effective system. We conclude that clear definition ex ante of compliance, in terms of verifiable outcomes, is critical to effective monitoring and enforcement. The best way to define compliance will depend on a tradeoff between efficiency, risk and transaction costs, and may vary among different types of project. We also conclude that the buyer country, which is a developed country, should be held solely liable for compliance ex post. This is because of its advantageous position as a monitor and enforcer for the global community in a given project...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{distributional}} implications of alternative permit allocations in a <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> regime for carbon emissions reductions (20 % below baseline) in 2010 for a region consisting of Europe {{and the states}} of the former Soviet Union (FSU). Participation in such a regime is expected to hinge on the “fairness” of the distributional consequences. We find that initial permit allocations by populationand/or GDP are unlikely to induce participation by most countries of Eastern Europe and FSU because of the net costs involved. We identify a set of initial allocations that would at least compensate these countries. A fair treatment of the countries in Western Europe (WE) is here one which equalizes net costs perGDP. For a wide set of cost functions for carbon emission reductions, the cost gains that WE would reap from a <b>tradeable</b> <b>permit</b> system relative to unilateral reductions by WE as a group are found to be on the order of 85 percent.
