40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the performance of}} Probabilistic Early Response TCP (PERT), a new TCP congestion control, for video streaming. As a delay based protocol, it measures the delay at the end host and adjusts the congestion window accordingly. Our experiments show that PERT improves video delivery performance by decreasing the fraction of packets delivered late. Furthermore, our Linux live streaming test indicates that PERT is able to reduce the playback glitches, when high resolution video is delivered over a link with non-zero packet loss. In order to operate PERT at higher <b>thoughputs,</b> we design PERT to work with Acknowledgement (ACK) coalescing at the receiver. ACK coalescing makes data transfers burstier and {{makes it hard to}} estimate delays accurately. We apply TCP pacing to fix this issue, and validate its effectiveness in the aspects of throughput, packet loss and fairness. Our experiment results also show that PERT with Delayed ACK and Pacing is more friendly, and therefore more suitable when multiple traffic flows are competing for limited bottleneck bandwidth or sharing the same router buffer...|$|R
50|$|Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) adds a {{standard}} tag or header {{known as a}} 'label' to existing packets of data. In certain situations {{it is possible to}} use MPLS in a 'stacked' manner, so that labels are added to packets that have already been labelled. Connections between MPLS systems can also be 'native', with no underlying transport protocol, or MPLS labelled packets can be carried inside frame relay or HDLC packets as payloads. Correct <b>thoughput</b> calculations need to take such configurations into account. For example, a data packet could have two MPLS labels attached via 'label-stacking', then be placed as payload inside an HDLC frame. This generates more overhead that has {{to be taken into account}} that a single MPLS label attached to a packet which is then sent 'natively', with no underlying protocol to a receiving system.|$|E

40|$|Use of {{multimedia}} services, such as streaming {{of high quality}} videos on mobile devices is increasing drastically which requires high data rate and bandwidth on mobile devices. Therefore LTE system is introduced by 3 GPP which promises higher throughput on mobile devices i. e. 326. 4 Mbps in downlink and 86. 4 Mbps in uplink. Theoritically LTE system promises high throughput, high bandwidth utilization, low latency, high spectral efficiency, and high peak data rates than all other 3 GPP technologies. The main motive behind this research is to analyze the LTE system performance in practical scenarios to estimate the practical system throughput and peak data rates in different situations. LTE system level simulation are performed in this thesis to evaluate the performance in practical scenarios. The simulation are performed with LTE system level simulator to calculate the user and cell <b>thoughput</b> of the LTE network in different practical scenarios such as outdoor, indoor, deep indoor and in car with different network layouts, antenna downtilt angles and MIMO. Simulation {{results show that the}} LTE system user and cell <b>thoughput</b> are greatly affected by interference from the neighbouring cells and are different in practical situation than in theory. Results also show that the interference can be reduced by using different network layouts, antenna downtilting and MIMO. Hence high system throughput can be achieved by mitigating the effect of interference from the neighboring cells...|$|E

In fact, we consider two policies as far as arbitration among the input queues is concerned and we show how <b>thoughput</b> can increase as m gets larger.

Existing detectors either use costly sorting for better performance or sacrifice sorting for high throughput. To achieve good performance with high <b>thoughput,</b> our detector runs multiple search passes in parallel, where each search pass detects the transmit stream with a different permuted detection order. We show that this flexible detector, including QR decomposition preprocessing, outperforms existing GPU MIMO detectors while maintaining good bit error rate (BER) performance. In addition, this detector can achieve different tradeoff between throughput and accuracy by changing the number of parallel search passes. I...|$|E

Because WiMax technology is capable of supporting data transmission speeds are very high. One of the issues that are popular on this technology is the quality of service varies for each application that use. The quality of this service depends on the scheduling algorithm used in the WiMAX network. In Wimax,there are no standard that regulate scheduler implementation so the designers can implement any scheduling algorithm in WiMAX accordance with needs. In the final project will simulate the Mobile WiMAX network that aims to determine the performance of the algorithm used in this network. Scheduling will be analyzed in this final project was the Modified Deficit Round Robin (MDRR) and Round Robin (RR). Network simulations are conducted using OPNET 14. 0 software. Some of the metrics used as performance benchmarks scheduling algorithm is throughput, delay, and Fairness Index. In the first scenario scheduling can work well for applications that run fourth. It {{can be seen from the}} results <b>thoughput</b> stable, time delay is small enough, and Firness index value approaching the value 1. In the second scenario scheduling can work well even though the throughput of Web applications has decreased. But overall throughput value remains stable. Value of time delay that occurs is also still quite small. While the Fairness index value decreased due to declining <b>thoughput</b> web applications. In the third scenario, all applications have a fairly stable value unless the web application,. It can be seen from the throughput, and delay time. While the Fairness Index decreased due to this scenario does not appear throughput web application. Throughput of this application does not arise because these applications have the lowest QoS, so when traffic is full throughput of this application does not appear.

40|$|Abstract — To protect SIP {{communication}} networks from attacks, especially flooding attacks like Denial-of-Service or message spam, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) {{are deployed}} at the ingress {{point of the}} network to filter potential malicious traffic. A key issue of IDS performance is the operation of its firewall to block malicious user requests. Depending on {{the complexity of the}} firewall ruleset, filtering performance of the IDS can decrease considerably during high-load flooding situations. In this paper we propose a scheme to increase IDS firewall performance by merging several similar rules into more general ones and ignoring lesser relevant rules {{to limit the number of}} firewall rules. We formalise a mathematical model to compute new firewall rules and show exemplary with traffic from SIP VoIP communication networks how the calculation can be performed. If applied to a VoIP IDS, the scheme can increase firewall <b>thoughput</b> considerably, while retaining most of its effectiveness. I...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} off-loading some time {{critical}} {{parts in the}} process of performing intrusion detection from software to reconfigurable hardware (FPGA). Signatures of known attacks must typically be compared to high speed network traffic, and string matching becomes a bottleneck. Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) are known to be fast string matchers, but offer little flexibility. For that purpose a Variable Word-Width CAM for fast string matching has been designed and implemented in an FPGA. A typical feature for this CAM is that the length of each word is independent from the others, in contrast to common CAMs where all words have the same length. The design has been functionally tested on a development board for a CAM of size 1822 bytes (128 words). This design processes 8 bits per clock cycle and has a reported maximum clock speed of 100 MHz. This gives a <b>thoughput</b> of 800 Mbit/s. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} in general to develop analytic tools for the performance study of computer networks, and is in particular motivated by a need to understand how restricted buffer sharing policies can be used for congestion control in the nodes of a packet switching computer communication network. Models of a single packet switching node with finite storage and restricted buffer sharing policies are developed. Effexts of acknowledgement signals as well as retransmission are considered. We introduce the concept of "penalty functions" and incorporate these in the packet switching node model in order to give priority to packets that have reached their destination node and thus should be lost. The single packet switching node models are used to form a model of a complete packet switching network. We present for the different models comprehensive results as <b>thoughput,</b> delays, blocking probabilities and buffe allocation schemes. We derive a number of analytic tools, inroduce some new concepts and clarify some techniques, used in our models, to compute the main performance characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{conveyor}} belt wear rate is key for BHP Billiton Iron Ore (BHPBIO) maintenance strategies as it {{owns and operates}} over three hundred conveyor systems across the Pilbara region. Analysis of 114 belts installed on 22 conveyors, completed by Callum Webb (2013), produced a statistical understanding of belt wear rate considering the following variables: conveyor duty, belt speed, belt width, cycle time, belt strength and throughput material. Of the 5 alternate linear models explored, the 1 D throughput based measure, which captures utilisation data unaccounted for in the conventional time base wear rates, proved most descriptive. This project confirms that throughput linear models better characterise belt wear rates. In addition, via dataset expansion to 211 belts installed on 98 conveyors, more robust regression models have been obtained. Further analysis of additional parameters has shown material drop height, loading characteristics and selected interaction terms have little effect on wear rate prediction. Finally, the expanded 1 D <b>thoughput</b> model has undergone successful cross validation using an unseen test dataset of 71 belts to provide prediction intervals for future estimates of belt wear. This outcome forms the basis for tool integration and improved reliability of BHPBIO’s conveyor maintenance scheduling...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) under construction at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA) of the Australian National University (ANU) for the ANU 2. 3 m telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory. WiFeS {{is a powerful}} integral field, double-beam, concentric, image-slicing spectrograph designed to deliver excellent <b>thoughput,</b> wavelength stability, spectrophotometric performance and superb image quality along with wide spectral coverage throughout the 320 - 950 nm wavelength region. It provides a 25 x 38 arcsec. field with 0. 5 arcsec. sampling along each of twenty five 38 X 1 arcsec slitlets. The output format is optimized to match the 4096 x 4096 pixel CCD detectors in each of two cameras individually optimized for the blue and the red ends of the spectrum, respectively. A process of "interleaved nod-and-shuffle" will be applied to permit quantum noise-limited sky subtraction. Using VPH gratings, spectral resolutions of 3000 and 7000 are provided. The full spectral range is covered in a single exposure at R= 3000, and in two exposures in the R= 7000 mode. The use of transmissive coated optics, VPH gratings and optimized mirror coatings ensures a throughput (including telescope atmosphere and detector) > 30 % over a wide spectral range. The concentric image-slicer design ensures an excellent and uniform image quality across the full field. To maximize scientific return, the whole instrument is configured for remote observing, pipeline data reduction, and the accumulation of calibration image libraries.

40|$|Biomarkers {{identification}} {{represents one}} of the most attractive goals in all biological research field due to its important application to improve diagnosis, guide molecularly targeted therapy and monitor activity and therapeutic response across a wide spectrum of disease and pathological states. With its ability to discover new metabolic markers, NMR metabolic profiling (metabonomics), coupled with pattern recognition methods, represents a highly effective approach for disease development and characterization. The purpose of the present thesis is to explore the recent NMR improvements by applying and developing new metabolomic strategies for biomarkers discovery, including NMR data handling, peaks quantification and fast data acquisition. We applied NMR spectroscopy and regression techniques to different patient classes to discriminate a) the progressive liver alterations during tumorigenesis and b) the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) of patients with airway diseases. In the first application a) Principal component analysis (PCA) and Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (O 2 PLS-DA) showed that the disease evolution clearly followed the increase of the lactate together with the remarkable decrease of the glucose signal, thus suggesting that such a signal pattern may act as a potential marker for assessing pathological hepatic lesions. In particular, we identified a statistical model {{that could be used to}} distinguish hepatic metastasis and human hepatocarcinoma from a "normal" (healthy) hepatic tissue. In the second application b) we investigated the role of pre-analytical variables (saliva and disinfectant contamination), potentially influencing EBC, to evaluate the stability and reproducibility of samples and to discriminate healthy subjects from patients with airway disease. Our results show that saliva does not hamper EBC discrimination of different samples, while the disinfectant could act as a strong contaminant. However, by selecting specific non-contaminated regions of spectra, Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was able to discriminate EBC of healthy subjects, laryngectomized and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As a further enhanced tool for high <b>thoughput</b> NMR analysis, we developed and tested a new integration method for 2 D NMR spectra quantification, called CAKE, based upon NMR axial symmetry and Monte Carlo Hit-or-Miss technique. Integration tests on simulated and experimental peaks with different degree of overlap, showed the CAKE efficacy in estimating umbiased peak volume, even for strongly overlapping peaks. Moreover, it is substantially independent on digital resolution and SNR. Finally, we successfully investigated the possibility of exploiting enhanced NMR pulse sequences for fast spectra acquisition. In particular, we applied the so-called SOFAST-HMQC pulse scheme to detect in-cell metabolism. we have applied the SOFAST experiment to 15 N-labeled Thalassiosira rotula diatom cells obtaining, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of fast NMR spectroscopy. We collected spectra in 10 - 15 s of acquisition time, pinpointing the T. rotula 1 H- 15 N metabolic profiling directly in living cells...|$|E
