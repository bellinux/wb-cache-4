5|$|The {{table below shows}} <b>typical</b> <b>values</b> for stars {{along the}} main sequence. The values of {{luminosity}} (L), radius (R) and mass (M) are relative to the Sun—a dwarf star with a spectral classification of G2 V. The actual values for a star may vary {{by as much as}} 20–30% from the values listed below.|$|E
5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography {{is a function of}} the rate at which the mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. <b>Typical</b> <b>values</b> for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features on the surface of the Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
25|$|While the {{standard}} deviation does measure how far <b>typical</b> <b>values</b> tend {{to be from the}} mean, other measures are available. An example is the mean absolute deviation, which might be considered a more direct measure of average distance, compared to the root mean square distance inherent in {{the standard}} deviation.|$|E

This ratio ensures that excess hydrogen is available throughout the process [1, 15].|$|R

25|$|Rolling {{resistance}} is {{the force that}} resists the rolling of a wheel or other circular object along a surface caused by deformations in the object or surface. Generally the force of rolling {{resistance is}} less than that associated with kinetic friction. <b>Typical</b> <b>values</b> for the coefficient of rolling resistance are 0.001.|$|E
25|$|BMI is used {{differently}} for children. It is calculated {{in the same}} way as for adults, but then compared to <b>typical</b> <b>values</b> for other children of the same age. Instead of comparison against fixed thresholds for underweight and overweight, the BMI is compared against the percentile for children of the same sex and age.|$|E
25|$|The {{heating value}} {{depends on the}} source of gas that is used and the process {{that is used to}} liquefy the gas. The range of heating value can span +/- 10 to 15 percent. A <b>typical</b> <b>value</b> of the higher heating value of LNG is {{approximately}} 50MJ/kg or 21,500BTU/lb. A <b>typical</b> <b>value</b> of the lower heating value of LNG is 45MJ/kg or 19,350BTU/lb.|$|R

25|$|Herbivores such as {{cows and}} sheep consume {{terrestrial}} plant matter (grass) which contains β-sitosterol {{as the principal}} sterol. β-sitosterol is the 24-ethyl derivative of cholesterol {{and can be used}} as a biomarker for terrestrial plant matter (see section). In the gut of these animals, bacteria biohydrogenate the double bond in the 5 position to create 24-ethyl coprostanol and so this compound {{can be used as a}} biomarker for faecal matter from herbivores. <b>Typical</b> <b>values</b> in different source materials can be seen in the table after Gilpin.|$|E
25|$|Pulp {{chemistry}} has {{a significant}} influence on nanocellulose microstructure. Carboxymethylation increases the numbers of charged groups on the fibril surfaces, making the fibrils easier to liberate and results in smaller and more uniform fibril widths (5–15nm) compared to enzymatically pre-treated nanocellulose, where the fibril widths were 10–30nm. The degree of crystallinity and crystal structure of nanocellulose. Nanocellulose exhibits cellulose crystal I organization {{and the degree of}} crystallinity is unchanged by the preparation of the nanocellulose. <b>Typical</b> <b>values</b> for the degree of crystallinity were around 63%.|$|E
25|$|The {{dissipation}} constant is {{a measure}} of the thermal connection of the thermistor to its surroundings. It is generally given for the thermistor in still air, and in well-stirred oil. <b>Typical</b> <b>values</b> for a small glass bead thermistor are 1.5mW/°C in still air and 6.0mW/°C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a thermistor may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the thermistor may be used as a flow rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the thermistor.|$|E

25|$|The median {{is one of}} {{a number}} of ways of {{summarising}} the <b>typical</b> <b>values</b> associated with members of a statistical population; thus, it is a possible location parameter. The median is the 2nd quartile, 5th decile, and 50th percentile. Since the median is the same as the second quartile, its calculation is illustrated in the article on quartiles. A median can be worked out for ranked but not numerical classes (e.g. working out a median grade when students are graded from A to F), although the result might be halfway between grades if there is an even number of cases.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{is measured}} according to EN 12667. <b>Typical</b> <b>values</b> range from 0.032 to 0.038 W/(m·K) {{depending on the}} density of the EPS board. The value of 0.038 W/(m·K) was obtained at 15kg/m3 while the value of 0.032 W/(m·K) was obtained at 40kg/m3 according to the data sheet of K-710 from StyroChem Finland. Adding fillers (graphites, aluminium, or carbons) has recently allowed the thermal conductivity of EPS to reach around 0.030–0.034 (as low as 0.029) and as such has a grey/black colour which distinguishes it from standard EPS. Several EPS producers have produced a variety of these increased thermal resistance EPS usage for this product in the UK & EU.|$|E
25|$|The {{collagen}} fibers {{are approximately}} 1-2 μm thick. Thus, {{the resolution of}} the imaging technique needs to be approximately 0.5 μm. Some techniques allow the direct acquisition of volume data while other need the slicing of the specimen. In both cases, the volume that is extracted must be able to follow the fiber bundles across the volume. High contrast makes segmentation easier, especially when color information is available. In addition, the need for fixation must also be addressed. It has been shown that soft tissue fixation in formalin causes shrinkage, altering the structure of the original tissue. Some <b>typical</b> <b>values</b> of contraction for different fixation are: formalin (5% - 10%), alcohol (10%), bouin (<5%).|$|E

25|$|To {{achieve the}} desired setting qualities in the {{finished}} product, a quantity (2–8%, but typically 5%) of calcium sulfate (usually gypsum or anhydrite) {{is added to the}} clinker, and the mixture is finely ground to form the finished cement powder. This is achieved in a cement mill. The grinding process is controlled to obtain a powder with a broad particle size range, in which typically 15% by mass consists of particles below 5 μm diameter, and 5% of particles above 45 μm. The measure of fineness usually used is the 'specific surface area', which is the total particle surface area of a unit mass of cement. The rate of initial reaction (up to 24 hours) of the cement on addition of water is directly proportional to the specific surface area. <b>Typical</b> <b>values</b> are 320–380m2·kg−1 for general purpose cements, and 450–650m2·kg−1 for 'rapid hardening' cements. The cement is conveyed by belt or powder pump to a silo for storage. Cement plants normally have sufficient silo space for one to 20 weeks of production, depending upon local demand cycles. The cement is delivered to end users either in bags, or as bulk powder blown from a pressure vehicle into the customer's silo. In industrial countries, 80% or more of cement is delivered in bulk.|$|E
