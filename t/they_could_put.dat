5|$|After {{the first}} year of development, Gas Powered Games found that {{they were not going to}} be able to finish the game within the planned two years; not only was the {{seamless}} world without loading screens harder to create than they had thought, but, according to lead developer Bartosz Kijanka, they had been overambitious in choosing how many innovative features <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> into the game's custom engine, such as the wide range through which the virtual camera system could zoom in and out. Other features supported and later dropped included allowing up to ten characters at once—and therefore maintaining up to ten areas of the single-player world—instead of the final maximum of eight, and a weather system that included wind blowing projectiles off course. According to Kijanka, the developers also spent a lot of time changing technologies mid-development, such as building a custom animation editor before moving to a licensed one, and starting with the OpenGL graphics library only to switch to Direct3D. As a result, the team was required to work 12–14 hour days and weekends for most of the development time in order to complete the game within four years. In a 2011 interview, Taylor stated that in retrospect the final cost in development time of the seamless world may have been too high, and also that the team tried to make too large of a game for their budget; he believed that a game with closer to 35 hours of playtime instead of 70 would have been a better and more polished experience given their constraints.|$|E

25|$|A {{theory is}} called {{categorical}} {{if it has}} only one model, up to isomorphism. This term was introduced by , and for some time thereafter mathematicians hoped <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> mathematics on a solid foundation by describing a categorical first-order theory of some version of set theory. The Löwenheim–Skolem theorem dealt a first blow to this hope, as it implies that a first-order theory which has an infinite model cannot be categorical. Later, in 1931, the hope was shattered completely by Gödel's incompleteness theorem.|$|E

25|$|In the 2005–06 season, Hibs {{got off to}} an {{excellent}} start, winning 10 of their first 14 league games. This form led to speculation by some commentators that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> in a challenge for the championship, but Mowbray played down the club's chances, pointing to the inconsistency of the side and the much higher budgets of Rangers, Celtic and Hearts. Highlights of the season included three consecutive victories over Rangers (including two 3–0 wins at Ibrox Stadium), and a 2–0 victory over Hearts that ended their unbeaten start to the league.|$|E
25|$|When {{knowledge}} of Port Adelaide's negotiations {{to gain an}} AFL licence were made public, many in the SANFL saw it {{as an act of}} treachery. SANFL clubs urged Justice Olssen to make an injunction against the bid, which he agreed to. The AFL suggested to the SANFL that if they didn't want Port Adelaide to join the AFL, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> forward a counter bid to enter a composite South Australian side into the AFL. After legal action from all parties, the AFL finally agreed to accept the SANFL's bid and the Adelaide Football Club was born.|$|E
25|$|Iraqi forces {{failed in}} their attacks on Israeli {{settlements}} {{with the most}} notable battle taking place at Gesher, and instead took defensive positions around Jenin, Nablus, and Tulkarm, from where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> pressure on the Israeli center. On 25 May, Iraqi forces advanced from Tulkarm, taking Geulim and reaching Kfar Yona and Ein Vered on the Tulkarm-Netanya road. The Alexandroni Brigade then stopped the Iraqi advance and retook Geulim. On 1 June, the Carmeli and Golani Brigades captured Jenin from Iraqi forces. They were pushed out by an Iraqi counterattack, and lost 34 dead and 100 wounded.|$|E

25|$|For most of {{the colonial}} period and during the Revolution, Hudson was a small {{waterfront}} area with little development known as Claverack Landing. That began to change in 1783 {{when a group of}} New England whalers, many of them Quakers, came west looking for somewhere <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> their ships where the British could not easily find them and destroy them. Claverack Landing, between what were then two small bays near the furthest point up the Hudson River accessible to oceangoing ships, seemed ideal. They bought the land from a Dutch settler in the area. Calling themselves the Proprietors, they divided the land into lots of equal size and made an agreement that they would either settle their land themselves or sell it at cost.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister William Pitt {{met with}} a number of inventors and amateur tacticians during the year, who {{proposed}} new and novel ways of attacking the French before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> to sea. Ideas included sinking blockships in the harbour mouth, releasing rocket-carrying balloons over the port at night to be detonated by clockwork, or sending in a fleet of fireships. On 20 July 1804 Pitt and Sir Home Popham met with the American born inventor Robert Fulton. Fulton had been working in France designing submarines, but having failed to generate any real interest in the French Navy for the practical application of his inventions, Fulton had come to Britain and offered his services to the Admiralty. He proposed an assault using a combination of fireships, torpedoes, mines and other explosive devices, a concept that Pitt agreed to. A contract was signed and Fulton was tasked with working with the Admiralty to build his devices in anticipation of an assault later that year.|$|E
25|$|Economical bowling from André Nel and Danish Kaneria gave Essex Eagles {{the victory}} over Hampshire Hawks at Chelmsford, {{and the four}} points for the win {{increased}} their lead in the National League to an unassailable 14 points and secured the National League title. Essex opener William Jefferson kept his calm {{while the rest of}} the top order deserted him, making 88, but when three wickets fell for only three runs and the score was 172 for 7 Hampshire would have fancied their chances of bowling Essex out. Only two more wickets fell, though, as contributions from Ryan ten Doeschate, Graham Napier and Kaneria propelled Essex to 222 for 9 at the end of their 45 overs. Hampshire and England fast bowler Chris Tremlett got Napier, ten Doeschate and James Middlebrook out to end with three wickets for 48. Despite John Crawley and Nic Pothas recording a first-wicket partnership of 95, Kaneria kept his calm, only allowing 26 runs off his nine overs, and boundaries were rare after Pothas and Crawley were dismissed. In the end, Hampshire finished on 210 for 8, 13 runs short of victory – <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> some of the blame on their overseas players, as Australians Shane Watson and Andy Bichel contributed only four runs off 18 deliveries.|$|E

500|$|Gameplay was {{compared}} frequently to Blizzard's Diablo series. According to Sullivan, the comparison was inevitable as Diablo helped define the genre, and was emphasized {{by the lack}} of action RPGs at the time. While the core gameplay remained traditional, they attempted to innovate in other areas. Character creation was simplified to simply choosing a name and gender rather than character types being tied to classes or chosen proficiency. They also effectively removed tutorials so players could get straight into gameplay, using games like Neverwinter Nights as an example of tutorials impeding players during early stages. When creating the skill system, the team looked at earlier successful RPGs and considered how they could improve on them. They also wanted to avoid creating characters who had [...] "a little of everything" [...] while offering replayability. The result was the creation of the themed masteries, with the added element of skill acquisition not being tied to level progression, allowing for players to bank skill points for different purposes. This system was built to encourage player freedom and represent logical character progression rather than tying one character to one class. Spawn points for enemies were governed by a random generation system, of what monsters are spawned depending on both environment and player level. Loot was controlled by a database system which mixed and matched characteristics to produce [...] "over 100,000" [...] item combinations. Loot drops were also made to fit the types of creatures killed, in contrast to other games such as World of Warcraft which had animals dropping currency and weapons regardless. Loot types were also designed to be clearly visible on enemies so players could pick and choose which enemies to engage and which defeated enemy to loot. According to Bruno, the team were limited with the amount of impact and realism <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> into combat by the necessity of keeping the game within its prescribed ESRB age ratings of [...] "E for Everyone" [...] and [...] "T for Teens": this meant that blood was non-existent and hit reactions were minimal, negatively affecting player impressions of the game. Multiplayer was part of the game plan from its beginnings, with the main goal being to foster a community around the game. Bruno later faulted the lack of secure multiplayer as one of the major faults with the game: THQ apparently was unwilling to invest in this.|$|E

2500|$|Tarmo was {{powered by}} two triple-expansion steam engines {{manufactured}} in Wallsend, one driving a propeller in the stern {{and the other}} a second propeller in the bow. The main function of the bow propeller was to reduce friction between the hull and the ice although the exact details of the icebreaking process were not known at that time. The stern engine produced 1,700 ihp at 97 rpm and the bow engine 1,300 ihp at 107 rpm, but for short periods of time <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> out 2,400 ihp at 98 rpm and 1,450 ihp at 120 rpm, respectively. This made her considerably more powerful than Sampo, whose two engines had together produced only 3,052 ihp during sea trials and were rated at 2,800 ihp. Tarmo could maintain a speed of [...] in open water, typical for icebreakers of her type at that time. Like all icebreakers of her age, Tarmo was also equipped with sails – two staysails and two Bermuda sails – although they were rarely, if ever, used. In the early 1930s, the sails were cut up piece by piece for other uses and eventually disappeared from the inventory.|$|E
2500|$|With matches between Manchester United and Liverpool and Chelsea and Arsenal scheduled, 23 March 2008 {{was dubbed}} [...] "Grand Slam Sunday" [...] by Sky Sports. Manchester United {{kicked off the}} day's action, knowing that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> {{pressure}} on both Arsenal and Chelsea by winning. However, the Red Devils {{took a while to}} get into their stride and Liverpool controlled the first ten minutes. Still, it was United who created the first chance of the game, although Wayne Rooney was unable to beat Pepe Reina after Anderson's through-ball. A few minutes later, Javier Mascherano was booked for a reckless challenge on Paul Scholes. The Argentinian was unimpressed, and continued to contest referee Steve Bennett's decisions as the game went on. The first goal of the game came in the 34th minute, through the most unlikely of goalscorers. After robbing Steven Gerrard of the ball two-thirds of the way up the field, Wes Brown continued his run into the Liverpool box, and found himself on the end of Wayne Rooney's cross, heading past a less than confident Reina. Then, a few minutes before half-time, Liverpool were awarded a free-kick just inside the United half. Believing that Paul Scholes deserved a yellow card for the challenge, Fernando Torres remonstrated with referee Bennett, for which he earned himself a yellow card. Incensed by his teammate's punishment, Mascherano rushed in to make his own protest. The referee, though, was not very receptive to Mascherano's protest, and gave him a second yellow card for dissent, sending him off.|$|E
