The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a larger one at the back.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This is {{the first}} paper to discuss the ON-state drain–current of a special {{thin-film}} transistor structure with a wide channel width and a narrow source/drain <b>width</b> in <b>the</b> linear region. The experimental results indicate that when <b>the</b> channel <b>width</b> is wider than <b>the</b> source/drain <b>width,</b> <b>the</b> side-channel current effect is generated. This effect increases the ON-state drain–current due to the additional current-flow paths exist-ing in the side-channel regions and low channel resistance. As <b>the</b> side-channel <b>width</b> increases, <b>the</b> ON-state drain–current ini-tially increases and then gradually becomes independent of <b>the</b> side-channel <b>width</b> when <b>the</b> side-channel <b>width</b> is larger than <b>the</b> effective side-channel <b>width,</b> which depends on <b>the</b> channel <b>width</b> and is largely independent of <b>the</b> source/drain <b>width.</b> This paper also demonstrates that the ON-state drain–current gain is directly proportional to the channel length and {{the ratio of the}} channel length to <b>the</b> source/drain <b>width</b> and dependent on <b>the</b> side-channel <b>width.</b> Index Terms—Drain–current, poly-Si thin-film transistor (TFT), source/drain width, wide channel width.

5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter <b>the</b> <b>width,</b> and a red band of one-quarter <b>the</b> <b>width.</b> All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half <b>the</b> <b>width</b> of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E

5|$|Of the British troops, {{approximately}} 3,300 {{formed into}} a shallow horseshoe formation that stretched across <b>the</b> <b>width</b> of the Plains, the main firing line being roughly one kilometre long. Two battalions were deployed, facing north, {{to cover the}} left flank and a further two formed a reserve. In order to cover the entire plain, Wolfe was forced to array his soldiers two ranks deep, rather than the more conventional three ranks. On the left wing, regiments under Townshend exchanged fire with the militia in the scrub and captured a small collection of houses and gristmill to anchor the line. The defenders pushed the British from one house, but were repelled and, in retreat, lit several houses on fire {{to keep them out}} of enemy hands. Smoke from these fires wound up masking the British left, and may have confused Montcalm as to <b>the</b> <b>width</b> of the lines. As Wolfe's men waited for the defenders, the steady fire became intense enough that Wolfe ordered his men to lie down amid the high grass and brush.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the most}} highly skilled Chacoans shaped and set stone; others carried {{supplies}} and mixed mortar. <b>The</b> <b>width</b> of a given wall was determined by its place in a structure. The first story of a two-story wall is always wider than the second. Chacoan walls are often called core-and-veneer, but only the widest walls had cores. The Chacoans tried to build walls with two flush faces, but because the stones were typically quite small, to build a wider wall they built up a space between the two faces; this spacing is often called the core. In most walls, the core consisted of roughly shaped stone or rubble laid {{at the same time}} as the two faces. In others, the faces were built up independently, and the core packed between them. Chacoan walls derive their stability from the degree of contact between stones in the faces and <b>the</b> <b>width</b> of the wall itself, not from the strength of the core.|$|E
