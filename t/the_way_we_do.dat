25|$|As human {{machines}} {{being made}} up of cells controlled by our brain to influence aspects of our behaviour, {{there must be some}} influence of biology on our consumer behaviour and how we purchase as well. The nature versus nurture debate {{is at the core of}} how much biology influences these buying decisions, because it argues the extent to which biological factors influence what we do, and how much is reflected through environmental factors. Neuromarketing is of interest to marketers in measuring the reaction of stimulus to marketing. Even though we know there is a reaction, the question of why we consume <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> still lingers, but it is a step in the right direction. Biology helps to understand consumer behaviour as it influences consumption and aids in the measurement of it.|$|E
500|$|The SRVUSD opened both Dougherty and Live Oak Elementary School on August 25, 2007. Dougherty {{began its}} inaugural school year on August 27, 2007, {{becoming}} the first high school in 34 years {{to open in the}} SRVUSD. History teacher James Corcoran noted that working at the first year school was an opportunity to develop its community, saying [...] "You oftentimes will go into a school as a teacher, or even a principal, and it's 'This is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it around here.' It's hard to change that once it's been set." [...] Elaine O'Hanlon, founding president of the Dougherty Parent-Teacher Association, said that parent volunteering would be encouraged at the new school.|$|E

500|$|Marvel Comics {{editor-in-chief}} Joe Quesada felt dissolving the Peter Parker and Mary Jane {{marriage and}} returning Spider-Man to his roots {{was necessary to}} preserve the longevity of the character for the next 20 or 30 years. Quesada said he and other previous editors-in-chief had long been seeking an opportunity to begin a new methodology in which to tell Spider-Man stories, but had not found a reasonable way to do so. Quesada said, [...] "It's very easy to un-marry a character, or fix something like that: you just do a huge universal retcon, and say a few events in history didn't happen. But that's really not <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it here at Marvel." [...] Quesada found an opportunity to address this in {{the events of the}} 2007 Civil War mini-series, which resulted in the unmasking of Spider-Man's identity to the public. Quesada knew J. Michael Straczynski was planning to end his run as a Marvel writer, so he personally approached Straczynski to propose [...] "One More Day" [...] as his final project.|$|E

2500|$|When Savant replied [...] "one out of three", readers {{wrote the}} odds were 50–50. In a follow-up, she defended her answer, saying that [...] "If we could shake a pair of puppies out of a cup <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> dice, there are four ways they could land", in three of which at least one is male, but in only one of which none are male.|$|E
50|$|The term Digital Economy {{was coined}} in Don Tapscotts 1995 book The Digital Economy : Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence.

5000|$|The {{season has}} gone so well from last year, but to come to Michigan {{and be able to}} run <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> today, after <b>the</b> <b>way</b> we've run here the past three years, this shows how far the {{organization}} has come as a whole,” Gil Martin, speaking after the race.|$|R
2500|$|Though In/Casino/Out was {{recorded}} live, [...] "Relationship of Command {{may very well}} be the first record to harness the chaotic balance of adrenaline and intellect of ATDI's live performance." [...] "Ross was instrumental in bringing out a lot of feeling from us," [...] Bixler recalls. [...] "We channeled a lot of emotion into this record. He pushed us farther than we thought we could go. I learned to cut loose <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> live and not to be afraid to break something or whatever." [...] While capturing the essence of At the Drive-In's live shows in a way never before seen, the record also featured some of the band's most experimental songs, including [...] "Rolodex Propaganda", [...] "Non-Zero Possibility", and [...] "Invalid Litter Dept." [...]|$|E
2500|$|Dictionaries and {{scholars}} have offered {{a variety of}} definitions. The Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary offers a definition of the term: [...] "the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems" [...] and [...] "a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology." [...] Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 [...] "Real World of Technology" [...] lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is [...] "practice, <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> things around here." [...] The term {{is often used to}} imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole. Bernard Stiegler, in Technics and Time, 1, defines technology in two ways: as [...] "the pursuit of life by means other than life," [...] and as [...] "organized inorganic matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014 {{there was}} {{speculation}} {{in the aftermath}} of Operation Onymous that a Tor weakness had been exploited. A representative of Europol was secretive about the method used, saying: [...] "This is something we want to keep for ourselves. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> this, we can’t share with the whole world, because we want to do it again and again and again." [...] A BBC source cited a [...] "technical breakthrough" [...] that allowed the tracking of the physical location of servers, and the number of sites that police initially claimed to have infiltrated led to speculation that a weakness in the Tor network had been exploited. This possibility was downplayed by Andrew Lewman, a representative of the not-for-profit Tor project, suggesting that execution of more traditional police work was more likely. However, in November 2015 court documents on the matter generated serious ethical security research as well as Fourth Amendment concerns.|$|E
5000|$|There isn't {{an artist}} {{in the world who}} doesn't listen to an album that they've done and go, 'I could have done that better', but I think on the whole, in every aspect of {{recording}} and just <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it, <b>we</b> <b>did</b> ourselves proud with that album.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} before, neither network behaviors nor message characteristics had to {{be defined}} in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> in this study. Longer, more practical, socially more sensitive lists of characteristics and behaviors, proposed by future studies may result in much more practical guidelines for us to understand why specific messages travel in <b>the</b> network <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they do.|$|R

2500|$|In Pakistan, an {{editorial}} in Dawn, the country's oldest English-language newspaper, {{said that there was}} no doubt that the Facebook initiative [...] "was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation," [...] adding that it was [...] "debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities." [...] However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a [...] "knee-jerk reaction," [...] saying that, [...] "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs," [...] and that the block might [...] "have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision." ...|$|E
2500|$|In simply {{narrative}} terms, Roquentin's nausea {{arises from}} his near-complete detachment from other people, his not needing much interaction {{with them for}} daily necessities: [...] "the fact of his alienation from others is important; as his own work ceases to entertain and to occupy him, Roquentin has nothing that could distract him from the business of existing in its simplest forms." [...] As a practical matter, he could solve his problem by getting a job; but, as a device for developing the novel's theme, his aloneness {{is a way of}} making him (and the reader) recognize that there is nothing inherent in the objective nature of the world that would give any necessary meaning to whatever actions he chose, and therefore nothing to restrict his freedom. [...] "is perception of the world around him becomes unstable as objects are disengaged from their usual frames of reference," [...] and he is forced to recognize that freedom is inescapable and that therefore creating a meaning for his life is his own responsibility. [...] "Nothing makes us act <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do,</b> except our own personal choice." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jackson didn't hold Anthrax's {{version in}} high esteem. In the June 1991 issue of Q magazine, Jackson remarked: [...] "I think it sounds kind of clumsy {{compared}} to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> it on <b>the</b> Live album. I mean, our version is really smoking. Theirs is actually slower than ours, {{and kind of}} lumpen. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> I feel about it is, Thanks for the royalties, guys." ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{nearly thirty}} {{years away from}} Hollywood, famed special effects {{supervisor}} Douglas Trumbull contributed to the visual effects work on The Tree of Life. Malick, a friend of Trumbull, approached him about the effects work and mentioned {{that he did not}} like the look of computer-generated imagery.

6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] {{her husband}} hesitated, [...] "I hardly {{know how to}} explain. But it seems that they think our living here in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> is orderly, and--and {{they want us to}} go to work, in short." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> it here. No time fooled away; nobody straggling {{in after}} the curtain's up. Wishing is quicker work than travelling.

It's lucky <b>we</b> turned <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>did,</b> for {{although}} it was taking us further from home it was but two miles along the road here, while, if we had gone <b>the</b> right <b>way,</b> {{it would have been}} six or seven before we arrived at the next village." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, no. You see, he doesn't {{confide in}} {{us a great}} deal, except to tell us his opinion of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> the steps.

In fact, I have been sent {{all the way up}} from down town simply to find out that simple matter. Of course, I could have asked the servants, but we always prefer to get our information from one of the family where possible. Now, let me see. Mr. Weiss was here, of course?" ...|$|E

I've come to feel--they are left too much to nurses and strangers.... And then you see he has agreed to nearly everything I had wanted. It wasn't only the personal things--I was anxious about those silly girls--the strikers. I didn't {{want them to be}} badly treated. It distressed me to think of them. I don't think you know how it distressed me. And he--he gave way upon all that. He says I may talk to him about the business, about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>do</b> our business--the kindness of it I mean. And this is why I am back here. Where else could I be?" ...|$|E
40|$|Cars {{have become}} the {{overwhelmingly}} favorite transportation mode in all the developing countries, and they're rapidly taking over {{in the rest of}} the world, as well.
