This has the benefit of being more rapid to implement, as physicians already trained in other areas can add the necessary emergency skills <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire.</b> However, after the initial expansion {{it is difficult for}} emergency medicine to progress further in nations that adopt this strategy, as the retrained practitioners identify more with their original specialty and have less incentive to continue to press for further innovations in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|During the October Revolution and the {{establishment}} of the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1918, Leontovych relocated without his family to Ukraine's capital Kiev, where he was active as both a conductor and composer. Several of his pieces gained popularity among professional and amateurs groups alike, who added them <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire.</b> In the beginning of 1919 the rest of his family also relocated to Kiev. During this period Leontovych also began teaching choir conducting alongside Hryhoriy Veryovka at the Kiev Conservatory, and also taught at the Mykola Lysenko Institute of Music and Drama. Leontovych was one of the organizers of the first Ukrainian State Orchestra. He participated in the founding of the Ukrainian Republic Capella of which he was the commissioner.|$|E

25|$|This new minstrelsy {{maintained}} {{an emphasis on}} refined music. Most troupes added jubilees, or spirituals, <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire</b> in the 1870s. These were fairly authentic religious slave songs borrowed from traveling black singing groups. Other troupes drifted further from minstrelsy's roots. When George Primrose and Billy West broke with Haverly's Mastodons in 1877, they did away with blackface {{for all but the}} endmen and dressed themselves in lavish finery and powdered wigs. They decorated the stage with elaborate backdrops and performed no slapstick whatsoever. Their brand of minstrelsy differed from other entertainments only in name.|$|E
25|$|Namdev's work {{is known}} for abhangas, a genre of hymn poetry in India. His poems were {{transmitted}} {{from one generation to}} the next within singing families, and memory was the only recording method in the centuries that followed Namdev's death. The repertoires grew, because the artists added new songs <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire.</b> The earliest surviving manuscripts of songs attributed to Namdev, from these singing families, are traceable to the 17th century. A diverse collection of these manuscripts exist, which have been neither compiled nor archived successfully in a single critical edition. The state Government of Maharashtra made an effort and compiled Namdev's work from various manuscripts into the Sri Namdev Gatha in 1970.|$|E

Rehearsals were moved from the cold air-raid shelter to Hanton's or Griffiths' house—as Griffiths' father had died in WWII, and his mother worked all day. The band also often visited Lennon's mother at 1 Blomfield Road, listening to her collection of rock and roll records by Elvis, Shirly and Lee's [...] "Let the Good Times Roll", and Gene Vincent's [...] "Be-Bop-A-Lula" [...] which they added <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire.</b> After his tenure on tea-chest bass, Nigel Walley became the group's manager.

Young Haitians formed small electric guitar-based bands. These yeye rock bands were short-lived, as the addition of compas <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoires</b> resulted in a sound was called mini-jazz, or mini-djaz in creole.|$|R
500|$|The hip hop {{group the}} Beastie Boys made a music video for their song [...] "Gratitude" [...] {{that appears to}} be a homage to the film.

The video ends with a message that reads, [...] "This video is dedicated to the memory {{of all the people who}} died at [...] Pompeii." [...] The Beastie Boys claimed in interviews that the song and the video came about from their desire to progress from being a straightforward hip hop group and add vintage instruments and old sound equipment <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire.</b>|$|E
500|$|Slovak, Kiedis, and Flea {{began to}} create their own music after finding {{inspiration}} in a punk-funk fusion band called Defunkt. The three formed a band with former Anthym-drummer Jack Irons called Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem. The band had only one song, entitled [...] "Out in L.A.", and was formed for the purpose of playing the song once. [...] The song was based on a guitar riff that Slovak wrote while [...] "jamming" [...] with Irons, and was not meant to become a real song until Kiedis decided to rap over the music. Following the group's first show at The Rhythm Lounge, the owner of the bar asked them to return, but with two songs instead of one. After several more shows, and the addition of several songs <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire,</b> the band's name was changed to Red Hot Chili Peppers.|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky Ball and Chain" [...] is {{an example}} of a song {{employing}} the unreliable narrator motif, according to Linnell. Influenced by the country-western musical tradition, the song is a [...] "simple regret song" [...] dealing with [...] "the one that got away". The fourth track and second single, [...] "Istanbul (Not Constantinople)", is a cover of the Four Lads song, which was originally released in 1953. Flansburgh and Linnell added [...] "Istanbul" [...] <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire</b> in the early 1980s in order to lengthen their live sets. From that point, it evolved from a folk-inspired cover to the baroque pop rendition that appears on Flood. A Casio FZ-1 synthesizer was used to perform the song in the studio. [...] "Dead", described by Rolling Stone as [...] "one of TMBG's most abstract and personal songs", follows the story of someone dying and then being [...] "reincarnated as a bag of groceries".

500|$|Trial by Jury {{soon became}} the most {{desirable}} supporting piece for any London production, and, outside London, the major British theatrical touring companies had added it <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire</b> by about 1877. [...] The original production was given a world tour by the Opera Comique's assistant manager Emily Soldene, which travelled as far as Australia. [...] Unauthorised [...] "pirate" [...] productions quickly sprang up in America, {{taking advantage of the}} fact that American courts did not enforce foreign copyrights. [...] It also became popular as part of the Victorian tradition of [...] "benefit concerts", where the theatrical community came together to raise money for actors and actresses down on their luck or retiring. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to play the work for a century, licensing the piece to amateur and foreign professional companies, such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company. [...] Since the copyrights to Gilbert and Sullivan works ran out in 1961, the piece has been available to theatre companies around the world free of royalties. [...] The work's enduring popularity since 1875 makes it, according to theatrical scholar Kurt Gänzl, [...] "probably the most successful British one-act operetta of all time".|$|E

[...] The emergence of a focus on governance {{as a means of}} promoting open markets had reverberations in the Middle East and North Africa. Critics of aid aimed at stimulating free market enterprise and thereby creating a middle class which would push for democracy assert that it can result in transforming local NGOs into a business sector framed as an example of entrepreneurship but dependent on aid from the West.|$|E

2500|$|In 1946 the AAGPBL made {{significant}} changes in its rules, extending {{the length of the}} base paths and pitching distance and decreasing the size of the ball. Later in the season the league allowed a sidearm pitching delivery, permitting the pitchers to add a curveball or sinker <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>repertoire</b> of fastball and changeup, all of which Faut had hurled before joining the league. All of these rules changes were designed to make the game more exciting and more like men's baseball.

The band's concert repertoire grew to ten songs as a result of months of playing at local nightclubs and bars. [...] At a performance at a strip club in Hollywood called Kit Kat Club, the band members performed wearing only socks on their penises, an idea formed by Kiedis. This gained the band notoriety, and club owners even began booking the group on the condition that they would perform in this manner. The Red Hot Chili Peppers entered Bijou Studios to record a demo tape and subsequently secured a record deal with EMI. Irons and Slovak however, decided to leave the Red Hot Chili Peppers in order to pursue a [...] "more serious" [...] future with rock band What Is This? Kiedis ultimately respected the decision, but felt the band would be lost without them. Kiedis and Flea hired drummer Cliff Martinez from The Weirdos and guitarist Jack Sherman to fill Iron's and Slovak's places, respectively. Andy Gill, formerly of Gang of Four, agreed to produce their first album, 1984's The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Gill and Sherman clashed with Kiedis and Flea; they continuously argued over music style, sound, and the album's production.
