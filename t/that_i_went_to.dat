Regarding this change in her career path, Fields told Peary in 1980 that [...] "All these young filmmakers are possessive. They feel I belong to them, and they feel a certain resentment - <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> the other side. In calmer moments, of course, they know it isn't true, that I can do more for them now." [...] Of Fields' work at Universal, Joel Schumacher was quoted in 1982 as saying: [...] "In the record business, you have Berry Gordy and Ahmet Ertegün. They're {{executives}} who actually made records. In the movie business, as an executive who's worked with film, you have only Verna. She saves Universal a fortune...every day." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1944 Donen and Kelly choreographed {{the musical}} Anchors Aweigh, {{released}} by MGM in 1945 and starring Kelly and Frank Sinatra. The most famous scene {{in this film}} is when Kelly dances with the cartoon mouse Jerry. The animation was supervised by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and is credited to cartoonist Fred Quimby, but {{the idea for the}} scene was Donen's. Originally Donen and Kelly wanted to use either Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck for the sequence and met with Walt Disney to discuss the project. At the time Disney was working on a similar idea in The Three Caballeros and was unwilling to allow one of his characters to appear in an MGM film. They spent two months shooting Kelly's dancing and Donen spent a year perfecting the scene frame by frame. According to Barbera [...] "the net result at the preview of Anchors Away <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to,</b> blew the audience away." ...|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important to me that this world feel real, and anytime I could build something I did. So I hired guys <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully people who watch the film feel like there’s a certain physicality to this world that hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects actually put this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy. Post-production wrapped on November 25, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|The airport {{designator}} [...] "SUX" [...] {{has been}} contentious. [...] Sioux City Mayor Craig Berenstein in 2002 described SUX as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] to the city. [...] After petitioning the FAA for a changed airport identifier in 1998 and 2002, authorities found the alternatives offered - GWU, GYO, GYT, SGV, and GAY - to be unappealing, and elected {{to stay with}} SUX. In October 2007, airport board member Dave Bernstein proposed embracing the identifier, saying [...] "Let's {{make the best of}} it.

[...] The airport now sells merchandise with the words [...] "Fly SUX".|$|E
2500|$|Kournikova {{received}} her first tennis racquet as a New Year gift in 1986 at age 5. Describing her early regimen, she said, [...] "I played two {{times a week}} from age six. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I {{was going to play}} professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd {{spend the rest of the}} day there just having fun with the kids." [...] In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world. Kournikova signed a management deal at age ten and went to Bradenton, Florida, to train at Nick Bollettieri's celebrated tennis academy.|$|E
2500|$|Blaxploitation was {{the first}} {{exploitation}} genre to {{picked up by the}} major studios in a substantial way. Indeed, the United Artists release Cotton Comes to Harlem (1970), directed by Ossie Davis, is seen as the first significant film of the type. Crossing over before the genre had even gotten established, Laurence Merrick's micro-budget independent The Black Angels (aka Black Bikers from Hell; 1970) followed by a few months. But the movie regarded as truly igniting the blaxploitation phenomenon, again completely independent, came the following year: Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is also perhaps the most outrageous example of the form—wildly experimental in style, borderline pornographic ("Rated X by an All White Jury," [...] declared the ads), and essentially a manifesto for a black American revolution. Melvin Van Peebles wrote, co-produced, directed, starred in, edited, and composed the music for the film, which was completed with the last-minute help of a $50,000 loan from Bill Cosby. It premiered in April 1971, distributed by Cinemation Industries, a small company then best known for releasing dubbed versions of the Italian Mondo Cane [...] "shockumentaries" [...] and the Swedish skin flick Fanny Hill, as well as for its one in-house production, The Man from O.R.G.Y. (1970). These were the sort of films that played in the [...] "grindhouses" [...] of the day—many of them not outright porno theaters, but rather specializing in all manner of exploitation cinema. As director Quentin Tarantino describes in a 2007 interview, [...] "Grindhouses were usually in the ghetto. Or they were the big old downtown movie theaters that sometimes stayed open all night long, for all the bums. At the grindhouse <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to,</b> every week there was the new kung fu movie, or new car-chase movie, or new sexploitation movie, or blaxploitation movie." [...] The days of six quickies for a nickel were gone, but a continuity of spirit was evident.|$|E
