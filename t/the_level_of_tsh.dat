40|$|Subclinical {{hyperthyroidism}} is {{a common}} clinical entity. Subclinical hyperthyroidism {{is defined as a}} serum TSH below the reference range but a normal T 4 and T 3 level in an asymptomatic patient. Whether or not subclinical hyperthyroidism should be treated remains a matter of debate. Cross-sectional studies and longitudinal population-based studies demonstrate association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and risk of atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis and cardiovascular and global mortality.

After 6 months of treatment with methimazole (MMI), the patients were randomly assigned to receive either MMI (96 patients) alone or MMI combined with IID (MMI+IID; 95 patients) treatment for 3 months, followed by continuing a dose of MMI that would maintain euthyroidism for the next 9 months in all of the patients. After withdrawal of the medical therapy, patients were followed for 24 months, and the relapse rate of hyperthyroidism was evaluated. Results: No statistical difference was observed in <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> serum FT 4, TSH, or TSH receptor antibodies (TR-Ab), the thyroid volume, or the TR-Ab positive rate between the two groups at month 6. After the next 3 months of treatment with MMI+IID or MMI alone, <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>TSH</b> increased significantly, and <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> serum TR-Ab, <b>the</b> TR-Ab positive rate, and thyroid volume decreased significantly in the MMI+IID group compared with the MMI group.

40|$|Background: Hypothyroidism {{means that}} the thyroid gland can't make enough thyroid hormone to keep the body running normally. We studied the histopathological and {{immunohistochemical}} changes in the hypothalamus of hypothyroid rat at the post-pubertal stage, {{in addition to the}} ameliorating role of folic acid. Material and Method: Twenty male albino rats were equally divided into four groups; the first and second groups were the control and folic acid groups respectively while the third group was the hypothyroid group in which rats received propylthiouracil (PTU) in drinking water for 6 weeks to induce hypothyroidism. The fourth group was hypothyroid rats treated with folic acid for four weeks and dissected after 6 weeks. In order to ensure the hypothyroid state, <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> serum T 3 and TSH through the dose period were regularly determined. Results: <b>The</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>TSH</b> in hypothyroid rats were significantly higher while <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> T 3 were significantly lower in hypothyroid rats when compared to control rats group. A variety of changes were observed in the hypothalamus of hypothyroid compared with control rats. Microscopically, the hypothalamus of hypothyroid rats showed diffuse vacuolar degeneration and damages neurons especially in both SCN and SON. Conclusion: Treatment of hypothyroidism with folic acid depressed the histopathological alternation...|$|R
40|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} {{currently}} suggested as mechanism underlying diabetes and diabetic complications. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the magnitude of oxidative stress in patients with diabetes by measuring the lipid peroxidation as well as the status of the antioxidant defense system, thyroid hormones status and other biochemical variables. The study population consisted of 100 subjects divided into two groups viz. diabetic (n= 50) and healthy controls (n= 50). Changes in the levels of lipid peroxidation and antioxidants and thyroid hormones status were determined in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. The level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) was found to be increased significantly in diabetic patients compared to healthy controls. On the other hand, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), reduced glutathione (GSH), vitamin A, vitamin E and vitamin C were found to be decreased significantly in diabetics when compared to control subjects. We also noticed a marked increase in serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and decrease in highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total protein and albumin in diabetic patients. <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>TSH</b> was significantly decreased whereas the levels of T 4 and FT 4 were significantly increased in diabetic patients than the control subjects. However, the T 3 and FT 3 levels did not differ significantly between groups. Our findings indicate that changes in oxidant and antioxidant equilibrium will have biological and possibly pathological role in the development of secondary complications. It also demonstrate that detection of thyroid hormone status in the early stage of the disease will help the patients to improve quality of life and reduce the morbidity rate...|$|E
40|$|Transverse {{myelitis}} (TM) {{is associated}} with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Early recognition of useful parameters {{may be helpful to}} distinguish their difference. This retrospective study analyzed thyroid parameters from 243 serum samples (relapse = 128; remission = 115) of 178 patients with demyelinating diseases (NMO, n = 25; TM, n = 48; MS, n = 105). The relationship between thyroid and clinical parameters was analyzed. Patients with NMO and TM had a higher frequency of abnormal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TG-Ab), and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) than MS patients (p, 0. 05). <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>TSH</b> and TG-Ab returned to normal levels after administration of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (p, 0. 05). In 96 patients (NMO, n = 19; TM, n = 25; MS, n = 52) without treatment, serum levels of TSH, TG-Ab and TPO-Ab were significantly different between patients with and without myelitis (p, 0. 01). Patients positive for aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) antibodies showed higher abnormalities of TSH (p = 0. 001), TG-Ab (p = 0. 004) and TPO-Ab (p, 0. 0001) levels than AQP 4 antibodies negative patients. Logistic regression analyses revealed independent relationships between TSH (odds ratio [OR] = 33. 994; p, 0. 0001), TG-Ab (OR = 7. 703; p = 0. 017) and myelitis occurrence in 96 patients at the active stage. In 52 MS patients experiencing their first attack, MS patients with myelitis were associated with TSH abnormalities (OR = 42. 778; p, 0. 0001). This study showed increased abnormalities of thyroid parameters in patients with NMO and TM than in MS patients. MS patients with myelitis also had greater TSH abnormalit...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) infection may {{directly or indirectly}} affect organ functions. Thyroid dysfunction, immune deficiency and cardiovascular disorders {{have been associated with}} HIV infection and the use of antiretroviral therapy. The study aimed to evaluate the levels of thyroid hormones, CD 4 + T cells, body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure of HIV seropositive subjects in Nkpor, Anambra State, South East Nigeria. A total of one hundred and fifty subjects were investigated; 50 HIV seropositive subjects who were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART), 50 HIV infected subjects who were on ART and 50 apparently healthy non HIV subjects (control). Thyroid hormones Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), tri-iodothyronine (T 3) and thyroxine (T 4) were assayed using Enzyme immunoassay kits (Diagnostic Automation), CD 4 +Tcells were determined using flow cytometry. Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from the height and weight of the subjects which have been measured using standard procedures. The results showed that the levels of thyroid hormones and systolic blood pressure of HIV seropositive subjects on ART showed significant increases when compared with HIV seropositive subjects not on ART and the control subjects. CD 4 + T cell counts and BMI showed significant decrease while the diastolic blood pressure did not show significant increase. There was significant decrease observed in <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>TSH</b> in subjects on Lamivudine, Zudovudine and Efavirenz (LZE) antiretroviral combination compared with those on Lamivudine, Efavirenz and Stavudine (LES) combination whereas there were significant increases in the levels of T 3 and T 4 in the subjects respectively. It was concluded that thyroid dysfunction as well as variations in BMI and Blood pressure are present in HIV seropositive subjects especially during antiretroviral therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Statins, such as simvastatin, are {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} the {{treatment}} of hypercholesterolemia. On the other hand hypercholesterolmia can occur in hypothyroid patients, who receive levothyroxine. There are few clinical case reports in regards to drug interaction between levothyroxine and lovastatin or simvastatin, indicating decreased levothyroxine effects. This study aimed at determining possible interaction between simvastatin and levothyroxine in hypothyroid patients by assessing serum <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT 4), the two important laboratory indices for levothyroxine therapy. Methods: In a cross sectional study, 41 eligible hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine (50 - 150 µg/d) were selected. Blood samples were taken before and after three months of simultaneous treatment with simvastatin (20 mg/d) and levothyroxine to determine <b>the</b> serum <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>TSH</b> and FT 4. Results: There {{was no significant difference between}} <b>the</b> serum <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>TSH</b> (P= 0. 77) or FT 4 (P= 0. 76) before and after three months of simultaneous treatment. Also, there was no aggravation or initiation of any sign or symptom of hypothyroidism in the patients during the study period. Conclusion: Considering that FT 4 and TSH are the most reliable indicators for the levothyroxine treatment, the findings of the present study suggest that there may not be any significant interaction between simvastatin and levothyroxin...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: Female pattern hair loss(female {{androgenic}} alopecia) is {{a common}} but puzzling condition in women which increases by aging. Female hair loss is strongly linked to hormones and hormonal imbalances. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine <b>the</b> serum <b>level</b> <b>of</b> hormones such as T 4, TSH, free testosterone, Prolactin(PRL) and Alb, SHBG in women(15 - 50 years old) with hair loss versus those without hair loss. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional case-control study, 71 women with hair loss and 70 normal women were selected from skin and hair care day clinics. <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> hormones and SHBG were measured by ELISA, and Alb was measured by spectrophotometery. Data were analyzed by independent t-test. Results: After analyzing the data and determining <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>TSH,</b> T 4, Prolactin, Alb, SHBG, no significant difference was found between the case and control groups. However, free Testosterone level was significantly different between patients and controls(P= 0. 000), with a higher mean <b>level</b> in <b>the</b> case group(patients). Conclusion : Since androgens have a major role in regulating the biological cycle of hair in women and since there was a significant difference between free testosterone in patient and control groups, we suggest that <b>the</b> serum <b>level</b> <b>of</b> free testosterone should be measured in women with androgenic alopecia.  ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background - Hypothyroidism is a {{condition}} in which the body lacks sufficient thyroid hormone. People with this condition have symptoms associated with a slow metabolism, tiredness, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, feeling cold and etc. [12] Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) regards hyperthyroidism and as Yin/Yang imbalances and often uses acupuncture, herbal medicine and dietary therapy to rebalance Yin and Yang. [8] Aim - The main purpose of doing this work is to show the most effective acupoints used in the acupuncture treatment of hypothyroidism in our practice and the results after the treatment. Methods - The patient is a 24 year old female diagnosed with Hashimoto hypothyroidism, an autoimmune thyroiditis. The treatments were done in the clinic for TCM and acupuncture in Skopje by a doctor specialist in acupuncture. The treatments were done every week for 3 years, when the TSH and T 4 <b>levels</b> normalized. During <b>the</b> treatments she has done 7 analysis for thyroid. Results - From the first treatment made <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>TSH.</b> T 4 and TPO hormones were gradually normalizing.
