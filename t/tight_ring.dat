5|$|With a mid-level ridge {{located in}} the Gulf of Mexico, the {{depression}} drifted generally northward through an area of warm water temperatures and low wind shear. Initially its convection was weak and confined to a few rainbands far from the center. As such, intensification was not expected beyond minimal tropical storm status. However, the system quickly developed intense thunderstorms near the center with increased banding in its southern semicircle, and at 1500UTC on May 29 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Alma, about 55miles (85km) southwest of Managua, Nicaragua. Its intensity was set at 45mph (75km/h), and the storm was forecast to intensity only slightly more before moving ashore. However, one hour after it was upgraded to tropical storm status, the NHC re-assessed the intensity as 65mph (100km/h), citing updated observations from satellite imagery and QuikSCAT. An eye feature formed, surrounded by a very <b>tight</b> <b>ring</b> of convection, and at around 1900UTC on May 29 Alma made landfall near León, Nicaragua as a strong tropical storm. The storm quickly weakened after moving ashore, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted as it crossed into the mountainous region of southern Honduras. After passing near Tegucigalpa Alma weakened to tropical depression status, and at 1500UTC on May 30 the cyclone dissipated near the border of Honduras and Guatemala. On May 31, after crossing Central America as a low pressure area, Alma's remnants moved into the Gulf of Honduras and spawned Tropical Storm Arthur.|$|E

MreB assembles into a helical network of filamentous structures just under the cytoplasmic membrane, covering the whole length of the cell.

The head is wedge-shaped, elongated and dry, with pricked and very mobile ears that fold backwards like a greyhound’s during the chase. The tail is a most important breed characteristic: long and curved upwards, forming a loose or <b>tight</b> <b>ring</b> and covered with a brush of longer hair underneath.The dog is slightly longer than tall, with medium angulations, slender legs and good muscle; the ribcage is spacious but neither too broad nor too rounded and it does not quite reach the point of elbow. The loin is slender yet powerful and there is good tuck-up, with the points of the hipbones slightly prominent. There should be a balance between characteristics of speed and stamina, the conformation being a compromise producing great agility. Flabby, clumsy, heavy individuals not to be tolerated.|$|E

Partisans encircled the town in a <b>tight</b> <b>ring</b> and undertook the offensive. Over 1000 Italians held the town. The fights lasted three days. The commander of the garrison had demanded air support, but before the support arrived, partisans seized the town. The Italians lost several hundred soldiers and considerable quantities weapons and equipment. In the end of June the Italians started a punitive expedition against partisans in the region of Mallakastra - Tepelena. Two thousand partisans took up defensive positions on mountain passes. In the first clash the Italians were forced back. Yet they renewed the action on 14 July with tanks, artillery and aircraft. After four-days of fighting, the partisans suffering heavy losses, retreated to upward parts of the mountains. In general from May to July the Italians lost thousands and many were wounded.|$|E

As the besiegers, violating their solemn promises, attacked the column, he stoutly engaged them on a hill-feature called Shahi Tibbi until he was relieved by Bhai Udai Singh. Ajit Singh crossed the Sarsa rivulet, then in spate, along with his father, younger brother, Jujhar Singh, and some others. Further reduced in numbers by casualties at the hands of pursuing troops from Ropar, the column reached Kotla Nihanga and then proceeded to Chamkaur on the night between 6th and 7 December 1704.

40|$|We {{consider}} a strongly interacting quasi-one dimensional Bose gas on a <b>tight</b> <b>ring</b> trap {{subjected to a}} localized barrier potential. We explore the possibility to form a macroscopic superposition of a rotating and a nonrotating state under nonequilibrium conditions, achieved by a sudden quench of the barrier velocity. Using an exact solution for the dynamical evolution in the impenetrable-boson (Tonks-Girardeau) limit, we find an expression for the many-body wavefunction corresponding to a superposition state. The superposition is formed when the barrier velocity is tuned close to multiples of integer or half-integer number of Coriolis flux quanta. As {{a consequence of the}} strong interactions, we find that (i) the state of the system can be mapped onto a macroscopic superposition of two Fermi spheres, rather than two macroscopically occupied single-particle states as in a weakly interacting gas, and (ii) the barrier velocity should be larger than the sound velocity to better discriminate the two components of the superposition.

It is often seen in the older woman with upper limb trauma or infection and usually involves a much-loved wedding ring. The meth-ods of removal used in the past have varying degrees of success but each has its own drawbacks: ¥ lubrication is usually the first course of action but the degree of swelling is often too great for this to be effective ¥ the use of suture material wound tightly around the digit, passing under the ring and then unwound, forcing the ring distally with it (Belliappa, 1989), is generally ¥ the last resort is the use of a ring cutter. This can sometimes be difficult to find in the department, especially in serviceable condition. It also, of course, results in damage to the ring that is expensive to repair.

Candida albicans septins were examined in this study for their roles in morphogenesis of this multimorphic, opportunistically pathogenic fungus, which can range from round budding yeast to elongated hyphae. C. albicans green fluorescent protein labeled septin proteins localized to a <b>tight</b> <b>ring</b> at the bud and pseudohyphae necks and as a more diffuse array in emerging germ tubes of hyphae. Deletion analysis demonstrated that the C. albicans homologs of the S. cerevisiae CDC 3 and CDC 12 septins are essential for viability. In contrast, the C. albicans cdc 10 � and cdc 11 � mutants were viable but displayed conditional defects in cytokinesis, localization of cell wall chitin, and bud morphology. The mutant phenotypes were not identical, however, indicating that these septins carry out distinct functions. The viable septin mutants could be stimulated to undergo hyphal morphogenesis but formed hyphae with abnormal curvature, and they differed from wild type in the selection of sites for subsequent rounds of hyphal formation. The cdc 11 � mutants were also defective for invasive growth when embedded in agar. These results further extend the known roles of the septins by demonstrating that they are essential for the proper morphogenesis of C. albicans during both budding and filamentous growth...|$|E
