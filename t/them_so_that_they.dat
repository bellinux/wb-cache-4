There {{they were able to}} reclaim the mortars that had earlier been abandoned and destroyed <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not be used against the Australians again, but the jeeps carrying the wounded ran into a Japanese ambush in which five Australians were killed. McKinna then organised a quick counterattack, taking a force up the road along with three tanks and subsequently attacking the ambushing force, killing 11, before forming a harbour around the tanks for the night.|$|E

25|$|Interfering with insects' {{reproduction}} can {{be accomplished}} by sterilizing males of the target species and releasing <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> mate with females but do not produce offspring. This technique was first used on the screwworm fly in 1958 and has since been used with the medfly, the tsetse fly, and the gypsy moth. However, this can be a costly, time consuming approach that only works on some types of insects.|$|E

During the fasting month in 2016, the Taipei Grand Mosque made a request to employers or companies hiring Muslim workers to be more flexible and easy towards <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{will be able to}} fully observe the fasting.|$|E

25|$|Parachuting is {{not always}} {{restricted}} to daytime hours; experienced skydivers sometimes perform night jumps. For safety reasons, this requires more equipment than a usual daytime jump and in most jurisdictions, it requires both an advanced skydiving license (at least a B-License in the U.S.) and {{a meeting with the}} local safety official covering who will be doing what on the load. A lit altimeter (preferably accompanied with an audible altimeter) is a must. Skydivers performing night jumps often take flashlights up with <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can check their canopies have properly deployed.|$|E
25|$|In the Soviet 1982 miniseries Niccolo Paganini the {{musician}} is portrayed by the Armenian actor Vladimir Msryan. The series focuses on Paganini's {{relationship with the}} Roman Catholic Church. Another Soviet actor, Armen Dzhigarkhanyan, plays Paganini's fictionalized arch-rival, an insidious Jesuit official. The information in the series is generally spurious and it also plays {{to some of the}} myths and legends rampant during {{the musician}}'s lifetime. One memorable scene shows Paganini's adversaries sabotaging his violin before a high-profile performance, causing all strings but one to break during the concert. An undeterred Paganini continues to perform on three, two, and finally on a single string. In actuality, Paganini himself occasionally broke strings during his performances on purpose so he could further display his virtuosity. He did this by carefully filing notches into them to weaken <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would break when in use.|$|E

25|$|All manned {{landings}} {{happened during}} the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface. The astronauts' eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{could not see the}} relatively faint stars. Likewise, cameras were set for daylight exposure and could not detect the stars. Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here. The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off. The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were {{in the shadow of the}} Moon.|$|E
25|$|The Ben-my-Chree {{was fitted}} with a large {{aircraft}} hangar aft and a smaller one forward, with a flying-off platform also fitted to the forward end of the ship. Cranes were fitted for hoisting the seaplanes back on board, and a workshop for the repair and servicing of the aircraft was fitted in the deck below the main hangar. Commissioned on 3 March 1915, her first base was Harwich, where she arrived on 28 April. HMS Ben-my-Chree was fitted with four 12-pounder and four anti-aircraft guns and carried four Short Type 184 seaplanes. When The Ben was fitted up as a carrier, {{it was assumed that}} the Short 184s could get airborne using the tilted forward trackway. In practice their weight was against <b>them,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> then had to be lowered into the sea, which meant that the ship would have to be almost stationary – a serious problem whilst in action.|$|E

Butt and Amir announced that their appeals were to continue. The ICC moved the hearing to the UAE. Salman Butt announced that he hoped the appeals would be completed quickly so that he could make a swift return to international cricket and participate in the series against South Africa in October 2010. Their initial appeal against the suspension was rejected on 31 October, 2010.

25|$|When the men {{return to}} the village with the {{collected}} trash, usually their families are waiting for <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can begin sorting the trash. The majority of those who sort the trash are women, while certain families specialize in sorting certain materials such as paper, plastic, aluminum, glass, etc. The women and children sort the garbage into 16 different types of trash and sort out the recyclables. The sorting of garbage is a time-consuming task in which women and children may spend up to 10 to 12 hours each day separating the garbage. First, the trash is sorted into the main 16 categories, such as paper, plastic, cardboard, cans, etc. So for example, all different types of paper are placed into one pile while all different types of plastic are placed in another pile. Sorting within categories does not take place until after the trash is sorted first into the major categories. Then sorting within the category takes place. For instance, the major category of paper would be sorted into white paper, yellow paper, thick paper, newspaper, thin paper, etc. Each sub-sorted material is then sold to factories and middle-men for a marginal profit.|$|E

500|$|Sound editor Bruce Tanis {{explained}} {{the production of}} sound {{that went into the}} episode in an interview with Designing Sound: [...] "In 'Fracture', the villain has created a serum which several characters inject because of a type of post-hypnotic suggestion. He has invented a frequency generator which causes these people to crystallize and then explode. In one of the best scenes all season, Walter and Astrid are in the lab and, using a watermelon for their experiments, are able to determine the exact frequency that the villain’s generator operates on. It was something like 68.7 megacycles (I don’t recall exactly), so I used the signal generator plugin and created some tones that started out as 68.7 megacycles. They were simply low-frequency tones on their own so I processed <b>them</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> warbled and chorused and were a bit more mysterious than the straight tone. It ended up being pretty subtle for television, but when Walter identifies the tone as a certain frequency, that’s what’s actually playing." ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{movie of}} the game was {{produced}} before the corresponding track [...] "Dark Dawn" [...] was, and Mitsuda had to rearrange his composition after realizing some parts were out of synch with the frames by about {{a minute and a}} half.
