One player assumes the role of <b>the</b> <b>Storyteller,</b> guiding other players through a scenario using <b>the</b> <b>Storyteller</b> interface. The interface allows <b>the</b> <b>Storyteller</b> to create or modify scenarios by placing items, monsters, and characters across the map. Character statistics, such as experience points, abilities, and disciplines, can also be modified. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Storyteller</b> can {{assume the role of}} any character at any given time. These functions allow <b>the</b> <b>Storyteller</b> to dynamically manipulate the play environment while the other players traverse it.|$|E

5|$|Game Revolution {{said the}} {{multiplayer}} feature {{was a revelation}} and worth {{the cost of the}} game alone. Computer Games said it was innovative and may serve as an inspiration for future games. PC Gamer said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs. Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient, such as the inability to store custom dialog, requiring <b>the</b> <b>Storyteller</b> to type text in real time during gameplay.|$|E

5|$|Though he {{was still}} engaged in {{creating}} children's television, such as the successful eighties shows Fraggle Rock and the animated Muppet Babies, Henson continued to explore darker, mature themes with the folk tale and mythology-oriented show <b>The</b> <b>Storyteller</b> (1988), which won an Emmy for Outstanding Children's Program. The next year, Henson returned to television with The Jim Henson Hour, which mixed lighthearted Muppet fare with riskier material. The show was critically well received and won Henson another Emmy for Outstanding Directing in a Variety or Music Program, but was canceled after 13 episodes due to low ratings. Henson blamed its failure on NBC's constant rescheduling.|$|E

5|$|The {{works of}} Mario Vargas Llosa {{are viewed as}} both modernist and postmodernist novels. Though {{there is still much}} debate over the {{differences}} between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as The Green House and Conversation in the Cathedral, are clearly elements of the modern novel. Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude—another important defining aspect of modernist art. By contrast, his later novels such as Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter, The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta, and <b>The</b> <b>Storyteller</b> (El hablador) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing. These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism. Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, The Green House and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people also}} {{make a case for}} {{different}} narrative forms being classified as storytelling in the contemporary world. For example, digital storytelling, online and dice-and-paper-based role-playing games. In traditional role-playing games, storytelling is done by the person who controls the environment and the non playing fictional characters, and moves the story elements along for the players as they interact with <b>the</b> <b>storyteller.</b> The game is advanced by mainly verbal interactions, with dice roll determining random events in the fictional universe, where the players interact with each other and <b>the</b> <b>storyteller.</b> This type of game has many genres, such as sci-fi and fantasy, as well as alternate-reality worlds based on the current reality, but with different setting and beings such as werewolves, aliens, daemons, or hidden societies. These oral-based role-playing games were very popular in the 1990s among circles of youth in many countries before computer and console-based online MMORPG's took their place. Despite the prevalence of computer-based MMORPGs, the dice-and-paper RPG still has a dedicated following.|$|E

25|$|The grim bass motif {{that opens}} the first {{movement}} represents the domineering Sultan (see the first theme, below). This theme emphasizes four notes of a descending whole tone scale: E-D-C-B (each note is a down beat, i.e. first note in each measure, with A for B). Soon after a few chords in the woodwinds, reminiscent of the opening of Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream overture, the audience hears the leitmotif that represents the character of <b>the</b> <b>storyteller</b> herself, Scheherazade. This theme, the second below, is a tender, sensuous winding melody for violin solo, accompanied by harp.|$|E
25|$|During {{the reign}} of the Abbasid Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the 8th century, Baghdad had become an {{important}} cosmopolitan city. Merchants from Persia, China, India, Africa, and Europe were all found in Baghdad. During this time, many of the stories that were originally folk stories are thought to have been collected orally over many years and later compiled into a single book. The compiler and 9th-century translator into Arabic is reputedly <b>the</b> <b>storyteller</b> Abu Abd-Allah Muhammad el-Gahshigar. The frame story of Shahrzad seems to have been added in the 14th century.|$|E

25|$|Each {{member of}} the Midnight Society from 1991 to 1996 has a {{distinct}} personality, and a notable trend in their storytelling. Though not all of their stories have similar styles and plots, {{in many of the}} stories, each character carries a unique aspect that reflects the nature of <b>the</b> <b>storyteller,</b> and what they find to be most important to themselves. In the second generation, the characters derive their stories more from events that happen during {{the days leading up to}} the society meetings instead of from their personal interests and views.
