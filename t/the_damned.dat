5|$|Armada of <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> was {{conceived}} as an action-adventure role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective {{and set in}} an open world environment based on the Pirates of the Caribbean universe. The player {{was to take the}} role of James Sterling, a pirate captain whose main mission was to travel across the Caribbean Sea and make a reputation for himself. Some of Sterling's features could be directly customized by the player, although Armada of <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> was centered on a choice system that would affect the character's appearance, personality, weapons, attacks, quests, and story developments.|$|E

5|$|The work's moralising tone is {{apparent}} {{from some of}} its more overtly dark iconography, its choice of saints, and how the scales tilt far lower beneath the weight of <b>the</b> <b>damned</b> than the saved. <b>The</b> <b>damned</b> to Christ's left are more numerous and less detailed than the saved to his right. In these ways it {{can be compared to}} Matthias Grünewald's Isenheim Altarpiece, which served much the same purpose, having been commissioned for the Monastery of St. Anthony in Isenheim, which cared for the dying.|$|E
5|$|The {{restructuring}} {{reduced the}} studio's staff {{by more than}} 100 people {{and led to the}} cancellation of Armada of <b>the</b> <b>Damned.</b> The remaining development team worked to finish Tron: Evolution, whose team was also affected by the lay offs. However, after the game failed to attain critical or commercial success, Disney cancelled its planned downloadable content and closed Propaganda Games.|$|E
5|$|Anne Rice (born Howard Allen Frances O'Brien; October 4, 1941) is an American {{author of}} gothic fiction, Christian literature, and erotica. She {{is perhaps best}} known for her series of novels, The Vampire Chronicles, {{revolving}} around the central character of Lestat. Books from The Vampire Chronicles were the subject of two film adaptations, Interview with the Vampire in 1994, and Queen of <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Armada of <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> {{was split}} between land and sea. Sterling had {{a light and}} a heavy attack, which could be {{combined}} to create combos that increased the damage he inflicted. Correct timing lead to a bonus attack {{at the end of}} the combo that improved its strength. Sterling could also curse his opponents. The curse was a spell that weakened all surrounding enemies when it was used as a finishing move. All attacks, special moves, and combinations varied depending of the pirate type chosen and could be upgraded at will.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Interview with the Vampire, while living in California, Rice wrote two historical novels, The Feast of All Saints and Cry to Heaven, along with four erotic novels (The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty, Beauty's Punishment, Beauty's Release, and Beauty's Kingdom) under the pseudonym A. N. Roquelaure, and two more under the pseudonym Anne Rampling (Exit to Eden and Belinda). Rice {{then returned to the}} vampire genre with The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of <b>the</b> <b>Damned,</b> her bestselling sequels to Interview with the Vampire.|$|E

He was also nominated for a BAFTA as the troubled comic actor Kenneth Williams in BBC Four's 2006 , and {{was nominated}} for a fourth Olivier Award in 2006 for portraying the broadcaster David Frost in Frost/Nixon, a role he revisited in the 2008 film adaptation of the play. He also starred as the outspoken football manager Brian Clough in <b>The</b> <b>Damned</b> United (2009).|$|E

5|$|In 2013, Lundgren starred {{alongside}} Steve Austin in The Package. Directed by Jesse Johnson, principal photography {{wrapped in}} March 2012, {{and the film}} was released on February 9, 2013. For a direct-to-DVD film, The Package was not a financial success. In its first week of release, the film debuted at no. 81; grossing $1,469 at the domestic box office. He starred {{in a number of}} other films later that year, including Legendary: Tomb of the Dragon, Battle of <b>the</b> <b>Damned,</b> Ambushed, Blood of Redemption, and the uncompleted comedy-western A Man Will Rise.|$|E
5|$|In June 1988, {{following}} {{the success of}} The Vampire Lestat and with The Queen of <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> about to be published, the Rices purchased a second home in New Orleans, the Brevard-Rice House, built in 1857 for Albert Hamilton Brevard. Stan took {{a leave of absence}} from his teaching, and together they moved to New Orleans. Within months, they decided to make it their permanent home.|$|E
5|$|Pirates of the Caribbean: Armada of <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> is a {{cancelled}} action-adventure role-playing {{video game}} {{that was being}} developed by Propaganda Games for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Microsoft Windows platforms.

The project was cancelled in October 2010, soon before the closure of Propaganda Games.|$|E

5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{follow the}} 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs {{associated with the}} saved to Christ's right, and those of <b>the</b> <b>damned</b> to his left. The words beneath the lily (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, {{to the extent that}} they are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The lettering opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.|$|E
5|$|To {{tell the}} truth, I wasn't all that fond of <b>the</b> <b>damned</b> thing by then, {{but it had}} become a symbol for the men of the 8th Wing. I knew McConnell understood.

She resumed recording in 2000 at Sing Sing Studios in Australia, where she shot her role for the 2002 film Queen of <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> during the day and recorded songs at night. Aaliyah worked primarily with Blackground Records' in-house crew of writers and producers, including Bud'da, J. Dub, Rapture, and Eric Seats, as well as longtime collaborator Timbaland.|$|E

5|$|Aegaeon– Featured in Ascension, Aegaeon the Hecatonchires had pledged a blood oath to Zeus, {{but later}} betrayed the god. The first {{victim of the}} Furies, they {{captured}} and tortured the multi-armed creature. Instead of killing him, the Furies turned him to stone, making him the giant Prison of <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> and becoming a symbol to all who may think of breaking a blood oath to a god. As Kratos attempted to escape the prison, Megaera used her parasitic insects to bring Aegaeon to life and control him as his many arms mutated into monstrous forms and began to attack the Spartan. Fending off two of its parasite-controlled arms, Megaera then infected Aegaeon's head, which attacked Kratos, but the Spartan outsmarted and killed Megaera; this also caused Aegaeon to die, freeing him from his suffering.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} games, God of War: Ascension {{is set in}} an alternate version of ancient Greece populated by the Olympian Gods, Titans, and other beings from Greek mythology. Game events are set six months after Kratos killed his family, and ten years before the original God of War (2005); Chains of Olympus (2008) takes place some time between Ascension and God of War. The game's narrative takes place over four weeks; it shifts between the present (the fourth week) and past (the preceding three weeks), while the player controls Kratos in both. Several locations, including the Prison of <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> and some real-world locations—including the village Kirra, the city Delphi, and the island Delos—are explored in the game.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Rhodes, a {{sometime}} {{associate of}} McLaren {{and friend of}} the Sex Pistols, was similarly aiming to make stars of the band London SS. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning off two new bands: <b>the</b> <b>Damned</b> and the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer, former lead singer of the 101'ers. On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in {{what came to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths.|$|E
