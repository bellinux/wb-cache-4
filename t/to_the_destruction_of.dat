5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} {{building}} was deteriorating.

5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, the {{collection}} of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as William Young Ottley, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> many manuscripts. Originals were highly sought after, a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived. The historian Barbara Yorke has maintained that this is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the kingdom's monasteries and the disappearance of both of the East Anglian sees, which were caused by Viking raids and later settlement.|$|E

5|$|The five {{versions}} of the Lost World Pyramid were each larger than the previous version. They were not built directly centred upon the preceding version due to the necessity of maintaining the E-Group plaza area between the pyramid and the East Platform.

5|$|The {{pink-backed pelican}} {{has a large}} {{population}} ranging over much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In the absence of substantial threats or evidence of declines across its range, its conservation status is assessed as being of Least Concern. Regional threats include the drainage of wetlands and increasing disturbance in southern Africa. The species is susceptible to bioaccumulation of toxins and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> nesting trees by logging.|$|E
5|$|About 5% of {{all people}} are {{diagnosed}} only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often {{in the context of}} a hemolytic anemia (anemia due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> red blood cells). This leads to abnormalities in protein production (identified by deranged coagulation) and metabolism by the liver. The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream. When these irritate the brain, the person develops hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, coma, seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain).|$|E

5|$|Aramaic {{became the}} common {{language}} in the north, in Galilee and Samaria. Hebrew remained in use in Judah; however the returning exiles brought back Aramaic influence, and Aramaic was used for communicating with other ethnic groups during the Persian period. Alexander conquered Judah in 332BCE, beginning the period of Hellenistic (Greek) domination. During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmonean dynasty, but later the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. One Jewish revolt against the Romans led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the Second Temple in 70CE, and the second Bar Kokhba revolt in 132–135 led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse {{rolls over}} the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by his sleeve. When a gale of wind takes hold of the comic so that it flies towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The next morning, the three boys reflect on how their inability to share led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the comic, although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{damage from}} the storm totaled {{approximately}} $7 million, of which about $4 million can be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> crops, notably rice and cotton. The hurricane affected the southern Louisiana region one week before the Louisiana Maneuvers, a series of military exercises held during August and September 1941. The exercise was designed to test US troop training, logistics, doctrine, and commanders and is considered a prelude to World War II. The rainfall triggered flooding and swelled rivers, and army vehicles became stuck in the mud as a result. Hundreds of military aircraft were forced to move inland for shelter.|$|E

5|$|Sarrail, {{who was not}} in Damascus at {{the time}} of the rebel assault, ordered aerial {{bombardment}} of the city, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> whole neighborhoods and the deaths of hundreds of Damascus residents. By 24 October, the rebels were routed, and al-Bakri escaped. He became the target of criticism among other rebel leaders, namely Said al-'As. Al-'As stated that al-Bakri sought personal glory when he decided to prematurely launch a mostly uncoordinated attack with small numbers of armed volunteers, instead of waiting for the arrival of al-Atrash's reinforcements, who numbered around 1,000. Al-Bakri was the only member of the Damascus nationalist elite to directly participate in the fighting on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{has also}} {{addressed}} {{stewardship of the}} natural environment, {{and its relationship to}} other social and theological teachings. In the document Laudato si', dated 24 May 2015, Pope Francis critiques consumerism and irresponsible development, and laments environmental degradation and global warming. The pope expressed concern that the warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the planet as humans pursue short-term economic gains.|$|E
5|$|The {{events leading}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{destruction}}</b> <b>of</b> the royal palace {{did not cause}} {{the destruction of the}} whole city. The Shattiwaza treaty, which describes the events of the first Syrian war, mentions that Qatna was invaded and destroyed, and its people were deported during the war. However, Idanda's successor, Akizzi, was ruling {{in the second half of}} the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten's reign following the first Syrian war, or shortly before the second Syrian war. This discrepancy can be explained if the treaty did not mention the events in a chronological order; many scholars, such as Wilhelm, believe that the author of the document organized the text according to the principle of association, rather than following the sequence of events.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth and}} final launch from an M-21 on 30 July ended in disaster. Unlike the three {{previous}} launches this one was performed straight and level, not in an outside loop {{to assist in the}} separation of the drone from the aircraft. The D-21 suffered engine problems and struck the M-21's tail after separation, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> both aircraft. The two crew ejected and landed at sea. The pilot, Bill Park, survived, but the Launch Control Officer, Ray Torick, drowned.|$|E
5|$|The second {{scenario}} {{revolved around}} the discovery of an ancient mausoleum by archaeologists. An ancient virus contained in the mausoleum has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry is hanging inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a fuel-air explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find the mausoleum, enter it (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the tapestry back prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> the mausoleum and its contents.|$|E
5|$|The use of fungi {{by humans}} {{dates back to}} prehistory; Ötzi the Iceman, a well-preserved mummy of a 5,300-year-old Neolithic man found frozen in the Austrian Alps, carried two species of polypore {{mushrooms}} {{that may have been}} used as tinder (Fomes fomentarius), or for medicinal purposes (Piptoporus betulinus). Ancient peoples have used fungi as food sources–often unknowingly–for millennia, in the preparation of leavened bread and fermented juices. Some of the oldest written records contain references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>destruction</b> <b>of</b> crops that were probably caused by pathogenic fungi.|$|E
