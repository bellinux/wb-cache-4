5|$|Doctor Stephen Strange: The Queen's Physician, {{who is also}} {{a magician}} and alchemist. He allows himself to be {{beheaded}} by King James, which subsequently frees him from the restriction placed upon him by Uatu, the Watcher (namely, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> reveal what he knows while still living).|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Indian Muslims, {{especially}} from the United Provinces, began to urge Jinnah to return and take up again his leadership of the Muslim League, an organisation which had fallen into inactivity. He remained titular president of the League, but declined to travel to India to preside over its 1933 session in April, writing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> possibly return there {{until the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|There {{is not the}} {{slightest}} {{doubt in my mind}} that this brainy man was hoodwinked, and that his confidence was betrayed by the so-called mediums that he tested. His powers of observation were blinded and his reasoning faculties so blunted by his prejudice in favor of anything psychic or occult <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not,</b> or would not, resist the influence.|$|E

5|$|A 1788 {{letter in}} the Kentucky Gazette {{indicated}} that Marshall had unsuccessfully sought election to the Virginia General Assembly, although {{the year of the}} contest is not given. The letter continued that the defeat convinced Marshall <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> win elected office in Fayette County and that he subsequently lobbied for the creation of Bourbon County, hoping that he might gain an office in that new county. When the county was created in 1785, he immediately applied to become the county lieutenant, but that office had apparently already been promised to someone else. Marshall applied for appointment as deputy lieutenant, and received the appointment.|$|E
5|$|A {{sequel to}} the game, Ace Attorney Investigations 2, was {{released}} in Japan on February 3, 2011. There are currently no plans for Capcom to release it internationally, but a fan translation has been made and released on the internet. In July 2013, Eshiro {{said that he and}} Yamazaki would like to make a third Investigations game, and that he intended to secure the needed Capcom personnel and plan everything out in the future, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> make any promises.|$|E
5|$|Action Button Entertainment is a {{video game}} {{development}} studio consisting of Tim Rogers, Brent Porter, Michael Kerwin, and Nicholas Wasilewski that has produced five games: Ziggurat (2012), TNNS (2013), Ten by Eight (2013), Tuffy the Corgi (2014), and Videoball (2016). The group convened in 2010 as Rogers worked on Ziggurat based on an idea he had while playing Angry Birds <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> complete on his own. Porter joined Action Button after responding to a call for artists Rogers made via Twitter, and Kerwin joined based on a connection he had with Rogers from producing a mockup of a game concept Rogers outlined in his Kotaku column.|$|E

60|$|This {{was pretty}} strong {{for the young}} professor, but the lady {{understood}} him. She was very glad, indeed, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> express himself impulsively, for without <b>that</b> power <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> win Olive.|$|R
5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was too ill {{to return}} to school, but by early 1985 {{he began to feel}} better. His mother asked if he could return to school, but was told by school {{officials}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not.</b> On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his suicide}} is often {{linked to the}} Foundation’s {{financial}} difficulties, the letter clearly shows Favaloro overwhelmed by {{the corruption of the}} health system and feeling <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> fight against this powerful organization. In some parts of the letter, he refers to himself as “Don Quijote” in his lonely battle against the giants. Aggravating this situation was that Favaloro had never recovered from the death of his wife in 1998. Following her death, he had resolved to marry one of his longtime colleagues and coauthors, Diana Truden; she lived with Favaloro during his final days and was in his Palermo neighborhood house when he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of his}} {{contract}} with the Batavian Society, van Kinsbergen had to take photographs of Borobudur, which had just been cleaned and restored. However, {{when he went to}} photograph the Panataran Hindu temple complex in East Java in 1867, he ran out of chemicals. In his enthusiasm for photographing the many reliefs of the temple complex, he used up so many glass slides <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> go to Borobudur as he had intended to. The Society was nervous about van Kinsbergen's delay, so they did not grant his request to supply new slides.|$|E

5|$|Australia played Pakistan at Karachi in {{the first}} Test between the two {{countries}} on a matting pitch, rather than the more familiar grass pitch. Miller top-scored {{in the first}} innings with 21, as Australia fell for 80. He took 2/40 and then scored 11 in the second innings as Australia fell to defeat. It was the last Test of his career, as his knee injury deteriorated to the point <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> play in the three Tests against India, and retired upon his return to Australia.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{married a}} schoolteacher, Alison Margaret Edward on 11 June 1942. Alison was the {{daughter}} of Kenneth Edward, a Scottish Professor of Theology at the University of Sydney. The couple met at a country dance, when Barnes, on his way back from an exhibition match in Katoomba, was bet the price of the meal <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> get the young girl to dance with him. Within twelve months the pair were married.|$|E
5|$|Bradbury's {{strategy}} {{from the}} semifinal onwards was to cruise behind his opponents {{and hope that}} they crashed, as he realised <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> match their raw pace. His reasoning was that risk-taking by the favourites could cause a racing incident, and if two (or more) riders collided and fell, the remaining three would all receive medals, and that as he was slower than his opponents, trying to challenge them directly would only increase his chance of being caught in a collision and falling.|$|E

5|$|Charles K. Feldman, the producer, had {{acquired}} the film rights in 1960 and {{had attempted to}} get Casino Royale made as an Eon Productions Bond film; however, Feldman and the producers of the Eon series, Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, failed to come to terms. Believing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> compete with the Eon series, Feldman resolved to produce the film as a satire. The budget escalated as various directors and writers got involved in the production, and actors expressed dissatisfaction with the project.|$|E
5|$|Data, an android, and Jenna D'Sora {{are in the}} torpedo room {{configuring}} several probes {{with which}} the Enterprise will explore a nearby nebula. D'Sora explains that she just split up with her boyfriend and Data attempts to comfort her. Later they play together in a chamber concert along with Keiko O'Brien (Rosalind Chao). D'Sora complains of her abilities as a musician, but Data insists <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> hear anything wrong.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{officials}} {{gave the}} Americans an unsubtle warning not to interfere. The official prosecutor {{claimed to have}} documents proving that a foreign power was behind the failed coup but said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> publicly name the nation in question. It was later revealed in secret proceedings that he pinpointed two Americans: George Carver, {{an employee of the}} United States Operations Mission (an economic mission) who was later revealed to be a CIA agent, and Howard C. Elting, described as the deputy chief of the American mission in Saigon.|$|E

5|$|During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth {{circled the}} world with his wife; the trip {{included}} a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player Alan Fairfax, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{have the time to}} make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.|$|E
5|$|In August, twelve {{engineers}} were hired on contract with Baneservice, {{at the time}} a subsidiary of the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The {{engineers were}} subsequently re-certified for the Y1 class, as well as being given a service course. While other engineers in the country are required to take an 18-month course, Timetoget felt it could meet sufficient safety standards with a six-week course. Arne Wam, chief executive officer of NSB, stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> permit that a subsidiary ignore safety in such a way, and announced he would stop operations.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1945, Smyth {{approached}} Datus C. Smith, {{the director}} of Princeton University Press, {{about the possibility of}} renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith’s response was that he found it hard to imagine anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> risk this.|$|E
60|$|The King {{answered}} that in <b>that</b> case <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{blame him for}} protecting his own life, and that Red was well worthy of death. So Red was hanged, and Ring married the King's daughter.|$|R
