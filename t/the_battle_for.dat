5|$|On May 25, 1948, during <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> the Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he {{would be forced to}} attack it. Moshe Russnak, {{commander of}} the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> the Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E

5|$|Besides the {{political}} significance of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> future {{developments of the}} war in Bosnia, the battle was militarily significant for planning and execution of Operation Winter '94 by the Croatian Army (HV) and the HVO aimed at relieving the siege of Bihać in late November and December 1994.

5|$|Both plans {{started in}} July, but by mid-September, <b>the</b> <b>Battle</b> <b>for</b> Guadalcanal took {{priority}} for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered {{to withdraw from the}} Port Moresby area to {{the northern part of the}} island, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the Battle of Buna-Gona. Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and withdrew their troops. In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first, an offensive into the Arakan region in late 1942, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to India by May 1943. The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.|$|E
