The Liberal Democrats lost two seats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives,</b> and only avoided losing a safe seat, Vicars Cross, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives.</b> In addition, a Liberal Democrat Councillor (Jeff Clarke, Waverton) {{defected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Conservatives</b> also won a by-election in Autumn 2006, taking another seat from the Liberal Democrats.|$|R

5|$|Wei Ping Chen was a {{candidate}} in the October 2008 federal election in the Richmond electoral district. However, because the party was not registered with Elections Canada, he ran as an independent.

5|$|Cubitt's eldest brother, Bertram Blakiston (b. 1862), {{attended}} Balliol College, Oxford {{before entering}} the civil service; he would later serve as the private secretary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> politicians Edward Stanhope, Secretary of State for War, in 1890-91, and St John Brodrick, Under-Secretary of State for War, in 1896-98. He was knighted in 1920. The middle brother, Julian Francis (b. 1869) studied at Selwyn College, Cambridge, but {{does not appear to}} have had an active public career. Their one sister, Helen, married a German economist, Dr. Moritz Julius Bonn, in 1903.|$|E

However, by early June it emerged that while {{she had left the}} Labour Party, she had not in fact joined the Conservatives and did not intend to.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu {{carried on}} {{as leader of}} pragmatic-reformist {{liberalism}} in Romania; in loose opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party cabinet of Lascăr Catargiu (1875), he began talks with the radical faction of the liberal trend (most notably, Ion Brătianu, Dimitrie Sturdza, Ion Ghica, C. A. Rosetti, Dimitrie Brătianu, and Alexandru G. Golescu), which were carried at the Bucharest residence of Pasha Stephen Bartlett Lakeman. On May 24, 1875, negotiations resulted {{in the creation of}} the National Liberal Party—the so-called Coalition of Mazar Pașa.|$|E

5|$|Shotgun Willie was {{released}} in June 1973. In spite of poor sales, the album received good reviews and gained Nelson major recognition with younger audiences.

5|$|The History of British Political Parties is a {{comprehensive}} work which lists and describes over 250 political parties in the United Kingdom that have participated in parliamentary elections since 1832. Entries are organised alphabetically, and most descriptions of the political parties span a few paragraphs or pages. Space is allotted to each entry based on the individual party's history and influence; 34 pages are devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Party, whereas only two paragraphs are given to the Captain Beany's New Millennium Bean Party.|$|E
5|$|After {{not being}} {{selected}} to become Labour's {{candidate in the}} 2000 London mayoral election, Livingstone successfully contested the election as an independent candidate. In his first term as Mayor of London, he introduced the congestion charge, Oyster card, and articulated buses, and unsuccessfully opposed the government's privatisation of London Underground. Despite his opposition to Blair's government on issues like the Iraq War, Livingstone was invited to stand for re-election as Labour's candidate and was re-elected in 2004, expanding his transport policies, introducing new environmental regulations, and enacting civil rights policies. Initiating and overseeing London's winning bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics and ushering in a major redevelopment of the city's East End, his leadership after the 7 July 2005 London bombings was widely praised. He stood unsuccessfully as Labour candidate in London's mayoral elections of 2008 and 2012, losing both <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> candidate Boris Johnson. In 2016, accused of bringing the party into disrepute, he was suspended from Labour.|$|E

50|$|Labour {{remained}} {{in control of}} the council with 23 councillors after holding 7 of the 11 seats contested, despite losing 1 seat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Conservative</b> gain came in Furnace Green, where Brenda Blackwell defeated the former Labour mayor Ray Calcott by 1,269 votes to 895. This took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> <b>to</b> 7 seats, as they also held the 2 seats contested in Pound Hill North, while the Liberal Democrats remained on 2 seats after holding Northgate.|$|R
5|$|Endecott's {{responsibility}} was {{to establish}} the colony and to prepare it {{for the arrival of}} additional settlers. The winters of 1629 and 1630 were difficult compared to those in England, and he called on the Plymouth Colony for medical assistance. His wife, who had been ill on the voyage over, died that winter. Other difficulties he encountered included early signs of religious friction among the colony's settlers (dividing between Nonconformists and Separatists), and poor relations with Thomas Morton, whose failed Wessagusset Colony and libertine practices (which including a May pole and dancing) were anathema <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conservative</b> Puritanism practiced by most settlers in the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies. Early in his term as governor he visited the abandoned site of Morton's colony and had the Maypole taken down. When one group of early settlers wanted to establish a church independent of that established by the colonial leadership, he had their leaders summarily sent back to England.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{in one of}} {{the closest}} polls in UK history, Sir Harmar Nicholls held the seat by three votes after seven recounts. Nicholls was the Conservative member from 1950 to 1974, when he lost in the October {{election}} of that year to Labour's Michael Ward, having held on by just 22 votes after four recounts in the election eight months earlier. The growth in the New Town from 1967 may in part account for Labour's victory here in 1974. In 1979, however, Ward lost the seat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> Brian Mawhinney, who would represent Peterborough for the entire duration of the incoming Conservative government and was a Cabinet Minister and Conservative Party Chairman during the second Major government (1992–97).|$|E
5|$|Mathias' {{candidacy}} consideration did not endear him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conservative</b> {{wing of the}} Maryland Republican Party organization. In June 1976, he lost a vote {{by state}} Republicans to determine who would represent Maryland on the platform committee at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Instead, the group chose George Price, a conservative member of the Maryland House of Delegates from Baltimore County. At one point, Mathias was close to being denied attendance to the convention altogether as an at-large delegate, but a last minute compromise ensured all Republican congressional representatives seats as at-large delegates. Mathias maintained a low profile during the convention, and received harsh criticism {{from some of the}} conservative delegates from Maryland who attended.|$|E

5|$|Members of the WSPU were {{sometimes}} heckled and derided for spoiling elections for Liberal candidates. On 18 January 1908, Pankhurst and her associate Nellie Martel {{were attacked by}} an all-male crowd of Liberal supporters who blamed the WSPU for costing them a recent by-election <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> candidate. The men threw clay, rotten eggs, and stones packed in snow; the women were beaten and Pankhurst's ankle was severely bruised. Similar tensions later formed with Labour. Until party leaders made the vote for women a priority, however, the WSPU vowed to continue its militant activism. Pankhurst {{and others in the}} union saw party politics as distracting to the goal of women's suffrage and criticised other organisations for putting party loyalty ahead of women's votes.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{was adopted}} as North Devon's Liberal {{candidate}} in April 1952. His political stance matched {{that of other}} young activists, who believed that the party should offer a radical non-socialist alternative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservative</b> government. He and others founded the Radical Reform Group, to drive the party in that direction. He {{spent much of his}} spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and on the doorstep he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as colonialism and apartheid. When Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Winston Churchill as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign. He succeeded in halving the Conservative majority in the constituency, and restoring the Liberals to second place.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, {{the issue of race}} hurt Weaver among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, but {{he and his wife were}} also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver as a threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conservative</b> Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E
50|$|The Liberal Democrats gained 5 {{seats to}} move from third largest group on <b>the</b> council <b>to</b> become <b>the</b> largest party, {{overtaking}} <b>the</b> Labour and <b>Conservative</b> parties. Liberal Democrat gains were recorded in Abbey, Arboretum and Mackworth wards from Labour, and in Blagreaves and Oakwood wards from <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives.</b> Meanwhile, Labour recovered a seat in Sinfin which they had lost when Hardial Dhamrait had defected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives.</b> However, Labour also two seats in Chaddesden and Chellaston <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Financial Times, the Evening Standard, The Economist also {{switched}} their endorsement from Labour <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives.</b> <b>The</b> Liberal Democrats {{picked up}} the endorsement of The Guardian and The Observer.|$|R
50|$|The results saw the Liberal Democrats {{keep their}} {{majority}} {{on the council}} after losing 1 seat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives.</b> <b>The</b> only change came in Windermere Applethwaite and Troutbeck, with <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> taking <b>the</b> seat by 12 votes after several recounts. This left the Liberal Democrats on 32 seats, compared <b>to</b> 18 for <b>the</b> <b>Conservatives</b> and 1 for Labour. Overall turnout in the election was 56.16%.|$|R
