25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth front fender extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the <b>transmission</b> <b>type.</b> AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E

2500|$|The 1980 VAM Americans {{incorporated}} all changes {{designed by}} AMC for the Concord that included C-pillar {{windows on the}} ECD, opera windows on the GFS, full-length tail lights, a standard flexible seven-blade fan in all engines, [...] speedometer. For the first time, the cars came with a VAM-designed grille made of aluminum. The American ECD came with the [...] six as standard equipment, meaning that all high-trim VAM Americans were powered by the largest six engine from this point ahead. The American GFS switched to column-shifted transmission control (retaining the individual seat configuration) and the American DL wagon was available {{for the first time}} with simulated wood bodyside trim. A lighted vanity mirror was now standard equipment for the three top end models. All three base models included the heater as standard equipment regardless of <b>transmission</b> <b>type,</b> as well as high back front seats with adjustable headrests. All models featured a locking gas cap and high trim models had safety reflectors fixed onto the door armrests. The high trim 1980 models were the first VAM cars ever to be available with intermittent wipers, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, electric antenna, and an AM/FM stereo radio (instead of the previous monaural units).|$|E
2500|$|The Gran Torino Sport now {{featured}} its {{own unique}} emblem, which it displayed in the grille and on the trunk lock cover. The laser strip was still an option but was revised to a slightly different shape, and ran higher along on the body side. The Sport no longer featured a hood scoop, and the Ram Air induction option was also gone. Other than the above changes, the Sport was unchanged from the 1972 model year, and continued to be offered as a 2-door hardtop and 2-door SportsRoof. In the Car and Driver magazine road test of a 1973 Gran Torino Sport, the suspension received high marks for comfort and handling. [...] Car and Driver wrote that the Torino was as [...] "..quiet as a Jaguar, smooth as a Continental, the Torino's ride is exceptional...even with the competition suspension."

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis work is to define the strategy of tuning current controller amplifier and voltage dependent current order limiter parameters to achieve good dynamic performance {{with a wide range}} of a. c. systems in PSS/E. The defined control parameter could be adapting independent of different power levels and configurations. Basically, three different HVDC <b>transmission</b> <b>types</b> are used such as overhead lines, cables and back to back. The dynamic control performances are varied with respect to <b>transmission</b> <b>types.</b> Hence, the control parameters could be different. The control parameters could be intended for stability improvement of HVDC system connected with wide range of AC system parameters. As a part of a HVDC project design, large efforts are made in tuning control system parameters for the specific project conditions. However, for customer support, in planning studies it is necessary to provide a set of robust control parameters giving a representative performance for “any” configuration. This thesis work mainly deals with dynamic response of HVDC system. The dynamic instabilities occur mostly at d. c. system connected to weak receiving a. c. network. It causes high ac voltage fluctuations as a consequence very difficult to recover the dc system after the fault clearing instant due to repetitive commutation failures. Therefore, good dynamic dc control strategy has to define by tuning the current control amplifier and voltage dependent current order limiter. This will be done by analyzing the responses of the HVDC model for different <b>transmission</b> <b>types,</b> network strengths and control parameters. Results will be evaluated, and presented so that it is possible to define performance and what needs to be improved. Evaluation will be made of the responses obtained using the existing parameters and those obtained using the set of rules proposed in the thesis...|$|R
