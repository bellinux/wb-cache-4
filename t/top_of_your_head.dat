500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, you do your best not to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E
2500|$|ERICKSON: You know, I had {{one patient}} this last July who had {{four or five}} years of {{psychoanalysis}} and got nowhere with it. And someone who knows her said, [...] "How much attention did you give to the past?" [...] I said, [...] "You know, I completely forgot about that." [...] That patient is, I think, a reasonably cured person. It was a severe washing compulsion, as much as twenty hours a day. I didn't go in to the cause or the etiology; the only searching question I asked was [...] "When you get in the shower to scrub yourself for hours, tell me, do you start at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> or the soles of your feet, or in the middle? Do you wash from the neck down, or do you start with your feet and wash up? Or do you start with your head and wash down?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{can see the}} <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>heads!</b> What's the use {{of staying}} up there? I like you not {{to go out with}} the street-boys; but do come and play with me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{only thing}} that I can see," [...] he said, after a long pause, [...] "is {{for you and the}} men each to cut off a lock of hair from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>heads,</b> where it will not show. The six locks would be ample; but I don't see how you are to fasten it, below the turban." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--nothing," [...] {{repeated}} the speaker. [...] "Yesterday's snow blocked {{up the old}} trail again. The beacon on the summit's burnt out. I left a notice at the Divide. Do that again, Dumphy, and I'll knock the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ugly <b>head</b> off." ...|$|R

Just half a minute, my young friend, and we'll give you a {{polishing}} that shall keep your curls on {{for the next ten}} years!' ...|$|E
60|$|SHE. Listen to me, Henry: {{we really}} haven't {{time for all}} that sort of flapdoodle now.

Oh, take care: you nearly hit me in the chin with the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my dears, I do. But then, I protest, I'm not fairly treated. I think, {{for a young}} American girl, {{who looks}} as most of my fair friends do look, to come down with her bright eyes and all her little panoply of graces upon an old fellow like me, and expect him to like a fashion merely because she looks well in it, is all sheer nonsense. Why, girls, if you wore rings in your noses, and bangles on your arms up to your elbows, if you tied your hair in a war-knot on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>heads</b> like the Sioux Indians, you would still look pretty. The {{question}} isn't, as I view it, whether you look pretty,--for that you do, and that you will, do what you please and dress how you will. The question is whether you might not look prettier, whether another style of dress, and another mode of getting up, would not be far more becoming. I am one who thinks that it would." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{waited a}} little--she was so tenderly mocking, so sweetly ambiguous. [...] "Because we're {{precious}} asses! However, I'm simple enough, after all, {{to care for}} you as I've never cared for any human creature. You have, as it happens, a personal charm for me {{that no one has}} ever approached, and from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> splendid <b>head</b> to the sole <b>of</b> <b>your</b> theatrical shoe (I could go down on my face--there, abjectly--and kiss it!) every inch of you is dear and delightful to me. Therefore good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|The garret where Tommy and Elspeth were {{to sleep}} was reached by a ladder from the hallan; {{when you were}} near the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the ladder <b>your</b> <b>head</b> hit a trap-door and pushed it open. At {{one end of the}} garret was the bed, and at the other end were piled sticks for {{firewood}} and curious dark-colored slabs whose smell the children disliked until Tommy said, excitedly, [...] "Peat!"

6000|$|Mr. Skinner, when he appeared, was a {{large-faced}} man, with a lisp and a squint {{that made}} him look over the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> slashed slippers that appealed to Mr. Bensington's sympathies, and a manifest shortness of buttons. He held his coat and shirt together with one hand and traced patterns on the black-and-gold tablecloth with the index finger of the other, while his disengaged eye watched Mr. Bensington's sword of Damocles, so to speak, with an expression of sad detachment. [...] "You don't want to run thith Farm for profit. No, Thir. Ith all the thame, Thir. Ekthperimenth! Prethithely." ...|$|E

Ida has a monkey which lives on the curtain rod. It is a most dreadful creature. It will remain absolutely motionless until it sees that you have forgotten its presence, {{and then it will}} suddenly bound from picture to picture all round the walls, and end by swinging down on the bell-rope and jumping on to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head.</b> At breakfast it stole a poached egg and daubed it all over the door handle. Ida calls these outrages amusing tricks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The smart people," [...] she answered, [...] "they are {{the same}} everywhere--they must be extravagant--they use the Java orange. If it hits you in the back I prefer the Java orange. It is more messy than the other, {{but it does not}} leave you with that curious {{sensation}} of having been temporarily stunned. Most people, of course, make use of the small hard orange. If you duck in time, and so catch it on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head,</b> it does not hurt so much as you would think. If, however, it hits you on a tender place--well, myself, I always find that a little sal volatile, with old cognac--half and half, you understand--is about the best thing. But it only happens once a year," [...] she added.|$|E
50|$|Your baby's skull {{has seven}} bones. Normally, these bones don't fuse until around age 2, giving your baby's brain time to grow. Joints called cranial sutures, made of strong, fibrous tissue, hold these bones together. In the front <b>of</b> <b>your</b> baby's skull, the sutures {{intersect}} {{in the large}} soft spot (fontanel) on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> baby's <b>head.</b> Normally, the sutures remain flexible until the bones fuse. The signs of craniosynostosis may not be noticeable at birth, but they become apparent {{during the first few}} months <b>of</b> <b>your</b> baby's life. The symptoms differs from types of synostosis. First of all there is Sagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the suture at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head (sagittal suture) forces the head to grow long and narrow, rather than wide. Scaphocephaly is {{the most common type of}} craniosynostosis. The other one is called Coronal synostosis (anterior plagiocephaly). Premature fusion of a coronal suture — one of the structures that run from each ear to the sagittal suture on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the head — may force your baby's forehead to flatten on the affected side. It may also raise the eye socket and cause a deviated nose and slanted skull. The Bicoronal synostosis (brachycephaly). When both of the coronal sutures fuse prematurely, your baby may have a flat, elevated forehead and brow.|$|R

6000|$|... 'People may {{say what}} they like,' {{observed}} Mrs Nickleby, 'but there's {{a great deal of}} comfort in a nightcap, as I'm sure you would confess, Nicholas my dear, if you would only have strings to yours, and wear it like a Christian, instead of sticking it upon the very <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> like a blue-coat boy. You needn't think it an unmanly or quizzical thing to be particular about your nightcap, for I have often heard your poor dear papa, and the Reverend Mr What's-his-name, who used to read prayers in that old church with the curious little steeple that the weathercock was blown off the night week before you were born,--I have often heard them say, that the young men at college are uncommonly particular about their nightcaps, and that the Oxford nightcaps are quite celebrated for their strength and goodness; so much so, indeed, that the young men never dream of going to bed without 'em, and I believe it's admitted on all hands that THEY know what's good, and don't coddle themselves.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Under her amazement {{there was}} a hint of fear, and then came a flash as of anger. Jacobus, after uttering my name fairly loud, said: [...] "Make {{yourself}} at home, Captain--I won't be gone long," [...] and went away rapidly. Before I had {{time to make a}} bow I was left alone with the girl--who, I remembered suddenly, had not been seen by any man or woman of that town since she had found it necessary to put up her hair. It looked as though it had not been touched again since that distant time of first putting up; it was a mass of black, lustrous locks, twisted anyhow high on her head, with long, untidy wisps hanging down {{on each side of the}} clear sallow face; a mass so thick and strong and abundant that, nothing but to look at, it gave you a sensation of heavy pressure on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>head</b> and an impression of magnificently cynical untidiness. She leaned forward, hugging herself with crossed legs; a dingy, amber- coloured, flounced wrapper of some thin stuff revealed the young supple body drawn together tensely in the deep low seat as if crouching for a spring. I detected a slight, quivering start or two, which looked uncommonly like bounding away. They were followed by the most absolute immobility.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Hogan advocates {{the use of}} a waggle {{not only}} because it helps you loosen your muscles, but also because it allows for your hands and arms to {{remember}} where to go for the first part <b>of</b> <b>your</b> backswing.
