5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are more similar <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> than the {{elements}} in any other group are <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.|$|E

5|$|The {{semicircular canals}} are contracted, {{and they are}} highly curved. The semicircular system of MCCM-HUE-8741 shows also a basal morphology, because the semicircular canals do not attach <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E

5|$|A limited genetic {{sampling}} of species in a 1996 study by Annette Kretzer and colleagues showed Suillus bovinus {{was related to}} a lineage that diverged to S.punctipes, S.variegatus and S.tomentosus. A 2001 study found it was not closely related to other European species, and that all populations tested were more closer <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> than any other and hence it was a cohesive species.|$|E
5|$|A third {{possibility}} {{is where the}} primary and moon are tidally locked <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> In that case, the tidal bulge stays directly under the moon, there is no transfer of angular momentum, and the orbital period will not change. Pluto and Charon are {{an example of this}} type of configuration.|$|E
5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper ankle bones) fused <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and to the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus. The tibia was shorter than the femur, giving the hindlimb stocky proportions. There were three functional digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|E

5|$|According to Keller's conjecture, any tiling of {{the plane}} by {{congruent}} squares must include two squares that meet edge-to-edge. None of the squares in the Pythagorean tiling meet edge-to-edge, but this fact does not violate Keller's conjecture because the tiles have different sizes, so they are not all congruent <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During nighttime, giraffes appear to hum <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many species}} of Psittacosaurus have been named, their {{relationships}} <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{have not yet been}} fully explored and no scientific consensus exists on the subject. Several phylogenetic analyses have been published, with the most detailed being those by Alexander Averianov and colleagues in 2006, Hai-Lu You and colleagues in 2008, and Paul Sereno in 2010. The middle one is shown below.|$|E
5|$|Although van der Weyden did not {{adhere to}} the {{conventions}} of idealisation, he generally sought to flatter his sitters. He depicted his models in highly fashionable clothing, often with rounded—almost sculpted—facial features, some of which deviated from natural representation. He adapted his own aesthetic, and his portraits of women often bear a striking resemblance <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they speak <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> only over {{communication}} links such as view screens.

5|$|Bigfin reef squids also exhibit both {{schooling}} and shoaling behaviours. Very young bigfin reef squids will also stay close together (shoaling), {{but do not}} swim together parallel <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> (schooling). Unlike most other squid species, bigfin reef squids are rarely cannibalistic. Shoals can include animals of different sizes without the threat of larger members attacking and consuming the smaller members. Whether bigfin reef squids recognise each other individually still remains unknown.|$|E
