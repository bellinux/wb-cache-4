Her approach {{to the study of}} race, gender, class, nationality, <b>transnationality,</b> and ethnicity is informed by Marxist feminist dialectical, and historical materialism approach. She is critical of theoretical frameworks which treat race, gender, and class atomistically, and reduce them to the domains of discourse, text, language, or identity. She critiques monopolies of knowledge and power in education, and advocates dialogical and inclusive pedagogical practices. Mojab's research has been published on Islamic feminism, minority women in academe, diversity and academic freedom in Canadian and Iranian universities, adult education and civil society in the Middle East, feminism and nationalism, state-university relation, and women's access to higher education.|$|E
40|$|Drawing on {{the core}} notions of {{knowledge}} augmentation and rational choice in internalization theory, the paper develops {{a theoretical framework}} {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>transnationality</b> and financial performance in the era of the global factory, and tests hypotheses against recent experience of leading transnational enterprises. The paper rejects a direct relationship between <b>transnationality</b> and financial performance, and supports a mediation model in which knowledge-based assets mediate the relationship between <b>transnationality</b> and financial performance conditional on R&D intensity. In making decisions on the <b>transnationality</b> of a firm, managers should not focus on whether it helps the firm achieve direct financial benefits because these are quickly offset by the costs in a competitive environment. Instead, they should focus on whether it helps the firm enhance knowledge-based assets and, through it, financial gains that can be long-lasting, and whether it is supported by R&D to augment such asset...|$|E
40|$|One {{phenomenon}} of globalisation is the transnationalization of migrants and migrant communities, creating new social fields and new identities between {{country of origin}} and country of settlement. This paper presents the preliminary results of a research project on transnational migration between Poland and the German city of Leipzig. It aims to identify aspects of <b>transnationality</b> and wants to show the transnational social spaces inhabited by the migrants. The analysis of the qualitative and quantitative data is done along a model of <b>transnationality,</b> differentiating between three spheres which refer to physical, cultural and identity movements of the migrants. It provides some empirical evidence of the interdependency between migration motives, duration of migration and several socio-economic variables {{on the one hand}} and the variations of <b>transnationality</b> on the other. The paper also raises the question of the implications of transnationalization for the European nation building process and suggests that transnational identity formations might serve as a model for a future European citizenship...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} immigrants' {{transnational}} ties {{and the relationship}} to their social position is subject to a controversial debate that suggests a dualistic picture. On the one hand, globalization theorists argue that an elite of highly educated and economically most successful professionals intensively engages in and benefits from <b>transnationality.</b> On the other hand, most scholars in migration and assimilation studies hold {{that it is the}} most underprivileged immigrants who maintain strong ties across state borders, which in turn furthers their marginalization. Yet, to date, very little systematic research has been conducted into the nexus between social inequalities and <b>transnationality.</b> This paper aims to fill this gap. Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we show that the economic, cultural and social forms of capital are related to <b>transnationality</b> in different ways, rather than reflecting one uniform pattern.

The purpose of this study is the analysis of the main non-financial multinationals in the world, based on the assets held abroad and depending on the <b>transnationality</b> index (TNI) in 2013. In order to achieve the purpose of the current paper we employed data from UNCTAD database and the World Investment Report (WIR) from 2015. Information on multinationals ranked by foreign assets according to the World Investment Report in 2015 show that, based on the TNI, European multinationals, such as the ones in France, Italy, Germany and Norway, have a higher <b>transnationality</b> index compared to multinationals from larger countries, such as the US and China.

40|$|Anthropologists {{have always}} striven to {{understand}} the relationships between local and supra-local realities, the integration of smaller socio-political economic and cultural units into larger wholes, the creation {{of political and economic}} systems. In this paper, transnationalism is interpreted within the realm of debates on levels of integration, shrinking {{of the world and the}} creation of new realities that challenge existing forms of coping with life and inherited understandings within the social sciences. The discussion on transnationalism has frontiers and similarities with subjects such as globalization, world system and the international division of labor. But I argue that its own distinction lies in the fact that <b>transnationality</b> points to a central issue: the state/citizenship relationship, or to put it in a more abstract fashion, the relationship between territories and the different forms of socio-cultural and political arrangements that orient the way people represent their membership to a certain level of integration. The emergence of transnationalism is recent and it endangers the logics and effectiveness of the other pre-existing collective representations on socio-cultural and political membership. Although we may clearly speak of transnationalism, <b>transnationality</b> as such keeps in many regards potential and virtual characteristics. This is why I'd rather consider the condition(s) of <b>transnationality</b> and not its existence in itself. I will explore this subject by briefly presenting six clusters of conditions that are separable only for analytical and exposition purposes...|$|E

40|$|The {{implications}} of migrants' transnational engagements for processes {{of change and}} development in the regions of origin are attracting increased attention from both policymakers and academics. Rather than addressing {{the positive effects of}} migration and <b>transnationality</b> on local development, this special issue suggests a focus on the relationship between this phenomenon and broader societal transformation, thereby acknowledging the renewed importance of place and locality. To this end, this introduction provides an overview of the current debate on transnational dynamics in relation to societal transformation, local development, and inequality. Central to our analysis {{is the way in which}} migrants' <b>transnationality</b> engages with the hierarchies that exist between and within localities, and how this reproduces social inequalities. This introduction thus also reflects the key themes that are addressed in the five papers that make up this special issue on transnational dynamics, transformation, and locality...|$|E

40|$|The {{transnational}} organization concept {{represents an}} epistemological challenge to entrepreneurship researchers (Drori, Honig, & Wright, 2007) because we lack a measurable characteristic that distinguishes a transnational entrepreneurial organization from a “born global ” export/import or a multinational small business. To address this problem, we propose an index that calculates the geographic diversity of a company’s value chain to clearly demarcate {{the boundaries between}} different global organizational forms along a continuous scale – The <b>Transnationality</b> Index. Low scores on the index represent domestic organizations while high scores indicate an equal distribution of value chain functions across multiple locations. Scores in the middle range include the continuum of export/import, outsourcing, and multinational organizations who have increasing proportions of their value chain distributed across national boundaries, {{but not to the}} extent of a transnational organization. We review the literature related to the varying forms of international entrepreneurship, using the <b>Transnationality</b> Index to resolve conflicting findings that result from misspecification of organizational form.

40|$|Although {{studies have}} shown that Tongan {{migrants}} maintain strong linkages with Tongans in Tonga as well as with their kin in New Zealand, Australia, and the United States, the Tongan concept of vä, social space, has not been used to understand Tongan transnational relations. For Tongans, vä is organized through one’s genealogy and kinship ties. The concept of space is central to our understanding of <b>transnationality</b> because global practices involve the movement and flows of people and things within space and across spatial boundaries while people maintain sociospatial connections with one another. Tongans generally view reciprocal exchanges, whether within Tonga or transnational, as tauhi vä: taking care of sociospatial ties with kin and kin-like members. In this article, I explore the concept of vä and the practice of tauhi vä primarily through my research among Tongans in Maui, Hawai‘i, as well as my experience with Tongans in Seattle, Washington.

40|$|Taking co-production as a {{dominant}} development of Hong Kong's film industry, {{this study examines}} the <b>transnationality</b> of different trends of co-production: Hong Kong China co-production, Hong Kong - Asia co-production, and individuals working for overseas productions, and the production cultures in these varied contexts are analyzed. By crossing production culture, policy, film business {{and the work of}} individual practitioners with the concept and practices of <b>transnationality,</b> this study outlines the possibilities and limitations of developing transnational co-production in Hong Kong cinema. Focusing on its varied manifestations, this thesis emphasizes the plurality of <b>transnationality</b> and suggests that "transnationalities" are a result of the development of Hong Kong cinema. The influences and infiltration of Hong Kong cinema into the other cinemas of the world reflects its ways of survival, and the simple claiming of "the death of Hong Kong" should be questioned. Although there are many constraints in co-production, and some practitioners of valuable skills, like action choreography, are privileged to others, the thesis reveals that Hong Kong cinema is transforming in a direction that provides a foundation for sustainable development. The different co-production projects in which Hong Kong cinema is now engaging demonstrate how this cinema will be able to incorporate itself into the production process in China, Asia and the overseas contexts.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the <b>transnationality</b> of {{identity}} {{in terms of how}} Irish diasporic memory is functioning in a post-September 11 th context. Here a distinction is made between Irish identity in Ireland and Irish-American identity. Drawing on current cultural studies ' critiques, a further distinction is made; namely how the 'look ' of Irishness is functioning as a sign for 'white ' America (Negra: 2006). In this respect, The Irish Face In America is an interesting text in that it exploits both the conventions of ‘old ’ and ‘new ’ photography. This study draws out the significance of these strategies in terms of constructions of Irish-American diasporic cultural memory as it is being currently formulated in a specific location; namely, a post 9 / 11 US context. <b>Transnationality,</b> in this instance works in two directions because a post-Cease-Fire Irish context is necessary for this re-imagining of the Irish terrorist. Through this case study of The Irish Face In America, I argue that photography is being employed to reify notions of roots and identity (Ireland and the Irish) that serve to obfuscate the challenges o...|$|E

Firstly, in this study, we briefly summarize several aspects regarding to the strategic focus of the multinational corporations on the global market. Secondly, we intend to map business extension in the international environment from the perspective of regional concentration. In this regard, for each region we have aggregated the key performance indicators (assets, sales and employees) which reflect the magnitude of the activities of the companies included by UNCTAD in the Top 100 non-financial TNCs outside the home economic environment. Also, based on the algorithm for calculating the <b>Transnationality</b> Index we estimated an aggregate index for each home region of these companies. The main conclusion drawn from the study is that Europe is the most internationalised region; this tendency is underlined both by the value of the <b>Transnationality</b> Index at regional level and by the total value of the assets hold abroad by the companies which have the home location in the European economic environment. At the same time, from all the developed regions, Europe is the most attractive location for the implantation of the multinational corporations from outside.
