40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{operation}} safety of expressway <b>tunnels</b> on <b>operation</b> {{efficiency of the}} expressway network is significant because tunnels are key sections in the network. In case of emergency, e. g. traffic accidents, it brings much difficulty to rescue work and may paralyze traffic in the tunnel and even that of the entire expressway. In order to guarantee the <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> safety, {{it is necessary to}} monitor the <b>operation</b> of <b>tunnels</b> and take effective measures to keep safety under control. This paper focuses on operation risk modeling of expressway tunnels and development of a monitoring-warning system for real time expressway <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> control. The research includes an investigation of expressway <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation,</b> risk analysis, development of risk modeling and intelligent monitoring-warning system and a pilot project. Over thirty cases of expressway <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> were investigated and filed data of the operation situations including traffic accidents, running speed, acceleration and deceleration of vehicles were collected. Then, the operation conditions and risks were analyzed and the operation risk model was then developed to solve the problem. Based on the investigation data of the <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation,</b> five types of emergency incidents were identified and classified with regard to the effect of incidents on the <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> risks and efficiency. The emergency incidents were defined respectively as traffic incidents, severe weather, overspeeding, dangerous goods transportation and scheduled event. These incidents were graded in relation to the levels of effect on <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> safety. Comprehensive traffic control measures for each incident were put forward respectively in order to achieve effective tunnel traffic management, which included speed limit, safe driving distance, closed lanes and traffic guides. To implement real time control and effective <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> management, an intelligent tunnel monitoring-warning system including the system software and relative equipment were developed with functions of information collection, information processing and transmission and information release. A pilot project has been implemented at Huotanwan tunnel (left line) on the Baomao expressway (G 65) in Hunan province, China...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 20 - 21) A detailed {{literature review}} of transonic wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>operations</b> was completed, and calibration of the supersonic wind tunnel, configured for transonic operation, was begun. The {{intent of the}} study was to select and evaluate various airfoils for use at high angles of attack and at transonic speeds (M between 0, 8 5 and 1. 0 5). However, after extensive operation it was found that the modified wind tunnel, as configured, would not allow -operation in excess of mach 0, 63. An analytical study of the transonic configured wind tunnel revealed that considerable additional modification of the air supply system would be required before satisfactory wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> would result. Recommendations for the air supply system modification include a higher flow capacity control valve,. and more compressed air storage tank volume...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of the {{boundary}} layer parameters in the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics tunnel were conducted during extensive calibration activities following the facility conversion from a Freon- 12 heavy-gas test medium to R- 134 a. Boundary-layer rakes were mounted on the wind-tunnel walls, ceiling, and floor. Measurements were made over the range of <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation</b> envelope in both heavy gas and air and without a model in the test section at three tunnel stations. Configuration variables included open and closed east sidewall wall slots, for air and R 134 a test media, reentry flap settings, and stagnation pressures over {{the full range of}} <b>tunnel</b> <b>operation.</b> The boundary layer thickness varied considerably for the six rakes. The thickness for the east wall was considerably larger that the other rakes and was also larger than previously reported. There generally was some reduction in thickness at supersonic Mach numbers, but the effect of stagnation pressure, and test medium were not extensive...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Mechanical {{excavation}} of tunnels using Road-header is getting widespread and {{popular due to}} their capability of excavating precisely soft to medium strength rock without weakening the surrounding rock. Road-header is flexible, very mobile, safe, and environmentally friendly machinery. It can excavate smoothly various sizes, shapes, and types of tunnel openings. Accurate and reliable productivity prediction for the selected machinery is required for time and resource scheduling, and hence estimating the budget of any tunnelling project. Simulation {{can be used to}} study <b>tunnelling</b> <b>operations</b> using Road-headers before they are actually performed. It will assist decision makers to predict productivity and to control time, cost, and resources. This paper presents a simulation model for estimating a (Voest-Alpine) Road-header productivity using both MicroCYCLONE and EZSROPE Software. Two Road-headers are used to excavate 1. 2 km tunnelling project starting Henri-Bourassa Station to Cartier station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The collected data represent actual time duration for the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>operations</b> (drilling, changing bits, maintenance, scaling, and wire mesh installation) of each Road-header. The results show that the predicted productivity by both simulation models gives close results to the actual. Productivity is calculated as 0. 44 lm/hr for the Road-header used in Henri-Bourassa direction against 0. 48 (actual); while it is 0. 64 lm/hr for the Road-header used in Cartier direction against 0. 7 (actual). A regression model is developed to generate a formula to predict the productivity (advance rate) based on consumption bits. The study also includes a sensitivity analysis for the resources acquired in <b>tunnelling</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R
