40|$|International {{audience}} 1. The use of cross-wise perches {{by laying}} hens {{was investigated in}} 8 groups of 6 hens. During a period of 5 weeks each group was exposed to 4 different perch arrangements: a single straight perch of 60 cm (P 60), a 30 cm perch crossing the middle of another perch of 30 (P 30 + 30), 45 (P 45 + 30) or 60 cm (P 60 + 30) long. 2. Perch arrangement influenced perch use. Perch occupancy (the mean number of hens using the perches) was lowest in the P 30 + 30 treatment during daytime, evening and night. Perch occupancy was lower for P 45 + 30 as compared both with P 60 + 30 during daytime and with P 60 during evening and night. Perch occupancy did not differ between P 60 and P 60 + 30. 3. Perch utilization (perch use per unit of total perch length provided) was lower for the three cross-wise perch arrangements as compared to P 60 indicating that the area near the crossing was not used optimally. 4. There were indications {{that the process of}} taking roosting positions was more disturbed with cross-wise perches. 5. Legislation and guidelines about the minimal perch <b>length</b> <b>per</b> <b>hen</b> should be refined {{to take into account the}} arrangement of the perches. A perch of 30 cm cross-wise to another perch should not be included in the total amount of perch length provided to the hens.

40|$|ABSTRACT Quantitative {{relationships}} between the cage area allotted <b>per</b> <b>hen</b> and parameters associated with egg production were examined by regression analysis. Hens were placed 3, 4, and 5 birds per cage (30. 5 X 50. 8 em) with 516, 387, and 310 cm 2 of floor area <b>per</b> <b>hen,</b> respectively. Egg production declined as the area <b>per</b> <b>hen</b> was reduced. There was no numerical difference for feed consumption per dozen eggs between 516 or 387 cm 2 <b>per</b> <b>hen.</b> Feed conversion was less efficient when the area was reduced to 310 em 2 <b>per</b> <b>hen.</b> Feed conversion when adjusted to 20 dozen eggs accentuated the decline in efficiency as previously noted. Mortality {{was significantly related to}} a reduction in cage area <b>per</b> <b>hen.</b> Egg weight tended to increase as the allotted area per bird decreased. Eggs produced and feed consumed per cage were highly correlated to bird numbers per cage area. An economic analysis based on dozens of eggs produced, feed consumption, egg and feed prices, grower payment, and pullet cost showed that profitability associated with increased bird numbers in a fixed cage area is sensitive to changes in egg and feed prices.

That is, a house 20 ft wide required a yard 4000 ft wide to provide the necessary area. This would normally be provided as two yards, one on either side of the house, each 2000 ft wide. In reality, such yards are expensive to fence, and the chickens spend most of their time on the portion closest to the house, so sustainability was never achieved in practice except with portable houses, which were moved periodically to fresh ground. Yarded operations were operated with unsustainably small yards that were quickly denuded and which received excessive levels of manure.|$|R

The diets were isocaloric and isoprotein (2, 850 kcal ME/kg and 12. 58 % CP) and oferred at a fixed amount (155 g) per bird.

The IL treatment provided 4 h of light per day given as 2 h light: 12 h dark: 2 h light: 8 h dark (2 L: 12 D: 2 L: 8 D). This treatment group was compared to controls maintained on 16 L: 8 D.

Feed intake and feed efficiency were similar in both age groups.

40|$|Animal populations {{occurring}} at high elevations are often {{assumed to be}} in peril of extinctions or local extirpations due to elevational-dispersal limitations and thermoregulatory constraints as habitats change and warm. However, long-term monitoring of high-elevation populations is uncommon relative to those {{occurring at}} lower elevations, and evidence supporting this assumption is limited. We analyzed 45 years of reproductive data for two Colorado populations of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), an alpine-endemic species with restricted distribution in western North America. Seasonal temperatures measured {{by the number of}} growing degree days warmed significantly at our study sites for pre-nesting, nesting, and brood-rearing seasonal periods (mean advance of 8 growing degree days per decade), and both populations advanced their reproductive phenology over the study period based on median hatch dates (median advance of 3. 7 and 1. 9 days per decade for the northern and southern sites, respectively). Reproductive performance measured by the number of chicks <b>per</b> <b>hen</b> declined significantly at one study site but not the other, and differences between sites may have been due to habitat degradation at one study area. Annual variability in chicks <b>per</b> <b>hen</b> was large at both sites but only weakly related to seasonal weather. An index of precipitation and temperature during the brood-rearing period was the best predictor for reproductive success with warm and dry conditions relating positively to number of chicks <b>per</b> <b>hen.</b> Our results provide evidence for two alpine ptarmigan populations that are remarkably invariant to fluctuations in seasonal weather with respect to reproductive success as measured by number of chicks <b>per</b> <b>hen</b> in the breeding population.
