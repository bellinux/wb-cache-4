5|$|Dinosaurs began {{appearing}} in films {{soon after the}} introduction of cinema, the first being the good-natured animated Gertie the Dinosaur in 1914. However, lovable dinosaurs were quickly replaced by monsters as moviemakers recognized the potential of huge frightening monsters. D. W. Griffith in 1914's Brute Force provided the first example of a threatening cinematic dinosaur, a Ceratosaurus who menaced cavemen. This film enshrined the fiction that dinosaurs and early humans lived together, and set up <b>the</b> <b>cliché</b> that dinosaurs were bloodthirsty and attacked anything that moved.|$|E
5|$|Poolside: The segment {{opens with}} Donovan on a pier, holding a newspaper. He {{returns to his}} house, strips by the pool and begins reading. Intrigued by {{an ad in the}} back of the paper, Donovan writes a letter in response. After a number of days pass (marked by <b>the</b> <b>cliché</b> device of {{fluttering}} calendar pages), he receives a reply in the form of a package. Inside is a tablet, which he throws into the pool. The water starts to churn and the dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple by the pool, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions. Di Cioccio turns the tables and tops Donovan until Donovan's climax. The scene closes with the two engaged in horseplay in the pool and then walking off together down a boardwalk.|$|E
5|$|Renoir {{originally}} {{wanted the}} entire cast of La Bête Humaineincluding Fernand Ledoux, Simone Simon, Jean Gabin and Julien Carettefor the film. Gabin {{was offered the}} role of André but rejected it and accepted a role in Marcel Carné's Le Jour Se Lève instead. He was replaced by Roland Toutain. Simon was offered the role of Christine but wanted 800,000 francs, which was {{a third of the}} film's entire budget. Simon's salary request was vetoed by NEF administrator Camille Francois. Ledoux was offered the role of Schumacher. He was married to Simon at the time; he declined when her salary request was denied and instead took a role in Maurice Tourneur's Volpone. He was replaced by Gaston Modot. Claude Dauphin was offered the role of the Marquis de la Chesnaye; he refused it and instead acted with Simon in Raymond Bernard's Cavalcade d'amour. Renoir then cast Marcel Dalio as the Marquis. Years later Dalio asked Renoir why he had been cast after having typically played burlesque or traitorous roles. Renoir told Dalio he was the opposite of <b>the</b> <b>cliché</b> of what a Marquis was, and that Dalio was the only actor he knew that could portray the character's insecurity. Renoir's brother Pierre was cast as Octave and Carette was cast as Marceau.|$|E

25|$|There are {{significant}} differences in lifestyles with respect to transportation between very urbanized regions such as Paris, and smaller towns and rural areas. In Paris, {{and to a lesser}} extent in other major cities, many households do not own an automobile and simply use efficient public transport. <b>The</b> <b>cliché</b> about the Parisien is rush hour in the Métro subway. However, outside of such areas, ownership of one or more cars is standard, especially for households with children.|$|E
25|$|Mulroney's {{big break}} came during <b>the</b> <b>Cliche</b> Commission in 1974, which {{was set up}} by Quebec premier Robert Bourassa to {{investigate}} the situation at James Bay, Canada's largest hydroelectric project. Violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle. To ensure the commission was non-partisan, Bourassa, the Liberal premier, placed Robert Cliche, a former leader of the provincial New Democratic Party in charge. Cliche asked Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative and a former student of his, to join the commission. Mulroney asked Lucien Bouchard to join as counsel. The committee's proceedings, which showed Mafia infiltration of the unions, made Mulroney well known in Quebec, as the hearings were extensively covered in the media. <b>The</b> <b>Cliche</b> Commission's report was largely adopted by the Bourassa government. A notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the Premier of Quebec. Although Bouchard favoured calling in Robert Bourassa as a witness, Mulroney refused, deeming it a violation of 'executive privilege'. Mulroney and Bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that {{would turn out to be}} extremely beneficial when Mulroney ran for re-election in 1988.|$|E
25|$|Of the façade by Alessandro Galilei (1735), <b>the</b> <b>cliché</b> {{assessment}} {{has ever}} been {{that it is the}} façade of a palace, not of a church. Galilei's front, which is a screen across the older front creating a narthex or vestibule, does express the nave and double aisles of the archbasilica, which required a central bay wider {{than the rest of the}} sequence. Galilei provided it, without abandoning the range of identical arch-headed openings, by extending the central window by flanking columns that support the arch, in the familiar Serlian motif.|$|E

500|$|Film scholar Kevin Wetmore {{noted the}} film's {{portrayal}} of {{violence as a}} reflection of its contemporary culture, writing: [...] "Death is a random act in post-9/11 horror—the result of being {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time, as <b>the</b> <b>cliché</b> goes. Unlike in eighties slasher horror, for example, where engaging in negative behavior such as drinking, doing drugs, having premarital sex are often forerunners to being killed by the killer(s); , death is random and unrelated to one's behavior." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} critical acclaim, with {{praise for}} Bharathiraja's script, Ilaiyaraaja's {{music and the}} performances of Kamal, Sridevi and Rajinikanth. The Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan, in its original review, gave the film 62.5 marks out of 100, their highest rating for a Tamil film. The reviewer praised the film for representing village life with realism, and for avoiding <b>the</b> <b>cliché</b> of (studio) court and police station in its climax, but criticised the error in focusing. In the fourteenth volume of Film World, dated 1978, T. M. Ramachandran praised Kamal's performance.

500|$|Reviewers {{had mixed}} {{opinions}} on the characters. Generally, reviewers liked the character interactions. IGN praised the diverse characters but panned Milla's english voice acting. Game Revolution felt the characters were relatable and agreed with IGN about Milla's voice noting it sounded robotic and forced. Electronic Gaming Monthly described the characters as rather normal and competent compared to the previous Tales games, adding that they could imagine the cast having lives and dreams outside of the party's journey. Edge described the character interactions as engaging, well written, and praised how the characters avoided <b>the</b> <b>cliché</b> found in manga and anime. Oppositely, PlayStation Official Magazine felt the characters [...] "fall into the familiar anime archtypes" [...] and that [...] "flat voice acting and a melodramatic script" [...] {{made it difficult to}} feel invested in the cast; Polygon agreed about the character archetypes and called it a lazy strategy used to make the characters understandable.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series.

He thought the performances were fairly solid and that the overall message about the ozone layer was [...] "unsubtle but not too sledgehammery". DeCandido praised Patrick Stewart's performance of Captain Picard, noting that his [...] "anger and outrage and justified self-righteousness at the kidnapping of children modulates nicely into diplomacy when negotiating with the Aldeans and amusingly into total discomfort when he has to actually deal directly with the children". He gave the episode a score of six out of ten. James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, said that it was [...] "a decent enough story, but not in a way that makes you want to watch it". He also felt that it was [...] "a complete throwaway episode and contains almost nothing unique to the franchise".|$|E
500|$|With Revelation, Third Day {{aimed to}} give their fans a record with their {{southern}} rock sound while being more creative.

500|$|The episode's plot is {{loosely based}} on the American comedy film Paper Moon, which was also the {{inspiration}} for Bart and Homer's swindle of Ned Flanders in the episode. The title of the episode is a parody of the 1981 film The Great Muppet Caper. The title was pitched by Simpsons writer Matt Selman. The episode's ending lampoons <b>the</b> <b>cliche</b> of having twist endings {{at the end of}} heist films. ”Magic Palace”, the magic-themed restaurant that the Simpsons visit {{in the beginning of the}} episode, is a parody on The Magic Castle, a nightclub in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles, California. Marge's line [...] "I didn't say that for clapping" [...] is a reference to a speech given by John Wayne while he was intoxicated. Homer wants to buy a singing rubber fish after their first con.

500|$|The plot, graphics, {{and audio}} have {{received}} mixed reviews. The plot and characters {{have been called}} cliché by Game Informer, GameSpot, and GamesRadar. Game Informer called the childhood prologue monotonous but commented on the improving story after the time skip. GameSpot agreed, calling the prologue the [...] "weakest {{part of the story}} on its own" [...] but [...] "crucial point of reference" [...] which adds depth and eventually breaks away from <b>the</b> <b>cliché.</b> GamesRadar shared the same opinion as GameSpot and praised Richard's transformation into a villain. As for the graphics, IGN considered them outdated while Joystiq described it as washed-out with jerky movements. For the audio, IGN, Game Informer, and GamesRadar, considered the music underwhelming and the voice acting acceptable. IGN describes the voice acting [...] "works" [...] but some parts suffer from weak script. Game Informer compared the voices to a well-produced anime and GamesRadar considered them fitting for the characters. Meanwhile, GameTrailers criticized the presentation completely, citing the plot as predictable, the characters unengaging, the lightings flat, animations stiff, lipsyncing off, forgettable music, and the voice acting as dry.|$|E

Several images including explosions and cityscapes are shown on him and on the wall before the performance begins.

Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "artistically contradictory", however said that the scenes of Drake sitting [...] "alone in his bedroom as flashing images of busy streets and crowds of strangers float around him, pensive and rebellious", and called them [...] "controlled chaos", but said that it worked in the video.
