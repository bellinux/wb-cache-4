To address these questions, we exploit administrative stamp duty records covering the universe of property transactions in the UK from 2004 - 2012 along with compelling sources of quasi-experimental variation. First, discontinuous jumps in the stamp duty at threshold property prices—notches—allow us to estimate the effect of the tax on house prices. Second, anticipated and unanticipated changes in the tax schedule allow us to estimate the dynamics of price responses and <b>timing</b> effects on <b>house</b> transactions. Third, a stimulus program that temporarily exempted certain properties from tax—a stamp duty holiday—allows us to provide micro evidence on both timing and extensive margin responses to macro stimulus policy.

Goodman [1] examined this issue and concluded that abnormal weather conditions {{have little or no}} effect on the pace of housing starts. The models presented in this study allow the impact of unseasonable weather on starts to vary over each month of the year whereas the specification in Goodman constrained these effects to vary between only the summer and winter. In addition, lagged weather deviations are included in the model to determine if unseasonable weather affects the demand for housing or merely the <b>timing</b> of <b>housing</b> starts. The results suggest that unseasonable weather does affect the pace of housing starts in the months of the first quarter.

40|$|Using {{proprietary}} micro data on {{the complete}} set of housing transactions between 1993 and 2009 in 99 metropolitan areas, we investigate whether contagion was {{an important factor in}} the last housing cycle. We define contagion as the price correlation between two different housing markets following a shock to one market that is above and beyond that which can be justified by common aggregate trends. Our estimates deal with the following empirical challenges: (a) defining the <b>timing</b> of local <b>housing</b> booms in a non-ad hoc way; (b) addressing specification search bias that arises when only one aggregate series is used to estimate both the <b>timing</b> of the <b>housing</b> boom and the magnitude of price volatility during that period; and (c) controlling for common variation in economic conditions. We find strong evidence of contagion during the housing boom, but not during the bust. These effects appear to arise mostly from the closest neighboring metropolitan area, with the price elasticity ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 27. This is large enough to account for up to 30 % of the jump in prices at the beginning of local booms, on average. Estimated elasticities are greater when transmitted from a larger to a smaller market, and also more important for the most elastically-supplied markets. Finally, local fundamentals and expectations of future fundamentals have very limited ability to account for our estimated effect, suggesting a potential role for non-rational forces...|$|R

40|$|Housing markets often {{exhibit a}} high degree of {{volatility}} in prices and quantities, with significant economic consequences for both homeowners and the construction sector. While aggregate housing market patterns have been well-documented, our understanding of the microfoundations of housing markets, particularly the <b>timing</b> of <b>housing</b> supply responses to demand shocks, is limited. In order to shed light on the primitives underlying these patterns, I develop and estimate the first dynamic microeconometric model of housing supply. In the model, parcel owners choose the optimal time and nature of construction, taking into account their expectations about future prices and costs. While retaining computational tractability, the model includes a large state space, allows profits to vary at a very fine level of geography, and incorporates a much broader definition of costs than previous work. Estimates of the model, using a rich data set on individual land parcel owners in the San Francisco Bay Area, indicate that changes {{in the value of the}} right-to-build are the primary cause of house price appreciation and that the demographic characteristics of existing residents are determinants of the cost environment.

40|$|Presentations {{of three}} {{potential}} nest intruders {{were used to}} investigate house wren nest defense behavior, while regular nest box checks provided information regarding house wren nest-destroying behavior. During nest defense trials, male wrens were typically more active in defense than females in the egg stage but no intersexual differences existed in the nestling stage. Males' greater defensiveness could be an extension of their territory defense role. Defense vocalizations were sex biased, with males giving primarily song calls and females giving chatter calls. Both sexes maintained or lowered their defense levels from egg to nestling stage, possibly due to decreased offspring vulnerability. House wrens altered their defense behaviors among intruder species, {{depending on the type}} of threat. Males exhibited greater defense levels against the house wren model compared to the bluebird or cowbird model in the egg stage but showed no differences among model species in the nestling stage. Females exhibited no defense differences among model species. Male defense levels were affected by their breeding strategy, as attentive males were more aggressive toward the house wren and cowbird models than non-attentive males. Attentive males discriminated among intruder species while non-attentive males did not. Lack of male attentiveness, due to polygamy or attempted polygamy, appeared to be potentially costly to females, regardless of their order of pairing with the male. House wren nest destroying behavior (NDB) varied with respect to the <b>timing</b> of <b>house</b> wren nest attacks, the abandonment and reacquisition of nests following a wren attack, and the status of neighboring house wren nests at the time of a nest attack.

Sugar beet refining takes place in the boiling house and represents a very complicated technological process in which it is necessary to decide about time coordination of particular production operations, mixing of intermediate products, and control of recycles (see Chapter 2). From the viewpoint of control, the process fights with following key problems (see Chapter 3) : regulation of filling of total capacity of all stock receivers (hereinafter filling of boiling <b>house)</b> <b>timing</b> the starting moment of the boil setting parameters of automatic control of the boil in phase "ready to start" and "boiling up" prediction to time of the boil Because the classic regulation methods cannot be used for solving these problems (see Chapter 4), the thesis: suggests a concept of control of expert control with regard to type and character of the problems solved, i. e. it suggests its architecture, main and subordinate strategies, and also three fundamental control functions: monitoring and diagnostics of filling of the boiling house together with suggestion of output changes of the refinery continual part, time coordination of start of boils together with prediction of time of boils, and finally suggestion of automatic control parameters of the boil in certain phases (see Chapter 6). ensuresdata preparation (see Chapter 7) and formalizes the conceptual model of expert control by means of specific knowledge representation (by means of production rules) (see Chapter 8) shows suitability and justification of application of expert control for the given purpose on the base of operation test in sugar refinery Lovosice (see Chapter 9).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} relationship between immigrant housing consumption behaviours in Canada and transnational engagements (specifically remittances and transnational housing investments). Immigrant integration remains a paramount issue of interest to scholars and policy experts especially because of Canada’s adoption of immigration inflow as its principal population growth policy. Within the broader context of immigrant integration, adequate housing of immigrants is an important marker of integration; justified by the many benefits associated with it including improvement in children’s educational outcomes, enhancement of employment stability and enhancement of both physical and mental health, among others. However, a corollary of increasing number of immigrants is participation in various transnational fields — a globally ubiquitous phenomenon. Understanding transnational engagements — such as remittances and investment in transnational housing projects — may offer further insights to broader integration patterns and housing integration in particular. Yet, scholars tend to ignore this potential link between immigrant housing integration and transnational engagements in efforts at explaining immigrant housing integration. The desire of nations to achieve integration within national borders seems to have set the agenda for research leading to a situation where researchers focus narrowly on activities strictly within host societies (e. g. Canada) in their attempts to offer understanding and solutions for immigrant integration challenges. Consequently, the frameworks and methodologies employed for this agenda ignore transnational connections and associated activities. To address this concern, this dissertation proposed that the theoretical framework for examining immigrant housing experiences in Canada should include transnational behaviour of immigrants. Four manuscripts addressing separate but related research objectives are used to indicate the relevance of incorporating transnational lenses in immigrant housing integration. The objectives of the dissertation were to: (1) examine the impacts of remittance behaviour on housing ownership over time; (2) examine the impacts of remittance behaviour on <b>timing</b> of <b>housing</b> ownership; (3) explore the impact of transnational housing investment on housing ownership status; and (4) investigate the motivations for transnational housing investment in areas of origin and its impacts on housing consumption choices in Canada. The dissertation adopts a mixed-methods approach drawing on quantitative data from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants in Canada (LSIC) and a survey among Ghanaian immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), as well as qualitative data from in-depth interviews (IDIs) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) among Ghanaian immigrants in the GTA. Whilst the LSIC data made it possible for the investigation of relationships between immigrant homeownership and remittance engagement behaviours at a much broader national scale, the survey data allowed for the investigation of relationships between homeownership and a specific type of transnational engagement not captured in LSIC (i. e. transnational housing investments). Descriptive, bivariate and multivariate regression modelling techniques were employed in quantitative data analysis whilst thematic coding was employed in qualitative data analysis. Results from quantitative data analysis show a relationship between homeownership status in Canada and immigrant transnational engagements (i. e. both remittance and transnational housing investment behaviours). For example, among the broader immigrant population, participation in remittance resulted in lower odds of homeownership at two discrete time periods. However, further investigation based on continuous time showed that immigrants who remit above the median remittance amount tend to attain homeownership faster. The survey among Ghanaian immigrants in the GTA showed that those who had on-going transnational housing projects (which involve regular remittance) had higher odds of homeownership in Canada. Results from in-depth interviews and FGDs show that engagement in transnational housing activities results in several constraints in choices in Canada including the decision to buy a house as well as rental dwelling types and neighbourhood choices. Overall, the findings demonstrate a relationship between housing outcomes in Canada and engagement in transnational activities. The findings were in agreement with existing literature outside immigrant housing integration such as transnational entrepreneurship and political participation which show {{that it is possible to}} keep strong transnational ties and still achieve integration in destination areas. These findings make a strong case for the inclusion of transnational perspectives in attempts at understanding immigrant integration as a whole and housing integration in particular. Regardless of the connections found between housing outcomes in Canada and transnational behaviours, certain nuances emerged from the separate manuscripts. For example, although results from analysing homeownership at discrete time points show that participation in remittances resulted in lower odds of homeownership, results from analysing homeownership in continuous time demonstrated that immigrants who remitted above the median amount entered ownership at a faster rate. This suggests that participation in remittance per se might not be the reason for the finding. The nuances from these exploratory investigations calls for further studies using a transnational perspective to establish a more concrete picture of the relationship between housing integration and transnational engagements...|$|R
40|$|A set {{of studies}} was {{designed}} {{in order to}} better understand the exposure of horses in Canada to Ixodes-borne diseases, namely equine granulocytic anaplasmosis (EGA, caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum) and Lyme borreliosis (LB, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi). In the first study, equine serum samples submitted to veterinary diagnostic laboratories in SK, MB and ON were tested for antibodies against A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi, using the point-of-care SNAP® 4 Dx® ELISA. Horses seropositive to EGA were found in SK and MB and horses seropositive to LB were found in SK, MB and ON. Overall seroprevalence according to the SNAP® 4 Dx® ELISA was 0. 53 % for EGA and 1. 6 % for LB. Samples that tested positive for antibodies against A. phagocytophilum (n= 2) and B. burgdorferi (n= 6) by SNAP® 4 Dx® ELISA and 2 randomly selected subsets of samples that tested negative (n= 92 each) were then re-tested using currently recommended serologic methods, and test results were compared. A lack of agreement was found between the SNAP® 4 Dx® ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) for EGA (McNemar test p = 0. 000001). Agreement of the SNAP® 4 Dx® ELISA and ELISA confirmed with Western Blot (WB) for LB was only fair (Kappa 0. 23). Due to the lack of agreement between serologic tests for EGA and LB in the first study, another study to further evaluate the agreement among available serologic tests was conducted. A set of 50 convenience serum samples submitted to the veterinary diagnostic laboratory in SK was tested by SNAP® 4 Dx® Plus ELISA for antibodies against A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi. Samples were also tested by IFA for antibodies against A. phagocytophilum in two referral laboratories, and by IFA, ELISA confirmed with WB and Equine Lyme multiplex assay for antibodies against B. burgdorferi in three referral laboratories. Again, test results varied between the different tests. For EGA, all 3 pair-wise test comparisons lacked agreement. For LB, agreement between tests ranged from poor to fair. Differences in test methodology and antigens used, cut-off settings between the laboratories and false positive or false negative results are likely the cause for the different assessment of the same sample as seropositive or seronegative. In the third study, the goal was to describe potential risk factors for exposure of horses in Canada to EGA and LB. Management factors in horses that tested seropositive or seronegative for EGA or LB, respectively, in the previous studies were evaluated. Horse owners were surveyed with regard to their horses’ signalment, <b>timing</b> of pasture <b>housing,</b> and province of residence, travel history, tick infestation history, history of Lyme vaccination and history of previously diagnosed tick-borne disease. Response rate (11. 5 %) and the number of seropositive horses available for evaluation were low, which precluded statistical analysis. The majority of seropositive horses resided in SK, was pastured in the fall, did not have a recent travel history and had not had visible tick infestation. These observations supported exposure of horses to tick-borne diseases within Canada. Potential risk factors require further investigation. As information about tick infestation in horses is scarce in general, a passive surveillance study of horse ticks in SK was conducted in 2012 and 2013. A total of 833 ticks from over 86 horses were received. All ticks were Dermacentor species, i. e. D. albipictus, D. andersoni and D. variabilis. D. albipictus ticks were mostly received in February and March, D. andersoni mainly in April and June and D. variabilis mostly in May and June. Geographic distribution of the species in SK was similar to that previously reported based on active and passive surveillance. No Ixodes species were received...|$|R
