5|$|The fleet {{departed}} Anjadip {{and arrived}} in Calicut on 13 September. Cabral successfully {{negotiated with the}} Zamorin (the title of <b>the</b> <b>ruler</b> <b>of</b> Calicut) and obtained permission to establish a factory and a warehouse. In hopes of further improving relations, Cabral dispatched his men on several military missions at the Zamorin's request. However, on 16 or 17 December, the factory suffered a surprise attack by some 300 (according to other accounts, {{perhaps as many as}} several thousand) Muslim Arabs and Hindu Indians. Despite a desperate defense by crossbowmen, more than 50 Portuguese were killed. The remaining defenders retreated to the ships, some by swimming. Thinking that the attack was the result of unauthorized incitement by jealous Arab merchants, Cabral waited 24 hours for an explanation from <b>the</b> <b>ruler</b> <b>of</b> Calicut, but no apology was forthcoming.|$|E

Furthermore, Bolesław, who already had two wives, wanted to marry Predslava, one of Vladimir's daughters, in order to cement ties between the two families. Despite Bolesław's best efforts, the offer was refused and instead he had to accept a less prestigious connection {{to the house of}} Vladimir through the marriage of Bolesław's daughter to Vladimir's son, Sviatopolk. Between 1005 and 1013, Vladimir arranged Sviatopolk's marriage to Bolesław's daughter, whose name has not survived in sources.|$|E

Soon after he came to Edirne, he was captured at the sultan's command. He was held in captivity in Gallipoli.|$|E

50|$|Irrespective of the {{assertion}} that the place has seen continuous human habitation since ancient times, for many scholars and historians, the place was a vast wilderness almost till early medieval times. During the later medieval times, the Kingdom of Ranpur was established. <b>The</b> <b>rulers</b> <b>of</b> Ranpur were in continuous battle with <b>the</b> <b>rulers</b> <b>of</b> surrounding small kingdoms.

5|$|By {{the time}} Bhimsen came to power, the {{territory}} of Nepal extended up to the border of Garhwal in the west. During the reign of Bahadur Shah, Nepal had concluded a treaty with Garhwal demanding that it pay NRs. 9,000 per year. Later Rana Bahadur Shah reduced it to NRs. 3,000. However, in 1804, Garhwal refused to pay the amount upon which Bhimsen sent an army {{under the command of}} Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa (not to be confused with his father), Bhakti Thapa and Hasti Dal Shah to attack Garhwal. The army succeeded in annexing Garhwal to Nepalese territory extending {{the territory of}} Nepal up to the Sutlej river in the west. After the annexation of Garhwal, the Nepalese army attacked the fort of Kangra but was defeated by the combined army of Sansar Chand, <b>the</b> <b>ruler</b> <b>of</b> Kangra, and that of Ranjeet Singh, <b>the</b> <b>ruler</b> <b>of</b> Punjab. Other states like Salyan were also annexed to Nepal during his rule. Before the Anglo-Nepalese War, the territory of Nepal extended from Sutlej river in the west to Teesta river in the east. Most of this territory, however, was lost in the Anglo-Nepalese War. In 1811, Bhimsen was given the title of General, thus enjoying a dual position of Mukhtiyar and General.|$|E

Domnall's mother was Mór, {{daughter}} of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, King of Dublin and the Isles, which may have given Domnall a stake to the kingship of the Isles.|$|E

5|$|From Kilwa Kisiwani, {{the fleet}} {{departed}} to Malindi, which was reached on 2 August. Cabral met with its king, {{with whom he}} established friendly relations and exchanged gifts.

5|$|George IV came to {{the throne}} in 1820 {{intending}} to create a set of royal palaces that reflected his wealth and influence as <b>the</b> <b>ruler</b> <b>of</b> an increasingly powerful Britain. George's previous houses, Carlton House and the Brighton Pavilion were too small for grand court events, even after expensive extensions. George expanded the Royal Lodge in the castle park whilst he was Prince Regent, and then began a programme of work to modernise the castle itself once he became king.|$|E
