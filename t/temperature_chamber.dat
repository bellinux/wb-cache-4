The second phase of training, lasting nearly 3 years involves extensive training in piloting the Shenzhou vehicle in nominal and emergency modes. The third and final stage of training is mission specific training, and lasts approximately 10 months. During this phase of training, astronauts are trained in the high fidelity Shenzhou trainer, as well as the Neutral Buoyancy Facility located at the Astronaut Center of China (ACC), in Beijing.

Forty-eight rabbits from the Botucatu genetic group, weaned at 35 d of age, were housed at low density (1, 500 cm 2), four per cage, in wire net cages up to 10 weeks of age.

These estimates were on average {{a factor of}} 2. 7 times higher in summer than winter. The known effects of wind speed and temperature on mass transfer coefficients could not account for this observation. Sampling rates are often derived using ambient temperatures, not the actual <b>temperatures</b> within deployment <b>chambers.</b> If deployment <b>chamber</b> <b>temperatures</b> are in fact higher than ambient temperatures, estimated sampler-air partition coefficients would be greater than actual partition coefficients resulting in an overestimation of PRC derived sampling rates. Sampling rates determined under measured ambient temperatures and estimated deployment <b>chamber</b> <b>temperatures</b> in summer ranged from 7. 1 to 10 m 3 day− 1 and 2. 2 – 6. 8 m 3 day− 1 respectively.

40|$|Nuclear {{propulsion}} {{has been}} identified as one of the key technologies needed for human exploration of the Moon and Mars. The Nuclear Thermal Rocket (NTR) uses a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to a high temperature followed by expansion through a conventional convergent-divergent nozzle. A parametric study of NTR nozzles was performed using the Rocket Engine Design Expert System (REDES) at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The REDES used the JANNAF standard rigorous methodology to determine nozzle performance over a range of <b>chamber</b> <b>temperatures,</b> <b>chamber</b> pressures, thrust levels, and different nozzle configurations. A design condition was set by fixing the propulsion system exit radius at five meters and throat radius was varied to achieve a target thrust level. An adiabatic wall was assumed for the nozzle, and its length was assumed to be 80 percent of a 15 degree cone. The results conclude that although the performance of the NTR, based on infinite reaction rates, looks promising at low chamber pressures, finite rate chemical reactions will cause the actual performance to be considerably lower. Parameters which have a major influence on the delivered specific impulse value include the <b>chamber</b> <b>temperature</b> and the <b>chamber</b> pressures in the high thrust domain. Other parameters, such as 2 -D and boundary layer effects, kinetic rates, and number of nozzles, affect the deliverable performance of an NTR nozzle to a lesser degree.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the effect on performance and <b>chamber</b> <b>temperature</b> of adding hydrogen to a propellant system. The systems investigated are: (1) RFNA-Aniline (2) Nitromethane (3) Anhydrous hydrazene-liquid oxygen Since a systematic investigation of the performance parameters of the RFNA-Aniline system {{over a wide range}} of mixture ratios has never been made, it was decided to make these calculations, in addition to the investigations stated above. The results of the calculations can best be summarized by a study of the figures {{at the end of the}} thesis. A few generalizations can be made. The effect of adding hydrogen in small quantities to a high temperature system is to increase the performance considerably without too much change in the <b>chamber</b> <b>temperature.</b> As more hydrogen is added, the percentage increase in performance. If hydrogen is added in large quantities, both the performance curve (effective exhaust velocity) and the <b>chamber</b> <b>temperature</b> curve flatten out. The behavior discussed above is characteristic of hot propellant systems such as RFNA-Aniline and anhydrous hydrazene. In a low temperature system, such as nitromethane, the effect is quite different. The addition of hydrogen in small quantities causes a rapid decrease in <b>chamber</b> <b>temperature,</b> but the increase in performance is considerably less on a percentage basis.
