5|$|Justice Powell, {{after setting}} forth {{the facts of}} the case, {{discussed}} and found it unnecessary to decide whether Bakke had a private right of action under <b>Title</b> <b>VI,</b> assuming that was so for purposes of the case. He then discussed the scope of <b>Title</b> <b>VI,</b> opining that it barred only those racial classifications forbidden by the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled in}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978) {{that affirmative action}} {{in the form of}} racial quotas in public {{university}} admissions was a violation of <b>Title</b> <b>VI</b> of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or <b>Title</b> <b>VI.</b> In Gratz v. Bollinger (2003) and Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In Gratz, the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in Grutter, the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In Fisher v. University of Texas (2013), the Court ruled that before race {{can be used in a}} public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous examples of linguistic prejudice, linguistic discrimination involves the actual treatment of individuals based on use of language.

There are state laws that also address the protection of non-native speakers, such as the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.

25|$|Alexandros Panagoulis {{was brutally}} {{tortured}} during his incarceration by the junta.
