The effect of external air flow on <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> was simulated in a subsonic wind-tunnel. By numerically evaluating the known equations for field-incidence <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> of single-walled panels {{in a computer}} program, {{a comparison of the}} theory with the test results was made. As a further extension to aircraft fuselage simulation, equations for the field-incidence <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> of a double-walled panel were derived. Flow is shown to provide a small increase in <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> for a flat panel. Curvature is shown to increase <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> for low frequencies, while also providing a sharp decrease in <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> at the ring frequency of the cylindrical panel.

40|$|A Helmholtz {{resonator}} with {{flexible plate}} attenuates noise in exhaust ducts, and the <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> function quantifies {{the amount of}} filtered noise at a desired frequency. In this work the <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> is maximized (optimized) by allowing the resonator end plate thickness to vary for two cases: 1) a nonoptimized baseline resonator, and 2) a resonator with a uniform flexible endplate that was previously optimized for <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> and resonator size. To accomplish this, receptance coupling techniques were used to couple a finite element model of a varying thickness resonator end plate to a mass-spring-damper model of the vibrating air mass in the resonator. Sequential quadratic programming was employed to complete a gradient based optimization search. By allowing the end plate thickness to vary, the <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> of the non-optimized baseline resonator was improved significantly, 28 percent.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a systematic numerical {{investigation of the}} sound <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> through a multilayer system consisting of a bagged gas and lightweight panel. The goal {{of the study is}} to better understand the effect of the gas on <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> and determine whether a gas with a slow speed of sound is beneficial for noise control applications. As part of the study, the density and speed of sound of the gas are varied independently {{to assess the impact of}} each on <b>transmission</b> <b>loss.</b> Results show that near grazing incidence the plane wave <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> through the multilayer system is more sensitive to the speed of sound than the density of the gas. In addition, it was found that a slow wave speed in the bagged gas provides more low-frequency <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> benefit than a fast wave speed. At low angles of incidence, close to the plate normal, the benefit is due to the reduction of the characteristic impedance of the gas. At high angles of incidence, the benefit is attributed to the fact that the incident waves at the air/gas interface are bent towards the surface normal. Since <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> is angle dependent, refraction in the slow gas layer results in a significant improvement in the <b>transmission</b> <b>loss</b> at high angles of incidence...|$|R
