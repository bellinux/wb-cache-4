Akshaya is a female character {{with a firm}} personality, and belongs to the band although she often acts as an antepole in regard to Costello. In a certain sense she represents the matriarchal form of governance by daring <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> the alpha and making her own decisions.|$|E
5|$|He {{served on}} the boards of the Electricity Trust and the Housing Trust, among others. Here, unused to not being in {{absolute}} control, and having little specific scientific knowledge, he occasionally stumbled in his decisions. This also created difficulties with the other board members, who were reluctant <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> their former boss, regardless of their expertise. But his thrift, a theme throughout his Premiership, did not abate; he was constantly forcing the trusts to use cost-saving methods and old vehicles for their work. This extended to his family property; he vigorously opposed his son's desire to install a new irrigation system in the orchard.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> this view.|$|E

5|$|After McKinley {{was assassinated}} in September 1901, Long {{had a change of}} heart, and {{tendered}} his resignation to President Roosevelt on May 1, 1902. The exact reasons for this are unclear, but several factors probably contributed. First, Roosevelt had a close relationship with Long's political rival Lodge, was known <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> Long on naval matters, and was not welcoming of his presence at the White House. Second, an inquiry into the actions of Admiral Winfield Scott Schley around the July 1898 Battle of Santiago de Cuba had resulted in a significant amount of criticism of Long's role in the war. Third, one of his daughters died in October 1901, {{less than a month after}} McKinley's assassination. These matters drove Long into a depression, and the situation was further exacerbated when Roosevelt squabbled with him over the beginning of the war, and then made newsworthy overrides of some of his decisions. Historian Wendell Garrett notes that Roosevelt took a great personal interest in the Navy, and had difficulty working with subsequent secretaries.|$|E
5|$|By noon, the Lithuanians {{received}} a reply from Moscow stating that Raštikis {{was not a}} suitable candidate for Prime Minister. The selection of another candidate would be supervised by Molotov's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov. Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister. Smetona, who continued <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> {{the majority of his}} government, decided to leave the country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting President. By late evening on June 15, Smetona and Minister of Defense Kazys Musteikis reached Kybartai and crossed the border into Germany, where they were granted temporary asylum. The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass; thus, Smetona had to wade across the shallow Liepona rivulet. Smetona′s departure worked to the Soviets′ advantage; its indignity opened him to ridicule {{and they were able to}} exploit the sentiments against him without fearing that he would be seen as a martyr. By fleeing, Smetona escaped the fate of Latvian President Kārlis Ulmanis and Estonian President Konstantin Päts, who were manipulated by the Soviets and later arrested. Under the Lithuanian constitution, Merkys became acting president.|$|E
5|$|The Orkneyinga saga relates how {{after the}} death of Earl Hákon Pálsson, his sons, Haraldr Hákonsson, and Páll Hákonsson, divided the earldom between themselves. However, the half-brothers soon began <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> one another, and their vassals divided into {{competing}} factions. The saga relates how one day Frakökk, and her sister Helga (mother of Earl Haraldr), were sewing a snow-white garment embroidered with gold. This garment was enchanted, and the two sisters had intended it for Earl Haraldr's half-brother, Earl Páll. Unfortunately for the sisters, Earl Haraldr noticed the beautiful garment and, despite their protestations, put the garment on and soon after died. The saga states that Earl Páll immediately took control of his deceased half-brother's possessions, and that he was highly suspicious of the two sisters. In consequence, Frakökk and Helga were no longer welcome in the earldom, and they left for Caithness, and from there move to Sutherland where Frakökk had an estate. In time, several of Frakökk's descendants were brought up in Sutherland—including her daughter, Steinnvör 'the Stout', and grandson, Ölvir.|$|E

50|$|On October 21, the Maine State Chamber of Commerce {{announced}} {{its opposition to}} the Question, due <b>to</b> <b>disagreeing</b> <b>with</b> its funding mechanism of eliminating corporate tax breaks. Chamber President Dana Connors stated that Maine's business incentive programs are modest {{and it would be}} difficult and harm the state's business climate to eliminate any of them. The opposition was notable it that it was not based on ideological opposition to public financing of campaigns as with other opponents.|$|R

50|$|Some junior leagues, {{like the}} Greater Metro Junior A Hockey League and {{formerly}} the Manitoba Major Junior Hockey League operate outside {{the jurisdiction of}} Hockey Canada. These leagues usually appear {{for a variety of}} reasons, ranging from <b>disagreeing</b> <b>with</b> the new Canadian Development Model implemented in 2005 <b>to</b> <b>disagreeing</b> <b>with</b> various zoning restrictions or anger over player raiding by other leagues. In the summer of 2009, Hockey Canada told players {{that they would have to}} choose to play within Hockey Canada or outside of Hockey Canada by September 30 of each playing year. At the end of each playing year the player has the right to apply to reenter Hockey Canada if they played in an independent league.|$|R
50|$|The {{possibility}} of Sudharmono becoming Vice President displeased many in ABRI. Although Sudharmono {{had been an}} Army man himself and had ended {{his career with the}} rank of Lieutenant General, he had spent most of his career behind a desk instead of commanding troops. For this, he was looked down upon by ABRI. Suharto was aware of this and before ABRI could do anything, replaced Benny Moerdani with Try Sutrisno as ABRI Commander. This move crippled ABRI as Moerdani was more assertive when it comes <b>to</b> <b>disagreeing</b> <b>with</b> Suharto while Try, having been Suharto's aide-de-camp would be more passive.|$|R

50|$|Fiske was invited, but {{declined}} to lead the bobsled team in the 1936 Winter Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany.

25|$|Richthofen and Sperrle made an {{effective}} team in Spain. Sperrle was an experienced officer and was intelligent, {{with a good}} reputation. Richthofen was considered a good leader in combat. They combined <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> Franco {{on a number of}} topics and debates could become heated. Both men were blunt, and although the Germans and Spanish did not like each other, they had a healthy respect which translated into {{an effective}} working relationship. Richthofen even learned a little Spanish and Italian, an effort appreciated by the Nationalist officers.|$|E
25|$|Marx did not study {{directly}} with Hegel, but after Hegel died Marx studied {{under one of}} Hegel's pupils, Bruno Bauer, {{a leader of the}} circle of Young Hegelians to whom Marx attached himself. However, Marx and Engels came <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> Bruno Bauer {{and the rest of the}} Young Hegelians about socialism and also about the usage of Hegel's dialectic. Having achieved his thesis on the Difference of natural philosophy between Democritus and Epicurus in 1841, the young Marx progressively broke away with the Prussian university and its teachings impregnated by German Idealism (Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel).|$|E
25|$|His exact date {{of birth}} is not known, but he was baptised on 16 July 1820 as Christopher Green to William and Mary Green at Upwell, close to Wisbech and the Isle of Ely in the Fenlands of the Norfolk/Cambridgeshire borders. There is nothing in later records <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> 1820 being his year of birth. His 1874 {{obituary}} writer, styling himself as 'The Sportsman', tells of him learning to ride {{at a very early}} age 'whipped in to his father' who hunted a pack of harriers across the 'enormous Fen drains'.

25|$|Even {{before the}} Liberals' second electoral {{victory in the}} 1997 election, there was much {{speculation}} {{in the media and}} in Ottawa that Martin was after Chrétien's job and wanted to force the Prime Minister to retire. As the Liberals emerged with a smaller majority government after the 1997 election, though it was unlikely that any opposition party could pose a serious challenge, Martin began to gain support from those who began <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> Chrétien. Chrétien, however, resolved to stay on after the Liberals were re-elected in 2000, having regained much of the ground lost in 1997. By this time, Martin had gained control of much of the party machinery.|$|E

Humanistic Judaism holds that the Torah is a historical, political, and sociological text, but does not believe that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct. Humanistic Judaism is willing to question the Torah and <b>to</b> <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> it, believing that the entire Jewish experience, not just the Torah, should be the source for Jewish behavior and ethics.|$|E
