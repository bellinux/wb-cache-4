5|$|Meanwhile, Maddy {{receives}} {{a visit from}} Dan Clifford, who she has not seen for over 18 months since he took his job abroad. After hearing about Maddy's attack he has arrived <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> is doing and to offer her a research position with him at his new hospital. Maddy decides to try for the position at Holby before making any decisions.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, it was hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy {{for women}} has its hardships. Women lock {{themselves}} {{away in the}} woods inside a hut to keep pregnancy localized, only mothers and grandmothers see the women during labor <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> is doing. Pregnant women {{have to deal with}} the pregnancy with the help of other women while the men go along their day like nothing else is happening. They are more pleased with the birth of a girl than that of a boy. The reason being is for the sake of multiplication, in other words, even though women are sent away for their pregnancy, they are given more praise for women being born.|$|E
50|$|Hermanni is {{especially}} fond of his dear old {{mother and the}} pancakes with strawberries she makes, and he often phones her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she's</b> doing. Hermanni's telephone is a large, complex contraption with its own video communications screen. Because the show predates actually feasible real-world video communication {{by more than a}} decade, this only adds to the comedy.|$|R
60|$|I was {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> moved <b>she</b> was. She went on laying the table, but her hands trembled.|$|R
60|$|Captain Willoughby {{understood}} his son; he glanced towards his unconscious wife, as if <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> far <b>she</b> felt with him.|$|R
500|$|These {{performances}} {{were not enough}} to gain selection in the Test and one-day series against India held in Adelaide immediately after the WNCL. However, Poulton was called up for her senior international debut against New Zealand in the Rose Bowl series staged at Allan Border Field in Brisbane {{at the start of}} the 2006–07 season because of an injury to fellow New South Wales batsman Alex Blackwell. The chairman of selectors Margaret Jennings said [...] "She is a talented player with a free-flowing game, and we are keen <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> performs against New Zealand, whom we expect to provide some very tough competition." [...] Poulton played in all of the matches. She made 10 in her Twenty20 international debut and the match ended in a tie.|$|E
500|$|Yahoo! Voices {{wrote that}} Stevens [...] {{in the third}} season [...] "has become more condescending and passive {{aggressive}} herself, more than anyone else." [...] Heigl was critical of her character's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George, which she deemed [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would love <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.|$|E
500|$|Kanami Sekiguchi {{was chosen}} as the {{character}} designer after Horikawa took notice of her work as the animation director of episode nine of Angel Beats!, and Toba was eager <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> would render Na-Ga's original designs. When it came time to choose an art director, Kazuki Higashiji was chosen for his zeal in the workplace and Horikawa's confidence in his artistic talent; Higashiji had also been the art director for Angel Beats!. Similarly, Satoki Iida was brought back to work on Charlotte again as the sound and music director, and he also helped with the proofreading of the script as he had done for Angel Beats!. Iida was largely chosen for his good communication with Maeda, and so that he could make the best use of his experience working on Angel Beats!. When writing the music for How-Low-Hello, Maeda reused some older songs he had composed as a student in the 1990s that he felt were selective of his best songs from that period. At the time, his concept when composing the songs was [...] "early B'z", but Maeda notes that this is no longer the case with the completed songs.|$|E
50|$|After the party, everyone’s a bit giddy - even Nikki. When Helen comes <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she’s</b> {{settling}} into her new enhanced cell, Nikki risks flirting {{with her and}} telling her <b>how</b> gorgeous <b>she</b> is. Helen is flustered and quickly leaves. When Justin asks her {{to go for a}} drink, she's grateful of the diversion. Fenner and Sylvia look on with amusement, confident that she won't be lasting much longer in the job.|$|R
50|$|After this round, {{the mothers}} opened the files. Lorraine chose Michelle. Esther chose Lauren in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> good <b>she</b> was. Khalood chose Brittany.|$|R
5000|$|Ansiedad has {{boarded a}} bus to New York, only to be stopped by her mother, who was told about Ansiedad's actions by the English teacher. Ansiedad and Grace fight but Grace stops Ansiedad by saying, [...] "I don't want what {{happened}} to your friend to happen to you". Ansiedad asks what happened, and Grace says that Tavita took weight pills and almost died. Ansiedad and Grace hug each other and wait at Tavita's house <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she's</b> doing.|$|R
2500|$|Trinny and Susannah {{then take}} their pink box {{in search of}} older women {{to talk about their}} clothing. They find that many of them feel a lack of {{confidence}} and hide themselves behind clothing, and do not have any knowledge of what to wear. Then the process of Susannah being aged through prosthetics begins. To give an accurate depiction of how Susannah would look at the age of 70 years, a plastic surgeon and prosthetic expert take details of her lifestyle and examine past pictures <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> is aging. When the face mask and body suit are fitted, Susannah is clearly distressed and states [...] "There is no way I'm going to look like this when I'm 70. I will not dress like this and I will not allow my face to become like this." [...] An elderly woman, Shirly Tripe, then takes Susannah shopping to find her some clothing from her own favourite shops. Susannah comments on Shirley's choice: [...] "It's a sack. This is a testament that older women, or mature women, benefit so much from tailoring." [...] Susannah then meets a shocked Trinny with her new appearance. The two fashionistas then aim to tackle what they believe older women should avoid; wearing loose fitting clothes. They take Shirley shopping to get some tighter fitting clothes, although Shirley shows much resistance and claims she looks like 'mutton dressed as lamb'.|$|E
2500|$|On May 12, 2011, Hilton {{opened her}} third {{store in the}} Philippines. The store, in the Abreeza Mall in Davao City, {{featured}} bags, earrings, wallets, belts, caps and perfumes. On June 1, she returned to reality television in Oxygen's The World According to Paris. The show, which followed her daily life, attracted 409,000 viewers. It was not a success, however, {{which led to a}} belief that Hilton's popularity was fading. The New York Times wrote that she [...] "is an attractive woman with proven talent for marketing and self-promotion, though as a reality heroine she seems a little passé—a Sony Walkman in an iPod era, a Friendster in the age of Facebook or, to put it in context, a single-process blonde in a triple-process world", also saying that she [...] "appears to have plenty of boyfriends, present and ex. Paparazzi still snap her picture. But it's hard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> can recapture the kind of audience she enjoyed in her heyday—even by streaming her premiere live on Facebook". Hilton appeared on the show with her boyfriend, Las Vegas nightclub owner Cy Waits, with whom she broke up in June. She was labeled a [...] "Billion Dollar Entrepreneur" [...] by Variety magazine, and was featured on its cover. Hilton opened her fourth store in the Philippines on August 18, 2011. In September she introduced a footwear line in Istanbul; a Paris Hilton store opened in India, with plans for eight more. Hilton modeled for designer Andre Tan during Ukraine Fashion Week in October 2011.|$|E

60|$|It was glorious <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> easily <b>she</b> {{seized a}} heavy {{dumb-bell}} and swung it above her head. The {{front line of}} her body was majestic as she stood thus.|$|R
60|$|Although {{with her}} infallible {{instinct}} Mrs. Small {{had said the}} very thing to make her guest 'more intriguee than ever,' it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> else <b>she</b> could truthfully have spoken.|$|R
60|$|Then, just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> far <b>she</b> would go, perhaps desperately {{hoping she}} would make me hate her, I {{followed}} her shamelessly from patio to parlor, porch to court, even to the waltz.|$|R
60|$|I was {{following}} the Vice-Warden, but, on second thoughts, went after my Lady, being curious <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> would manage to keep the children out of sight.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Ain't {{wrapping}} up the music again, are you, Marilla?' I asks. 'What's {{the matter with}} {{just a couple of}} tunes for <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> goes under the saddle?' ...|$|E
60|$|The next day, Rectus and I, with Corny and Mrs. Chipperton, {{walked down}} to the queen's house, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> fared and what could be done for her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's {{sitting in}} her room, reading. She's been reading all day. Heaven only knows <b>how</b> <b>she</b> can do it. I tried, and all the letters swam before my eyes. It drives me mad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> calm <b>she</b> is.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{laugh at}} her for that, the darling! I do delight in her, after all. It warms even my old blood <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> {{thoroughly}} <b>she</b> knows her business, and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> enjoys it, like a true daughter of Eve.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Fanny {{brought out}} her [...] "rags" [...] and was {{astonished}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> many <b>she</b> had, for chair, sofa, bed, and bureau were covered, and still Maud, who was burrowing in the closets, kept crying, [...] "Here 's another." ...|$|R
60|$|Henry {{paused and}} glanced at his sister <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> had taken the unwelcome announcement. Even {{in the dim light}} he caught some of the anguish in her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] said Miss West, in {{the pause}} I {{permitted}} in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> {{had received the}} thought. [...] "We also have gazed often at the stars." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} better, David; but it were best <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> goes on. It may be, as you say, {{that she will}} shortly gain her {{strength}} and spirits again." ...|$|E
60|$|Ruth {{said no more}} on the subject, {{but went}} about her work as quietly and orderly as usual, and Margaret Carne was {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> bravely <b>she</b> held up, for {{she knew that she}} must be suffering greatly.|$|R
60|$|When it was ended she {{had ceased}} weeping, though Eustace {{said it was}} piteous <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> changed <b>she</b> was, and the startled {{pleading}} look in the dark eyes that used {{to look at him}} with such confiding love.|$|R
5000|$|For this task, Lord Sugar {{evened out}} the teams by having Selina move over to Versatile. On Why I Fired Them {{he claimed that}} this had been deliberate, mainly <b>to</b> test <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> good <b>she</b> and Charleine worked {{together}} on the task.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, very much!' said Emily. 'Mrs. Weston is {{very fond}} of the garden, and drives about in the pony-carriage, and it is quite {{pleasant}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> admires the views.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Theodora {{is so much}} hurt!' pleaded Violet; 'you will be {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>she</b> is scorched! Such arms and hands, that she cannot help herself--and she wants cold applications continually.' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{girl was}} too {{sensible}} of her circumstances {{not to give}} all possible satisfaction of that kind, and indeed she was mistress of too much understanding not <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> much <b>she</b> should be obliged to that part for her own interest.|$|R
