50|$|In late 1962 {{and early}} 1963, Hepler tested the newly {{developed}} procedure using a glutaraldehyde pre-fix {{followed by an}} osmium post-fix to study plant cell structure using an electron microscope. Building on the earlier work by Sinnott and Bloch, who had shown that wounding the existing <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> in a Coleus stem induced neighboring parenchyma cells to differentiate into new <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements,</b> Hepler showed that cytoplasmic microtubules were localized specifically in the cortical cytoplasm immediately over the bands of new secondary wall thickenings. Moreover, Hepler discovered that the microtubules were oriented parallel to the cellulose microfibrils of the newly formed secondary wall thickenings. This work, along with the studies of Ledbetter and Porter and Green established the importance of cortical microtubules in controlling the alignment of cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall. Further work with Barry Palevitz showed that microtubules were involved in orienting the cellulose microfibrils in the walls of guard cells in a pattern of radial micellation that is necessary for stomatal function. Hepler, along with {{the husband and wife}} team of Dale Callaham and Sue Lancelle, developed a method to achieve rapid freeze fixation of particularly small plant cells that showed that cortical microtubules are closely associated with one another, actin microfilaments, the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tracheary</b> <b>element</b> {{formation}} from isolated Zinnia leaf mesophyll {{cells is}} an excellent system for the dissection of patterned secondary cell wall thickening and lignification. We used mRNAs from cells cultured for 48 h in the induction medium to isolate differentially regulated genes. Thirteen unique cDNA clones were isolated using a subtractive hybridization method. These clones {{can be divided into}} three distinct groups according to their characteristic gene expression in different media. The first group includes those genes whose expression is induced in the basal medium without 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and benzyladenine; this indicates that the expression of these genes is regulated by chemical and physical factors other than these hormones. Three of these clones, p 48 h- 229, p 48 h- 114, and p 48 h- 102, show significant homology to a pathogenesis-related protein II, a serine proteinase inhibitor, and a sunflower anther-specific proline-rich protein, respectively. The second group includes those genes whose expression is mainly NAA induced. One of these clones, p 48 h- 10, shows high protein sequence homology to a barley aleurone-specific cDNA, B 11 E. The p 48 h- 10 -encoded protein shares some common characteristics of plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (low molecular weight, the secretion signal peptide, eight conserved cysteine residues, and a basic protein), although no significant protein sequence homology is found between p 48 - 10 and other plant nonspecific lipid transfer proteins. The third group includes those genes whose expression is induced primarily in the induction medium; this indicates that the expression of these genes is closely associated with the process of <b>tracheary</b> <b>element</b> formation. Two of these clones, p 48 h- 107 and p 48 h- 17, show high homology to adenylate kinase and papaya proteinase I, respectively.

40|$|Xylem vessel {{elements}} are hollow cellular units that assemble end-to-end {{to form a}} continuous vessel throughout the plant body; the xylem vessel is strengthened by the xylem elements' reinforced secondary cell walls (SCWs). This work aims to unravel the contribution of unknown actors in xylem vessel differentiation using the model in vitro cell culture system of Zinnia elegans differentiating cell cultures and the model in vivo system of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. <b>Tracheary</b> <b>Element</b> Differentiation-Related 6 (TED 6) and TED 7 were selected based on an RNA interference (RNAi) screen in the Zinnia system. RNAi reduction of TED 6 and 7 delayed <b>tracheary</b> <b>element</b> (TE) differentiation and co-overexpression of TED 6 and 7 increased TE differentiation in cultured Zinnia cells.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the substantial reductions in xylemic water flow occurring at veraison are due to physical disruption (breaking) of the xylem {{as a result of}} renewed berry growth. In a companion paper, evidence was presented {{that the vast majority of}} xylem <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> remained intact despite the growth of the berry, and it was proposed that existing <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> stretch to accommodate growth and that additional elements may also differentiate after veraison. Measurements of the intergyre distance of <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> in macerated tissue were used to test for stretching, and the numbers of <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> per vascular bundle and of branch points of the peripheral xylem network were analysed to test for continued differentiation from 18 to 120 [*]d after anthesis in Chardonnay berries. The distance between the epidermis and the vasculature increased substantially from pre- to post-veraison, potentially increasing the amount of skin available for analysis of compounds important for winemaking. <b>Tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> continued to differentiate within the existing vascular bundles throughout berry development. Additional vascular bundles also appeared until after veraison, thereby increasing the complexity of the peripheral vascular network. The results also confirmed that <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> stretched by ∼ 20 %, but this was not as much as that predicted based on the growth of the vascular diameter (40 %).

In Cyatheaceae and Dicksoniaceae, rhizome <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> are short, contorted, with numerous facets.

In Arabidopsis, <b>Tracheary</b> <b>Element</b> Differentiation Inhibitory Factor Receptor (TDR) and its ligand TDIF signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of procambial cell proliferation and inhibiting its differentiation into xylem cells.

Our in vitro biochemical studies indicate that the interactions between the ligands and the receptors at the C-terminal anchoring site provide conserved binding. While the binding interactions occurring at the N-terminal anchoring site dictate differential binding specificities between different ligands and receptors. Our studies will open different unknown avenues of TDR-TDIF signaling pathways that will enhance our knowledge in this field highlighting the receptor ligand interaction, receptor activation, signaling network, modes of action and will serve as a structure function relationship model between the ligand and the receptor for various similar leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) ...|$|R

40|$|During the {{development}} of many fleshy fruits, water flow becomes progressively more phloemic and less xylemic. In grape (Vitis vinifera L.), the current hypothesis to explain this change is that the <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> of the peripheral xylem break {{as a result of}} berry growth, rendering the xylem structurally discontinuous and hence non-functional. Recent work, however, has shown via apoplastic dye movement through the xylem of post-veraison berries that the xylem should remain structurally intact throughout berry development. To corroborate this, peripheral xylem structure in developing Chardonnay berries was investigated via maceration and plastic sectioning. Macerations revealed that, contrary to current belief, the xylem was comprised mostly of vessels with few tracheids. In cross-section, the <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> of the vascular bundles formed almost parallel radial files, with later formed elements toward the epidermis and earlier formed elements toward the centre of the berry.

When ice plant callus was grown in a modified Linsmaier-Bednar and Skoog culture medium containing no NaCl (control medium), up to 20 % of ice plant cells differentiated into <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> during in vitro culture. Close examination of callus tissues stained with potassium permanganate revealed that <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> were aggregated as discrete nodules. Some strikingly elongated <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> {{were found in the}} macerated tissues. Experimental results indicated that adding 200 mM NaCl to the control medium reversibly inhibited the formation of tracheary element in the halophytic cells. The rate of tracheary element formation increased accordingly as the rate of cell growth in control medium. In the presence of high salt, the degree of tracheary element differentation remained low through the growth cycle. The inhibitory effect of salt on tracheary element differentiation was overcome by adding 10 mg l(- 1) salicylic acid, a known signaling compound that induces a diverse group of defense-related genes, including genes involved in reinforcing the host cell wall. Furthermore, microscopic examination revealed that most <b>tracheary</b> <b>elements</b> formed under this treatment (200 mM NaCl plus 10 mg l(- 1) salicylic acid) were round shaped.
