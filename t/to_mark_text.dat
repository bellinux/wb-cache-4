40|$|Studies {{examining}} learners’ text marking displayed some limitations. First, for {{the most}} part these studies measured recall as a learning outcome. Very few studies measured inference and none measured transfer. Second, when describing marked text, these studies mainly used two categories: high and low level sentences, and main and subordinate ideas. This classification is insufficient to explore the relationship between learners’ text marking and expected learning outcomes. Third, studies providing instructions for learners on what and how much to mark geared learners towards one learning outcome; mostly recall, thus missed on capturing the effects of different prompts that direct learners’ expectations to more than one outcome. This research used nStudy, an online learning tool that allows learners <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>text</b> and logs detailed traces of marking, and provided a detailed description of what and how much learners’ marked, using a set of sentence identifiers, such as terms, explanations, main ideas, consequences…etc., when learners are requested to study for recall and transfer tasks. The study also tested the effect of learners’ marking on learners’ performance on recall and transfer tasks. Moreover, it examined the effect of showing learners examples of kinds of information relevant to answering recall or transfer test questions on learners’ performance. Findings reveal that recall and transfer prompts do have an effect on learners’ total marking and some of the categories learners choose to mark. Also, marking text related to recall/ transfer questions enhances learners’ performance on these tasks. Moreover, in transfer tasks, marking parts of text unrelated to transfer questions did enhance learners’ performance in those tasks. On the other hand, showing learners’ examples of kinds of information relevant to answering recall and transfer test questions do not have an effect on learners’ marking nor performance on transfer and recall tests. These findings suggest that the goal/reason learners have when they are marking affects their marking as well as their learning...|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of the Internet, illegal copying of electronic documents has become a growing problem. There is an increasing need of prevention in the field of pirate copying.

40|$|Opportunities for International Phonetic Alphabet {{application}} {{to the sounds of}} Lithuanian dialects The paper discusses the issues of transcription of Lithuanian dialects. It compares the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) with the characters of the currently popular font Palemonas. From the 20 th to the 21 st century, almost for a whole century, there has been a tradition in Lithuania <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>texts</b> of Lithuanian dialects using the so-called Copenhagen transcription that was adapted by Georg Gerullis. The established Lithuanian transcription system largely differs from those applied in other languages, even from the closest neighbours Latvians. Therefore, researchers are often confronted with the problems of comparing the research results of several languages. In the 21 st century the issues of different transcriptions became more relevant after quantitative measurements of language variance became popular. They are usually made by computer programs which require identical data. The discussion paper analyses the opportunities for IPA {{application to}} the sounds of Lithuanian dialects, discusses the marking correspondences of vowels, consonants, some phonetic features and prosodic units in the font Palemonas and IPA, and provides examples of words from various Lithuanian subdialects transcribed by applying both systems. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} heterogeneity {{and complexity}} of XML repositories makes query formulation challenging for users who have little knowledge of XML. To assist its users, an XML retrieval system can have a keyword-based interface, relegating the task of combining textual and structural clues to the retrieval algorithm. In this work, we propose an automatic query refinement method to transform a keyword query into structured XML queries that capture the original information need and conform to the underlying XML data. We formulate query generation as a search problem, and show {{the effectiveness of the}} method in generating accurate content-and-structure queries. 1 The problem of adding structure to keyword queries The functionality <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> up <b>text</b> with user-defined, self-descriptive tags makes XML a versatile framework for storing and sharing data.

Drawing on a synchronic corpus study, we distinguish several uses of the adverbial on the basis of formal and semantic criteria. We show that this adverbial is an anaphoric expression that keeps its compositional semantics, ordering events rather than textual matter : 'dans un premier temps' is both retroactive and prospective, establishing backward links (based on a part-of relation between events) and forward links in discourse (based on a simple temporal succession or on an additional contrastive value). These links are analyzed within the SDRT framework, which reveals two major discourse configurations: either a purely temporal interpretation where the Elaboration of an explicit topic plays a central role; or an argumentative interpretation where a Contrast relation between the coordinated elaborating elements is associated with the relation of temporal succession present in the first configuration...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{principle}} of operation for SemSin semantic and syntactic parser creating a dependency tree for the Russian language sentences. The parser consists of 4 blocks: a dictionary, morphological analyzer, production rules and lexical analyzer. An important logical part of the parser is pre-syntactical module, which harmonizes and complements morphological analysis results, separates the text paragraphs into individual sentences, and also carries out predisambiguation. Characteristic feature of the presented parser is an open type of control – it is done {{by means of a}} set of production rules. A varied set of commands provides the ability to both morphological and semantic-syntactic analysis of the sentence. The paper presents the sequence of rules usage and examples of their work. Specific feature of the rules is the decision making on establishment of syntactic links with simultaneous removal of the morphological and semantic ambiguity. The lexical analyzer provides the execution of commands and rules, and manages the parser in manual or automatic modes of the text analysis. In the first case, the analysis is performed interactively with the possibility of step-by-step execution of the rules and scanning the resulting parse tree. In the second case, analysis results are filed in an xml-file. Active usage of syntactic and semantic dictionary information gives the possibility to reduce significantly the ambiguity of parsing. In addition <b>to</b> <b>marking</b> the <b>text,</b> the parser is also usable as a tool for information extraction from natural language texts...|$|R

40|$|Early medieval Latin manuscripts {{frequently}} contain marginal commentaries and annotations that {{refer to}} the text in these manuscripts. Such marginalia may have the form of texts or diagrams, but in other cases, they are symbols - crosses, dots, slashes and other more complex graphic signs. While scholars {{have been aware of}} the presence of technical signs in manuscript margins, we had until now no coherent understanding of their usage and in many cases we lacked the key to decipher their meaning. My PhD research provides the first detailed examination of technical signs used in the early medieval Latin West and attempts to map their usage in the Carolingian period. I first outline their history that goes back to Classical Antiquity. Technical signs devised by scribes and scholars to perform routine professional tasks, such as correction of faulty manuscripts or critical assessment of fellow scholars, were adopted by Christian scribes and scholars in Late Antiquity. Christian users also developed new uses for technical signs, for example <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>texts</b> that contained theologically problematic passages. The practice of using technical signs was originally highly pragmatic, and we may assume sign users learned their trade from other users orally and by observing their behaviour. However, since the first centuries technical treatises that detailed how signs were to be used, gave them names and sometimes added details about their origin and known users began to be produced in Greek and Latin. These oldest technical texts provided the basis for the sign treatises surviving from the early Middle Ages. More than twenty sign treatises survive in medieval manuscripts. I transcribe and analyze them in my dissertation and also discuss other testimonies reflecting scholarly discourse on the subject of technical signs. My research showed that the majority of signs one can encounter in early medieval Western manuscripts were produced by monastic scribes who used them to perform simple operations connected with copying of manuscripts, their correction and readership. Nevertheless, some manuscripts also contain signs that reflect the activities of scholars and attest to a revival of interest in scholarly traditions of sign use outlined in sign treatises and in testimonies available to medieval readers. This revival can be connected with Carolingian Renaissance and the reforms that have their origin in the last decades of the eighth century. Most likely, Carolingian thinkers began to study the critical signs, one category of technical signs, because of their connection to the Psalter; however, their interest gradually developed beyond this single tradition and stimulated interest in sign treatises and their study. Ultimately, Carolingian scholars devised their own traditions of sign use that are captured by several works produced during this period...|$|R

Através da análise das traducões ao português do Brasil do jogo Chrono Trigger feitas por fãs, foi possível demonstrar como eles chegaram a resultados similares aos produzidos por profissionais da indústria de localização. Para definir os objetos da análise, foram priorizados teóricos que abordam o fenômeno da tradução desde um ponto de vista cultural, como Nord (1994), Newmark (1998), Vermeer (1987) e Fish (1980), além de ser destacado o conceito de “transcriação” utilizado por Mangiron e O’Hagan (2006). O recorte de termos culturais – ainda que de um universo ficcional – permitiu a investigação dos aspectos da tradução que colocam em maior evidência o choque entre duas ou mais culturas. Com esse intento, utilizou-se uma adaptação da proposta de Venuti (1995) a respeito de como traduzir um texto culturalmente marcado em conjunto com as técnicas de tradução sugeridas por Molina e Hurtado (2002).
