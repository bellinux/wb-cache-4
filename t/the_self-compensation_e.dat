Assuming monochromatic plane-wave pump field, the mutual signal-idler relations like energy conservation and transverse-momentum conservation define well one of the two-photon with reference to its conjugate. The weaker conservation of longitudinal momentum (due to relatively thin crystals) allows two-photon emission directions coplanar with the pump beam while spreading around the perfect phase-matching direction.

40|$|Using hybrid density {{functional}} theory, {{we address}} point defects susceptible to cause charge compensation upon Mg doping of GaN. We determine the free energy of {{formation of the}} nitrogen vacancy and of several Mg-related defects. The entropic contribution {{as a function of}} temperature is determined within the quasiharmonic approximation. We find that the Mg interstitial shows a noticeably lower free energy of formation than the Mg substitutional to Ga in p-type conditions. Therefore, the Mg impurity is amphoteric behaving like an acceptor when substitutional to Ga and like a double donor when accommodated in an interstitial position. The hybrid-functional results are then linked to experimental observations by solving the charge neutrality equations for semiconductor dominated by impurities. We show that a thermodynamic equilibrium model is unable to account for the experimental hole concentration as a function of Mg doping density, due to nitrogen vacancies and Mg interstitials acting as compensating donors.

ZnO contains a promising emission tendency for blue/ultraviolet and full-color lighting, owing to the wide band gap, large exciton binding energy and many radiative deep levels depending on its synthesizing techniques [8, 9].

In this regard, GaN provides a suitable replacement of the p-ZnO for the fabrication of pn-heterostructures due to their better match in crystal structure, wide band gap and opto-electronic properties compared to other p-type materials. Among a variety of nanoscale structures of ZnO, nanotubes along with p-GaN have the potential to provide a heterostructure with substantial advantages and the conjunction of high surface to volume ratio with huge number of intrinsic and extrinsic defects could culminate a full-color illumination. Moreover, ZnO-nanotubes/GaN heterostructure have an aptitude to produce an environmentally benign alternative of the traditional lighting sources with high CRI value encompassing the diverse applications.

40|$|Abstract—Threshold voltage VT of a {{transistor}} degrades {{with time}} both {{due to the}} formation of defects at the oxide/Si interface, as well as charge trapping into bulk defects – a phenomenon commonly known as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI). However, we have shown earlier that with appropriate mobility vs. vertical effective electric field characteristics, transistor’s drivability (i. e., drain current) can be made far less sensitive to the NBTI-induced threshold voltage degradation ΔVT, than previously presumed. Higher steepness of the mobility-field characteristics results in an increase in mobility due to interface defects, which can self-compensate the effect of ΔVT on drain current. In this paper, {{for the first time we}} analyze the additional effect of PBTI-induced ΔVT in NMOS transistor parameters and show that mobility at constant gate voltage always increases with PBTI, irrespective of the mobility-field steepness. Therefore, self-compensation for PBTI is even more pronounced compared to NBTI. Next, we demonstrate <b>the</b> consequence of <b>self-compensation</b> via an intuitive analysis in simple digital circuits and show that lifetime of digital ICs increases dramatically once we incorporate <b>the</b> effect of <b>self-compensation</b> by using appropriate sign for mobility variation at constant gate voltage.

Though stoichiometric ZnO is an insulator, due {{to the presence of}} internal defects such as Zn interstitials and Oxygen vacancies, it exists as a n-type conductor. The other important property of ZnO which could be used by the optical field is its widebandgap. ZnO has a wide bandgap of 3. 2 eV - 3. 3 eV. The additional advantage of being a direct bandgap semiconductor has increased the probability of using ZnO for short wavelength applications. These practical applications are directly related to the fabrication of homostructural p-n junctions. ZnO can be readily doped n-type. Doping ZnO P-type is very difficult due to its native defects and <b>the</b> <b>self-compensation</b> that occurs during doping. But when P-type doping is obtained in ZnO it could be used in various optical applications such as light emitting diodes and laser diodes. This provided the motivation for this research. Theoretical studies have proposed nitrogen as a suitable material to achieve p-type ZnO. Literature provides a set of conditions {{that could be used to}} improve the doping in ZnO films. In this research, a set of these conditions were used to implement p-type doping in ZnO films. A sputtering system with a setup to support two Torus - 5 M guns was used to deposit the ZnO films. A codoping technique using an aluminium doped zinc oxide target was the first method. Though an improvement in the nitrogen incorporation was found in this method in the beginning, a further increase in the nitrogen pressure did not show further improvement. A co-sputtering technique of a 99. 999 % pure ZnO target and a 99. 99 % pure Zn metal target was the second method. The ZnO target was rf sputtered while the Zn target was dc sputtered using the two guns provided in the deposition chamber. The extra Zinc obtained from sputtering the metallic Zn target was used to improve the incorporation of nitrogen. The films were later deposited in an oxygen ambient where the excess oxygen was used to suppress the oxygen vacancies that act as hole killers during the doping process. Four point probe measurement and Keithley 900 series Hall equipment were used for the electrical characterization of the films. An ORIEL monochromator was used to optically characterize the films.

40|$|A {{study of}} defects in {{semiconductors}} is vital as defects tend to influence device operation by modifying their electrical and optoelectronic properties. This influence can at times be desirable {{in the case}} of fast switching devices and sometimes undesirable as they may reduce the efficiency of optoelectronic devices. ZnO is a wide bandgap material with a potential for fabricating UV light emitting diodes, lasers and white lighting devices only after the realization of reproducible p-type material. The realization of p-type material is greatly affected by doping asymmetry. <b>The</b> <b>self-compensation</b> behaviour by its native defects has hindered the success in obtaining the p-type material. Hence there is need to understand the electronic properties, formation and annealing-out of these defects for controlled material doping. Space charge spectroscopic techniques are powerful tools for studying the electronic properties of electrically active defects in semiconductors since they can reveal information about the defect “signatures”. In this study, novel Schottky contacts with low leakage currents of the order of 10 - 11 A at 2. 0 V, barrier heights of 0. 60 – 0. 80 eV and low series resistance, fabricated on hydrogen peroxide treated melt-grown single crystal ZnO samples, were demonstrated. Investigations on the dependence of the Schottky contact parameters on fabrication techniques and different metals were performed. Resistive evaporation proved to produce contacts with lower series resistance, higher barrier heights and low reverse currents compared to the electron-beam deposition technique. Deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and Laplace-DLTS have been employed to study the electronic properties of electrically active deep level defects in ZnO. Results revealed the presence of three prominent deep level defects (E 1, E 2 and E 3) in the as-received ZnO samples. Electron-beam deposited contacts indicated the presence of the E 1, E 2 and E 3 and the introduction of new deep level defects. These induced deep levels have been attributed to stray electrons and ionized particles, present in the deposition system during contact fabrication. Exposure of ZnO to high temperatures induces deep level defects. Annealing samples in the 300 °C – 600 °C temperature range in Ar + O 2 induces the E 4 deep level with a very high capture cross-section. This deep level transforms at every annealing temperature. Its instability at room temperature has been demonstrated by a change in the peak temperature position with time. This deep level was broad, indicating that it consists of two or more closely spaced energy levels. Laplace-DLTS was successfully employed to resolve the closely spaced energy levels. Annealing samples at 700 °C in Ar and O 2 anneals-out E 4 and induces the Ex deep level defect with an activation enthalpy of approximately 160 – 180 meV. Vacuum annealing performed in the 400 °C – 700 °C temperature range did not induce any deep level defects. Since the radiation hardness of ZnO is crucial in space applications, 1. 6 MeV proton irradiation was performed. DLTS revealed the introduction of the E 4 deep level with an activation enthalpy of approximately 530 meV, which proved to be stable at room temperature and atmospheric pressure since its properties didn’t change over a period of 12 months.

40|$|Electrical {{and optical}} {{properties}} of the (N,Ga) -doped ZnO films have been studied. Three growth regions were identified to obtain ZnO films with different conduction types depending on the N/Ga flux ratio in doping process. The PL spectra show evident competition between neutral-donor bound exciton (D 0 X) and neutral-acceptor bound exciton (A 0 X) according to the N/Ga ratio. From the temperature-dependent PL spectra, the nitrogen acceptor level was identified to be about 126 meV in (N,Ga) -doped p-type ZnO. For nitrogen doping of ZnO thin films, DMHy {{was used as the}} nitrogen dopant source. A narrow temperature window from about 500 °C to 550 °C for efficient nitrogen doping was identified. However, p-type ZnO was not obtained by nitrogen mono-doping, which results from the low solubility of N and the self-compensating effect of native defects, and/or N-induced complexes. By co-doping N with Ga in proper ratios, p-type ZnO films were successfully achieved with a high hole concentration of 3. 51 x 1017 [...] 2. 41 x 1018 cm- 3, Hall mobility of 1. 1 [...] 4. 29 cm 2 /V-s and resistivity of 0. 6 [...] 16. 2 O cm. But the conduction type critically depends on the growth conditions. Based on the successfully fabrication of (N,Ga) -doped p-type ZnO, a p-ZnO:(N,Ga) /n-ZnO homojunction was fabricated. The I-V measurement shows clear rectifying behavior with a turn-on voltage of about 3. 7 V. Further investigation of the effect of N/Ga doping ratios on the conduction type of ZnO samples reveals that successful doping depends much on engineering a stable local chemical bonding environment. Under mono-doping conditions (via N-Zn 4), nitrogen solubility is limited and nitrogen acceptors are readily compensated by native donors and/or N-related donors; under appropriate N/Ga flux ratios, cluster-doping (via Ga-N 3 O and Ga-N 4) can be realized to achieve p-type ZnO; while excessively high N/Ga ratios cause the doped ZnO n-type conductivity again, which may be because that under excessively high N/Ga ratio range, N-Zn 4 configuration dominates and thus cause more N-related donors and degrade the ZnO film quality, similar as the mono-doping case. By tuning the N/Ga ratio in doping, it is expected to create appropriate chemical environments to enhance the formation of desired dopant species for stable p-type ZnO. In this work, Metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) growth of ZnO and its p-type doping have been studied. The group V element N was used as primary dopant to make ZnO p-type. In the growth of ZnO by MOCVD, {{it was found that the}} structural and morphological properties of deposited ZnO strongly depend on growth conditions. Low VI/II ratio and high growth rate favor the growth of ZnO nanostructures (nanowires, nanobelts); while high VI/II ratio and low growth rate favor the growth of ZnO thin films. The semiconductor ZnO is currently gaining intense interest in the research community because of its prospect in optoelectronic applications, such as blue/ultraviolet emitters and detectors, and high speed electronic devices. However, making reliable and reproducible p-type ZnO is still a bottleneck, which impedes the practical application of ZnO-based devices. The difficulty is mainly due to <b>the</b> <b>self-compensation</b> effect of native defects and the low solubility limit of acceptor dopants. Although substantial research is currently being carried out worldwide towards this goal, the effective p-type dopant and its doping process have not yet been identified. Wang, Hui. "Apr 2008.

40|$|Process-related and stress-induced {{changes in}} {{threshold}} voltage are major variability concerns in ultra-scaled CMOS transistors. The device designers consider this variability as an irreducible {{part of the}} design problem and use different circuit level optimization schemes to handle these variations. In this paper, we demonstrate how {{an increase in the}} negative steepness of the universal mobility relationship improves both the process-related (e. g., oxide thickness fluctuation, gate work-function fluctuation), as well as stress-induced or reliability-related (e. g., Bias Temperature Instability or BTI) parametric variation in CMOS technology. Therefore, we calibrate the universal mobility parameters to reflect the measured variation of negative steepness in uniaxially strained CMOS transistor. This allows us to study the extent of (process-related and stress-induced parametric) variation resilience in uniaxial strain technology by increasing the negative steepness of the mobility characteristics. Thus, we show that variability analysis in strained CMOS technology must consider <b>the</b> presence of <b>self-compensation</b> between mobility variation and threshold voltage variation, which leads to considerable amount of variation resilience. Finally, we use detailed circuit simulation to stress the importance of accurate mobility variation modeling in SPICE analysis and explain why the variability concerns in strained technology may be less severe than those in unstrained technology.

40|$|Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is {{more common}} in the Southern China region {{than the rest of the}} world. Radiation therapy (RT) is the {{contemporary}} and standard treatment for nasopharyngeal cancer. Chronic complications arise from RT including hearing loss, xerostomia, trismus and dysphagia. Previous research has shown that dysphagia is prevalent in irradiated NPC patients. Radiation therapy techniques have improved in the last decade with the emergence of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), which allows more precise radiation beams directed at the tumor. In turn, it should also allow greater sparing of surrounding structures that are vital for preservation of swallowing function. This study was designed to investigate the difference in the degree of swallowing function preservation in two groups of irradiated NPC patients: the conventional RT and the IMRT group. Thirty patients with NPC who received RT from 1998 to 2006 in Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong were randomly recruited during the period from January to December 2011. Participant’s swallowing competence and its effect on the quality of life was assessed by videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and by the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory, respectively. In comparison of swallowing performance with VFSS between the two groups, only one measure (Duration of Laryngeal Elevation) out of 13 showed significant difference on thin liquid and congee diet. Results from the MDADI did not show significant difference between the two groups. From the results, it was concluded that IMRT only resulted in subtle improvement in preserving the swallowing function as compared to conventional RT. One possibility is <b>the</b> subject <b>self-compensation</b> of their swallowing impairments that led to functionally similar performance despite their differences in the anatomy and physiology. Swallowing is a highly complex body function and no single parameter can be used to accurately quantify and characterize one’s swallowing function. The interaction between the anatomical and physiological impairments resulted from radiation therapy and the compensatory mechanism could not be clearly explained with this study. Future research could adopt a longitudinal approach such that the changes in NPC patients who received radiation therapy can be better understood. published_or_final_versionSpeech and Hearing SciencesMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
30|$|Semiconductor {{nanoparticles}} termed {{quantum dots}} (QDs) have drawn wide attention {{in recent years}} as light-emitting source for light-emitting diode (LED) applications, whose emission spectrum with narrow linewidth can be tuned by changing the energy bandgaps with the variation in QD sizes and shapes [1 – 7]. Numerous experiments present in literature on the high-performance electroluminescence (EL) properties of LEDs based on CdS [8, 9], CdSe [10, 11], and PbS [12, 13] colloidal QD thin film. However, the widespread employment of heavy metal ions, particularly Cd and Pb, are a serious hazard to human health {{as well as to the}} environment [14]. Therefore, it necessitates alternative approaches for developing QD-LEDs with the heavy-metal free composition. Nontoxic ZnO QDs with a tunable direct wide bandgap and a large exciton binding energy of 60  meV at room temperature are very promising for solid-state LED applications [15, 16]. However, the main issue, the lack of high-quality and stable p-type doing of ZnO due to <b>the</b> strong <b>self-compensation</b> effect of native point defects such as zinc interstitial or oxygen vacancy, still remained. Thus, n-ZnO/p-GaN heterojunction LEDs are offered as an alternative approach due to the low lattice mismatch (1.9 %), similar bandgap energy between ZnO and GaN, and the same wurtzite crystal structure. Nevertheless, the spontaneous polarization of GaN [17 – 19] and the interfacial energy barrier between ZnO QDs and GaN will necessarily reduce the performance of the device, thus resulting the low EL efficiency of the device. To improve the EL efficiency of the LEDs, localized surface plasmon (LSP) has been introduced into n-ZnO/p-GaN LEDs to improve EL performance of the device. Recently, different metals like Au, Ag, and Pt have been observed to enhance the EL performance due to the enhancement of the internal quantum efficiency [20 – 26]. More recently, Lu et al. demonstrated a more than 30 -fold EL enhancement of Al nanoparticle-decorated n-ZnO nanorod/p-GaN LEDs compared with that of the bare one [27]. Liu et al. showed the devices of LSP-enhanced ZnO/SiO 2 core/shell nanorod array/p-GaN heterostructure LEDs containing decorated with Ag nanoparticles. In comparison with the bare UV LEDs, the maximum enhancement ration of the Ag nanoparticle-decorated LEDs in EL is sevenfold [28]. However, many reports are mainly focused on the LSP-enhanced LEDs based on ZnO nanorods; there has been no literature concerning the LSP-enhanced EL emission in ZnO QD-based LED structure.|$|R
40|$|Zinc {{selenide}} is {{a prospective}} material for optoelectronics. The fabrication of ZnSe­based light-emitting diodes is hindered by complexity of p-type doping of the component materials. The interaction between native and impurity defects, {{the tendency of}} doping impurity to form associative centres with native defects and <b>the</b> tendency to <b>self-compensation</b> are <b>the</b> main factors impeding effective control of the value and type of conductivity. The thesis {{is devoted to the}} study of the processes of interaction between native and impurity defects in zinc selenide. It is established that the Au impurity has the most prominent amphoteric properties in ZnSe among Cu, Ag and Au impurities, as it forms a great number of both Au; donors and Auz„ acceptors. Electrical measurements show that Ag and Au ions introduced into vacant sites of the Zn sublattice form simple single-charged Agz„+ and Auzn+ states with d 1 ° electron configuration, while Cu ions can form both single-charged Cuz„ (d 1) and double-charged Cuzr`+ (d`o) centres. Amphoteric properties of Ag and Au transition metals stimulated by time are found for the first time from both electrical and luminescent measurements. A model that explains the changes in electrical and luminescent parameters by displacement of Ag ions into interstitial sites due to lattice deformation forces is proposed. Formation of an Ag;-donor impurity band in ZnSe samples doped with Ag and stored at room temperature is also studied. Thus, the properties of the doped samples are modified due to large lattice relaxation during aging. This fact should be taken into account in optoelectronic applications of doped ZnSe and related compounds...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} {{comprehensive study of}} the intrinsic room temperature ferromagnetism, RTFM, in technologically important thin films of ZnO, MgO, Mg@ZnO, the so-called d 0 –magnets that do not contain any intrinsic magnetic elements. We also present the first report on magnetism in Mn doped MgO films fabricated by dc magnetron sputtering. We have just published (April 2013 ‘on-line’) {{a state of the}} art review entitled ‘p-type ZnO Theory, growth, properties, and devices’ in the prestigious journal ‘Progress in Materials Science’, summarizing the recent advances of the studies on p-type ZnO thin films and pointing out the major challenges that remain in the field. The experimental work then focuses on the magnetic properties of band gap engineered Mg@ZnO films exploiting the fact that by substitutional doping of Mg for Zn in ZnO it is possible to tailor new materials with bandgap energy in the range 3. 3 eV to 7. 2 eV, thus extending the possibilities for new magnetic and optical device applications. In addition, we show that by doping Mn in MgO its magnetic properties can be enhanced to saturation values as high as 38. 5 emu/cm 3 in a 92 nm thick film. These studies involve extensive characterization of the high quality films in the thickness range of nanometers, using SQUID magnetometer for magnetic properties, XRD for structural analysis, Dual beam HRSEM/FIB and AFM for accurate film cross-sectioning and surface morphology, EDXS for elemental analysis, UV-VIS NIR for measuring the band gap of MgxZn(1 -x) O films, Mg K-edge NEXAFS experiment in order to understand electronic structure of specific cations present in the thin films The origin of the observed room temperature feerromaganetism is attributed to cation vacancies and its consequences on the polarization about these vacancies in the oxides [...] . ZnO films are promising materials for optoelectronic device applications, and the fabrications of high quality p-type ZnO and p–n junction are the key steps to realize these applications. However, reliable p-type doping of the material remains a major challenge because of <b>the</b> <b>self-compensation</b> from native donor defects (VO and Zni) and/or hydrogen incorporation. Considerable efforts to obtain p-type ZnO by doping different elements with various techniques have resulted in remarkable progress in the field both from theoretical and experimental point of view. In our paper, we discuss p-type ZnO materials: theory, growth, properties and devices, comprehensively. We first discuss the native defects in ZnO. Among the native defects in ZnO, VZn and Oi act as acceptors. We then present the theory of p-type doping in ZnO, and summarize the growth techniques for p-type ZnO and the properties of p-type ZnO materials. Experimentally, besides the intrinsic p-type ZnO grown at O-rich ambient, p-type ZnO (MgZnO) materials have been prepared by various techniques using Group-I, IV and V elements. We pay a special attention to the band gap of p-type ZnO by band gap engineering and room temperature ferro magnetism observed in p-type ZnO. Finally, we summarize the devices based on p-type ZnO materials. In presenting the current studies, we first focus on the sputtering process in order to produce high quality films. From a comparative study of RTFM, in MgO films deposited by sputtering from 99. 999 % pure metallic Mg, Vs MgO targets respectively on glass/Si substrates under identical ambience during deposition it is found that the metallic targets give the best magnetic properties (e. g: with maximum Ms values of ~ 13. 75 emu/g vs ~ 4. 2 emu/g respectively on Si substrates. (supplement 2). Furthermore, the Ms values are strongly film thickness dependent with Mg target while it is weakly so for films from MgO target. Also, the as deposited MgO films using metallic Mg target are found to be amorphous, while it is nanocrystalline when the films are sputtered off MgO targets. The overall Ms values are found to be dependent on the oxygen content in the atmosphere during deposition, increasing to 2. 69 emu/g at a oxygen partial pressure of 40 % of the total working gas pressure. On annealing to nanocrystallize these films in the temperature range 600 to 8000 C strong XRD peaks corresponding to (200) orientation are observed, and Ms values decrease proportionately. (supplement 3). With the above information on studies for optimizing the effect of sputtering gas, film thickness, and oxygen partial pressure, PO 2, comprehensive investigations on band gap engineering and magnetism in MgxZn(1 -x) O co-sputtered thin films from Mg and Zn targets are then closely examined. The optical band gap calculated from absorption spectra shows that the band gaps of Mg-doped ZnO thin films increased linearly from 3. 33 to 4. 074 eV. Our studies indicate that both the magnetic properties and the band gap of the film can be tailored by tuning the film thickness and PO 2 in the working gas. In summary, RTFM ordering in the thin films originates from cation vacancies which couple ferromagnetically and establish long range magnetic order. The ferromagnetic ordering in these materials is shown to arise from defects situated at the cation sites. Electronic structure studies of some selected films disclose that the unoccupied O 2 p states exist and this unoccupied state results from cation vacancy (VMg). QC 20130524 </p...|$|R
