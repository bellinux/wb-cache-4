Then Aaron <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> a beverage, or wine, from a wine glass. Then he starts playing the song.

6000|$|... 'Hum!' he said. Then 'Umph!' in a protesting tone, as {{if someone}} had pinched him. Finally, he gave vent to a long-drawn 'Um-m-m,' in a deep bass. 'Most extraordinary. Really, most extraordinary. Exceedingly. Yes. Um. Very.' He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> coffee.|$|R

Cutter also finds out that Nikki didn't serve his singer a drink despite being underage. Nikki then tells Cutter that even though she sometimes has casual sex with him, she doesn't appreciate him bringing other girls with him {{right in front of her}} because it makes her feel jealous.|$|E
5000|$|Tom {{manages to}} clear his ears out {{and is able to}} hear the sounds of the jungle. Soon after, Jerry pokes his head out of a gun's barrel and taunts Tom. Tom tries to grab Jerry, but his owner {{immediately}} yells to him [...] "DON'T TOUCH MY GUNS!!!", which scares Tom off of the basket and onto the elephant's buckle. To make matters worse, Jerry unbuckles the belt, causing Tom to fall off. Later, the owner manages as he falls off. Tom's owner, blaming Tom for the act, angrily traps him in the overturned basket and the elephant walks off without them. The two attempt {{to get back on the}} elephant, but fail, and just as the owner prepares to punch Tom, they are both interrupted by the thunderous roar of a lion. Frightened, the owner reaches back for Tom to hand him a gun for self defense as Tom searches the basket. Jerry hands him with a thermos and he gives it to Tom's owner. As the hunter fights the lion, Jerry puts his hat over his chest in mourning sarcastically, sobbing. After defeating the lion, the scratched-up and irritated owner <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> coffee from the thermos and counts all the way to ten before clobbering Tom over his head with a thermos.|$|E
5000|$|Becky klassily gets {{dropped off}} by her mom, {{who has a}} date and needs to borrow the car. Rather than going inside, Becky decides to crawl GI Jane-style through the bushes to peer through the gym windows and spy on Lisa and Tim. Everything's peachy until she looks over, and discovers it's Russell, the boy with head lice. Becky finally gives him decent advice: {{everyone}} has to grow up at their own pace. Russell thanks her, then asks, if he can touch her breast, to which she calmly replies [...] "No sweetie". With leaves from the bushes sticking out of her hair, Becky says some people think she doesn't {{have time for a}} life of her own. But now that her dad has run off, her mom needs her. Becky gets offered a ride home by the nerdish girl whose outfit matches hers. But just then she sees Lisa and Tim coming out of the gym. Becky runs away, trips, and falls spectacularly down behind a parked car. There, she crouches and hides as Lisa and Tim talk nearby. Lisa cries about how hard it is for her to be single, but Tim says she’s not alone - he and Becky are single, too. Lisa laughs that Becky's desperation is kind of pathetic. Tim proves that he's a truly awesome guy by saying he knows she can be awkward at times, but that's why he's so impressed. Becky's always so positive. The next day, Bruce is his usual snapish self about Becky's absence at the dance. She tells him she was there, helping out Russell. She dreamily looks out the window and, seeing Tim walking up to the school, sighs that she loves her job. It's like her car. Her whole life she wanted that car, and now she can't believe she's so lucky. Right about then, a taxi backs into said car in the parking lot. Becky <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> tea, trying to suppress the nervous twitch I think she may be developing.|$|E
60|$|The {{chairman}} <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> water, and resumed. Almost all in {{the last}} six rows were now on their feet, and amid a hubbub of murmurs the chairman held out to the secretary the slips of his speech, and fell heavily back into his chair.|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Dave Meyers and premiered on June 20, 2009 in the United Kingdom on 4music at 11:00am. Tony Kanal of No Doubt, also the co-writer and the producer of the song, appears in a cameo, playing a piano. The video {{takes place in a}} barren lot that is later shown to be what's left of a house that is still burning. There are 'evil clowns' throughout the area who are picking though the rubble and playing the instruments as the band. The video begins as it pans low to the ground showing an [...] "Elvis" [...] grave briefly. Pink emerges from an old empty pool and begins to sing the first verse. She proceeds to kick over a toilet and picks up a framed photo. She throws it behind her. She passes a toaster and now it shows that she is in a burning fun house. She dances past a few 'evil clowns'. It shows more of the burning remains of the building. She picks up a stick and throws it down. Then an 'evil clown' turns around and the camera has a close up of its face. She counts down from 9. (She quickly shows her middle finger on '5' but on most versions of the video that is blurred out.) She moves to a table and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> some red liquid but becomes disgusted and throws it down. She jumps onto a mattress attached to a chain which two 'evil clowns' are pulling. She gets off the mattress and climbs onto the burning fun house. It shows four 'evil clowns' (Two are miming with each other, one is playing the guitar and the last is just standing on its own.) She goes over to the guitar playing clown and dances with it. She proceeds to count down from 9 again. She climbs through a doggie door to find Tony Kanal playing the piano. Pink moves to a motorcycle and puts on sunglasses and a leather jacket. In the background a voice is counting down from 9. At one she rides away on the motorcycle as the house explodes. It then shows her riding her motorcycle on a road as the song ends.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{your friend}} ill?" [...] said he. [...] "He has not our English {{ruggedness}} of look. He {{would have done}} better to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the cool tankard, and {{a slice of the}} cold beef. He finds no such food and drink as that in his own country, I warrant." ...|$|R
6000|$|To oblige him, we at last <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> his [...] "arva tee," [...] {{and found}} it very crude, and strong as Lucifer.

60|$|The spy, well used to his business, did {{not change}} his {{unconscious}} attitude, but drained his little glass <b>of</b> cognac, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> fresh water, and asked for another glass of cognac.

6000|$|Osmond <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{glass of}} wine; he looked {{perfectly}} good-humoured.

5000|$|One {{of those}} places where you could <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> his native air was Russicum with the Russian church, with family icons and {{expensive}} Slavic rites.

Years later, Archpriest Alexander Sipyagin who knew Leonid Mikhailovich wrote in his obituary: [...] "Here, {{and especially in the}} Church of St. Anthony, the late felt like at home".|$|R
