5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage <b>tank</b> <b>volume.</b> In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the tank is protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
25|$|The {{biological}} load, or bioload, is {{a measure}} of the burden placed on the aquarium ecosystem by its inhabitants. High biological loading presents a more complicated tank ecology, which in turn means that equilibrium is easier to upset. Several fundamental constraints on biological loading depend on aquarium size. The water's surface area limits oxygen intake. The bacteria population depends on the physical space they have available to colonize. Physically, only a limited size and number of plants and animals can fit into an aquarium while still providing room for movement. Biologically, biological loading refers to the rate of biological decay in proportion to <b>tank</b> <b>volume.</b> Adding plants to an aquarium will sometimes help greatly with taking up fish waste as plant nutrients. Although an aquarium can be overloaded with fish, an excess of plants is unlikely to cause harm. Decaying plant material, such as decaying plant leaves, can add these nutrients back into the aquarium if not promptly removed. The bioload is processed by the aquarium's biofilter filtration system.|$|E

2500|$|Eventually von Braun and {{the others}} were won over. As von Braun stated: [...] "It sounded reckless, but George Mueller's {{reasoning}} was impeccable. Water ballast in lieu of a second and third stage would require much less <b>tank</b> <b>volume</b> than liquid-hydrogen-fuelled stages, so that a rocket tested with only a live first stage would be much shorter than the final configuration. Its aerodynamic shape and its body dynamics would thus not be representative. Filling the ballast tanks with liquid hydrogen? Fine, but then why not burn it as a bonus experiment? And so the arguments went on until George in the end prevailed." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study to}} determine the uncertainty in the volume estimates of the Hanford Site single-shell and double-shell tanks. Through {{a detailed analysis of}} the standard method for estimating waste volume from surface level measurements, a number of systematic biases were identified as well as the five main sources of uncertainty. As a result of systematic biases, the current volume estimates may overstate the total <b>tank</b> waste <b>volume</b> by as much as 460, 000 gallons. The surface level measurements for all 177 tanks were analyzed between January 1, 1990 and January 7, 1999.
