5|$|The {{core of a}} {{follicle}} {{is surrounded}} by a single layer of follicular cells. When stimulated by <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4. They do this by transporting and metabolising the thyroglobulin contained in the colloid. Follicular cells vary in shape from flat to cuboid to columnar, depending on how active they are.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone.</b> Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{possible}} role of thyroid hormones in the Nitric Oxide (NO) - mediated {{response to}} sexual stimulation, and on prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1) and Sildenafil {{in the treatment}} of erectile dysfunction was investigated using the corpus cavernosum of the New Zealand rabbit animal model.

25|$|After a thyroid nodule {{is found}} during a {{physical}} examination, {{a referral to}} an endocrinologist or a thyroidologist may occur.

Measurement of <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis present, a known cause of a benign nodular goiter.

25|$|The exact {{cause is}} unclear; however, it is {{believed}} to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. A person {{is more likely to}} be affected if they have a family member with the disease. If one twin is affected, a 30% chance exists that the other twin will also have the disease. The onset of disease may be triggered by stress, infection, or giving birth. Those with other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to be affected. Smoking increases the risk of disease and may worsen eye problems. The disorder results from an antibody, called thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), that has a similar effect to <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (TSH). These TSI antibodies cause the thyroid gland to produce excess thyroid hormone. The diagnosis may be suspected based on symptoms and confirmed with blood tests and radioiodine uptake. Typically, blood tests show a raised T3 and T4, low TSH, increased radioiodine uptake in all areas of the thyroid, and TSI antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Hypothyroidism is {{the most}} common {{endocrine}} disease in dogs. It can be caused by autoimmune destruction (lymphocytic thyroiditis) or idiopathic atrophy of the thyroid gland. These two causes are responsible for over 95% of the hypothyroidism cases in dogs. Signs include decreased appetite, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin/coat, skin that is cold to the touch, recurring skin infections, and lethargy. The dog may also seek out warm places to lie. The symptoms of hypothyroidism are shared with many other medical conditions; {{it may not be the}} first thought when a diagnosis is made. Symptoms may not appear until 75% or more of the gland is non-functional. In less than 10% of hypothyroidism cases, the problem is not with the thyroid gland itself, but with the pituitary gland in the brain. The pituitary gland produces a <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (TSH); without this hormone to signal the thyroid gland to produce its thyroid hormone, the thyroid gland remains inactive. Treatment is with oral thyroid hormone supplementation. Lack of enough iodine in the diet can produce a form of hypothyroidism; without the proper amount of it, the thyroid gland fails to produce enough thyroid hormone. Myxedema coma is a rare but serious aspect of the disease that is a medical emergency.|$|E

METHODS Prospective longitudinal study of men and women aged 70 - 82 years with pre-existing vascular disease or more than one risk factor to develop this condition (N = 5, 154). Participants taking antithyroid medications, thyroid hormone supplementation and/or amiodarone were excluded. Thyroid function was measured at baseline: subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism were defined as <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormones</b> (TSH) 4. 50 mU/L respectively, with normal levels of free thyroxine (FT 4).

This paper reports the identification, expression, and function of an ancestral, nonclassical, pituitary heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone (GpH) consisting of the thyrostimulin A 2 subunit with the classical β-subunit in the sea lamprey, Petromyzon marinus, a jawless basal vertebrate. Lamprey (l) GpA 2, and lGpHβ were shown to form a heterodimer by coimmunoprecipitation of lGpA 2 with FLAG-tagged lGpHβ after the overexpression in transiently transfected COS 7 cells using a bipromoter vector. Dual-label fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed the coexpression of individual subunits in the proximal pars distalis of the pituitary. GnRH-III (1 μΜ) significantly increased the expression of lGpHβ and lGpA 2 in in vitro pituitary culture. Recombinant lamprey GpH was constructed by tethering the N terminal of lGpA 2 to the C terminal of lGpHβ with a linker region composed of six histidine residues followed by three glycine-serine repeats. This recombinant lamprey GpH activated the lamprey glycoprotein hormone receptor I as measured by increased cAMP/luciferase activity.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate whether chronic {{exposure to}} solvents like benzene and pollutants like carbon monoxide in petrol filling workers had adverse effect on blood parameters, thyroid and respiratory functions. The study group consisted of 42 healthy, non-smoker petrol filling workers, aged 20 - 50 years with work (exposure) duration from 2 - 15 years while 36 healthy subjects of the same age group served as controls. Physical examination and measurement of pulmonary functions by portable electronic spirometer were performed. Complete blood pictures (CBP) were determined by normal haematology lab procedure and hormones by Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) light absorption techniques. There was a significant decrease in the lung volumes and capacities; the restrictive pattern was more prevalent in the workers when compared with the control groups. But in the workers exposed for long period (more than 10 years) the restrictive pattern was changed to mixed pattern.

Twenty six experienced linesmen, aged 25 to 52, were studied during two working days while performing a simulated routine inspection of insulators on steel poles of a 400 kV power line. During one of the working days the inspection was performed on a power line in operation and on the other day the same procedure was performed on an identical power line, which was not in operation. The two days were found to be comparable with regard to the physical workload which, on the basis of heart rate measurements, was estimated to be high. Exposure to the electric and magnetic fields was measured using a device designed for on-worker sampling on each linesman. The mean exposure for the working day was estimated to be 2. 8 kV/m (SD = 0. 35) and 23. 3 microT (SD = 4. 2). The possible effects of exposure were studied using a battery of four automated performance tests, EEG, a mood scale, and a questionnaire to assess subjective symptoms. All workers were examined immediately before and after each workday. Furthermore, blood samples were collected for each subject on three different occasions during each workday. The battery of behavioural tests comprised a test of simple reaction time, a vigilance test, a test of short term memory (digit span), and a perceptual test (symbol digit).

2500|$|The {{secretion}} of many hormones {{is affected}} by sleep-wake cycles. For example, melatonin, a hormonal timekeeper, is considered a strongly circadian hormone, whose secretion increases at dim light and peaks during nocturnal sleep, diminishing with bright light to the eyes. In some organisms melatonin secretion depends on sleep, but in humans it is independent of sleep and depends only on light level. Of course, in humans {{as well as other}} animals, such a hormone may facilitate coordination of sleep onset. Similarly, cortisol and <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormone</b> (TSH) are strongly circadian and diurnal hormones, mostly independent of sleep. In contrast, other hormones like growth hormone (GH) & prolactin are critically sleep-dependent, and are suppressed in the absence of sleep. GH has maximum increase during SWS while prolactin is secreted early after sleep onset and rises through the night. In some hormones whose secretion is controlled by light level, sleep seems to increase secretion. Almost in all cases, sleep deprivation has detrimental effects. For example, cortisol, which is essential for metabolism (it is so important that animals can die within a week of its deficiency) and affects the ability to withstand noxious stimuli, is increased by waking and during REM sleep. Similarly, TSH increases during nocturnal sleep and decreases with prolonged periods of reduced sleep, but interestingly, increases during total acute sleep deprivation.|$|E

The reason for increased risk of obesity in DS is unclear. The current {{study was designed to}} clarify differences in some obesity- related hormones in a group of prepubertal Down syndrome children. Methods Thirty six Egyptian children with Down syndrome were enrolled in this study, divided according to their body mass index (BMI) into 23 obese and 13 non obese. Another group of 43 non Down children were recruited, they were divided according to their BMI into 20 patients having simple obesity and 23 non obese, as control groups. Fasting blood samples were collected for estimation of fasting blood glucose (FBG), insulin, leptin, free thyroxin (FT 4), <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>hormones</b> (TSH) and creatine kinase (CK). Insulin resistance was assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment method (HOMA-IR). The ratio of leptin to BMI (LEP/BMI) was used as an index of leptin resistance. Results Median values of FBG, insulin, and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in Down versus non Down groups, while median values of leptin and leptin resistance were non-significantly different among Down versus non Down groups. Median TSH values were non- significantly different between obese Down and obese non Down. Although the median values of TSH and FT 4 were within normal range in Down groups, four cases of subclinical hypothyroidism were encountered. Leptin levels were correlated with insulin and IR but not with TSH in Down groups. Conclusion Increased circulating leptin, a marker of leptin resistance in obese children with Down syndrome seems to be similar to that in children with simple obesity. Elevated FBG and insulin in obese Down children highlights the presence of early IR. Associated myopathy evidenced by mildly elevated CK levels could be an added factor for obesity in such group of patients. </p...|$|R
