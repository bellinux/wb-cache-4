5|$|Some of <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> {{observed}} {{with high levels}} of compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> deceptive, {{in that it}} coerces governments into {{altering}} {{land use}} laws without debating them on their merits.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> incomplete, in that {{it fails}} to dictate a method for {{determining}} property value when a claim is filed or evaluated.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> new <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> {{guaranteed}} by <b>the</b> Russian Empire, giving it another pretext {{to interfere in}} Commonwealth politics if <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> changed.|$|R

50|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision, {{the court held}} <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> a valid exercise of the trade and commerce power. Section 51(i) was a non-purposive power, and the only relevant factor was {{the subject matter of}} trade and commerce. The motive and purpose behind <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> irrelevant.|$|R
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, an {{aggrieved party}} who alleges that legislation enacted by Parliament violates {{his or her}} constitutional rights may apply for a declaration from the High Court that <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Another {{remedy that}} Singapore courts might apply if an {{appropriate}} case arises – {{though it has}} yet to do so – is the granting of temporary validity to unconstitutional laws. When a piece of legislation is ruled as unconstitutional, a lacuna or gap in the law may ensue as <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> void retrospectively and prospectively. The situation is exacerbated if <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> one with far-reaching effects. Hence, to overcome the negative impact of such a lacuna, the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the remedy of granting temporary validity to unconstitutional legislation for the minimum time necessary for the legislature to enact alternative laws.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> {{opposed by}} <b>the</b> Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. <b>The</b> final <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> amended {{to gain the}} support of Independent Senator Brian Harradine, whose vote was {{required}} for the bill to pass.http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s12184.htm ...|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, {{civil unions}} are solely {{in the provincial}} domain and have no {{relevance}} here. As such, section 2 of <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> ultra vires the federal government. Any legislation protecting freedom of religion with respect to marriage must be done through provincial legislation.|$|E
25|$|Each {{member state}} is {{responsible}} for establishing the required policing measures to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> implemented. For example, in the UK the Water Quality Regulations prescribe maximum values for substances that affect wholesomeness and the Drinking Water Inspectorate polices the water companies.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Democrats {{have said}} they will appeal the AEC decision, which under <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> reviewable. However the party does not appear on the AEC Current Register of Political Parties and could not contest the 2016 Federal Election. Much of their support in the party's birthplace, South Australia, flowed to the Nick Xenophon Team, which has a very similar platform.|$|E
50|$|In April 2011, Minister Roxon {{released}} an exposure draft of plain packaging legislation with an expected start date of 1 July 2012. Australian newspapers reported that <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> likely to pass despite concerns from the Opposition. It was suggested the Opposition resistance to <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> {{due to their}} continuing acceptance of funding donations from tobacco companies.|$|R

25|$|The {{governor}} {{has the power}} of the line-item veto, which allows them to sign part of appropriation bills into law, while sending appropriations items they disagree with back to the legislature.

25|$|On July 29, 2005, the United States Congress {{established}} {{guidelines for}} Patient Safety Organizations under the Patient Safety Quality Act of 2005.

25|$|The Truth in Music Advertising act or bill, {{also known}} as Truth in Music Performance Advertising or simply Truth in Music, is legislation, adopted into state law by most U.S. states, that aims to protect the {{trademark}} of musical recording artists. The legislation provides that {{the name of a}} famous musical group cannot be used by a group of performers unless they include at least one member of the original group. The intent of <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> to prevent unfair or deceptive trade practices, and to protect the livelihood of musicians who were in famous musical groups.|$|E

25|$|Senate bills must {{be signed}} {{by both the}} Student Body President and the Senior Student Affairs Officer. Either officer may veto any Senate bill. The Senate may {{override}} the veto of the Student Body President by a two-thirds vote, at which the time <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> passed to the Senior Student Affairs Officer for approval or veto. If a bill is vetoed by the Senior Student Affairs Officer, the Senate may override the veto by a two-thirds vote, at which time the legislation goes {{to the president of}} the university for ultimate review. The decision of the university president is final and may not be overridden by the Senate. In 2010, a veto by the Senior Student Affairs Officer was successfully overridden by the Senate and university president. Resolutions require only the signature of the Speaker and President Pro Tempore.|$|E
25|$|H.R. 4587 {{contains}} no intergovernmental mandates {{as defined in}} the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. H.R. 4587 would impose private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA by prohibiting certain transactions with entities associated with human rights violations in Venezuela. In addition, individuals {{found to be associated}} with the human rights violations could have their visas revoked. The cost of the mandates would be any forgone income directly related to the prohibited transactions and to the loss of visas. Based on data from the U.S. International Trade Commission, the total value of transactions that could be affected by <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> low. Further, CBO expects that the number of individuals in the United States that could have their visa revoked under the bill is small. Therefore, CBO estimates that the aggregate cost of the mandates would fall below the annual threshold for private-sector mandates established in UMRA ($152 million in 2014, adjusted annually for inflation).|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{the impact of}} the Canada Not-for-Profit Corporations Act (2009) on the governance of national sport organizations (NSO). The impact of <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> explored through <b>the</b> perceptions of NSO executive leaders and by analyzing the by-laws in effect before <b>the</b> <b>legislation.</b> <b>The</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> perceived to have the greatest impact on enhancing accountability, specifically affecting membership categories and director selection. The interview data showed that <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>was</b> necessary to enhance accountability in many NSOs. The Respondents also demonstrated that they understood the goals sought through <b>the</b> <b>legislation.</b> <b>The</b> data also showed that the boards of NSOs were already in alignment with the goals of <b>the</b> <b>legislation.</b> With respect to governance, the data indicated that NSOs rely almost exclusively on their regional sport associations as voting stakeholders. An emerging issue {{that came out of the}} results was the role of athletes in the governance of sport organizations...|$|R

500|$|Under this procedure, the Commission {{presents}} {{a proposal to}} Parliament and the Council. Following its first reading the Parliament may propose amendments. If the Council accepts these amendments then <b>the</b> <b>legislation</b> <b>is</b> approved. If it does not then it adopts a [...] "common position" [...] and submits that new version to the Parliament. At its second reading, if the Parliament approves the text or does not act, the text is adopted, otherwise the Parliament may propose further amendments to the Council's proposal. It may be rejected out right by an absolute majority of MEPs. If the Council still does not approve the Parliament's position, then the text is taken to a [...] "Conciliation Committee" [...] composed of the Council members plus {{an equal number of}} MEPs. If a Committee manages to adopt a joint text, it then has to be approved in a third reading by both the Council and Parliament or the proposal is abandoned.|$|E
