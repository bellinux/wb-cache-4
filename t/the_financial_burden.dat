The government, {{defending}} the measures as necessary in Hong Kong's changing economy, said that foreign domestic workers were still better paid {{than their counterparts}} in other Asian countries; according to James Tien, the monthly wage of Filipina maids in Singapore was about HK$1,400 and $1,130 in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|With feed-in tariffs, <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> falls {{upon the}} consumer. They reward {{the number of}} kilowatt-hours {{produced}} {{over a long period}} of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities, it may result in perceived overpayment. The price paid per kilowatt-hour under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity. Net metering refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged.|$|E

His own deputy, Erhard Milch, had a Jewish parent. But Göring supported the Nuremberg Laws of 1935, and later initiated economic measures unfavourable to Jews.

5|$|The most {{politically}} charged issue in Kentucky during Breckinridge's campaign, however, was the Old Court-New Court controversy. The Panic of 1819 had left many Kentuckians in dire financial straits. Legislators sought to relieve some of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> by passing {{a law of}} replevin which favored debtors. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, (the highest court in the Commonwealth at the time,) declared the law unconstitutional. The next year, an incensed General Assembly passed legislation that dissolved the court {{and replaced it with}} a new court. Neither court acknowledged the other as valid, and a confused public lost respect for public authority in general. The issue was generally split along party lines, with Democrats generally favoring the New Court and Whigs favoring the Old Court.|$|E
5|$|With {{investment}} subsidies, <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> falls {{upon the}} taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument {{in favour of}} feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out {{as a function of}} the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, thus rewarding the overstatement of power and tolerating poor durability and maintenance. Some electric companies offer rebates to their customers, such as Austin Energy in Texas, which offers $2.50/watt installed up to $15,000.|$|E

50|$|In 1877 Kappeneye was {{formateur}} of {{a liberal}} cabinet. Kappeyne became Ministers of the Interior and gave up his seat in parliament. He was appointed chairperson {{of the council of}} ministers, an office equivalent to today's Prime Minister of the Netherlands, formally temporarily, but he was the political leader of the cabinet. As minister he enacted important laws, such as a new law on primary education. This law put higher demands on the quality of school buildings and the wages and education of teachers. This raised <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burdens</b> of primary schools, but only public schools received state subsidies. This effectively eliminated religious schools which, without subsidies, were unable to sustain <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burdens.</b> This led to staunch opposition as part of the school struggle from Anti-Revolutionary and Catholic members of parliament, and a citizens' petition. Kappeyene however did not change his mind.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of the eugenics movement peaked during the Depression when sterilization was widely seen {{as a way of}} relieving society of <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burdens</b> imposed by defective individuals.

5|$|Aberdeen signed new co-managers in 1989, pairing Alex Smith and Jocky Scott. A {{number of}} foreign players were signed, {{including}} Dutch internationals Theo Snelders and Hans Gillhaus. In the 1989–90 season, the club won both the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup. In 1991, they lost the last game of the season, and the league title, to Rangers. Former player Willie Miller took over in 1992 and presided over two seasons where Aberdeen came close to winning the title. However, the club ended the 1994–95 season second-bottom, and {{had to rely on}} a play-off victory over Dunfermline Athletic to retain their Premier Division status. Miller was sacked in February 1995, and replaced by Roy Aitken. Despite a Scottish League Cup success in 1995, the club continued to struggle. Alex Miller and Paul Hegarty had spells in charge in the late 1990s, but with <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> of a new stand putting the club into debt {{for the first time in}} its history, the directors turned to Stewart Milne, a local businessman whose firm had built the stand, to bring business acumen to the running of the club.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Grunwald, First Battle of Tannenberg or Battle of Žalgiris, {{was fought}} on 15 July 1410 during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. The {{alliance}} of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila) and Grand Duke Vytautas, decisively defeated the German–Prussian Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Knights' leadership {{were killed or}} taken prisoner. Although defeated, the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege of their fortress in Marienburg (Malbork) and suffered minimal territorial losses at the Peace of Thorn (1411) (Toruń), with other territorial disputes continuing until the Peace of Melno in 1422. The knights, however, would never recover their former power, and <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands under their control. The battle shifted {{the balance of power}} in Central and Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish–Lithuanian union as the dominant political and military force in the region.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{occurred}} on Lady Day 1644, when an exceptionally high tide flooded the Upper Levels, and {{broke through the}} walls of the New Salt Channel. The Commissioners authorised {{the construction of a new}} sea sluice at Kent Wall, and work began in May 1646, but in September, they decided that it should be built at Blackwall instead. The height of Knelle Dam was regularly adjusted, in an attempt to manage the amount of water that still flowed along the Appledore Channel, and the conflicting needs of navigation and drainage. The Great Freshwater Sluice below Appledore deteriorated, and failed in 1650. A new sluice with three channels was built in 1669. <b>The</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> on the Upper Levels as a result of the sea entering the Wittersham Levels was huge, as they had to pay rent on all land that was not available to its original owners, and so in 1671, an agreement was reached that the sea would be excluded from the levels. Work began in 1680 to enclose areas of land on both sides of the valley, and was largely completed by 1684. The work included a new embanked channel for the Rother, which was built along the southern edge of the valley. It was called the Craven Channel, and ended at Craven Sluices.|$|E

5|$|Globally, women's {{access to}} health care remains a challenge, both in {{developing}} and developed countries. In the United States, before the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect, 25% of women of child bearing age lacked health insurance. In the absence of adequate insurance, women are likely to avoid important steps to self care such as routine physical examination, screening and prevention testing, and prenatal care. The situation is aggravated by the fact that women living below the poverty line are at greater risk of unplanned pregnancy, unplanned delivery and elective abortion. Added to <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> in this group are poor educational achievement, lack of transportation, inflexible work schedules and difficulty obtaining child care, all of which function to create barriers to accessing health care. These problems are much worse in developing countries. Under 50% of childbirths in these countries are assisted by healthcare providers (e.g. midwives, nurses, doctors) which accounts for higher rates of maternal death, up to 1:1,000 live births. This is despite the WHO setting standards, such as a minimum of four antenatal visits. A lack of healthcare providers, facilities, and resources such as formularies all contribute to high levels of morbidity amongst women from avoidable conditions such as obstetrical fistulae, sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike {{idea was}} an {{attractive}} one because initial construction {{was to be}} financed {{by the private sector}} via sales of revenue bonds, allowing state highway funds to be used for other important projects. The new toll road would also reduce traffic, and thus maintenance costs, on existing roads. There was also a concern that if Kansas lagged behind in turnpike construction, it might be bypassed by toll roads in other states, leaving it at an economic disadvantage. The toll concept also had the benefit of ultimately putting <b>the</b> <b>financial</b> <b>burden</b> on the drivers who actually used the road, instead of using tax revenue that had been collected from residents statewide. There was a some opposition to the plan, from both government officials and citizens, due to concerns that the toll revenue might not cover the repayments to investors, bankrupting the turnpike authority and burdening the state government with the remaining debt. There were also worries about the possibility of the turnpike requiring maintenance before the bonds had been repaid. Some critics also felt that the high speeds typical of turnpike driving were unsafe. As right-of-way for the project was obtained, the turnpike drew opposition from farmers and ranchers, who objected to the turnpike bisecting their property, making it difficult to access disjointed parcels of land.|$|E
