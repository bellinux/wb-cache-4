60|$|It {{appeared}} {{a wonderful thing}} to me, but it turned out that there was no will. He had never so much as thought of making one, so far as his papers afforded any evidence; for there was no kind of hint, sketch, or memorandum, of any <b>testamentary</b> <b>intention</b> whatever. What was scarcely less astonishing to me, was, that his affairs were in a most disordered state. It was extremely difficult, I heard, to make out what he owed, or what he had paid, or of what he died possessed. It was considered likely that for years he could have had no clear opinion on these subjects himself. By little and little it came out, that, in the competition on all points of appearance and gentility then running high in the Commons, he had spent more than his professional income, which was not a very large one, and had reduced his private means, if they ever had been great (which was exceedingly doubtful), to a very low ebb indeed. There was a sale of the furniture and lease, at Norwood; and Tiffey told me, little thinking how interested I was in the story, that, paying all the just debts of the deceased, and deducting his share of outstanding bad and doubtful debts due to the firm, he wouldn't give a thousand pounds for all the assets remaining.|$|E
50|$|Discontented {{with their}} {{inheritance}} prospects, the “heirs” seek {{to grab the}} whole of their wealthy relative’s fortune, enlisting {{the help of the}} notary’s clerk Goupil. The doctor conceals a letter of <b>testamentary</b> <b>intention</b> in a legal volume in his library. This, together with three bearer bonds, is stolen by one of the doctor’s nephews, the postmaster François Minoret-Levrault, who, in the era before railways, owns and manages the carriage and postchaise services in and out of Nemours.|$|E
40|$|This article {{questions}} whether wills law 2 ̆ 7 s disapproval of partial intestacy rests on defensible assumptions about testamentary intent. After examining {{the causes of}} and antidotes to partial intestacy, I make three primary points. First, the presumption against intestacy applies only to wills that contain an ambiguous bequest of the residue. Second, the law 2 ̆ 7 s disapproval of partial intestacy {{is due in part}} to its failure to make an important distinction between <b>testamentary</b> <b>intention</b> and dispositive intention. Third, a theory of passive intention, heretofore barely alluded to in the law of wills, supplies the necessary validation of partially intestate estates...|$|E

Have you considered {{what it is}} to undermine the confidence that should subsist between my daughter and myself? Have you considered my daughter's station in life, the projects I may contemplate for her advancement, the <b>testamentary</b> <b>intentions</b> I may have with reference to her? Have you considered anything, Mr. Copperfield?' ...|$|R

It is usually {{contained}} {{in the form of}} a letter from a Testator to his Executors, privately informing them of <b>testamentary</b> <b>intentions</b> on his part which he has not thought proper openly to acknowledge in his will. I leave you a hundred pounds; and I write a private letter enjoining you, on taking the legacy, not to devote it to your own purposes, but to give it to some third person, whose name I have my own reasons for not mentioning in my will. That is a Secret Trust.|$|R

I don't know as I see {{my way to}} hitting any of you quite {{in the right place}} neither.' He said this with a dark smile, and then began to bellow. What we were specially to be preserved from, according to his solicitations, was, despoilment of the orphan, suppression of <b>testamentary</b> <b>intentions</b> {{on the part of a}} father or (say) grandfather, appropriation of the orphan's house-property, feigning to give in charity to the wronged one from whom we withheld his due; and that class of sins. He ended with the petition, 'Give us peace!' which, speaking for myself, was very much needed after twenty minutes of his bellowing.|$|R
40|$|Since the {{recognition}} that, in will-making practice, solicitors owe duties to beneficiaries {{as well as}} to clients, the courts have stated solicitors' will-making duties with some precision. However the law of tort still fails to offer an agreed rationale for them. This article suggests that, tortious principles aside, these duties spring from a clearer articulation of the solicitor's professional role as caretaker of clients' <b>testamentary</b> <b>intentions.</b> This idea explains most adjudication on will-making, while placing reasonably clear limits on solicitors' liabilities. This article's theory of the solicitor's caretaking role is the basis of its criticism of Queensland Art Gallery Board of Trustees v Henderson Trout (a firm) — where duties to one who merely hoped to be a beneficiary were recognised — and its conclusion that the duties stated there are conceptually precarious and practically unsustainable...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{insights}} into recent developments in the way the law of succession allows people to use new technologies to document their <b>testamentary</b> <b>intentions</b> in an informal way. Design/methodology/approach – This article considers one area in which the law has arguably kept good pace with advances in society’s expectations and technological change – the law of succession. This article examines the legislative reforms in Queensland and other jurisdictions permitting the recognition of informal wills and the decided cases in the area. In particular, the article examines the decision in a Queensland Supreme Court case in which the court recognised the validity of a will made on an iPhone. Research limitations/implications – This is a doctrinal analysis, not an empirical study, and accordingly is limited to providing details specific to the legislation and the court cases selected...|$|R

"You are {{sufficiently}} acquainted with Mr. Clare's contempt for all social prejudices," [...] he continued, [...] "to anticipate his {{reception of the}} confession which his neighbor addressed to him. Five minutes after the interview had begun, the two old friends were as easy and unrestrained together as usual. In the course of conversation, Mr. Vanstone mentioned the pecuniary arrangement which he had made {{for the benefit of}} his daughter and of her future husband--and, in doing so, he naturally referred to his will here, on the table between us. Mr. Clare, remembering that his friend had been married in the March of that year, at once asked when the will had been executed: receiving the reply that it had been made five years since; and, thereupon, astounded Mr. Vanstone by telling him bluntly that the document was waste paper {{in the eye of the}} law. Up to that moment he, like many other persons, had been absolutely ignorant that a man's marriage is, legally as well as socially, considered to be the most important event in his life; that it destroys the validity of any will which he may have made as a single man; and that it renders absolutely necessary the entire re-assertion of his <b>testamentary</b> <b>intentions</b> in the character of a husband. The statement of this plain fact appeared to overwhelm Mr. Vanstone. Declaring that his friend had laid him under an obligation which he should remember to his dying day, he at once left the cottage, at once returned home, and wrote me this letter." ...|$|R
60|$|And now {{the company}} have gone down to breakfast, and tears have given place to smiles, for all the corks {{are out of the}} long-necked bottles, and their {{contents}} are disappearing rapidly. Miss Emma's papa {{is at the top of}} the table; Miss Emma's mamma at the bottom; and beside the latter are Miss Emma herself and her husband,-- admitted on all hands to be the handsomest and most interesting young couple ever known. All down both sides of the table, too, are various young ladies, beautiful to see, and various young gentlemen who seem to think so; and there, in a post of honour, is an unmarried aunt of Miss Emma's, reported to possess unheard-of riches, and to have expressed vast <b>testamentary</b> <b>intentions</b> respecting her favourite niece and new nephew. This lady has been very liberal and generous already, as the jewels worn by the bride abundantly testify, but that is nothing to what she means to do, or even to what she has done, for she put herself in close communication with the dressmaker three months ago, and prepared a wardrobe (with some articles worked by her own hands) fit for a Princess. People may call her an old maid, and so she may be, but she is neither cross nor ugly for all that; on the contrary, she is very cheerful and pleasant-looking, and very kind and tender- hearted: which is no matter of surprise except to those who yield to popular prejudices without thinking why, and will never grow wiser and never know better.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} the first extended taxonomy of charitable intention {{in the law}} of schemes. It does {{so in order to}} identify the legal functions of intention and suggest critical doctrinal (‘black letter’) reforms so that those functions can be better carried out. Where appropriate, it draws on Australasian statutory and common law innovation. It contrasts developments in those related jurisdictions as a reference point for English reform. Two functions of intention are identified. In the context of established trust reform, intention is one element of a broader process of ‘balanced variation’. The original intention of the donor is balanced against broadly defined effectiveness standards. By contrast, in the context of <b>testamentary</b> construction, <b>intention</b> has a different role. It is constructed simply to make a failed will possible to effect. Efficacious reform is possible with regards to both those functions, and so this thesis proposes a series of common law and legislative changes...|$|R
