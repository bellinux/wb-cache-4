25|$|In mountainous areas (or near {{rivers in}} mountainous areas), the main {{aquifers}} are typically unconsolidated alluvium, composed of mostly horizontal layers of materials deposited by water processes (rivers and streams), which in cross-section (looking at a two-dimensional {{slice of the}} aquifer) appear to be layers of alternating coarse and fine materials. Coarse materials, {{because of the high}} energy needed to move them, tend to be found nearer the source (mountain fronts or rivers), whereas the fine-grained material will make it farther from the source (to the flatter parts of the basin or overbank areas—sometimes called the pressure area). Since there are less fine-grained deposits near the source, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where aquifers are often unconfined (sometimes called the forebay area), or in hydraulic communication with the land surface.|$|E

He was also actively engaged in smaller projects relating to the UN working environment.

2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> {{which is}} [...] from where almost 3,000 people were torn to pieces by Islamic extremists... it is {{incredibly}} insensitive and audacious ... {{for them to}} build a mosque ... {{so that they could}} be in proximity to where that atrocity happened ... The idea that you would establish a religious institution that embraces the very shariah law that terrorists point to as their justification for what they did ... to build that where almost 3,000 people died, that is an obscenity to me.|$|E
50|$|For Santa Anna <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of rest, {{pleasure}} and entertainment, suitable for intrigue and conspiracy, {{as well as}} refuge in adversity and defeat. Countless times he took the road to Manga de Clavo from the capital, {{letting go of the}} responsibility of governing, abandoning presidential power in order to return to the tranquility of his domain.|$|R
50|$|Eventually {{the studio}} hotel {{ended up being}} too small for {{long-term}} international residents. So in 1986 Dierks bought a mansion with huge gardens - suitable for long-term stays - in Bruchstraße, around two kilometres away from the studios. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where musicians could stay in a relaxed atmosphere and enjoy creative breaks during long recording periods.|$|R

[...] As part of this witness, these walls show how one of the world's most advanced nations embraced a policy aimed at the annihilation of the Jewish people. These walls help restore the humanity of the millions who were loaded into trains and murdered by men who considered themselves cultured. And these walls remind us that the Holocaust was not inevitable; it was allowed to gather strength and force only because of the world's weakness and appeasement in the face of evil.|$|E
2500|$|In the postero {{inferior}} {{part of the}} thalamus is a {{place which}} raises unsolved problems. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> of endings of spinothalamic terminal axonal arborisations. The spinothalamic tracts ends in three [...] "lateral elements", the VCP, VCO, and VIm. Secondly, it ends, close to these, in intralaminar-limitans elements. The third place of ending, the basal formation (not a classical nucleus, {{in a place that}} was attributed to lower pulvinar), is particular only in one place named the nucleus basalis nodalis that was claimed by some to be the only relay of pain messages from layer I of the spinal cord. This place has been shown to send axons to the insula. In fact VCP also conveys painful stimuli.|$|E
60|$|Nor may what hath {{now been}} said {{be applied to}} those that are weak in faith, and so in every other grace; for the strongest grace when acted {{as well as we}} can, cannot cause that we depart from iniquity as we should. (l.) Because the strongest grace cannot act without opposition. (2.) Because we that are the actors are lame, infirm, and made weak by sin that dwells in us. (3.) Because grace and a state of grace is not that wherein the {{perfection}} designed for us doth lie, for that is in another world. (a.) <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to act faith in.

25|$|Hackney Central is {{the area}} that once would have been known as Hackney Village. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> that flourished from the Tudor period, when {{principal}} members of the Court had their houses in the surrounding area, and King Henry VIII of England had a palace (located near the modern Lea Bridge Road roundabout). Hackney Central remained a popular resort for Londoners {{until the end of}} the Georgian era, when this suburb of London began to be completely built up. Railways, trams and factories brought an end to Hackney's rural atmosphere during the Victorian era, and its fortunes declined.|$|R

50|$|By {{the age of}} 35, Arbab Jamshid {{had several}} trade {{chambers}} in the central market known as the Grand Bazaar of Tehran. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where, normally non-Moslems had difficult times establishing businesses due to heightened level of prejudice. It was deeply rooted in centuries of discrimination and unjust behavior. Jamshid managed to build respect by establishing relationships with the key political figures of his time. These included two kings of Iran, Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar and Mohammed Ali Shah Qajar, and other political figures such as the first Iranian Prime Minister Mirza Nasrullah Khan. These relationships were built upon mutual respect and often accompanied by generous gifts.|$|R

This Shelter, which is almost always so full {{that people have to}} be turned away, holds 261 women. It contains a separate room, where children are admitted with their mothers, half price, namely 1-1/2d., being charged per child. There is a kitchen attached where the inmates can buy a large mug of tea for a 1/2d., and a huge chunk of bread for a second 1/2d.; also, if I remember right, other articles of food, if they can afford such luxuries.|$|E

60|$|All night, then, {{we walked}} through {{the north side of}} the Carse under the high line of the Ochil mountains; and by Alloa and Clackmannan and Culross, all of which we avoided: and about ten in the morning, mighty hungry and tired, came to the little clachan of Limekilns. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> that sits near in by the water-side, and looks across the Hope to the town of the Queensferry. Smoke went up from both of these, and from other villages and farms upon all hands. The fields were being reaped; two ships lay anchored, and boats were coming and going on the Hope. It was {{altogether}} a right pleasant sight to me; and I could not take my fill of gazing at these comfortable, green, cultivated hills and the busy people both of the field and sea.|$|E

If we are all killed in the catching, and some, it seems, are missing already, yet they must be caught. Say, my brother, shall we draw on? The impi is nigh. Would that Faku, our captain yonder, might find two others to take our place, for in this thicket I had rather run last than first. Well, here leads the spoor--a wondrous mass of wolf-spoor mixed with the footprints of men; perhaps they are sometimes the one and sometimes the other--who knows, my brother? It is a land of ghosts and wizards. Let us on! Let us on!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> {{to give a}} man chances, and try what {{stuff is}} in him. The office {{involves}} a talent for governing, {{as well as for}} judging; talent for fighting also, in cases of extremity, and what is still better, a talent for avoiding to fight. None but a man of competent superior parts can do that function; I suppose, no imbecile could have existed many months in it, in the old earnest times. Conrad and his succeeding Hohenzollerns proved very capable to do it, as would seem; and grew and spread in it, waxing bigger and bigger, from their first planting there by Kaiser Barbarossa, a successful judge of men. And ever since that time, from [...] "about the year 1170," [...] down to the year 1815,--when so much was changed, owing to another (temporary) [...] "Kaiser" [...] of new type, Napoleon his name,--the Hohenzollerns have had a footing in Frankenland; and done sovereignty in and round Nurnberg, with an enlarging Territory in that region. Territory at last of large compass; which, under the names MARGRAFDOM OF ANSPACH, and of BAIREUTH, or in general MARGRAFDOM OF CULMBACH, which includes both, has become familiar in History.|$|E
