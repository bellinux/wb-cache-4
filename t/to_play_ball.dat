Three hours later Hanover went to City Hall to confront Giuliani, but a mayor's aide prevented her from entering the suite.|$|E
25|$|With his arm injured, Paige {{suddenly}} found himself unemployable. He looked for {{work as a}} manager or coach, but was unsuccessful. One ballclub owner {{was willing to give}} him a chance <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> again—J.L. Wilkinson of the Monarchs. Wilkinson offered him the modest opportunity to play, not for the Negro American League Monarchs, but for a second-string barnstorming team called the Travelers, which was now renamed the Satchel Paige All-Stars. Paige would pitch when he could and play first base when he could not.|$|E

My refusal <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> with my colleagues is deliberate, of course, since I view the standard philosophical terminology as worse than useless—a major obstacle to progress since it consists of so many errors." ...|$|E

2500|$|Weeks after Gore's {{contract}} {{was sold to}} the New York Giants, Chicago writer Harry Palmer wrote that whenever Gore [...] "failed <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> for all he was worth, Anson has reprimanded him." [...] Socially, Palmer added, Anson says [...] "Gore is all right. As an instance of their friendly relations, Anson says Gore applied to him for work this Winter, and the big Chicago captain promised him employment on the toboggan slides at the White Stocking Park whenever he wanted it."

2500|$|The {{day after}} his death, {{before the start of}} the Yankees' four-game set with the Baltimore Orioles in the Bronx, the team paid tribute to their {{deceased}} captain in a pre-game ceremony in which the starters stood at their defensive positions, save for the catcher's box, which remained empty. Following a prayer by Cardinal Terence Cooke, a moment of silence and [...] "America the Beautiful" [...] by Robert Merrill, the fans (announced attendance 51,151) burst into an eight-minute standing ovation. Jerry Narron, the man who replaced Munson behind the plate that night, remained in the dugout and did not enter the field until stadium announcer Bob Sheppard said, [...] "And now it is time <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>ball.</b> Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your co-operation." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Judge Roy Hofheinz now {{the sole}} {{owner of the}} {{franchise}} and his vision of a domed stadium <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> indoors complete, the Colt [...]45 moved into their new domed stadium in 1965. The Judge called the new domed stadium the Astrodome. [...] The name was in honor of Houston's importance to the country's space program and to match with {{the meaning of the}} name, the Colt [...]45s were renamed the Astros. [...] The new park, coined as the [...] "Eighth Wonder of the World" [...] did little to help the play on the field. [...] While several [...] "indoor" [...] firsts were accomplished, the team still finished ninth in the standings. [...] The attendance was high not because of the team accomplishments, but because people came from miles around to see the Astrodome.|$|E

2500|$|Gwynn's father {{encouraged}} {{his sons}} <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> in the makeshift baseball field that he assembled in their backyard. The setup was a {{narrow strip of}} grass that was longer than wide. Pulling the ball too much resulted in it being lost over the neighbor's fence, but left field being short ruled out hitting it to the opposite field as well. Once the brothers' supply of wiffle balls [...] was exhausted, they resorted to using a sock rolled in rubber bands, a wad of tape, or a hardened fig from a neighbor's tree. Although Gwynn was able to pull the ball in his back yard, he would naturally hit {{it the other way}} during regular games. Growing up, he attended Los Angeles Dodgers games and watched his hero, Willie Davis; the Dodgers outfielder had twice as many stolen bases as home runs (398 SB, 182 HR) in his career. Gwynn admired Davis for being black, left-handed, and [...] "aggressive but under control"; he respected Davis' work habits as well. Unlike other kids that tracked home run hitters, Gwynn checked the box scores in the newspaper every morning to follow high-average hitters like Pete Rose, George Brett and Rod Carew.|$|E
2500|$|In another episode, Redhorn and {{his friends}} are {{challenged}} by the Giants <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>ball</b> (or possibly chunkey) with their lives staked on the outcome. [...] The best Giant player was a woman with long red hair identical to Redhorn's. [...] The little heads on Redhorn's ears caused her to laugh {{so much that it}} interfered with her game and the Giants lost. The Giants lost all the other contests as well. Then they challenged Redhorn {{and his friends}} to a wrestling match in which they threw all but Red Horn's friend Turtle. Since Redhorn and his fellow spirits lost two out of the three matches, they were all slain. [...] The two wives of Redhorn were pregnant {{at the time of his}} death. [...] The sons born to each have red hair, with the older one having heads where his earlobes should be, and the younger one having heads in place of his nipples. [...] The older brother discovers where the Giants keep the heads of Redhorn and his friends. [...] The two boys use their powers to steal the heads from the Giants, whom they wipe out almost completely. [...] The boys bring back to life Redhorn, Storms as He Walks, and Turtle. In honor of this feat, Turtle and [...] "Storms as He Walks" [...] promise the boys special weapons.|$|E
