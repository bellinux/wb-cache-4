50|$|A snap general {{election}} {{was held in}} Italy on 13-14 April 2008. The election came after President Giorgio Napolitano dissolved Parliament on 6 February 2008, following {{the defeat of the}} government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi in a January 2008 Senate vote of confidence and the unsuccessful <b>tentative</b> <b>appointment</b> of Franco Marini with the aim to change the current electoral law. Under Italian law, elections must be held within 70 days of the dissolution. The voting determined the leader of Italy's 62nd government since the end of World War II. The coalition led by ex-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from The People of Freedom party defeated that of former Mayor of Rome, Walter Veltroni of the Democratic Party.|$|E
5000|$|Both Shaw and Council Member R.S. Sparks raised {{criticism}} {{in advance of}} the May 1927 primary election when they each sent letters on city stationery to people who were on a <b>tentative</b> list for <b>appointment</b> as election workers asking them to call on the two councilmen to discuss, in the words of Shaw's letter, [...] "several matters which I believe will prove advantageous to you." [...] Shaw denied that he was attempting to influence the prospective workers to influence his candidacy.|$|R
5000|$|He ran {{again in}} the 1927 {{election}} {{but this time he}} was linked to the unpopular mayoral administration of George E. Cryer, and he was soundly defeated in the final round by Virgil A. Martin, 7,843-2,889. Before that election he was criticized for having mailed letters on official city stationery to people who were on a <b>tentative</b> list for <b>appointment</b> as election precinct workers, asking them to call on him to [...] "discuss with you some matters in which I am interested." ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{critical}} {{challenges facing}} healthcare providers, and more broadly society, are controlling {{the cost of}} providing care to patients and improving the health outcomes. This dissertation leverages operations research and analytics to develop patient-centered decision support tools {{to improve the quality}} of care, patient safety, and timeliness of access to care at lower cost. This will result in bending the cost curve of healthcare spending and can contribute to a positive impact on health outcomes and improve the quality of life for many people. Three specific research topics are treated. The first research topic focuses on integrating and personalizing the monitoring and control of chronic diseases {{to improve the quality of}} care and avoid unnecessary testing and treatment. Our modeling paradigm incorporates each patient's past and present readings in a feedback-driven control model to optimally determine (1) when to schedule office visits and which subset of test to perform to monitor for disease progression (exploration), and (2) what levels of controllable disease risk factors should be targeted to slow the rate of disease progression (exploitation). Glaucoma is discussed as a case study. The second research topic strives to reduce medical errors at hospitals by reducing the number of error-prone patient handoffs via designing a new work shift schedule for healthcare providers. Previous research has focused on the communication aspects of handoffs and has provided recommendations to achieve high-quality handoffs. While a high-quality, structured handoff process is important, decreasing number of patient handoffs is an additional and fundamental way to reduce opportunities for medical errors caused by communication breakdowns, thereby supporting safer and more efficient patient care. The third topic of this dissertation is focused on providing timely access to care, which not only affects patient satisfaction but also directly influences patient safety and health outcomes. We present novel ideas on how to creatively use patient information to coordinate clinic and surgery appointment scheduling. The decision support tool proactively books a clinic and a <b>tentative</b> surgery <b>appointment</b> for all patients with different acuity levels to ensure access to surgery within a maximum wait time target that is clinically safe for them...|$|R
