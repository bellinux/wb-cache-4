2500|$|The {{original}} trapezoidal thread form, {{and still}} probably {{the one most}} commonly encountered worldwide, is the Acme thread form ( [...] ). The Acme thread was developed in 1894 as a profile well suited to power screws that has various advantages over the square thread, which had been the form of choice until then. It is easier to cut via either single-point threading or die than the square thread is (because the latter's shape requires <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> or die tooth geometry that is poorly suited to cutting); it wears better than square (because the wear can be compensated for); it is stronger than a comparably sized square thread; and it makes for smoother engagement of the half nuts on a lathe leadscrew than square does.|$|E
50|$|The {{toolpost}} is {{the part}} of a metalworking lathe which either holds the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> directly or holds a toolholder which contains the <b>tool</b> <b>bit.</b> There are a great variety of designs for toolposts (including basic toolposts, rocker toolposts, quick-change toolposts, and toolpost turrets) and toolholders (with varying geometry and features).|$|E

50|$|Originally, all <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> {{were made}} of high carbon tool steels with the {{appropriate}} hardening and tempering. Since the introductions of high-speed steel (HSS) (early years of the 20th century), sintered carbide (1930s), ceramic and diamond cutters, those materials have gradually replaced the earlier kinds of tool steel in almost all cutting applications. Most <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> today are made of HSS, cobalt steel, or carbide.|$|R

50|$|A <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> is a non-rotary {{cutting tool}} used in metal lathes, shapers, and planers. Such cutters are also often {{referred}} to by the set-phrase name of single-point cutting tool, as distinguished from other cutting tools such as a saw or water jet cutter. The cutting edge is ground to suit a particular machining operation and may be resharpened or reshaped as needed. The ground <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> is held rigidly by a tool holder while it is cutting.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tool</b> <b>bits</b> {{have been}} used for centuries, yet their further {{technological}} development continues even today. Before about 1900, almost all <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> were made by their users, and many machine shops had forges. In fact, good machinists were expected to have blacksmithing knowledge, and although the chemistry and physics of the heat treatment of steel were not well understood (as compared with today's sciences), the practical art of heat treatment was quite advanced, and something that most skilled metalworkers were comfortably acquainted with. <b>Tool</b> <b>bits</b> were made of carbon tool steels, which have high enough carbon content to take hardening well. Each bit was forged with a hammer, quenched, and then ground with a grindstone. The exact details of the heat treatment and tip geometry were a matter of individual experience and preference.|$|R

5000|$|Or it {{may hold}} the chuck, which then holds the {{workpiece}} in a lathe. In these cases the tool is often a stationary <b>tool</b> <b>bit,</b> although {{there are plenty of}} exceptions, such as in thread milling.|$|E
5000|$|Most fly cutters {{simply have}} a {{cylindrical}} center body that holds one <b>tool</b> <b>bit.</b> It {{is usually a}} standard left-hand turning tool that is held at an angle of 30 to 60 degrees. Fly cutters with two tool bits have no [...] "official" [...] name but are often called double fly cutters, double-end fly cutters, or fly bars. The latter name reflects that they often {{take the form of}} a bar of steel with a <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> fastened on each end. Often these bits will be mounted at right angles to the bar's main axis, and the cutting geometry is supplied by using a standard right-hand turning tool.|$|E
50|$|These gauges {{are most}} {{commonly}} used when hand-grinding threading tool bits on a bench grinder, although they may be used with tool and cutter grinders. When the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> has been ground to the correct angle, they may then be used to set the tool perpendicular to the workpiece.|$|E

50|$|A {{fly cutter}} is {{composed}} of a body into which one or two <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> are inserted. As the entire unit rotates, the <b>tool</b> <b>bits</b> take broad, shallow facing cuts. Fly cutters are analogous to face mills in that their purpose is face milling and their individual cutters are replaceable. Face mills are more ideal in various respects (e.g., rigidity, indexability of inserts without disturbing effective cutter diameter or tool length offset, depth-of-cut capability), but tend to be expensive, whereas fly cutters are very inexpensive.|$|R

50|$|Fly cutters are {{a type of}} {{milling cutter}} in which one or two tool bits are mounted. The bits spin around with the {{rotation}} of the spindle, taking facing cuts. Fly cutters are an application of tool bits where the bits are part of a rotary unit (whereas most other <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> use is linear).|$|E
5000|$|The {{dimensions}} {{between the}} piece and the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> {{can be changed}} about two axes to cut both vertically and horizontally into the internal surface.

5000|$|A box tool {{is mounted}} on the turret of a turret lathe or screw machine. It is {{essentially}} a toolpost that brings its follower rest along with it. A <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> (or several tool bits) and a compact follower rest (usually V-shaped or with two rollers) are mounted opposite {{each other in a}} body which surrounds the workpiece (forms a [...] "box" [...] around it). As the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> puts a lateral deflecting force on the workpiece, the follower rest opposes it, providing rigidity. A different and popular type of box tool uses two rollers rather than a follower rest. One roller is called a [...] "sizing roller" [...] and the other roller is called a [...] "burnishing roller". The rollers turn with the stock to reduce scarring on the finished turn. Opposing tool bits may be used (instead of a rest) to cancel each other's deflecting forces (called a [...] "balanced turning tool"), in which case the box tool begins to overlap in form, function, and identity with a hollow mill.|$|E
50|$|Follower rests {{can provide}} support that {{directly}} counteracts the springing {{force of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>bit,</b> right at {{the region of the}} workpiece being cut at any moment. In this respect they are analogous to a box tool. Any rest transfers some workpiece geometry errors from base (bearing surface) to processing surface. It depends on the rest design. For minimum transfer rate correcting rests are used. Rest rollers typically cause some additional geometry errors on the processing surface.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} grooves, slots, and pockets in the {{work-piece}} may be produced {{from a variety}} of tool bits. Common <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> types are: square end cutters, ball end cutters, t-slot cutters, and shell mills. Square end cutters can mill square slots, pockets, and edges. Ball end cutters mill radiused slots or fillets. T-slot cutters mill exactly that: T-shaped slots. Shell end cutters are used for large flat surfaces and for angle cuts. There are variations of these tool types as well.|$|E

50|$|The main use of {{high-speed}} steels {{continues to be}} in the manufacture of various cutting tools: drills, taps, milling cutters, <b>tool</b> <b>bits,</b> gear cutters, saw blades, planer and jointer blades, router bits, etc., although usage for punches and dies is increasing.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> {{is mounted}} in the {{toolpost}} (1) which may be of the American lantern style, traditional four-sided square style, or a quick-change style such as the multifix arrangement pictured. The advantage of a quick change set-up is to allow an unlimited number of tools to be used (up {{to the number of}} holders available) rather than being limited to one tool with the lantern style, or to four tools with the four-sided type. Interchangeable tool holders allow all tools to be preset to a center height that does not change, even if the holder is removed from the machine.|$|E
5000|$|A {{screw-cutting}} lathe is {{a machine}} (specifically, a lathe) capable of cutting very accurate screw threads via single-point screw-cutting, {{which is the}} process of guiding the [...] motion of the <b>tool</b> <b>bit</b> in a precisely known ratio to the rotating motion of the workpiece. This is accomplished by gearing the leadscrew (which drives the tool bit's movement) to the spindle with a certain gear ratio for each thread pitch. Every degree of spindle rotation is matched by a certain distance of linear tool travel, depending on the desired thread pitch (English or metric, fine or coarse, etc.).|$|E
