5|$|The {{ships were}} {{protected}} with Krupp armor. The deck armor was 40mm (1.57in) <b>thick</b> on the horizontal, and ranged between 140–75–140mm (5.51–2.95–5.51in) in the sloped deck armor. The main armored belt was 250mm (9.8in) <b>thick.</b> The forward conning tower had a 50mm (1.97in) <b>thick</b> roof, while the sides were 300mm (11.8in) <b>thick.</b> The aft conning tower had a roof protected by 30mm (1.2in) of armor plating and 140mm (5.51in) armor on the sides. The ship's citadel was also protected by 140mm of armor. The main battery turrets had 50mm <b>thick</b> roofs and 250mm sides. The secondary battery turrets were protected by 150mm (5.9in) of armor, while the casemated guns had gun shields 70mm (2.75in) <b>thick.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} to have been {{protected}} with Krupp and Wotan, Hart ("Wotan", Hard) armor plating. The class decks were 20mm <b>thick,</b> with 35mm <b>thick</b> sloped deck. The conning tower had a roof that was 50mm <b>thick</b> and sides 100mm <b>thick.</b> The inner layer of the armor belt was 50mm <b>thick</b> in critical areas amidships, and tapered down to zero protection at the stern and bow. The outer layer was 30mm amidships; it too tapered down to nothing {{at both ends of}} the ships. The gun turrets had the same armor protection as the preceding light cruiser : the sides were 35mm <b>thick,</b> the faces were 80mm <b>thick,</b> the roofs ranged in thickness from 2035mm. The armor protecting the turret barbettes was 60mm <b>thick.</b>|$|E
5|$|Von der Tanns armor {{consisted}} of Krupp cemented and nickel steel. The main belt armor was 80–120mm (3.1–4.7in) <b>thick</b> forward, 250mm(9.8in) <b>thick</b> over the ship's citadel, and was 100mm(3.9in) <b>thick</b> aft. The forward conning tower {{was protected by}} 250mm(9.8in), while the aft conning tower by 200mm(7.9in). The four turrets had 230mm(9.1in) faces, 180mm(7.1in) sides, and 90mm(3.5in) on the roofs. The horizontal armor measured 25mm(0.98in) <b>thick,</b> and the sloping deck armor was 50mm(2.0in) <b>thick.</b> Like the armored cruiser Blücher before her, she was protected by a torpedo bulkhead, 25mm(0.98in) <b>thick.</b> It was set back a distance of 4meters(13ft) from the outer hull skin, the space in between being used to store coal.|$|E

5|$|All whales have a <b>thick</b> {{layer of}} blubber. In species that {{live near the}} poles, the blubber can be as <b>thick</b> as 11 inches. This blubber can help with {{buoyancy}} (which is helpful for a 100-ton whale), protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard}} time getting through a <b>thick</b> layer of fat, and energy for fasting when migrating to the equator; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. It can constitute as much as 50% of a whale's body weight. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with <b>thick</b> lanugos.|$|E

5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission that results in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction.
