The dictator’s job is <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> the Good Society, to impose the needed order, and the people's job is to obey the dictator, thereby enjoying the fruits of the good society.

5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics.

Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
