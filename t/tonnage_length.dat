30|$|The {{coastal and}} marine {{surveillance}} systems are mainly based on sensors such as radar and sonar, which allow detecting marine vessels and taking responsive actions. Vision-based surveillance systems containing electro-optic imaging sensors {{can also be}} exploited for developing robust and cost-effective systems. Categorization of maritime vessels is of utmost importance to improve the capabilities of such systems. For a given image of a ship, {{the goal is to}} automatically identify it using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

A large-scale dataset would be beneficial for extracting such clues and learning compelling models from images containing several types of vessels.|$|E

30|$|Moreover, as novel problems, {{we attempt}} tasks of {{predicting}} and classifying vessel attributes: draught, gross <b>tonnage,</b> <b>length,</b> and summer deadweight. The objective {{here is to}} quantify these attributes based on 2 -D visual content only, which may ameliorate the practicality of coastal surveillance systems, since that avoids the need for retaining meta-data for optical systems, namely camera parameters, camera position, and distance to the vessel, while estimating physical dimensions of a vessel based on its appearance. Another beneficial use of this task may be for safe marine traffic routing {{as well as for}} the calculation of port access and transit fees, when vessel dimensions need to be known. Furthermore, there are studies, proving that presence of attribute-based representations are helpful for several computer vision tasks including object recognition [16], detection [17], and identification [18]. The attribute-based learned representations for marine vessels in this work may be utilized in a similar fashion aiding other visual analysis tasks.|$|E

40|$|AIS (Automatic Identification System) {{data have}} proven to be a {{valuable}} source to investigate vessel behavior. The analysis of AIS data provides a possibility to recognize vessel behavior patterns in a waterway area. Furthermore, AIS data can be used to classify vessel behavior into several categories. The analysis results would help the port authority and other equivalent parties in port design and optimization or marine traffic management. For researchers, it provides a systematic way to understand, simulate and predict vessel behavior. This paper focuses on vessel classification in the Botlek area, Rotterdam from the perspective of vessel behavior. In this paper, the vessel properties, including vessel type, GT (Gross <b>Tonnage),</b> <b>length</b> and beam, have been analyzed to investigate the vessel behavior, which is described by four factors including heading, COG (Course over Ground), SOG (Speed over Ground), and position. In order to discover the behavior patterns in normal situations, several thresholds are set in order to filter the collected AIS data to define such situations. By plotting the AIS data, behavioral changes with the changes of properties have been observed. Hence, the correlations between vessel behavior and different vessel properties are investigated. The results reveal that a vessel’s sailing position and COG are both strongly determined by beam, while SOG is affected by GT. For the heading of a vessel, no obvious correlation with any vessel property is found. Each behavioral factor is clustered according to the correlated vessel property. This way, the criteria to classify the vessels are determined. The vessel classification results based on their behavior would likely to lead to more consistency in the analysis, simulation and prediction of the vessel behavior. The reason is that the development of such a simulation model is based on a systematic recognition of the vessel behavior patterns. Transport & PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
