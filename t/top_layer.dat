5|$|Agriculture {{damage was}} widespread. Across the country 40% of the {{sugarcane}} crop, 80–100% of the banana crop, 75% {{of the coffee}} trees under three years old, and 20% of the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of the cocoa crop were lost to the storm. Insured damage in Jamaica was initially estimated at around US$1.5billion, but post-storm analysis showed that it was closer to US$310million.|$|E

The occupational categorization in Chirand covers three periods – Period I Neolithic (2500–1345 BC), Period II Chalcolithic (1600 B.C) and Period III Iron age. Carbon dating of the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of the Neolithiic period dates the layer between 1910 BC and 1600 BC. The {{lowest level of}} the finds date to 200 BC.|$|E

40|$|Sandwich {{structures}} {{consist of}} one light core <b>layer</b> and two <b>top</b> <b>layers,</b> which form the load-bearing structure. These layers {{have to be}} stiff and strong and have to protect the structure against indentations. The main task of the core layer {{is to keep the}} <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> in place and to generate a high shear stiffness. In order to obtain the required space between the <b>top</b> <b>layers,</b> the core layer has to have a high specific volume. Different sandwich materials with aluminium or steel <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> and cores of aluminium combs, corrugated aluminium sheets or aluminium foams are already known. In order to obtain better properties in terms of strength fibre-reinforced plastics (FRP) are utilised as top layers; this is the focus of numerous of the current research studies. The sole use of these materials leads to negative effects regarding the damage and impact behaviour. New <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> with high strength and high stiffness characteristics as well as good damage tolerances are to be expected by utilising metal layers in combination with endless fibre-reinforced plastics, so called hybrid laminates. These hybrid laminates combine the positive properties of metals (e. g. ductility) and fibre-reinforced plastics (e. g. tensile strength). The focus of this investigation lies on the production and characterisation of sandwich structures with aluminium foam core layers and hybrid laminate <b>top</b> <b>layers.</b> The foam cores consist of closed pore aluminium foams produced by utilising ingot and powder metallurgical techniques. The <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> consist of glass fibre-reinforced thermoplastics and aluminium layers. The production of the sandwich materials is realised by means of thermal pressing...|$|R

Nablus, {{to the present}} day is famed for its kanafeh, partly due to its use of a white-brined cheese called Nabulsi after the city. Boiled sugar is used as a syrup for kanafeh.|$|E
5|$|The father {{panel is}} {{signed and dated}} on both sides, {{in what may be}} the oldest extant {{instance}} of Dürer's signature monogram of a large open A and small d. However this inscription and the 1490 date are later additions. The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: retouching has largely removed Dürer's <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring.|$|E
5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a <b>top</b> <b>layer,</b> were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E

40|$|While {{considering}} lightweight design, {{sandwich structures}} have become indispensable, especially when thinking of high bending stiffness. In general they {{consist of a}} low density material as core and two <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> which bear the load. Various sandwiches consisting of numerous of different material combinations are available. For instance honeycombs or polymer foams are widely used as core materials. One of the sub-projects of the Cluster of Excellence called MERGE deals with the research regarding a new material combination for sandwich structures. Hereby aluminium foam is used as the core and fibre reinforced thermoplastics are used as the <b>top</b> <b>layers.</b> Advantages of this combination are for example the high damping capability, the feasibility of very complex designs and the high temperature resistance of the core material, on which the <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> can be compression moulded. The main focus of the investigation, reported in this paper, is the characterisation of the bonding properties of sandwiches made of aluminium foam and <b>top</b> <b>layers</b> consisting of glass fibre reinforced polyamide via tensile tests perpendicular to the faces...|$|R
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the <b>top</b> <b>layer.</b> Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E
5|$|Kanafeh is {{the most}} famed Nabulsi sweet. Originating in Nablus during the 15th century, by 1575, its recipe was {{exported}} throughout the Ottoman Empire — which controlled Palestine at the time. Kanafeh is made of several fine shreds of pastry noodles with honey-sweetened cheese in the center. The <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of the pastry is usually dyed orange with food coloring and sprinkled with crushed pistachios. Though it is now made throughout the Middle East, to the present day, kanafeh Nabulsi enjoys continued fame, partly due to its use of a white-brine cheese called jibneh Nabulsi.

5|$|Taller, heavier {{buildings}} such as skyscrapers {{also required}} stronger foundations than smaller buildings. Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble, {{which was in}} turn laid down on the soft <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of the ground called the overburden. As buildings became taller and heavier, the overburden could not support their weight, and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below. In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft soil and often below the water table, risking the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete. The deeper the foundations needed to be, the greater the challenge. Special water-tight boxes called caissons were invented {{to deal with this}} problem in England in 1830 and adopted in the U.S. during the 1850s and 1860s.|$|E

5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger dark spots, and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
5|$|Marasmius sasicola {{produces}} colourless, ellipsoid basidiospores {{of between}} 8 and 10 by 4 to 6micrometres (μm). The spores have no ornamentation, are not amyloid and have thin cell walls. In his examinations, Takahashi did not observe any basidia, {{but he did}} describe the club-shaped basidioles (immature basidia) which measured from 18 to 26 by 6 to 10μm. The tightly packed cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} the gill) form a sterile edge to the gill, and there are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the face of the gill). The pileipellis, the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of the cap, forms a hymeniderm, a cell structure reminiscent of the hymenium on the gills. This is made up of club-shaped cells measuring between 2 and 8 by 7 to 10μm, with reddish-brown, smooth cell walls up to 1μm thick. The stipitipellis, the outermost layer of the stem, is made up of cylindrical hyphae measuring from 3 to 6μm in width, which run parallel to one another. They have featureless brown cell walls measuring up to 1μm thick, and the septa (the walls separating individual cells) have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|The pileipellis, the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis {{is made up}} of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick.

They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills is basically the same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E

Consumer Reports' blog The Consumerist noted that two single Stackers at $1.00 included more cheese and more bacon than one double Stacker for $2.00. Three single Stackers had 50% more cheese and double the bacon of one triple Stacker.

5|$|Soil is {{the living}} <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of mineral and organic dirt {{that covers the}} surface of the planet. It is the chief {{organizing}} centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The decomposition of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing minerals and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the pedosphere where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the detritivores that regulate soil formation. Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called bioturbation. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil microorganisms are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils. Paleoecological studies of soils places the origin for bioturbation to a time before the Cambrian period. Other events, such as the evolution of trees and the colonization of land in the Devonian period {{played a significant role in}} the early development of ecological trophism in soils.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{passed to}} the south of most of the Greater Antilles, though its outer rain bands crossed many of the islands, and {{delivered}} hurricane force winds to Jamaica. Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Cayman Islands were mostly spared, though Hurricane Dean passed 50 to 60mi (80 to 95km) south of Jamaica as a Category4 hurricane. In Jamaica the rain caused flooding on {{the eastern side of the}} island and landslides on the northeast end. At least two direct deaths were confirmed. Over 1,500 roofs were lost, primarily to the hurricane force winds, and 1,582 of the 3,127 damaged homes were uninhabitable. Landslides and fallen trees blocked hundreds of roads, particularly in the rural northeast region. As in the Lesser Antilles, Jamaica suffered severe damage to its agricultural sector. Forty percent of the sugarcane crop, 80 to 100% of the banana crop, 75% of the coffee trees under three years old, and 20% of the <b>top</b> <b>layer</b> of the cocoa crop were lost. Hurricane Dean affected 248 roads, including 186 that were blocked: 10 were blocked in the Kingston metropolitan region, 14 sections were blocked in St. Andrew, 43 roads were blocked in St. Catherine, eight roads were blocked in the Western Region (Saint James, Hanover, Westmoreland, and Trelawny), and 110 roads were blocked in the Northeast region.|$|E
