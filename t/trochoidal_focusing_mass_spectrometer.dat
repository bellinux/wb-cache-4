The European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft will encounter comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, another Jupiter-family comet of likely Kuiper belt origin, in 2014 and accompany it from almost aphelion to and past perihelion. Onboard Rosetta is the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) which consists of two <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometers</b> and a pressure sensor (Balsiger et al., 2007).

In this paper we discuss the performance of this sensor on the basis of measurements of the terrestrial hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios performed with the flight spare instrument in the lab. We also show that the instrument on Rosetta is capable of measuring the D/H and the oxygen isotopic ratios even in the very low density water background released by the spacecraft.

Aims. We study heterogeneities in the coma during three periods starting in October 2014 (summer in the northern hemisphere) and ending in February 2016 (end of winter in the northern hemisphere). We provide {{a detailed description of}} the main volatiles dynamics (H 2 O, CO 2, CO) and their abundance ratios. Methods. We analysed and compared the data of the Reflectron-Type Time-Of-Flight (RTOF) <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> with data from both the Double <b>Focusing</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (DFMS) and COPS during the comet escort phase. This comparison has demonstrated that the observations performed with each ROSINA sensor are indeed consistent. Furthermore, we used a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) model to compare modelled densitites with in situ detections. Results. Our analysis shows how the active regions of the main volatiles evolve with the seasons with a variability mostly driven by the illumination conditions; this is the case except for an unexpected dichotomy suggesting the presence of a dust layer containing water deposited in the northern hemisphere during previous perihelions hiding the presence of CO 2. The influence of various parameters is investigated in detail: distance to the comet, heliocentric distance, longitude and latitude of sub-satellite point, local time, and phase angle...|$|R

Here {{we find that the}} radiolysis of icy grains in low-density environments such as the presolar cloud may induce the production of large amounts of molecular oxygen. We also show that molecular oxygen can be efficiently trapped in clathrates formed in the protosolar nebula (PSN), and that its incorporation as crystalline ice is highly implausible, because this would imply much larger abundances of Ar and N- 2 than those observed in the coma. Assuming that radiolysis has been the only O- 2 production mechanism at work, we conclude that the formation of comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is possible in a dense and early PSN in the framework of two extreme scenarios: (1) agglomeration from pristine amorphous icy grains/particles formed in ISM and (2) agglomeration from clathrates that formed during the disk's cooling. The former scenario is found consistent with the strong correlation between O- 2 and H 2 O observed in comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's coma while the latter scenario requires that clathrates formed from ISM icy grains that crystallized when entering the PSN...|$|R

Proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (1 H-NMR and 13 C-NMR) were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500, Avance 600 or ARX 500, using the deuterated solvent as lock and the residual protiated solvent as internal standard. All chemical shifts are quoted using the δ scale, and all coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hertz (Hz). Electrospray mass spectra (ESI-MS) were measured on a VG ProSpec triple <b>focusing</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> 3 : A mixture of the carboxylic acid derivative 1 [1] (0. 50 g, 0. 79 mmol), diethylene glycol (2) (0. 42 g, 3. 97 mmol), 1, 3 -dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (0. 33 g, 1. 59 mmol) and 4 -dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (cat. amount) in CH 2 Cl 2 (20 mL) was stirred for 1 h a...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe European Space Agency’s Rosetta {{spacecraft}} is now {{close in}} a bound orbit around comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67 P/C-G). On board is the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA) instrument suite. ROSINA {{consists of two}} <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometers,</b> the Double <b>Focusing</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (DFMS) and the Reflectron-type Time-Of-Flight (RTOF), {{as well as the}} COmet Pressure Sensor (COPS). ROSINA is designed to detect and monitor the neutral gas and thermal plasma environment in the comet’s coma by in situ investigation. The two <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometers</b> have high dynamic ranges and complement each other with high mass resolution (DFMS) and high time resolution and large mass range (RTOF). Especially the unprecedented sensitivity and mass resolution of DFMS together with the large mass range of RTOF will allow determining precisely light species (e. g. isotopologues) as well as detecting heavy organics. The pressure sensor COPS is capable to derive total gas densities, velocities, and temperatures. To date only limited data for the composition of cometary comae at heliocentric distances of more than 2. 5 AU are available. The set is dominated by CO and daughter species of water from bright comets originating in the Oort cloud. While some molecules can be detected from far by remote sensing (e. g. CO) other molecules are much more difficult to observe from ground (e. g. CO 2). The Rosetta mission presents a unique opportunity to directly probe the parent species in the thin cometary atmosphere of a Kuiper-belt object at more than 2. 5 AU from the Sun and relate it to ground-based observations. Distances that far from the Sun are of particular interest as the comet’s activity transitions from being super volatiles dominated to being water dominated. We will report on the first measurements of the volatile inventory obtained from ROSINA observations as Rosetta is following comet 67 P/C-G in close vicinity...|$|R
40|$|Applications of tandem mass {{spectrometry}} (MS/MS) in complex mixture analysis {{and the development}} of a new MS/MS instrument are described. The MS/MS methodology is applied to the analysis of coal liquids and diesel particulates. Individual components are identified by daughter scans, while parent and neutral loss scans are used to screen the mixture for selected types of compounds. The selective ionization methods of negative chemical ionization and ammonia chemical ionization are employed to increase specificity in these analyses. High and low energy MS/MS data are compared for a group of isomeric pairs of methyl aza and amino polynuclear aromatic compounds. Quite different spectra are observed in the two energy regimes, however, in both regimes the isomers are distinguishable. A library of low energy MS/MS spectra is developed on a triple quadrupole <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> and is used for the identification of individual components in a diesel particulate sample. ^ Chemical ionization {{mass spectrometry}} is used for the quantitation of methylated nucleosides formed from in vitro and in vivo DNA alkylations. The potential for tandom mass spectrometry to decrease detection limits in these determinations is shown. ^ A new hybrid <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> is constructed for MS/MS studies and its performance evaluated. The new instrument, of BEQQ configuration, combines a double <b>focussing</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> with a quadrupole collision cell and a quadrupole mass analyzer. The instrument features four different reaction regions and is capable of high resolution MS/MS, high and low energy MS/MS, and consecutive collision experiments. New scan types are also possible. Studies on a variety of systems establish that the BEQQ performs well for low energy MS/MS. High resolution and high mass MS/MS capabilities are also demonstrated. Early applications, including parent scans and consecutive collision experiments, are described. In addition, an improved arrangement for angle-resolved mass spectrometry, which utilizes the BE section of the hybrid instrument, is described. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractElectrospray mass {{spectra of}} {{carbonic}} anhydrase (MW ∼ 29000) and ovalbumin (MW ∼ 45000) were obtained on a double <b>focusing</b> magnetic secter <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> {{by using a}} single stage of mechanical pumping in the interface between atmospheric pressure and high vacuum. Full scan spectra of lysozyme were recorded on 15 fmoles consumed. In addition, accurate mass measurement was demonstrated for peptides and proteins, and resolution in excess of 10, 000 (m/Δm, 10 % valley) was observed. These results clearly show that high performance magnetic sector <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometers</b> can be advantageously interfaced to an atmospheric pressure electrospray ion source...|$|R
