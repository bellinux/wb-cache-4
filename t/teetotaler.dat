5|$|Negative {{impressions}} of drinking {{alcohol in the}} Biden and Finnegan families and in the neighborhood led to Joe Biden becoming a <b>teetotaler.</b> Biden suffered from stuttering through much of his childhood and into his twenties, and overcame it by spending many hours reciting poetry {{in front of a}} mirror.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with his}} good friends and former {{teammates}} from his time in Brommapojkarna, John Guidetti and Simon Tibbling, he is a <b>teetotaler</b> {{and has never been}} drunk. Ludwig attended primary schools Aspuddens skola and Nybohovsskolan, both with focus on football.|$|E
5|$|Beecher {{advocated}} for the temperance movement {{throughout his career}} and was a strict <b>teetotaler.</b> Following the Civil War, he also became {{a leader in the}} women's suffrage movement. In 1867, he campaigned unsuccessfully to become a delegate to the New York Constitutional Convention of 1867-1868 on a suffrage platform, and in 1869, was elected unanimously as the first president of the American Woman Suffrage Association.|$|E
5|$|Benchley's drinking, {{already a}} problem, worsened {{and he was}} {{diagnosed}} with cirrhosis of the liver. (Ironically, when younger, he had been an adamant <b>teetotaler.)</b> While he completed his year's work, his condition continued to deteriorate, and Benchley died in a New York hospital on November 21, 1945. His family opted for a private funeral service, and his body was cremated and interred in a family plot on the island of Nantucket.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} at Harvard, he adopted {{a number of}} habits which he {{maintained}} {{for much of his}} life. He organized and led the Total Abstinence League, a temperance organization; he was a <b>teetotaler</b> and never drank alcohol. He was active in the Baptist church, in which he had considered becoming a minister.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble {{endured a}} period where {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a <b>teetotaler,</b> Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E
5|$|Hayes courted {{his future}} wife, Lucy Webb, {{during his time}} there. His mother had {{encouraged}} him {{to get to know}} Lucy years earlier, but Hayes had believed she was too young and focused his attention on other women. Four years later, Hayes began {{to spend more time with}} Lucy. They became engaged in 1851 and married on December 30, 1852, at the house of Lucy's mother. Over the next five years, Lucy gave birth to three sons: Birchard Austin (1853), Webb Cook (1856), and Rutherford Platt (1858). Lucy, a Methodist, was a <b>teetotaler</b> and abolitionist. She influenced her husband's views on those issues, although he never formally joined her church.|$|E
5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a <b>teetotaler</b> and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
5|$|In {{his inaugural}} season of {{competitive}} football, Liddell confirmed {{his status as}} a regular and contributed to Liverpool's first championship since 1923. Positioned on the left wing, he appeared in 34 matches, scored seven goals, and supplied strikers Albert Stubbins and Jack Balmer with numerous assists. Severe conditions in the winter disrupted the league's schedule and Liverpool did not secure the title until 14 June 1947. The club won its final game away against Wolves 2-1, with Liddell setting up one of the goals, but the championship was decided by Sheffield United defeating contenders Stoke in the season's last fixture. The game coincided with the Senior Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton at Anfield, where tannoys announced the result during the match. As a strict <b>teetotaler,</b> Liddell refrained from accepting glasses of champagne to celebrate the success.|$|E
5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In sharp {{contrast}} to the Earl, Fisher was a <b>teetotaler</b> and a vegetarian, and he hoped she would be a calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|Treloar {{returned}} to the AWM on 2September 1946 and was formally discharged from the Army in 1947. At the time he believed {{he was suffering from}} bad health, but wanted to resume his work at the Memorial rather than enter hospital. While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne, their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial's library. Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a <b>teetotaler</b> and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E
5|$|From the 1854 {{establishment}} of railways in Norway to 1909, no dining service was offered aboard trains; passengers {{were allowed to}} bring food with them. Train stations also lacked dining facilities. The first dining service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen. He established the restaurant at Drammen Station, and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a dining service aboard the express trains on the Bergen Line, which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two carriages from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. These were {{to be paid for}} by the state, but the Parliament of Norway delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability of restaurant carriages on trains. The plans were opposed by the <b>teetotaler</b> faction of Parliament, but there was a majority in favor of dining service. To get the carriages in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated. After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the carriages was refunded by NSB. In 1910, when President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt visited Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, several restaurant carriages were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant carriages were put in regular service on the Østfold Line.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 {{passage of}} the Moore {{amendment}} expanded the state's Nicholson local option law to apply to all liquor license applicants within a local township or city ward. The {{next step was to}} seek countywide prohibition. The IASL appealed to the general public, holding large rallies in Indianapolis and elsewhere, to support a county option law that would provide a more restrictive ban on alcohol. In September 1908 Indiana governor J. Frank Hanly, a Methodist, Republican, and <b>teetotaler,</b> called for a special legislative session to establish a county option that would allow county voters to prohibit alcohol sales throughout their county. The state legislature passed the bill with only a narrow margin. By November 1909 seventy of Indiana's ninety-two counties were dry. In 1911 a Democratic legislative majority replaced the county option with the Proctor law, a less-geographically restrictive local option, and the number of dry counties was reduced to twenty-six. Despite the setback prohibition advocates continued to lobby legislators for support. In December 1917 several temperance organizations formed the Indiana Dry Federation to fight the politically powerful liquor interests, with the IASL joining the group a short time later. The Federation and the League vigorously campaigned for statewide prohibition, which the Indiana General Assembly adopted in February 1917. Subsequent legal challenges delayed implementation of statewide prohibition until 1918, when a court ruled in June that Indiana's prohibition law was constitutionally valid.|$|E
5|$|Rickey was a {{conservative}} <b>teetotaler,</b> while O'Malley freely enjoyed vices such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco. As O'Malley became {{more involved in}} affairs, he became critical of Rickey, the highest-paid individual in baseball, counting salary, attendance bonuses, and player contract sales commissions. O'Malley and Rickey had very different backgrounds and philosophies. It was O'Malley who put pressure on Rickey to fire manager Leo Durocher, who O'Malley felt was a drain on attendance. In board of directors meetings, O'Malley also opposed Rickey's extravagances. When he was with his political friends, he made fun of Rickey at every chance. Daily News columnist Jimmy Powers would deride Rickey for selling off players and for general miserliness. When Rickey asked O'Malley, the team lawyer, if he should sue, O'Malley said no. Powers' campaign became so public that after the 1946 season Rickey gave each player a new Studebaker, which gave O'Malley, a Dodgers shareholder, reason to speak ill of Rickey in the press. It {{got to the point}} where everything Rickey did was something O'Malley derided: O'Malley thought Rickey's construction of the state of the art Vero Beach spring training facility, known as Dodgertown, was extravagant; he thought Rickey's investment in the Brooklyn Dodgers of the All-America Football Conference was questionable; he fought Rickey on the team's beer sponsor; and he demanded that players return their 1947 World Series rings before receiving the new ones Rickey ordered. As team lawyer, O'Malley had a role in breaking the racial barrier as well. In particular, he had a significant role in Rickey's top-secret search for suitable ballplayers to break the color barrier and then later he had a role in assessing the ongoing legal risks to the franchise.Other accounts, however, suggest that he played a lesser role in Robinson's signing.|$|E
25|$|He was a <b>teetotaler.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nerman was a {{vegetarian}} and a strict <b>teetotaler.</b> Alcoholism {{was a major}} social problem in Sweden in the early 20th century, and Nerman considered alcohol to be a drug that made the working class passive instead of fighting for better conditions.|$|E
25|$|Wilkinson {{is widely}} {{known as a}} <b>teetotaler,</b> but broke that habit after England lost to South Africa in the 2007 Rugby World Cup Final. He has been {{following}} Buddhist principles and teachings to help control his perfectionist tendencies, according to an interview he gave with The Times newspaper.|$|E
25|$|In 1830 Snow {{became a}} member of the Temperance Movement, and lived for a decade or so as a {{vegetarian}} and <b>teetotaler.</b> In the mid-1840s his health deteriorated, and he returned to meat-eating and drinking wine. He continued drinking pure water (via boiling) throughout his adult life. He never married.|$|E
25|$|Both Henrietta Ward and {{her husband}} were {{supporters}} of the cause of women's suffrage. The Wards traveled in an artistic circle that included figures like Charles Dickens and George Cruikshank. In one account, Dickens and Cruikshank nearly brawled when the <b>teetotaler</b> Cruikshank prevented Henrietta Ward from drinking a glass of sherry at a Dickens party.|$|E
25|$|Thompson {{actually}} {{appeared in}} the 1975 movie Farewell, My Lovely, starring Robert Mitchum. He played the character Judge Baxter Wilson Grayle. When Thompson's fortunes were fading, he made the acquaintance of writer Harlan Ellison who had long admired Thompson's books. Though Thompson still drank heavily (preferring to meet at the famed writer's haunt, the Musso & Frank Grill) and Ellison was a <b>teetotaler</b> (preferring fast food restaurants), they often met for meals and conversation.|$|E
25|$|Eisuke had a {{drinking}} problem, over which his wife often went {{to seek help}} at a local Christian church with her children. Christianity therefore was the most familiar religion for Senkichi since his childhood. One day {{when he was a}} high school student, Senkichi was advised by his minister to read Kanzō Uchimura's The Biblical Studies, which impressed him and made him a devout Christian. Unlike his father, he grew up to be a <b>teetotaler.</b>|$|E
25|$|Jones married Mary Joanna ("Janie") Brady (born 1866), {{whose father}} owned the {{boarding}} house where Jones was staying. Since she was Catholic, {{he decided to}} convert and was baptized on November 11, 1886, at St. Bridget's Catholic Church in Whistler, Alabama, to please her. They were married at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Jackson on November 25, 1886. They bought a house at 211 West Chester Street in Jackson, where they raised their three children. By all accounts he was a devoted family man and <b>teetotaler.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{few years}} later, Speck's religious, <b>teetotaler</b> mother {{fell in love}} with a {{traveling}} insurance salesman from Texas, Carl August Rudolph Lindberg, whom she met on a train trip to Chicago. The hard-drinking, peg-legged Lindberg, with a 25-year criminal record that started with forgery and included several arrests for drunk driving, was the opposite of Speck's sober, hardworking father. Speck's mother married Lindberg on May 10, 1950 in Palo Pinto, Texas. Speck and his younger sister Carolyn stayed with their married sister Sara Thornton in Monmouth for a few months so Speck could finish second grade, before joining their mother and Lindberg in rural Santo, Texas, 40 miles west of Fort Worth, Texas, where Speck attended third grade.|$|E
25|$|Bennett {{moved to}} Calgary in 1897. A lifelong {{bachelor}} and <b>teetotaler</b> (although Bennett was known by select associates to occasionally drink alcohol when {{the press was}} not around to observe this), he led a rather lonely life in a hotel and later, in a boarding house. For a while a younger brother roomed with him. He ate his noon meal on workdays at the Alberta Hotel. Social life, such as it was, centred on church. There was, however, no scandal attached to his personal life. Bennett worked hard and gradually built up his legal practice. In 1908 {{he was one of}} five people appointed to the first Library Board for the city of Calgary and was instrumental in establishing the Calgary Public Library.|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that the project was joined by both the US Coast Guard and the Royal Canadian Navy. The project was still top secret at this time, and little actual {{information}} was shared, especially with the Coast Guard. The Canadian liaison was required, as ideal siting for the stations would require several stations in various locations in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. One site in Nova Scotia {{proved to be a}} battle; the site was owned by a fisherman whose domineering <b>teetotaler</b> wife was dead set against having {{anything to do with the}} sinful Navy men. When the site selection committee of J.A. Waldschmitt and Lt. Cdmr. Argyle were discussing the matter with the husband, a third visitor arrived and he offered the men cigarettes. They refused, and the hostess then asked if they drank. When they said they did not, the land was quickly secured.|$|E
25|$|Watts {{returned}} to Oklahoma {{and became a}} youth minister in Del City and was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1993. He is a <b>teetotaler.</b> Watts opened a highway construction company and later cited discontent with government regulation of his business as reason to become a candidate for public office. Watts' family was affiliated with the Democratic Party and his father and uncle Wade Watts were active in the party, {{but it did not}} help Watts when he ran for public office and he changed his party affiliation in 1989, months before his first statewide race. Watts later stated he had first considered changing parties when he covered the 1980 U.S. Senate campaign of Republican Don Nickles. Watts' father and uncle continued to strongly oppose the Republican party, but supported him. Watts won election to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in November 1990 for a six-year term as the first African-American elected to statewide office in Oklahoma. He served {{as a member of the}} Commission from 1990 to 1995 and as its chairman from 1993 to 1995.|$|E
25|$|The highwayman Dick Turpin {{used the}} Swan Inn at Woughton-on-the-Green in Buckinghamshire as his base. Jamaica Inn near Bolventor in Cornwall gave {{its name to}} a 1936 novel by Daphne du Maurier and a 1939 film {{directed}} by Alfred Hitchcock. In the 1920s John Fothergill (1876–1957) was the innkeeper of the Spread Eagle in Thame, Berkshire, and published his autobiography: An Innkeeper's Diary (London: Chatto & Windus, 1931). During his idiosyncratic occupancy many famous people came to stay, such as H. G. Wells. United States president George W. Bush fulfilled his lifetime ambition of visiting a 'genuine British pub' during his November 2003 state visit to the UK when he had lunch and a pint of non-alcoholic lager (Bush being a <b>teetotaler)</b> with British Prime Minister Tony Blair at the Dun Cow pub in Sedgefield, County Durham in Blair's home constituency. There were approximately 53,500 public houses in 2009 in the United Kingdom. This number has been declining every year, so that {{nearly half of the}} smaller villages no longer have a local pub.|$|E
25|$|Mulroney {{took the}} job of {{executive}} vice president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada, a joint subsidiary of three major U.S. steel corporations. Mulroney earned a salary well into the six-figure range. In 1977, he was appointed company president. Drawing upon his labour law experience, he instituted improved labour relations, and, with commodity prices on the rise, company profits soared during the next several years. In 1983 Mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the Schefferville mine, winning a generous settlement for the affected workers. Under his leadership, the company was sold off to foreign interests. In the wake of his loss in the 1976 leadership race, Mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years; he credits his loyal wife Mila with helping him recover. In 1979, he permanently became a <b>teetotaler.</b> During his IOC term, he made liberal use of the company's executive jet, frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips. Mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country. As his business reputation grew, he was invited onto several corporate boards. He declined an offer to run in a Quebec by-election as a federal Liberal.|$|E
500|$|Molotov was {{reported}} to be a vegetarian and <b>teetotaler</b> by American journalist John Gunther in 1938. However, Milovan Djilas claimed that Molotov [...] "drank more than Stalin" [...] and did not note his vegetarianism despite attending several banquets with him.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Cambridge, Kennedy along with his brother {{enrolled}} in Stanford University, where he majored in management science and engineering. [...] Kennedy's reputation as a <b>teetotaler</b> earned him the college nickname [...] "Milkman", as his teammates on the club lacrosse team would jocularly order him glasses of milk at bars. While at Stanford, Kennedy roomed with future NBA player Jason Collins.|$|E
500|$|Vainio was {{supported}} by his friends who had quit drinking a few years earlier, such as Osmo [...] "Osku" [...] Kanerva. Eino Grön, a friend of Vainio's, decided to follow his example and managed to quit {{a year and a}} half after Vainio. Vainio never wanted to be called a <b>teetotaler</b> and considered himself a recovered alcoholic. After he quit drinking, Vainio's songs became more serious and more sensitive, although he still wrote humorous lyrics as well.|$|E
500|$|Bethune was {{described}} as [...] "ebony" [...] in complexion. She carried a cane, not for support but for effect. She said it gave her [...] "swank". She was a <b>teetotaler</b> and preached temperance for African Americans, taking opportunities to chastise drunken blacks she encountered in public. Bethune said more than once that {{the school and the}} students in Daytona were her first family, and that her son and extended family came second. Her students often referred to her as [...] "Mama Bethune." ...|$|E
500|$|Josephine Earp {{worked hard}} to create an image of Wyatt as a <b>teetotaler,</b> but as a saloon owner and gambler, he drank {{occasionally}} as well. When Flood and Lake wrote their biographies, Prohibition was in force. Among the other facts Josephine wanted scrubbed from Earp's history, was that he liked a drink. She persuaded biographers Flood, Lake and Burns to write that Earp was a non-drinker. A good friend of Earp's, Charlie Welsh, was known to disappear {{for days at a}} time [...] "to see property", the family euphemism for a drinking binge, and Earp was his regular partner. Director John Ford said that whenever Josephine left town for religious conventions, Earp would come into town, play poker, and get drunk with the cowboy actors.|$|E
500|$|Lowell {{was also}} {{involved}} in other reform movements. He urged better conditions for factory workings, opposed capital punishment, and supported the temperance movement. His friend Longfellow was especially concerned about his fanaticism for temperance, worrying that Lowell would ask him to destroy his wine cellar. There are many references to Lowell's drinking during his college years, and part of his reputation in school was based on it. His friend Edward Everett Hale denied these allegations. Lowell considered joining the [...] "Anti-Wine" [...] club at Harvard, and he became a <b>teetotaler</b> {{during the early years}} of his first marriage. However, as he gained notoriety, he became popular in social circles and clubs and he drank rather heavily when away from his wife. When he drank, he had wild mood swings, ranging from euphoria to frenzy.|$|E
500|$|In December 1917, {{he married}} L. Mae, {{with whom he}} had one son and two daughters: Clark Shaughnessy, Jr.; Janice Shaughnessy (mother of Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann); and Marcia Wilson. He met his wife in New Orleans while {{coaching}} at Tulane. A <b>teetotaler,</b> Shaughnessy held a negative opinion of both drinkers and smokers. Marchmont Schwartz noted, [...] "When he said, 'Let's go have a drink,' he meant, 'Let's go drink a milk shake...He disappointed a lot of newspapermen that way." [...] Aside from his declared hobby as a football coach and experimenter, he enjoyed long-distance driving. Shaughnessy preferred to devise plays late at night, between midnight and dawn, while his household slept. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article described him as an [...] "ascetic" [...] and his lifestyle as [...] "Spartan". It noted he would go to bed as early as 7 o'clock, and wake up for work at three or four in the morning.|$|E
