60|$|Ans. I cannot {{give myself}} this reason, nor can you by it {{give me any}} satisfaction. Because their <b>travelling</b> <b>state</b> could not hinder; if you {{consider}} that they might, and doubtless did lie still in one place years together. 1. They were forty years going from Egypt to Canaan: and they had but forty-two journies thither. 2. They at times went several of these journies in {{one and the same}} year. They went, as I take it, eleven of them {{by the end of the}} third month after they came out of the land of Egypt. Compare Exodus 19:1 with Numbers 33:15. 3. Again, in the fortieth year, we find them in Mount Hor, where Aaron died, and was buried. Now that was the year they went into Canaan; and in that year they had nine journies more, or ten, by that they got over Jordan (Num 33:38), &c. Here then were twenty journies in less than one year and an half. Divide then the rest of the time to the rest of the journies, and they had above thirty-eight years to go their two and twenty journies in. And how this should be such a traveling moving state, as that it should hinder their keeping this ordinance in its season, to wit, to circumcise their children the eighth day; especially considering to circumcise them in their childhood, as they were born, might be with more security, than to let them live while they were men, I see not.|$|E

The design goal was to provide ultralight pilots with an aircraft that was as portable as possible. To this end the aircraft's wings fold along the fuselage to rest on the horizontal stabilizer allowing trailering or storage in a small hangar or with other aircraft. The aircraft can be field assembled from its <b>travelling</b> <b>state</b> in ten minutes. The FP-303 has a standard empty weight of 235 lb when equipped with a two-stroke [...] Rotax 277 engine.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of maximum entangled coherent state travels through an amplitude damping channel is investigated. For small {{values of the}} transmissivity rate the <b>travelling</b> <b>state</b> is very fragile to this noise channel, where it suffers from the phase flip error with high probability. The entanglement decays smoothly for larger values of the transmissivity rate and speedily for smaller values of this rate. As the number of modes increases, the <b>travelling</b> <b>state</b> over this noise channel loses its entanglement hastily. The odd and even states vanish at the same value of the field intensity...|$|E

For large value of the deformation the amplitude of Bloch vectors decrease very fast and consequently the traveling state turns into mixed state quickly. The generated entangled state is used as quantum channel to implement quantum teleportation protocol.

40|$|It {{is claimed}} {{in the above}} paper that, if time travel were possible, quantum {{propagation}} would prevent classic time travel paradoxes by establishing consistent loops; an example circuit is used to demonstrate such a loop. It is argued here that established loops are not the framework in which the classic paradoxes arise; rather they arise via {{the establishment of a}} concrete initial history in which no disturbing time travel is allowed and then disturbing that history via the launch of the time traveller. It is shown that, operated in this two-pass fashion, if the first forward evolution of their circuit produces a definite triggering of a backwards time <b>travelling</b> <b>state,</b> the re-evolution thereby engendered may be organised so as to prohibit the triggering of this state, thereby creating a classic time travel paradox.

Two classes of initial <b>travelling</b> <b>states</b> are considered:self transposed and a generic pure states. The entanglement contained in all possible generated entangled channels between the qubits and their Anti-qubits is quantified. The usefulness of the travelling channels as quantum channels to perform quantum teleportation is investigated. For the self transposed classes, we show that the generalized Werner state is the most robust class. We show that starting from a class of pure state, one can generate entangled channels more robust than self transposed classes...|$|R
