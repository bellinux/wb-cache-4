5|$|Regardless of <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> juries, no {{player that}} throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises {{to throw a}} ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E

5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver.

5|$|Meyerbeer's operas {{consistently}} enjoyed enormous popularity {{during his}} lifetime, and <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> (the then pro-Meyerbeer) Wagner in 1841, when the Paris Opéra was vainly awaiting Le prophète and L'Africaine, was not atypical:The Paris Opéra lies dying.

5|$|There {{are three}} main {{accounts}} of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote {{in the time of}} Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian's account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, some argue that his casualty figures are exaggerated—"more symbolic than factual". Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize. Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. <b>The</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> Philip Sabin—"a worthless farrago"—is typical.|$|E
5|$|Politics in Uttarakhand is {{dominated}} by the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Since the formation of the state these parties have ruled the state in turns. Following the hung mandate in the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly election, 2012, the Indian National Congress, having the maximum number of seats, formed a coalition government headed by Harish Rawat that collapsed on 27 March 2016, following the political turmoil as about nine MLAs of INC rebelled against the party and supported the opposition party BJP, causing Harish Rawat government to lose the majority in assembly. However, on 21 April 2016 the High Court of Uttarakhand quashed the President's Rule questioning its legality and maintained a status quo prior to 27 March 2016 when 9 rebel MLAs of INC voted against the Harish Rawat government in assembly on state's money appropriation bill. This has been seen as a big blow to central government which is expected to take the matter to the Supreme Court of India to challenge <b>the</b> <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> High Court. On 22 April 2016 the Supreme Court of India stayed the order of High Court till 27 April 2016, thereby once again reviving the President's Rule. In later developments regarding this matter, the Supreme Court ordered a floor test to be held on 10 May with the rebels being barred from voting. On 11 May at the opening of sealed result of the floor test, under the supervision of Supreme Court, the Harish Rawat government was revived following the victory in floor test held in Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly.|$|E

This article critically examines theories of community as were propounded by Devlin, Dworkin and Hart in answer to this question.
