Nothing is known of him before he took part in the Council of Basle, except that he was archdeacon at Villaviciosa, canon at Toledo, and {{professor}} of theology at the University of Salamanca. In 1432 the University of Salamanca and King John II of Castile sent him as their representative to the Council of Basle, where he was one of the ablest defenders of the superiority of the council over the pope. At first he endeavoured to mitigate the conflict between the council and Pope Eugene IV, with whom he spent some time at Florence in 1435, but afterwards he became one of the chief supporters of the revolutionary party at the council. He took part in the twenty-eighth session (1 October 1437) at which Eugene IV was declared contumacious, and in the <b>thirty-third</b> <b>session</b> (16 May 1439) at which the pope was declared a heretic. In March, l439, John of Segovia represented the council at the Diet of Mainz. After Eugene IV was deposed by the council on 25 June 1439, John of Segovia was appointed on the committee whose duty it was to select a number of theologians to elect the new pope. He was one of the thirty-three who on 5 November 1439, elected the antipope Felix V. In recognition for his services he was created cardinal by the antipope on 12 October 1440. He represented Felix V at the Parliament of Bourges in 1440, at the Diet of Mainz in 1441, and the Diet of Frankfort in 1442. At the end of the schism in 1449 he resigned the cardinalate, was appointed titular Bishop of Caesarea by Eugene IV, and retired to a monastery. John spent much of his retirement advocating peaceful dialogue with the Islamic world and the translation of the Koran into Western languages, Castilian, with the assistance of an Islamic scholar: Ice de Gebir -spelled `Isâ Ibn Jabîr (عيسى بن جابر) in Arabic. He died probably in 1458.|$|E

40|$|Spanish version availableAt the <b>thirty-third</b> <b>session</b> of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), {{which was}} held in Brasilia in 2010, member States adopted a {{resolution}} entrusting the secretariat with a new mandate to continue to analyse, in collaboration with other international and regional intergovernmental agencies, new alternatives for generating the volume of resources necessary for financing {{the development of the}} countries of Latin America and the Caribbean; and develop, in collaboration with other international and regional agencies, a broader set of indicators to reflect the particular realities in the countries and support the identification of their main needs, so that classification as a middle-income country ceases to be an a priori impediment to participation in official development assistance. In compliance with this mandate, the ECLAC secretariat has prepared this report, which argues that constraints and challenges associated with development must not be treated as related in a linear fashion to countries' per capita income levels. The document proposes fine-tuning the approach and complementing the per capita income criterion with a new perspective that addresses the structural gaps that constrain the development of middle-income countries, in terms of inequality and poverty, investment and saving, productivity and innovation, infrastructure, education, health, fiscality, gender and the environment. This calls for a review of the concept of development used to channel cooperation resources, and the adoption of a broader, multifaceted view which entails not just improving people's standards of living but also achieving sustainable and inclusive growth, whereby the problems of social inequality and productive heterogeneity characteristic of Latin American and Caribbean countries and middle-income countries as a whole can be addressed...|$|E
40|$|The PhD {{activity}} {{described in}} the present work concerned the determination of organic micropollutants in food matrices at trace level, with the aim of correctly evaluating the measurement uncertainty and establishing metrological traceability for the results of these measurements. The metrological traceability of organic micropollutants measurements is a relevant issue due to the potential adverse effects that these substances can act on human health and on natural ecosystems. Many organic micropollutants have been classified as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in the framework of the Stockholm Convention (2001) [1]. The research activity was addressed to the study of some food matrices and the attention was focused on two different matrices, green tea powder and milk, and on two organic molecules: - endosulfan, an organochlorine pesticide banned in 2011 due to its toxicity, analysed in green tea; - melamine, a molecule commonly used in the plastic industry which became famous for its fraudulent use as adulterant of the protein content of milk in 2008. Ad hoc methods were developed for the extraction of these molecules from food samples and for their quantification by means of two different analytical techniques: - gaschromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for the analysis of endosulfan; - Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) spectroscopy for the analysis of melamine. For the development of these methods a metrological approach was adopted and correct metrological traceability chains to the SI units were established, considering all the steps which constitute an analytical method. The activity concerning the Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) started for the participation in 2012 in an international comparison carried out in the framework of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière (CCQM), namely the "Pilot Study CCQM-P 136 Mid-Polarity Analytes in Food Matrix: Mid-Polarity Pesticides in Tea". Metrological traceability was established using suitable Certified Reference Materials (CRMs), both for the calibration of the analytical instrumentation and for the evaluation of the recovery efficiency of the analytes from the matrix. For the uncertainty evaluation, two approaches were followed: the classical GUM approach based on the law of propagation of uncertainty [2] and the Monte Carlo method [3]. The activity for the determination of melamine in milk consisted in the set up of an extraction procedure followed by the analysis by means of Raman spectroscopy, performed after mixing the samples with gold nanoparticles. Their synthesis is carried out in order to obtain particles having a diameter of 40 nm and a negatively charged surface, which allows their interaction with the melamine molecules (positively charged at acidic pH). These agglomerates are responsible for the amplification of the Raman signal by means of the SERS effect, which generates a considerable intensity enhancement of the Raman signal when the sample is put in contact with a metallic irregular surface or constituted of metallic nanoparticles. This procedure was validated by studying different parameters (linearity, repeatability, limit of detection, limit of quantification and recovery). The developed method allows the quantification of melamine in milk samples in accordance with the European law limits, fixed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, due to its potential toxicity, to 1 mg/l for powder infant formula and 2. 5 mg/l for other foods and animal feed [4]. For the determination of the calibration curve of the Raman spectrophotometer and of the uncertainties of the related coefficients, an algorithm based on Total Weighted Least Squares [5] was used, which takes into account the uncertainty contributions deriving from the instrumental repeatability and the calibration solutions used to calibrate the measuring instrument.
