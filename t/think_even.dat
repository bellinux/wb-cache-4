25|$|Research {{indicates}} that wealth {{is related to}} many positive outcomes in life. Such outcomes include: improved health and mental health, greater longevity, lower rates of infant mortality, experience fewer stressful life events, and less frequently the victims of violent crimes However, research suggests that wealth has a smaller impact on SWB than people generally <b>think,</b> <b>even</b> though higher incomes do correlate substantially with life satisfaction reports.|$|E

500|$|Bundy {{confessed to}} 30 homicides, but the true total remains unknown. Published {{estimates}} have {{run as high}} as 100 or more, and Bundy occasionally made cryptic comments to encourage that speculation. He told Hugh Aynesworth in 1980 that for every murder [...] "publicized", there [...] "could be one that was not." [...] When FBI agents proposed a total tally of 36, Bundy responded, [...] "Add one digit to that, and you'll have it." [...] Years later he told attorney Polly Nelson that the common estimate of 35 was accurate, but Robert Keppel wrote that [...] " [...] and I both knew [...] was much higher." [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>even</b> he knew ... how many he killed, or why he killed them", said Rev. Fred Lawrence, the Methodist clergyman who administered Bundy's last rites. [...] "That was my impression, my strong impression." ...|$|E
500|$|Al-Tamimi, {{during his}} trial, {{repeatedly}} questioned {{the legitimacy of}} the Israeli military court trying him as well as Israeli regulations regarding public gatherings. The military judge ultimately found him guilty of sending stone-throwers and illegal protesting but cleared him of the two more serious charges. She stated that testimony from a 14-year-old witness had been inconsistent and therefore unusable and that she had found misrepresentations by interrogators about the content of the confession of another witness. Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak described al-Tamimi's partial exoneration as a [...] "miracle" [...] given the 99.74 percent conviction rate of the military court. Before his sentencing al-Tamimi stated that [...] "the laws come from an occupying regime whose legitimacy I do not recognise. I don't <b>think</b> <b>even</b> for a single minute {{that there is going to}} be justice done." [...] His lawyer denied al-Tamimi's involvement in stone throwing, stating that al-Tamimi believed in passive resistance.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{resistance}} to the character, Bungie staff defended the character's introduction. [...] "I'd much rather experiment and do something surprising, and not have everybody appreciate it, than just turn the crank and do another alien war movie with a space marine," [...] said Halo 2 design lead Jaime Griesemer. Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game's marketing and the actual gameplay. [...] "I <b>think,</b> <b>even</b> more so than playing as the Arbiter, the thing that people were disappointed with and angry about {{is that they were}} promised this experience, through the marketing, of being really backs against the wall, Earth's under siege, we're going to do all we can to save our home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that." [...] Referring to Halo 2s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, [...] "I think if we'd been able to finish that last couple of missions and get you properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated." ...|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{decided to}} omit the post-revolution {{execution}} sentences of [...] "suspected war criminals, traitors and informants" [...] that Guevara reviewed at La Cabana Fortress because [...] "there is {{no amount of}} accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him". Soderbergh addressed the criticism for this omission in a post release interview where he stated: [...] "I don't think anybody now, even in Cuba, is going to sit {{with a straight face}} and defend the events. La Cabana was really turned into a Roman circus, where I <b>think</b> <b>even</b> the people in power look back on that as excessive. However, every regime, in order to retain power when it feels threatened, acts excessively ... This is what people do when they feel they need to act in an extreme way to secure themselves". The filmmaker noted as well that, [...] "with a character this complicated, you’re {{going to have a very}} polarized reaction". Furthermore, he was not interested in depicting Guevara's life as [...] "a bureaucrat", stating that he was making a diptych about two military campaigns, declaring the pictures [...] "war films". Soderbergh said, [...] "I'm sure some people will say, 'That's convenient because that's when he was at his worst.' Yeah, maybe—it just wasn't interesting to me. I was interested in making a procedural about guerrilla warfare".|$|E
500|$|A {{stoppage}} time penalty from Shane Long {{earned a}} crucial 2–1 win for Reading in Argyle's next match, but {{they came from}} a goal behind to claim a 3–1 victory at Barnsley four days later, which included a 35-yard effort from former Barnsley player Fallon. Paul Mariner was full of praise for his team and singled out youngster Yannick Bolasie, who made his debut for the club. [...] "We played with intellect. We got the ball down, rather than panicking a little bit; we stroked it around; we retained position at vital times," [...] he said. [...] "The introduction of Bolasie was {{a breath of fresh}} air. I <b>think</b> <b>even</b> the Barnsley fans would probably say they liked to see what he was doing. He brought a lot to the table for us." [...] A double-header of home matches were next on the agenda for Argyle, against Swansea City and Leicester City, and they both ended in 1–1 draws. New signing Damien Johnson scored late on against Swansea, and Craig Noone scored his first goal of the season to earn a point against Leicester. An end-to-end game at Bramall Lane against Sheffield United ended in a 4–3 defeat, which included a number of defensive mistakes. Argyle went 3–0 before finally sparking into life, scoring twice thanks to Bolasie and a first for young Irish striker Joe Mason. A lapse in concentration from David Stockdale, on loan from Fulham, gifted the hosts a fourth goal before a 20-yard volley from Mackie set up a frantic finale. In the aftermath, Paul Mariner heaped praise on Mason, describing him as [...] "an incredible talent." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1955 Larkin became University Librarian at the University of Hull, a post he held {{until his}} death. Professor R.L. Brett, who was {{chairman}} of the library committee that appointed him and a friend, wrote, [...] "At first I was impressed with the time he spent in his office, arriving early and leaving late. It was only later that I realised that his office was also his study where he spent hours on his private writing as well as the work of the library. Then he would return home and on a good many evenings start writing again." [...] For his first year he lodged in bedsits. In 1956, at the age of 34, he rented a self-contained flat on the top-floor of 32 Pearson Park, a three-storey red-brick house overlooking the park, previously the American Consulate. This, it seems, was the vantage point later commemorated in the poem High Windows. Of the city itself Larkin commented: [...] "I never thought about Hull until I was here. Having got here, it suits me in many ways. It is a little on the edge of things, I <b>think</b> <b>even</b> its natives would say that. I rather like being on the edge of things. One doesn't really go anywhere by design, you know, you put in for jobs and move about, you know, I've lived in other places." [...] In the post-war years, Hull University underwent significant expansion, as was typical of British universities during that period. When Larkin took up his appointment there, the plans for a new university library were already far advanced. He made a great effort in just a few months to familiarize himself with them before they were placed before the University Grants Committee; he suggested a number of emendations, some major and structural, all of which were adopted. It was built in two stages, and in 1967 it was named the Brynmor Jones Library after Sir Brynmor Jones, the university's vice-chancellor.|$|E
