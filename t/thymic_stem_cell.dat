40|$|The recent {{development}} of hybridoma technology has enlarged {{our understanding of}} cell surface molecules, especially those of lymphoid organs. T cell leukemia, which is a common neoplasm of the mouse, and its normal counterpart, the thymocyte, {{have been a major}} focus for studying cell surface antigens (1). It has been generally accepted that, in the mouse embryo, <b>thymic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are derived from either the yolk sac or the fetal liver. Shortly after the <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> enter into the thymus, they begin to proliferate and give rise to thymocytes in the cortex and medulla, where they can be divided into functional subclasses of T iymphocytes having a wide repertory of antigen specificity (2). Serological analysis has revealed that this process of differentiation of thymic lymphocytes involves a number of marked changes in surface antigens, Thy- 1, Lyt-l, 2, 3, TL and other T cell differentiation antigens (3 - 5). Almost all of these antigens, except for the TL systems, are quantitative rather than qualitative features. The presence of TL antigen is restricted to adult thymocytes and leukemias of thymic origin, and the mechanism of regulation of gene coding for this antigen is o...|$|R

40|$|Injection of day- 12 murine {{fetal liver}} cells into thymus lobes of Thy- 1 congenic adult {{recipients}} {{results in a}} wave of thymocyte development. The kinetics of repopulation by donor cells reaches a peak after 20 – 25 days. The frequency of <b>thymic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> (TSC) in day- 12 fetal liver was estimated, by limit dilution, as 1 in 4 x 104 cells. Within 8 hr of injection into a thymus lobe, fetal liver TSC commit to T-cell development, losing stem-cell activity. When fetal liver cells are maintained in culture for 7 days, with no exogenous cytokines added, and then injected intra-thymically (I. T.), thymus recolonization is not observed. However, TSC can be maintained in culture for 7 days with IL- 1 β, IL- 3, IL- 6, or LIF added, alone or in combination, with steel factor (SLF). Poisson analysis of fetal liver cells cultured with SLF and IL- 3 together revealed a precursor frequency of 1 in 1. 8 x 105 cells. In contrast, the frequency of TSC in adult bone marrow was estimated by limit dilution as 1 in 12, 000 cells...|$|R
40|$|Differences in the {{structure}} of the interphase nucleus between two species of birds, the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) and the chick (Gallus gallus) has been used to distinguish cells from different origins in interspecies combinations. This biological cell marking technique was applied to thymus histogenesis. Using various combinations between components of quail and chick thymic rudiments, the respective contribution of endodermal epithelium, mesenchyme, and blood-borne extrinsic elements to the histogenesis of thymus was analyzed. It was demonstrated that the whole lymphoid population of the thymus is derived from immigrant blood-borne <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> which are chemically attracted by the endoderm of the 3 rd and 4 th pharyngeal pouch. The latter is determined to differentiate into thymic epithelial reticulum as soon as the 15 -somite stage, and is able to attract blood <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> even when transplanted in an heterotopic position such as the ventral body wall of the embryo. It was shown that the thymic mesenchyme originates from the neural crest mesectoderm which colonizes early the 3 rd and 4 th branchial arches. It participates in the formation of perivascular mesenchyme, but does not give rise to lymphocytes. From heterospecific transplantations of quail thymuses into chick embryo (and inversely) at various stages of development is appeared that the thymic rudiment becomes attractive for lymphoid <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> at a precise stage of its evolution for each species. The attractivity period lasts about 24 h for the quail and 36 h for the chick. Then, the inflow of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> becomes very low until the end of the incubation period. At this time, a second wave of lymphocytoblasts invades the thymus and the primitive embryonic lymphoid population is completely renewed around the hatching time. Competent <b>thymic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are present in the blood before and after the period of physiological thymic attractivity. The identity of basophilic cells appearing in the thymus during its histogenesis and lymphoid <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> has been demonstrated from the analysis of quail-chick chimeric thymuses...|$|R
40|$|SummaryWithin the thymus, {{two major}} thymic {{epithelial}} cell (TEC) subsets—cortical and medullary TECs—provide unique structural and functional niches for T cell development and establishment of central tolerance. Both lineages {{are believed to}} originate from a common progenitor cell, yet the cellular and molecular identity of these bipotent TEC progenitors/stem cells remains ill defined. Here we identify rare stromal cells in the murine adult thymus, which under low-attachment conditions formed spheres (termed “thymospheres”). These thymosphere-forming cells (TSFCs) displayed the stemness features of being slow cycling, self-renewing, and bipotent. TSFCs could be significantly enriched based on their distinct surface antigen phenotype. The FoxN 1 transcription factor was dispensable for TSFCs maintenance in situ and for commitment to the medullary and cortical TEC lineages.

It is considered that sex hormones have significant theoretical and clinical values for improving the self-renewal of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and selecting appropriate <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> in the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy for liver fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|Dental tissues {{provide an}} {{alternate}} source of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> compared with bone marrow {{and have a}} similar potency as that of bone marrow derived mesenchymal <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> It has been established there are six types of dental stem cells: Dental pulp <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from human exfoliated deciduous teeth, <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> from apical papilla, periodontal ligament <b>stem</b> <b>cells,</b> dental follicle progenitor <b>cells,</b> oral periosteum <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and recently gingival connective tissue <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> Most of the dental tissues have a common developmental pathway; thus, it is relevant to understand whether <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> derived from these closely related tissues are programmed differently. The present review analyzes whether <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> form dental tissues depict distinct characteristics by gaining insight into differences in their immunophenotype. In addition, to explore the possibility of establishing a unique phenotypic fingerprint of these <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> by identifying the unique markers {{that can be used}} to isolate these <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> This, in future will help in developing better techniques and markers for identification and utilization of these <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> for regenerative therapy...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stem</b> <b>cells</b> are {{the source}} of {{differentiated}} cells that constitute tissues and organs. Two fundamental characteristics of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are their abilities to self‐renew <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> identity and to produce differentiated cells, the balance of which can be achieved by asymmetric <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> division. Many <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> have been shown to reside in a <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche, the home of <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> that regulates the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> behavior. Recent studies have revealed the critical contribution of cytoskeletons in achieving asymmetric <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> division: mitotic spindles in dividing <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> are often oriented with respect to the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche, which is supported by concerted actions of microtubule networks and components at the cell membrane such as adherens junctions, the actin cytoskeleton, and the extracellular matrix. In this article, we review the mechanism of <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> spindle orientation, with emphasis on its relationship with the <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> niche, and discuss how it contributes to tissue development and homeostasis.
