The new approach overcome a lot of some shortcomings (e. g., neglecting spatial information) in current approaches <b>to</b> <b>quantifying</b> the spatial gradation of slope positions, and is applied <b>to</b> <b>quantifying</b> the spatial distribution of slope positions with a fuzzy manner.

5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} is difficult <b>to</b> <b>quantify</b> for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and {{must always be}} under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E

Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} G/D modes is conventionally used <b>to</b> <b>quantify</b> the structural quality of carbon nanotubes. High-quality nanotubes have this ratio significantly higher than 100. At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube, the G/D ratio remains almost unchanged. This ratio gives an idea of the functionalisation of a nanotube.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{consequences for the}} county were more difficult <b>to</b> <b>quantify.</b> The financial impact on the county was estimated by the California Economic Forecast Director at $74 million if Line 901 remains dormant for three years because of the dependence of the region’s {{oil and gas industry}} to move product through this line. Workers income, property taxes, and federal royalties are reduced while the line is out of service. The impact on tourism was not as bad as predicted and thousands of workers involved in the cleanup appear to have benefited some hotels.|$|E
5|$|Attempts <b>to</b> <b>quantify</b> the {{economic}} impact of growth in the air transport sector generate results which depend on assumptions made, and therefore the viewpoint of the organisation making the analysis. The OEF study has produced a figure of £2.5billion per annum of additional GDP by 2015 for Heathrow, or £7billion per annum by 2030 if a third runway is built there. Full implementation of the White Paper runway proposals resulted in a forecast yield of an additional £13billion per annum in GDP by 2030. Calculations done for the AEF, based on a new runway at Stansted, and which assume increased taxation of the industry, result in a negative economic benefit.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040. The main goal of the LCA is to define the energy and environmental profile of the finished products. The reasons to use LCA arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes.

The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades. The value of the espionage is difficult <b>to</b> <b>quantify,</b> as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.|$|E
