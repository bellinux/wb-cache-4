25|$|Ecology in {{the narrow}} sense refers to the {{biological}} science of ecology. However, ecological paradigms and principles are being developed and applied in almost all disciplines, and these paradigms {{have to do with}} the way we approach understanding the relationships and inter-connections within and between living beings which give to each its special place and identity. Human ecology, e.g., must certainly take account of the role of our subjective lives and spiritual needs, as well as our biological ones, in terms of their ecological effects. Ecology in this sense is not a reductionist undertaking, but a movement toward a more whole (or holistic) vision and understanding of world processes. Deep ecology seeks to look into all levels of existence and might be viewed as radical by some; for them a more anthropocentric view is appropriated because it put humans at the center. Learning how to live in harmony with our surroundings is beneficial because stopping the global extinction crisis and achieving true ecological sustainability will require rethinking our values as a society. In that way education seems to be the best way to start. Sustainability education aims to help learners understand their interconnectedness with all life, to become creative problem solvers and active citizens, and to engage personally and intellectually in shaping our common future. Experiential learning and critical pedagogy are central to providing opportunities for learners to engage in transformative sustainability learning. The “Environment” broadly defined, remains somewhat neglected within development studies, despite a substantial increase in contributions to the field over the fifteen years since 2000. Undergraduate and postgraduate courses (with some notable exceptions) often “add on” environmental issues as special lectures or modules, and there remains a tendency for those who are grounded in the material and discursive struggles that define the discipline to consider the environment as an exotic special interest, a problem that manifests itself in societies that have the leisure <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> natural world. Development of a modern education model promoting patriotism and civic responsibility, active social position and healthy lifestyle is closely linked to the development of environmental responsibility in the younger generation. Development of environmentally responsible personality in individual is of particular importance for graduates of educational institutions. Environmental education could be integrated in different curriculum in most fields: education for sustainable development in the context of ecopedagogy.|$|E
500|$|Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for The A.V. Club in 2013, praising the natural {{manner in which}} the romance was progressed, saying that this was [...] "refreshing" [...] to see. He felt that the relationship {{did not appear to be}} manipulative for the sake of male viewers, but added that the ending was expected and that the episode never communicated to the audience the need <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> duo. Handlen wrote that the overall story itself was [...] "shallow", as the episode suffered from an [...] "enervating lack of fun" [...] which was only saved from [...] "complete tedium" [...] through [...] "strong acting and an admirable lack of stigma". Jordon Hoffman, reviewing the episode on his website, commented that Farrell's acting [...] "really steps up to the plate" [...] for this episode, and gave [...] "Rejoined" [...] a rating of five out of five.|$|E
500|$|Cryptum was {{met with}} varying reviews. Dr. Nigel Seel of sciencefiction.com called it tired, unoriginal and boring, saying, [...] "It's hard <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> flimsy characters, the plot is wearily over familiar, the hero is passive {{throughout}} and overall, not enough happens." [...] He criticised the characters as stereotypical and the plot being far too slow, concluding, [...] "This is one for the die-hard Halo fans." [...] Hilary Williamson of Book Loons also considered Cryptum appealing only to Halo fans, but praised Graham's narration. The author of Artistic Gamings review of Cryptum {{found it difficult to}} like the book's characters due to the condescending tone of Bornstellar, also concluding that it is only suited to diehard fans. Portland Book Reviews Missy Wadkins felt differently. She thought the characters complex and found it comparable to an interesting history lesson. Her review further contrasted Dr. Seel's by recommending it to all science fiction readers, not just Halo fans. Jason Hamilton of Story Hobby also praised the novel; he complimented Bear's creation of a completely different culture to humanity and his balance of providing the reader with enough information to maintain interest without letting on too much and ruining the suspense.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{concluding}} scene involving Sophia's {{death was}} {{cited as the}} episode highlight. Janet Turley of The Huffington Post asserted that the sequence was [...] "fiction not afraid to provoke", while Goldman described it as an [...] "absolutely horrific scenario". CNN's Henry Hanks opined that the sequence [...] "left [...] with a final scene that we'll be talking about until then." [...] New York City Starlee Kine asserted that it contained cinematic qualities, and felt that the scene was [...] "satisfying, sad, and fun". She wrote: [...] "It was everything you've ever wanted this show to be. Zombies plus no dialogue, such a winning combination! And how great was it that Sophia was dead instead of impossibly alive somewhere, holed up with Merle or Morgan or those warmhearted gang members in Atlanta. And because she was granted more screen time than she ever was when she was alive, we were finally able <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> loss of her short, young life." [...] Jen Chaney of The Washington Post echoed synonymous sentiments; [...] "Really, the final moments of the last episode before the AMC series' December/January hiatus played like a fireworks finale on the Fourth of July, assuming your Fourth of July celebrations typically involve zombies {{and a pile of}} corpses." [...] Rawlings concluded that it was the perfect resolution for what he called [...] "television's slowest subplot". McIntyre felt that the concluding sequence was the most eventful moment of the episode, and stated that it was difficult to watch.|$|E
500|$|Written in 1986, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] was {{the first}} song lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken wrote for The Little Mermaid, although Menken {{had not yet been}} enlisted as Ashman's composer when the song was first conceived. Directly inspired by Broadway's most successful musicals, Ashman believed that The Little Mermaids story would benefit from at least one song that serves as its heroine's [...] "inner diary of thoughts". Having always intended for Ariel to perform a song in her grotto, directors and screenwriters Ron Clements and John Musker originally asked Ashman to write a song in which Ariel declares her love for Prince Eric by singing to a statue of the character, but Ashman suggested that a song depicting the character's fascination with the human world would be a stronger alternative. Ashman explained to the filmmakers that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] would be Ariel's [...] "I Want" [...] song, likening it to moments in stage musicals during which the heroine sings about her dreams so that the audience can begin <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> character and her journey. Menken believes that Disney had not yet included explicit [...] "I Want" [...] songs in the studio's films prior to The Little Mermaid, making [...] "Part of Your World" [...] the first time one had been written intentionally for a Disney film. However, Disney princesses had technically been singing [...] "I Want" [...] songs since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Cinderella (1950). Observing structural similarities between the song and [...] "Somewhere That's Green" [...] from their musical Little Shop of Horrors (1982), the songwriters nicknamed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] "Somewhere That's Dry" [...] because they believe it resembles an [...] "underwater version" [...] of the Little Shop of Horrors song. Additionally, Ashman had written a song entitled [...] "Disneyland" [...] with composer Marvin Hamlisch for their Broadway musical Smile (1986) in which a young girl, much like Ariel, sings about regularly watching Disney anthology series as a means of escaping her troubled childhood. Menken identified the musical motif he composed for the beginning of the ballad as his favorite part of the song. Ashman debuted [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for Clements and Musker at his apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Only the directors' second time meeting Ashman and first time meeting Menken, Menken provided the piano accompaniment while Ashman sang Ariel's melody himself, instead of their traditional method of Menken singing lead vocals. Moved by Ashman's demonstration, Musker recalled that the lyricist gazed up towards the ceiling as though it were the human world itself as he [...] "became Ariel before our eyes" [...] and [...] "poured out his heart in song", helping them visualize [...] "this far-off place of wonder that so entranced this little mermaid.” ...|$|E

During the meeting he became unconscious. He was subsequently admitted to the Parkside Hospital in Wimbledon. The fact that this was a private clinic owned by a German healthcare company (reportedly charging patients up to £2,000 per day) attracted bad publicity.

2500|$|In May 1991 Braithwaite told The Canberra Times Bevan Hannan {{that he had}} met Hussey {{about two}} years before they worked on Edge. Braithwaite had heard some demos of Hussey's work and [...] "in 1987 I {{approached}} him to produce the album and after {{quite a lot of}} hassling he said yes". In the following year Clinton Porteous of Rolling Stone described how [...] "Braithwaite was trying to make a comeback... record companies urged [...] to use a name producer... he insisted on the untried Hussey. 'I saw someone who was a little bit hesitant... a little shy but who was really talented ... he really did seem <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> music... he doesn't do things half heartedly.'

2500|$|In 1993, Woolverton {{explained}} to the Los Angeles Times that [...] "the mythology in the story would be changed to explain, for example, a 6-foot-tall candelabra." [...] Perhaps Woolverton's most significant modification involves the enchanted objects, and the decision to have the enchantress' spell gradually transform the castle's staff of loyal servants into household objects throughout the entire duration of the musical, as opposed to having already done so immediately at the beginning. Essentially, becoming completely inanimate if the spell is not broken in time would equate to each character dying, which ultimately augments the story's drama. Consequently, this plot decision enhanced the story into a tale about people being forced to make difficult decisions, as opposed to solely {{a story of a}} man struggling to retain his humanity, in turn providing the audience with an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> supporting characters dramatically.|$|E

50|$|At first, when Sarah drinks, {{the alcohol}} seems to {{suppress}} her feelings of anxiety, insignificance and inadequacy. She associates happiness with drinking. For example, Sarah is embarrassed and humiliated {{when her mother}} arranges for her to attend {{a party at the}} Peterson's with a date, Ken. When Sarah emphatically states that she does not want to go, her mother's primary concern is of the social repercussions if Sarah does not attend the party. Thus, at the party, Sarah plies herself with alcohol in order to satiate her feelings of inferiority. She surprises herself and others when she sings, which everyone at the party appreciates. When Sarah becomes inebriated at the party, her parents attribute blame to Ken, even though it was Sarah who made the conscious decision to drink copious amounts of alcoholic beverages. JoAnne is more concerned with the impression that the guests formed at the party of Sarah as opposed <b>to</b> <b>caring</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> welfare of her daughter.|$|R

2500|$|After graduating {{high school}} in 2008, she {{attended}} California State Polytechnic University, Pomona where she intended to major in graphic design. During her freshman year, she looked up some online forums regarding voice-over and attended Anime Expo, where she learned about and attended an Adventures in Voice Acting workshop conducted by Tony Oliver. On Oliver's suggestion that she was pretty good at it, she changed her major to theatre, [...] and continued to take voice acting lessons and workshops while studying at school. She also did a production internship at Bang Zoom! Entertainment where she got to sit in {{on some of the}} recording sessions. Her first voice acting project was on K-On! where she voiced some incidental characters. Her first big voice-over role was for Battleship, based on the movie of the same name, where she got to voice a main character among many veteran voice actors. However, video game reviewers panned the game because none of the movie's actors reprised their roles in the game, and faulted the game's limited acting, which was relegated to mostly radio chatter and mission updates. At one point in college, she had some health issues that led her to take an absence from school and acting, so she pursued production work, which her parents thought would make for a more practical career; she later dropped it as she was encouraged by Oliver to pursue acting and to finish school. That was when she landed the lead role as Ayesha in the video game [...] She described Ayesha as a bit airheaded and ditsy but relatable and resembles her personality at times. [...] Video game reviewer Sean Madson of Diehardgamefan found the dub to be of decent quality, but said Ayesha [...] "sounded a bit too obnoxious with her airheadedness." [...] Matt Sainsbury of Digitally Downloaded thought the dub was reasonable but disliked their American accents as not suiting the Japanese personality of the game. [...] Vince Ingenito of IGN wrote that [...] "both the writing and voice acting fail to lend any weight to her plight. Ayesha seems about as upset over her missing sister as I might be over a glass of spilled milk, making it really hard <b>to</b> <b>care</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> outcome of her quest."
