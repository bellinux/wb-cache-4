5|$|The {{history of}} the highway system in Michigan {{dates back to the}} old Native American trails that crossed the state. These trails were {{pathways}} no wider than approximately , permitting single-file traffic. Many of the modern highways in the state follow the path of <b>these</b> <b>old</b> trails, including the Great Trail from Fort Pitt to Fort Detroit which is now US24 from Detroit to Toledo, Ohio. This trail connected with Braddock's Road which led to the Atlantic Coast.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of this old constellation of iconographic elements {{can still be}} seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from <b>these</b> <b>old</b> elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but is turned towards the viewer {{in a gesture of}} protection or fearlessness (abhaya mudra). The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing, which is a very popular theme.|$|E

5|$|As Heyer's {{popularity}} increased, {{other authors}} began to imitate her style. In May 1950, {{one of her}} readers notified her that Barbara Cartland had written several novels in a style similar to Heyer's, reusing names, character traits and plot points and paraphrased descriptions from her books, particularly A Hazard of Hearts, which borrowed characters from Friday's Child, and The Knave of Hearts which took off <b>These</b> <b>Old</b> Shades. Heyer completed {{a detailed analysis of}} the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, and while the case never came to court and no apology was received, the copying ceased. Her lawyers suggested that she leak the copying to the press. Heyer refused.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{studies have}} shown that, in its current circumscription, the genus Hydnellum is polyphyletic and only distantly related to the white-spored genera Bankera and Phellodon, {{currently}} grouped together in the family Bankeraceae. Analyses of the ITS region by Parfitt and colleagues and Ainsworth and colleagues, have further revealed multiple cryptic lineages within the genus. Most of the cryptic species belong to the H. concrescens/H. scrobiculatum species complex, resulting in frequent misinterpretations of <b>these</b> <b>old</b> and widely applied names. At the moment, the number of phylogenetically distinct lineages confirmed by molecular sequencing exceeds the number of described taxa in the genus, making further taxonomic revisions inevitable in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse the rugged mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville. These rugged and rocky trails were used steadily until 1895, when Pennsylvania Route154 was constructed to take their place. Part of <b>these</b> <b>old</b> horse trails are still in use and known as Pioneer Road and Double Run Road, and form part {{of two of the}} seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and Pioneer Road meet at the Worlds End Vista, which is thought to be a possible inspiration for the park's name.|$|E

5|$|Roddenberry firmly {{believed}} that throwaway clothes were {{the future of}} the industry, and this idea was incorporated into the costumes of The Motion Picture. William Ware Theiss, the designer who created the original television series costumes, was too busy to work on the film. Instead Robert Fletcher, considered one of American theater's most successful costume and scenic designers, was selected to design the new uniforms, suits, and robes for the production. Fletcher eschewed man-made synthetics for natural materials, finding that these fabrics sewed better and lasted longer. As times had changed, the Starfleet uniforms, with their bright reds, blues, greens, and golds, had to be revised: the miniskirts worn by females in the original series would now be considered sexist. Wise deemed the original multicolored uniforms too garish, and Fletcher {{believed that}} the brightness of <b>these</b> <b>old</b> designs would work against believability when seen on the wide screen—the designer's first task was to create new, less conspicuous uniforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{industry}} {{has come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in the}} number of ships scrapped annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. <b>These</b> <b>old</b> ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E

Research has shown this weakened immune response was also apparent in aging rats. Additionally, <b>these</b> <b>older</b> rats had reduced expression of the key gut-specific homing receptors α4&beta7; and MadCAM-1. <b>These</b> <b>older</b> rats had 30% less α4&beta7; and 17% less MadCAM-1 than juvenile rat equivalents.|$|R

25|$|More American help came in {{the form}} of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement in September 1940. Fifty old American destroyers were handed over to the Royal Navy in {{exchange}} for 99-year leases on certain British bases in the western hemisphere. Although plagued with mechanical problems, <b>these</b> <b>old</b> ships performed anti-submarine patrols in 1941–42.|$|E
25|$|The Vanir are attested in the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century {{from earlier}} traditional sources; the Prose Edda and Heimskringla, both {{written in the}} 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in the poetry of skalds.

25|$|In the 17th century, Edinburgh's {{boundaries}} {{were still}} {{defined by the}} city's defensive town walls.
