40|$|Even minimal {{improvements}} in particle collection efficiency of electrostatic precipitators significantly reduce dust emission from fossil-fuelled power stations and reduce pollution. Yet current designs {{rely on the}} Deutsch collection theory, which was developed for tubular precipitators and {{has been applied to}} wire-plate precipitators {{on the assumption that the}} inter-electrode electric fields at the same discharge distance in both were similar. Differences in geometry and associated collector electric fields and current density non-uniformity have not been taken into account, although the collector electric field and current density of the wire-plate precipitator are not uniform. And observations show that <b>precipitated</b> <b>dust</b> patterns and the distribution of collector current density are interrelated. Investigations revealed a simple square law relationship between the collector electric field and the collector current density in the space charge dominated coronas. Applying this relationship to the Deutsch collection theory led to a current-density-based collection formula that takes into account the non-uniform collector current density distribution. The current-density-based collection formula is then used to assess the impact of collector current density on collection efficiency, the results closely following published measurements. Applying the current-density-based collection formula to estimate the dust accumulation shows that most of the dust accumulates at collector locations facing the corona wires. The effect of the non-uniform <b>precipitated</b> <b>dust</b> layer on collection performance is assessed using the distributed corona impedance - the ratio of the inter-electrode voltage and the non-uniform collector current. Re-distribution of the collector current profile as dust builds up is also compatible with published measurements. Finally this is applied to optimize the wire-plate precipitator collection performance. This shows that optimal collection performance is obtained with the wire-wire spacing less than the wire-plate distance, once again confirming published experimental results. This is the first analytical approach to show better collection performance can be achieved at the ratio of wire-wire spacing/wire-plate distance not equal to unity, which has been the standard industry practice since 1960...|$|R

This finding demonstrates that some characteristic of M. sexta gut fluid, {{in addition to its}} basicity, counteracts the potential of tannins <b>to</b> <b>precipitate</b> ingested proteins. Gut fluid of M. sexta has a surface tension of 36 – 39 dynes/cm, indicating the presence of surfactants. Lysolecithin and linoleoylglycine, surfactants known to be present in insect gut fluids, also interfere with the precipitation of RuBPC by tannins at pH 6. 5. It is concluded that detergency is a widespread property of insect gut fluids that counteracts the potential of tannins <b>to</b> <b>precipitate</b> die ary proteins, and it is argued that {{there is no longer any}} justification for continuing to refer to tannins as digestibility-reducing-substances. Finding that there has been no formidable barrier to the evolution of mechanisms that counter a generalized antidigestive action by tannins is difficult to reconcile with the idea that reduced digestibility is an evolved anti-herbivore adaptation of apparent plants...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} dealing with the presentations of {{collecting}} efficiencies of electrostatic precipitators. Whereas the total separation efficiency and effective migration rates respectively bear some problems in interpretation and discussion an observation of the flux of locally <b>precipitated</b> <b>dust</b> should lead <b>to</b> more clarity and an improved insight of precipitation because it is only based on physical terms. The paper presents model calculations accounting for the size-dependent local particle transport. The local mass flux was calculated for varying median particle size and width of the particle size distribution. One interesting result is the influence of the classification along the duct, due to the size dependence of the particle migration velocity, on the local mass flux. It causes an increasing curvature resulting in a higher flux at the entrance of the precipitator, and a higher flux at the outlet for increasing width of the particle size distribution. Furthermore one can show that [...] ...|$|R
