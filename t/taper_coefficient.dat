An analysis of round wood volume tables from GOST 2708 – 75 {{in comparison with the}} Lithuanian volume tables showed positive values of deviations that indicates larger values in “Lithuanian” volumes (up to 10 % for butt and middle logs and 15 % – for top logs, although for butt logs over 70 cm diameter the differences in their volumes are around 2 % only). The main working method of upper diameter (STB 1667 - 2012, GOST 2708 – 75) was researched. 194 logs in 6 stacked batches were measured (diameters at both ends of a log (twice, rounding to 0. 1 cm), and length (0. 1 m)). The greatest deviations have been received when logs with increased <b>taper</b> <b>coefficient</b> (1 – 2 cm/m) are inventoried (– 14. 5 % according to the formula of the “end cross-sections” (SmalIana) and – 13. 1 % – using formula of “truncated cone”). In our view, it is advisable to clarify the method of upper diameter based on the average value of <b>taper</b> <b>coefficient</b> in stacked batches of round wood (entering of amendments to the volumes from GOST 2708 – 75 on a log <b>taper</b> <b>coefficient</b> of real value) ...|$|E

An analysis of round wood volume tables from GOST 2708 – 75 in comparison with control data showed positive values of deviations that indicates larger values in standard volumes (GOST 2708 – 75) (up to 13 % for medium-sized (24 cm) and large (over 24 cm) round wood). However, for logs with <b>taper</b> <b>coefficient</b> more than 1 cm/m) negative deviations are characterized, which, in turn, suggests an underestimation of wood volume in the standard tables {{in relation to the}} control data of formulas Smaliana and truncated cone (– 18 %). Formula Smaliana versus frustoconical formula underestimates the timber volume (however, not more than 1 %). Obviously, both of these formulas can be used to determine the amount of measurement errors by the method of upper diameter.

40|$|Jatropha curcas is an oil-bearing semi-evergreen shrub {{or small}} tree with {{potential}} {{as a source of}} sustainable biofuel, yet information regarding vegetative and fruit biomass in relation to plant architecture is lacking. Research conducted in Indonesia used the tree based functional branch analysis (FBA) model as a non-destructive method to estimate above and belowground biomass, and plant architecture. The FBA utility for shrubs was unknown and required modification. This research used destructive measurements to validate modifications to the FBA model that included sub-categorisation of the <b>tapering</b> <b>coefficient</b> for twig, branch, and wood diameter classes, and addition of a fruit load parameter in the distal link. The modified FBA model confirmed jatropha to be a shrub rather than a tree, producing variable estimates for aboveground biomass. This variation was due to morphological plasticity in the length–diameter relationship of the branches that diverged from fractal branching architecture. Fruit biomass variation between replicates was not well estimated and total proximal root diameter was a poor predictor of total root biomass, due to the proximal roots having enlarged water storage structures that do not follow fractal branching assumptions. Jatropha fruit was shown to predominate on twigs with a diameter between 0. 9 and 1. 4 cm. Understanding the correlation between fruit development and plant architecture will be necessary for fine-tuning the FBA model for future commercial breeding and selection. The high degree of morphological plasticity displayed by jatropha requires consideration when determining plant biomass...|$|R

This estimation is done after orthogonal {{transformation of the}} data to a reasonable coordinate system. The procedure adaptively <b>tapers</b> the <b>coefficients</b> of the transformed data. If the class of candidate estimators satisfies a uniform entropy condition, then b is asymptotically minimax in Pinsker's sense over certain ellipsoids in the parameter space and shares one such asymptotic minimax property with the James-Stein estimator.

These confidence sets are centered at b, have correct asymptotic coverage probability, and have relatively small risk as set-valued estimators of...|$|R

The λ/ 4 transformer changes to the Klopfenstein tapers, and the exponential taper changes to the Hecken tapers, when a longer length {{is used in the}} wide passband frequency.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a {{theoretical}} and numerical model {{based on the}} power series method is investigated for the lateral buckling stability of tapered thin-walled beams with arbitrary cross-sections and boundary conditions. Total potential energy is derived for an elastic behavior from strain energy and work of the applied loads. The effects of the initial stresses and load eccentricities are also considered in the study. The lateral-torsional equilibrium equations and the associated boundary conditions are obtained from the stationary condition. In presence of <b>tapering,</b> all stiffness <b>coefficients</b> are not constant. The power series approximation is then used to solve the fourth-order differential equations of tapered thin-walled beam with variable geometric parameters having generalized end conditions. Displacement components and cross-section properties are expanded in terms of power series of a known degree. The lateral buckling loads are determined by solving the eigenvalue problem of the obtained algebraic system. Several numerical examples of tapered thin-walled beams are presented to investigate the accuracy and {{the efficiency of the}} method. The obtained results are compared with finite element solutions using Ansys software and other available numerical or analytical approaches. It is observed that suggested method can be applied to stability of beams with constant cross-sections as well as tapered beams...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Different {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} developed for connecting abutment to implant. One of the most popular mechanisms is Tapered Integrated Screw (TIS), which is a Tapered Interference Fit (TIF) with a screw integrated at the bottom of that. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the mechanism of TIS and effective factors in employing TIS during design and implementation processes using an analytic method. Materials and Methods: Relevant equations were developed to predict tightening and loosening torques, contactpressure and preloads with and without bone tissue in this analysis. The efficiency is defined as the ratio of the loosening torque to the tightening torque. The effects of the change in elastic modulus and thickness of the bone on operation of this mechanism were investigated. Results: In this study, 14 independent parameters such as <b>taper</b> angle, friction <b>coefficient,</b> abutment and implantgeometry that are effective on performance of TIS mechanism were presented. The role of some factors was shown in the performance of ITI implant using sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: It was shown that friction coefficient, contact length, and implant radius play major roles on tightening and loosening torques and efficiency of the mechanism. Furthermore, the results revealed that the change in the elastic modulus and thickness of the bone influenced the efficiency of the mechanism less than 15 %...|$|R

We extracted the surface slope angle and décollement dip angle (which are the necessary topographic parameters for applying the critical taper theory) from seismic reflection and refraction survey data at 12 {{sites in the}} frontal wedges of the Japan Trench. We found that the angle between the décollement and back-stop interface generally decreases toward the north. The measured taper angle and inferred effective friction coefficient were remarkably high at three locations. The southernmost area, which had the highest coefficient of basal friction, coincides with {{the area where the}} seamount is colliding offshore of Fukushima. The second area with a high effective coefficient of basal friction coincides with the maximum slip location during the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. The area of the 2011 earthquake rupture was topographically unique from other forearc regions in the Japan Trench. The strain energy accumulation near the trench axis may have proceeded because of the relatively high friction, and later this caused a large slip and collapse of the wedge. The location off Sanriku, where there are neither seamount collisions nor rupture propagation, also has a high coefficient of basal friction. The characteristics of the <b>taper</b> angle, effective <b>coefficient</b> of basal friction, and pore fluid pressure ratio along the Japan Trench presented herein may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} relationship between the geometry of the prism and the potential for generating seismo-tsunamigenic slips.|$|R
40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMAs) have {{recently}} emerged as promising material candidates for structural seismic resisting purposes. Most {{of the existing}} SMA-based strategies, however, {{are based on the}} wire or rod form of SMAs, where issues such as gripping complexity and fracture may exist. This paper presents a proof-of-concept study on an innovative type of SMA-based self-centring system, namely, a superelastic SMA ring spring system. The proposed system includes a series of inner high-strength steel (HSS) rings and outer superelastic SMA rings stacked in alternation with mating taper faces, where the resisting load is provided by the wedging action which tends to expand the outer rings and concurrently to squeeze the inner rings. The superelastic effect of the SMA offers energy dissipation and a driving force for recentring, and the frictional effect over the taper face further contributes to the overall resisting load and energy dissipation. The feasibility of the new system is carefully examined via numerical studies considering the parameters of ring thickness, <b>taper</b> angle, and <b>coefficient</b> of friction. The key hysteretic responses, including resisting load, stiffness, stress distributions, source of residual deformation, energy dissipation, and equivalent viscous damping, are discussed in detail. The behaviour of the SMA ring springs is also studied via analytical models, and the analytical predictions are found to agree well with the numerical results. Finally, two practical applications of the new system, namely self-centring HS-SMA ring spring connections, and self-centring SMA ring spring dampers, are discussed via comprehensive numerical studies.
