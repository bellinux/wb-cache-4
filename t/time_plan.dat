40|$|Literatures {{investigation}} {{reveal that}} poor project planning is cited by many authors as a delay {{factor in the}} construction projects. Project planning have many different aspects and this research only addresses time aspect of project planning in the Norwegian construction industry. To capture the real word experience of experts in Norwegian construction industry {{and to find out}} the factors influencing project <b>time</b> <b>planning,</b> a survey questionnaire was conducted. The survey was distributed among the experts in construction companies, which are in partnership with the SpeedUp project. Totally, 62 complete responses were gathered. Respondents were asked different questions about their background, project <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> personnel, project <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> tools, and the relation between project <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> and project delay. The result shows that more than 90 % of the respondents agree that poor project <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> may lead to delay. Almost all of the respondents mentioned poor project management as a reason of poor <b>time</b> <b>planning.</b> Besides, most of the respondents cited more experienced people as the most important enabler of <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> improvement. Based on the literature, a model is presented which shows that poor project <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> has a harsher effect on delay in the execution phase. Moreover, the best phases to improve the project schedule is in the planning phase of the projects. Due to the relationship between delay factors, start of one delay factor may trigger other delay factors as well. This situation can be like a domino where initiation of one of the factors may activate other factors and the final consequence may be project delay. Therefore, to avoid delay, the whole system should be considered and controlling only one of the factors is not sufficient...|$|R
500|$|According to Ubisoft, [...] "teamwork, tactics, and tension" [...] {{were the}} game's three most {{important}} pillars. The team initially worked on a respawn feature, allowing players to rejoin after they are killed in the game. However, following several internal tournaments, the team realized {{that some of their}} employees would always win a match. They concluded that the respawn system worked to the benefit of strong players and placed individual skill above teamwork, which did not fit the developer's focus on game tactics. Removing the respawn feature meant greater consequences for taking risks, and players had to rely on their teammates in order to survive and achieve objectives. According to Chris Lee, the game's designer, the team initially worried that the system would only appeal to hardcore players. However, after several testings, they found that the removal of the respawn system provided new challenges to strong players and forced them to cooperate with their teammates – while it rewarded weaker players who were willing to take their <b>time,</b> <b>plan</b> their actions, and be strategic.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose for}} {{conducting}} {{the study was}} to identify the amount of <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> offered to elementary teachers and to compare that <b>time</b> to the <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> offered secondary teachers. The study was also conducted to identify how elementary teachers used <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> and how their <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> was monitored by administrators. In addition, the study was conducted to determine whether teachers and principals desired more <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> and how additional <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> would be used. ^ The study included information provided by superintendents, elementary principals, and teachers from Nebraska Class III districts. Questionnaires were mailed to 223 superintendents. Questionnaires were sent to a random sample of 150 principals and 391 teachers whose superintendents reported the use of <b>planning</b> <b>time.</b> ^ Frequency analysis and cross-tabulations were used to analyze the responses from the questionnaires. Data from each of the groups were compared using t-tests and the Mann-Whitney U test. ^ A number of conclusions were inferred from the <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> study: (1) While studies have addressed how teachers plan, little has been done to study the use and effectiveness of <b>planning</b> <b>time.</b> (2) The intensification {{of the role of the}} teacher has increased the need for planning. (3) Superintendents, principals, and teachers did not always agree on what was and was not <b>planning</b> <b>time.</b> (4) Less time was given to elementary teachers for <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> than to secondary teachers. (5) Teachers reported using <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> to complete professional tasks. Principals supported the teachers 2 ̆ 7 reported use of <b>planning</b> <b>time.</b> Teachers who reported fewer weekly minutes of <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> also reported less long-term planning. (6) Principals spent little time monitoring and assessing teacher <b>planning</b> <b>time.</b> Superintendents and teachers reported less monitoring or assessing by principals than did principals. (7) Elementary principals and teachers desired more <b>planning</b> <b>time.</b> (8) Principals and teachers would use additional <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> for long-term <b>planning</b> and collaboration with other staff. (9) Along with daily <b>planning</b> <b>time,</b> principals and teachers reported a preference for block <b>planning</b> <b>time</b> which would allow staff members to plan together. ...|$|R

The present study focuses on two self-regulated learning strategies, namely <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> and self-monitoring. <b>Time</b> <b>planning</b> involves <b>time</b> management, scheduling and <b>planning</b> one's study <b>time.</b> Self-monitoring involves setting goals, focusing attention and monitoring study activities. The aim of this study was first, to assess students' <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> and self-monitoring skills and second, to investigate how <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> and self-monitoring skills are related to actual individual study time, (un) prepared participation in the tutorial group and cognitive achievement. 165 first-year psychology students, enrolled in a problem-based curriculum, filled in a questionnaire (response 77 %) and their scores on two tests of cognitive achievement were used. Results showed that students who are better time-planners and who have better self-monitoring skills were more efficient in allocating their individual study time (spent less time on individual study), prepared more appropriately for the tutorial group meeting (although not significant [n. s. ]) and achieved higher scores on cognitive tests...|$|R

This paper presents a takt <b>time</b> <b>planning</b> case study from a closely related industry, cruise ship cabin refurbishment. The results of lean implementation in the case company have been very good, including productivity increase to 380 % of baseline, WIP decrease of 99 %, quality defect decrease of 99 % and project lead time reduction of 73 %. The paper reviews the process used and compares and contrasts the takt time method implemented by case company and the process proposed for construction in previous lean construction conferences. The implemented takt time method was found to be similar to the method proposed in previous lean construction conferences but it includes several additional process steps such as explicitly considering material logistics and garbage collection and real-time data collection. The main differences between project types are in logistics setup and business drivers impacting desire to cut lead time over improving resource efficiency. Interestingly, cycle time reduction achieved both goals in the case company.
