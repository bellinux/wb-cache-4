5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' when the need arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC is in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E

At the same time, he submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the US.

5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her to go ahead and marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child.

5|$|Before the 1956 season, the Giants, who had {{previously}} been renting the Polo Grounds from baseball's Giants {{at a rate of}} $75,000 a year, began playing their home games at Yankee Stadium. The Giants run of championship game appearances in their late 1950s and early 1960s combined with their large market location translated into financial success. In 1958 they set a new home attendance record when 71,163 fans attended their November 8 game against Baltimore. And in 1959 they established their next four highest home game totals by drawing between 66,000 and 68,000 fans for games versus the Eagles, Packers, Browns, and Steelers. By the early 1960s, the Giants were receiving $175,000 a game under the NFL's television contract with CBS—four times as much as small-market Green Bay, {{which was one of the}} most successful teams of the era. However, in the league's new contract, the Maras convinced the other owners that it would be in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NFL to share television revenue equally, a practice which is still current, and is credited with strengthening the NFL. The Giants and professional football as a whole, were helped financially by their contest versus the Baltimore Colts in the 1958 NFL Championship game. The televised game became the first professional football game to go into overtime, and is credited with increasing the popularity of the NFL in the US. The explosion in interest in pro football was evidenced in the Giants financials: in 1956 they had less than 8,000 season ticket holders and by 1963 that number had increased to over 50,000. They sold out every home game in 1962 and 1963. Additionally, while scalpers hardly existed in 1956, by 1963 they regularly received $25 for a $5 ticket.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, provincial government-appointed {{auditors}} {{backed up}} claims by Ocean Choice International (OCI) {{that they were}} losing millions of dollars each year operating the Marystown fish plant. On December 2, 2011, the company announced that they would permanently close their Marystown and Port Union fish processing plants and invest money into other plants throughout the province. The following week OCI asked the provincial government for an exemption to export unprocessed fish in return for nearly doubling the workforce at the company's plant in Fortune. Minister King reacted positively to the proposed idea and said the government would consider it. Negotiations on a deal would become tense, with the minister criticizing the company for using 'pressure tactics' {{to try to get}} a deal. OCI said that they were in damage control all around the world because of Minister King's comments. In February 2012, the government rejected a proposal to drop MPRs for the company, saying that it was not in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>interest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province. In mid October 2012, workers at the Fortune fish plant voted unanimously in favour of allowing OCI to ship out raw fish to China for processing, in return for 110 full-time jobs at their plant. The FFAW, which represented the workers, opposed the move to ship out the raw product. Dunderdale held a cabinet shuffle on October 19, 2012, and appointed Tourism Minister Derrick Dalley as the new Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture. In a news conference held on December 21, 2012, Minister Dalley announced the government would allow Ocean Choice International to ship 75 per cent of its yellowtail flounder quota overseas for processing, along with 100 per cent of its redfish quota. In return a total of 236 year-round jobs, between the Fortune fish plant and on company vessels at sea, for at least five years.|$|E
