5|$|In 2004, {{scientists}} analysing {{a detailed}} CT {{scan of the}} braincase of the London Archaeopteryx concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using <b>the</b> <b>scan.</b> The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that Archaeopteryx had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. Archaeopteryx had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% {{of the way to}} modern birds from the condition of non-coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as Carcharodontosaurus or Allosaurus, which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear. Newer research shows that while the Archaeopteryx brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among maniraptoran dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.|$|E

40|$|We present {{characteristics}} of a wavelength swept laser with a scanning fiber Fabry-Perot filter at 1300 nm. We investigate the dependence of <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> frequencies in <b>the</b> swept laser. In conventional wavelength swept lasers, the relative intensity of the laser output decreases significantly as <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> frequency increases. <b>The</b> peak wavelength of the output spectrum is red-shifted due to the nonlinear frequency downshifting in the semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA). In the Fourier domain mode-locked (FDML) wavelength swept laser, we investigate transient intensity profiles and the full width at half maximum {{in response to the}} injection currents and detuning of <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> frequency. <b>The</b> degradation of <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> range of <b>the</b> swept laser is caused by the deviation from <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> frequency at 45. 6 kHz.

30|$|One of the {{necessary}} and fundamental stages in {{the execution of the}} handover process is <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> phase. Information obtained during <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> process can shorten the synchronization stage. However, scanning has a disruptive effect on application traffic. As already pointed out, the more time that is dedicated to <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> process, <b>the</b> greater is the increase in buffering queues in the BS. Consequently, the end-to-end delay increases and global throughput declines accordingly. There is also a clear dependence between the disruptive effect caused by <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> process and <b>the</b> data load or traffic pattern. As the data load increases, less bandwidth is available to flush the buffered data before the delay increases. <b>The</b> high <b>scanning</b> interactivity frequency problem arises when, during <b>the</b> <b>scanning,</b> <b>the</b> medium access control (MAC) buffers packets to be sent to/received by the MS and there is not enough time after each scanning period to empty the queues, especially before performing a handover.|$|R
40|$|Large-area, uniform laser-induced {{periodic}} surface structures (LIPSS) are of wide potential industry applications. The {{continuity and}} processing precision of LIPSS are mainly determined by <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> intervals of adjacent scanning lines.

This study proposes that by varying the laser (800 nm, 50 fs, 1 kHz) polarization direction, LIPSS and <b>the</b> <b>scanned</b> line-widths on a silicon (111) surface can be continuously modulated with high precision. It shows that <b>the</b> <b>scanned</b> line-width reaches <b>the</b> maximum when the polarization direction is perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> direction.
