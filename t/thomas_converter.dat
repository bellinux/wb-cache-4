50|$|Dreux {{remained}} {{in charge of}} Aci√©ries de Longwy until he retired in 1919 and was succeeded by his son, Edouard.After Edouard died prematurely in 1923 he returned to run the operation for another ten years.After World War I (1914-18) there was a ten-year reconstruction period, starting with reopening of the iron mines in 1919.About {{a third of the}} equipment that the Germans had taken during the war was recovered and reinstalled, and in 1920 two blast furnces, a <b>Thomas</b> <b>converter</b> and a rolling mill started operation.Following this, new equipment was installed to bring up capacity to prewar levels by 1924.From 1925 to 1929 the facilities were upgraded and expanded.Blast furnaces with capacity of 300 tons per day gave the steelworks annual capacity of 760,000 tons of pig iron and steel.|$|E
5000|$|The 'Basic process' {{invented by}} Thomas was {{especially}} valuable {{on the continent}} of Europe, where the proportion of phosphoric iron is much larger than in England, and both in Belgium and in Germany {{the name of the}} inventor became more widely known than in his own country. In America, although non-phosphoric iron largely predominated, an immense interest was taken in the invention. The improved process resulted in much more slag forming in the <b>converter.</b> <b>Thomas</b> discovered this 'Basic slag' could be useful and profitable as a phosphate fertiliser.|$|R
5|$|Sheffield has an {{international}} reputation for metallurgy and steel-making. Many innovations in these fields {{have been made}} in Sheffield, for example Benjamin Huntsman discovered the crucible technique in the 1740s at his workshop in Handsworth. This process was rendered obsolete in 1856 by Henry Bessemer's invention of the Bessemer <b>converter.</b> <b>Thomas</b> Boulsover invented Sheffield Plate (silver-plated copper) in the early 18thcentury. Stainless steel was invented by Harry Brearley in 1912, and the work of F. B. Pickering and T. Gladman throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s was fundamental to the development of modern high-strength low-alloy steels. Further innovations continue, with new advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques being developed on the Advanced Manufacturing Park by Sheffield's universities and other independent research organisations. Organisations located on the AMP include the Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC, a research partnership between the Boeing Company and the University of Sheffield), Castings Technology International (CTI), The Welding Institute (TWI), and William Cook Group.|$|R
