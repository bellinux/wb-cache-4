5000|$|This lineup {{may not be}} surprising, but {{the scope}} of the {{recording}} is. Washington could have gone the easy route and followed up his R&B chart success with a series of uptempo, rousing tracks that leaned heavier on funk - {{in the style of the}} title tracks of both the previous albums. But he went in a different direction, at least partially. There are four cuts here, each between eight and nine minutes. The two which comprise side one of the LP, the title track and Hancock's tune, are a bit more laid-back and mysterious. Washington takes his time letting them unfold, utilizing dynamics. [...] "A Secret Place" [...] does have a slippery funky backbeat, and a killer guitar line by Gale, but the groove is nocturnal, spacy and soulful. His soprano sings over the backbeat as Grusin's Rhodes piano plays down a vamp for the rhythm section, and fills in the painted backdrop beautifully. The tempo picks up with Jackson's bassline becoming more prominent in the mix, but it never overpowers the easy groove established at the beginning. [...] "Dolphin Dance" [...] begins every bit as sparely and exotically spacious as Hancock's own version, with beautiful soprano and alto work, gorgeous floating Rhodes piano, and lots of warmth. When it begins to swing near the middle, it does so in such a relaxed and languid manner that the shift from soul-jazz on the preceding tune to the straight up fingerpopping nightclub swing on this one is seamless. [...] "Not Yet" [...] opens the second half of the set. It's a funky groove, but the easy, laid-back feel and chord changes in this Washington original make it irresistibly sexy. Once more, Gale's guitar pleases as it leads the horn section vamps that fill his sophisticated, soulful, bluesed-out solo. The lilt in Grusin's Rhodes piano is the perfect tastemaker, since Washington's tenor is so throaty and on the low-end growl. Harvey Mason's straight up funky soul number [...] "Love Makes It Better," [...] takes the set out on a high note, with gorgeous guitar vamps by Gale, the three-horn line playing a sparse but pronounced melody line, and Grusin filling the middle with enough sweetness and light to offer the drums and percussion room to really pop. Washington's tenor solo is sophisticated and tasteful; its emotion ratchets up the dynamic in the entire tune. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> A Secret Place is that while the set did well commercially, it got nowhere near the critical praise of its predecessors. That's a shame, because it is a truly fine album whose grooves and pleasures stand the test of time easily. It's ripe for reappraisal." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} {{environmental}} reporting {{began in the}} early 1990 ’s when some companies included the environmental issue in their annual report. The increased interest of ethical and sustainable investments and demands from different stakeholders conjure a change of the report design. To develop the environmental reports and create design guidance for sustainability reports an organisation called Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was born. The GRI is environmental reporting taken to another level, a level that is according to sustainable development. This qualitative study concerns sustainability reporting in general and the GRI-guidelines in particular. The question is why the Swedish companies, which are already using the guidelines, have chosen to use the guidelines and what type of behavioral changes within the company it has lead to? From my study, I have found that the GRI-report could help corporations {{to be able to see}} what actually has been done in the organisation.

40|$|During the 1990 s {{the assets}} of {{corporate}} defined-benefit (DB) pension plans ballooned {{as a result of}} the booming stock market. Because of accounting rules for DB plans put in place in 1986, this robust growth provided a substantial, although stealthy, boost to the profits reported by sponsoring corporations. In particular, the extraordinary returns earned on pension assets flowed to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> corporate income statements through lower net pension cost accruals included in general corporate expenses. These developments may have misled many investors about the value of corporate equities, because pension cost accruals provide a fairly con-voluted signal of the underlying value of net pension assets, in two ways.

The Article acknowledges the validity of some of the business rationales for diversity within corporations more generally, but questions whether those rationales apply with as much force in the context of corporate boards and the obligations board members undertake. On this point, the Article concludes that such rationales promise more, and in some cases significantly more, than directors of color can realistically deliver. The Article also concludes that while there may be practical reasons for relying on business rationales to encourage corporations to diversify, many diversity advocates have failed to analyze and appreciate the costs associated with adopting business rationales. In fact, these individual and societal costs, including the costs of marginalization and commodification, may outweigh the benefits of using market and economic rationales to justify board diversity...|$|E

5000|$|In {{traditional}} {{business accounting}} and common usage, the [...] "bottom line" [...] refers {{to either the}} [...] "profit" [...] or [...] "loss", which is usually recorded at <b>the</b> very <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> a statement of revenue and expenses. Over the last 50 years, environmentalists and [...] "social justice" [...] advocates have struggled to bring a broader definition of <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> into public consciousness by introducing full cost accounting. For example, if a corporation shows a monetary profit, but their asbestos mine causes thousands of deaths from asbestosis, and their copper mine pollutes a river, and the government ends up spending taxpayer money {{on health care and}} river clean-up, how do we perform a full societal cost benefit analysis? <b>The</b> triple <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> adds two more [...] "bottom lines”: social and environmental (ecological) concerns. With the ratification of the United Nations and ICLEI TBL standard for urban and community accounting in early 2007, this became the dominant approach to public sector full cost accounting. Similar UN standards apply to natural capital and human capital measurement to assist in measurements required by TBL, e.g. the EcoBudget standard for reporting ecological footprint.

The first {{aim of this}} paper is to describe the main developments in the Ukrainian economy since its independence in 1991, focusing on the evolution of output, and the path of economic reforms - that is, to simply show what happened. <b>The</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> <b>on</b> that is well known: Ukraine's economy performed very poorly, and its reforms moved quite slowly, lagging behind most of Central Europe and the Baltic, and even behind some FSU (Former Soviet Union) countries. This first task is a relatively easy one, though some measurement issues do need discussion. In comparison, the second aim - explaining why it happened, identifying the explanatory, causal factors - is much more difficult and contentious. Indeed, causation here means two dynamics: the relationship between performance and reform pace, and the underlying determinants of the slow reforms. The paper's main effort will be to argue and present evidence that the poor economic performance is primarily due to the late and slow start on economic reforms. However, it only begins to point to the explanations for slow reforms and suggest a modeling approach to analyze this econometrically in future work.

40|$|Regardless of the {{technical}} procedure used in signalling corporate collapse, <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>line</b> rests <b>on</b> <b>the</b> predictive power of the corresponding statistical model. In that regard, {{it is imperative to}} empirically test the model using a data sample of both collapsed and non-collapsed companies. A superior model is one that successfully classifies collapsed and non-collapsed companies in their respective categories {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. Empirical studies of this nature have thus far done one of two things. (1) Some have classified companies based on a specific statistical modelling process. (2) Some have classified companies based on two (sometimes – but rarely – more than two) independent statistical modelling processes for the purposes of comparing one with the other. In the latter case, the mindset of the researchers has been – invariably – to pitch one procedure against the other. This paper raises the question, why pitch one statistical process against another; why not make the two procedures work together? As such, this paper puts forward an innovative dual-classification scheme for signalling corporate collapse: dual in the sense that it relies on two statistical procedures concurrently. Using a data sample of Australian publicly listed companies, the proposed scheme is tested against the traditional approach taken thus far in the pertinent literature. The results demonstrate that the proposed dual-classification scheme signals collapse with a higher degree of accuracy. <br /...|$|R
