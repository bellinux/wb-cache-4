5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} is {{prevented}} from precessing {{as the front}} wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> {{as though it were}} not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E

5|$|At low forward speeds, the {{precession}} of {{the front}} wheel is too quick, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to oversteer, start <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> {{the other way and}} eventually oscillate and fall over. At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s tendency to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} shown that the couple created by gravity and the ground {{reaction}} forces is necessary for a bicycle to turn at all. On a custom built bicycle with spring-loaded outriggers that exactly cancel this couple, so that the bicycle and rider may assume any lean angle when traveling in a straight line, riders find it impossible to make a turn. As soon as the wheels deviate from a straight path, the bicycle and rider begin <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> in the opposite direction, {{and the only way to}} right them is to steer back onto the straight path.|$|E
5|$|Organ {{builders}} began <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> towards specifications {{with fewer}} mixtures and high-pitched stops. They preferred {{to use more}} 8 and 16 stops in their specifications and wider pipe scales. These practices created a warmer, richer sound than was common in the 18th century. Organs began {{to be built in}} concert halls (such as the organ at the Palais du Trocadéro in Paris), and composers such as Camille Saint-Saëns and Gustav Mahler used the organ in their orchestral works.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his life, Peel started <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> {{heavily on}} a cane with a golden head. He lived out his final days in Ardwick Green, near his daughter. Peel died on 12 September 1795, and was buried in St John's Church, Manchester. His wife survived him by six months; one of her final wishes was to outlive her husband. He left his estate split equally between his eight children, valued at £13,000 each (worth about £1.1 million in 2013).|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, they found it increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E

30|$|As Lean is Japanese, many of {{the words}} used were totally {{unfamiliar}} to the employees. This in itself could lead to resistance <b>to</b> the <b>Lean</b> concept.

One way was using lots of information mixed with cartoons describing inappropriate ways of doing things.|$|R
5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks {{on top of a}} wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of the}} wall without having <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on top of a wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy at the base of the wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Jacint Verdaguer {{reported}} that a woodcutter had recently tried to cut {{down one of the}} trunks, causing it <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> out; damage from which the tree was unlikely to recover. It was also {{reported that}} around 1895, cuts had been made to tap the tree for resin, and a fire lit at its base to speed the process. This and other damage prompted the Catalanist Union to erect a high stone wall around the tree in 1907 to protect against further attacks, though it was suggested that the building work also contributed to the subsequent death of the tree. By 1915 the aforementioned wall had been demolished.|$|E
5|$|Shulgin's {{professional}} activities continued <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> in {{the direction}} of psychopharmacology, furthered by his personal experiences with psychedelics. But during this period he was unable to do much independent research. His opportunity for further research came in 1961 after his development of Zectran, the first biodegradable pesticide, a highly profitable product. In his book PIHKAL, Shulgin limits his pesticide days at Dow Chemical to one sentence in 978 pages. Dow Chemical Company, in return for Zectran's valuable patent, gave Shulgin great freedom. During this time, he created and patented drugs when Dow asked, and published findings on other drugs in journals such as Nature and the Journal of Organic Chemistry. Eventually, Dow Chemical requested that he no longer use their name on his publications.|$|E

40|$|The lean philosophy, which denotes {{business}} excellence through continuous improvement, originates from Japanese {{car manufacturer}} Toyota’s Production System (TPS). An area where lean {{is not fully}} explored is remanufacturing, a business that brings used products back to useful life. Remanufacturing is often a more complex process than manufacturing due to uncertainty of process steps/time and part quality/quantity. This paper has explored remanufacturing by revealing its challenges and opportunities <b>to</b> be <b>lean.</b> The identified challenges <b>to</b> work with <b>lean</b> do not overcome the advantages of a lean remanufacturing system. Even though some researches state {{that it is difficult}} or even impossible <b>to</b> apply <b>lean</b> <b>to</b> remanufacturing, this research recovers lean as a continuous improvement philosophy that not only works for manufacturing but also for remanufacturing.

5|$|The minaret is {{believed}} to have been built in the area of an earlier, Fatimid-era brick minaret that had itself been rebuilt several times. Contemporary accounts suggest that the Fatimid minaret had defects in its construction and needed to be rebuilt several times, including once under the direction of Sadr al-Din al-Adhra'i al-Dimashqi al-Hanafi, the qadi al-qudat (Chief Justice of the Highest Court) during the rule of Sultan Baibars. Recorded to have been rebuilt again under Barquq in 1397, the minaret began <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> at a dangerous angle and was rebuilt in 1414 by Taj al-Din al-Shawbaki, the walī and muhtasib of Cairo, and again in 1432. The Qaytbay minaret was built in its place as part of a reconstruction of the entrance to the mosque.|$|E
5|$|A {{cover system}} {{can be used in}} combat as {{assistance}} against enemies. Players have the ability <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> around, over, and under cover, which {{can be used as a}} tactical advantage during shootouts and stealth levels. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options; they can be found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or removed from their stationary position and carried around. Weapon ammunition must be manually retrieved from the ground or from dead enemies. Players have access to a weapon inventory, which allows them to carry as many weapons as they find. With some of these weapons, players have the ability to dual wield, giving them an advantage over enemies by dealing twice as much damage. Players can also customize weapons through the use of upgrades; for example, a rocket launcher can be attached to the side of an assault rifle, and a laser cannon can be transformed into a wire cutting tool.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the very}} {{existence}} of the SPARTAN project and thus John's existence, was categorised as classified information. Many within the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who were aware of this information, were strongly opinionated against the project, as the SPARTAN unit's proven versatility elevated them into direct competition with role-dedicated, established units. Since John emerged as the most exemplary Spartan from among the unit, he became the natural target of their sentiments. Antonio Silva, an officer from one such unit (ODSTs), exemplifies this attitude, and considers the Master Chief the freak product of an experiment that should never be repeated. Although the Chief resents Silva's dishonor to his fallen comrades' memory, he is also loyal to the chain of command, and remains quiet. Following the partial declassification of the SPARTAN project, John's heroic achievements caused the overall sentiment <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> in his favor. Despite these explorations of the character's personality, O'Connor {{said in an interview that}} revealing the face of the Chief is not as important as revealing the events going on around the character.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the sound of a ticking clock and Levine and Rihanna sitting {{opposite}} each other at a table, tapping their hands and staring at one and other. As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut with each other for the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends.

5|$|When heavy {{snowfall}} rendered campaigning impossible {{during the}} following winter, Kantakouzenos instead sent envoys, including an embassy of monks from Mount Athos to Constantinople. However, they too were dismissed by the Patriarch. By then, {{almost all of the}} Byzantine provinces and their governors had declared themselves for the regency. Only Theodore Synadenos, an old associate of Kantakouzenos who was the governor of the Empire's second city, Thessalonica, indicated his support. Synadenos had kept his allegiance to Kantakouzenos secret from the city's populace, and intended to surrender Thessalonica in collusion with the local aristocracy. Furthermore, Hrelja, the Serbian magnate and virtually independent ruler of Strumica and the Strymon River valley, seemed <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> towards Kantakouzenos. Consequently, as soon as the weather improved, on 2 March 1342, Kantakouzenos left his wife Irene Asanina, his brother-in-law Manuel Asen and his daughters to hold Demotika and marched west with his army toward Thessalonica. On the way, he first attacked Peritheorion but was repelled and continued westward. Kantakouzenos was however able to take fortress Melnik, where he met with Hrelja to forge an alliance. Their two armies marched toward Thessalonica, but arrived too late to take control. As they approached the city, they were met by Synadenos and other aristocrats, who had fled after an uprising led by a radical popular party, the Zealots. Soon afterwards a fleet of 70 ships led by Apokaukos reinforced the city. Synadenos, whose family had remained behind in Thessalonica, defected to the regency. Apokaukos' son John was appointed governor of Thessalonica, although effective power rested with the Zealots, who for the next seven years led an autonomous regime unparalleled in Byzantine history.|$|E
