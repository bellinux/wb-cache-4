5|$|Hill {{called the}} {{attention}} of the Nebraska State Historical Society (NSHS) <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> and, in 1924, joined representatives of the Society in conducting further excavations, showing that a village of considerable size had existed there. In 1925, to ensure archaeological access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> and to protect it from relic-hunting, he bought the two farms on whose land it lay. Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E

5|$|A large deer park, {{owned by}} the Crown, was {{established}} around the castle to provide hunting grounds. The castle was carefully positioned next to the park, which was overlooked by the motte. A vineyard was also maintained alongside the castle. The old Anglo-Saxon manorial centre was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site,</b> {{and as a result}} the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Berkhamsted also shifted from the area now called Northchurch to the castle; several mills, essential for grinding flour, were present there in 1086.|$|E

5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds were brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E

5|$|At 15:05, {{the train}} {{disappeared}} from the approach zone for the Vendenheim junction on the display being monitored by staff at the signalling control center. At 15:10, the control center initiated emergency procedures {{for the loss of}} a train and closed the non-high-speed rail lines that pass through the Vendenheim junction. At approximately the same time, one of the companies involved {{in the construction of the}} line received a call from an employee aboard the train, who informed them of the derailment. Shortly before 17:45, the local mass casualty plan was enacted. Emergency medical and fire rescue services along with 100 gendarmes responded to the incident. At its height, 104 engines from three départments responded to the incident—65 from Bas-Rhin and 39 from Moselle and Haut-Rhin. Those with minor injuries were treated by responders from the French Red Cross, which operated at the school in Eckwersheim. The French Minister of Ecology, Sustainable Development and Energy, Ségolène Royal, and the Secretary of State for Transport, Alain Vidalies, travelled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> shortly after the crash. The president of SNCF, Guillaume Pepy, and the president of SNCF Réseau, Jacques Rapoport, also travelled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> in the hours after the accident.|$|E
