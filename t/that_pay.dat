5|$|In 2008, {{the annual}} salary for {{entry-level}} ministers was $1,924,300. In {{view of the}} worsening economic crisis in 2008–2009, as of January 2009 the Prime Minister's salary was cut to $3.04 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers was reduced by 18% to $1.57 million. In November 2009 the Public Service Division announced <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> increments would be deferred {{for a second time}} in 2010 because of the uncertain economic recovery. A minister's 2009 salary of $1,494,700 per year was therefore 22% lower than what he or she received in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Annuities {{provide a}} stream of {{payments}} and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require {{the same kinds of}} actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and pensions <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a retiree will outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} company profits are best re-invested in the company: {{research}} and development, capital investment, expansion, etc. Proponents {{of this view}} (and thus critics of dividends per se) suggest that an eagerness to return profits to shareholders may indicate the management having run out of good ideas {{for the future of}} the company. Some studies, however, have demonstrated that companies <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> dividends have higher earnings growth, suggesting that dividend payments may be evidence of confidence in earnings growth and sufficient profitability to fund future expansion.|$|E

Moreover, we can also expect that poor noncitizen children whose parents lack job-based coverage have lower rates of participation than poor citizen children of U.S. citizens. The lack of insurance for citizen children in mixed-status families means that these children {{are less likely to}} receive timely care for acute conditions, and less likely to have their chronic conditions diagnosed and appropriately managed.|$|E
25|$|The average woman's {{unadjusted}} {{annual salary}} {{has been cited}} as 78% to 82% of that of the average man's. However, after adjusting for choices made by male and female workers in college major, occupation, working hours, and parental leave, multiple studies find <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> rates {{between males and females}} varied by 5–6.6% or, females earning 94 cents to every dollar earned by their male counterparts. The remaining 6% of the gap has been speculated to originate from gender discrimination and a gender difference in ability and willingness to negotiate salaries.|$|E

Instead of addressing the complaints, the Naval Board declared that any sailor who did not return to duty by the morning of Tuesday 29 April would be marked as Absent Without Leave. By morning parade, 52 men had failed to return.|$|E

It was first thought Anthony's image would be featured on the $10 bill. The decision to retain Alexander Hamilton, the first US Secretary of the Treasury and architect of all US financial systems on the $10 bill meant that Anthony {{would need to be}} featured on another piece of US currency. It is hoped that images <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> homage to the women's suffrage movement will feature the images of Anthony, Sojourner Truth, Lucretia Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Alice Paul, and the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession.|$|E
25|$|The {{numbers and}} {{effectiveness}} of the regular soldiers may have declined during the fourth century: payrolls were inflated so <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> could be diverted and exemptions from duty sold, their opportunities for personal extortion were multiplied by residence in cities, and their effectiveness was reduced by concentration on extortion instead of drill. However, , gross corruption, and occasional ineffectiveness were not new to the Roman army; {{there is no consensus}} whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376. Ammianus Marcellinus, himself a professional soldier, repeats longstanding observations about the superiority of contemporary Roman armies being due to training and discipline, not to physical size or strength. Despite a possible decrease in its ability to assemble and supply large armies, Rome maintained an aggressive and potent stance against perceived threats almost {{to the end of the}} fourth century.|$|E

25|$|The International Hockey Hall of Fame, was {{established}} in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the Kingston Memorial Centre (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre. The International Hockey Hall of Fame, founded by the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, is the oldest sports hall of fame in Canada. The museum's collection is home to various items <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> homage to Kingston's role {{in the history of}} hockey in Canada. These include: the original square hockey puck from the first Queens University vs. the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) game in 1886, hockey’s oldest sweater worn by a Queen’s student in 1894, and Canada’s first Olympic gold medal from 1924, among others.|$|E
25|$|PAYE (Pay As You Earn) is a {{significant}} contributor to tax being 45%. Given the high unemployment rate the tax is quite heavy. This of course captures those <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> and keep records properly. The average salary is probably $250. This is skewed downwards by {{the large number of}} government employees whose average salary is around there. At the top end salaries are quite competitive and this {{is to be able to}} attract the right skills though the cost of living is high so it balances this out. A top-earning Zimbabwean spends a lot more money on necessities than say a South African top earner. This is more evident when a comparison with the United States or England is done.

25|$|Agriculture in Tuvalu {{is focused}} on coconut trees and growing pulaka in large pits of {{composted}} soil below the water table. Subsistence farming of coconut palms to produce copra and fishing remain the primary economic activities, particularly off the capital island of Funafuti. There is no apparent large income disparity among the residents, although virtually the only jobs in the islands <b>that</b> <b>pay</b> a steady wage or salary are with the government, which make up about two thirds of those in formal employment. About 15% of adult males work as seamen on foreign flagged merchant ships. Population growth on the outer islands, the limits as to available land {{and the lack of}} employment opportunities, results in a flow of people from the outer islands to the capital in Funafuti with further pressure to migrate to Australia or New Zealand. There is high youth unemployment and few new jobs being created. Given the absence of natural resources (apart from tuna in the territorial waters), and the constrains imposed on the Tuvaluan economy by its remoteness and lack of economies of scale, practical policies are needed for improvements to the livelihoods of the growing numbers of young Tuvaluans who aspire to a more affluent lifestyle than older generations.|$|E
