40|$|The thesis aims {{to build}} a {{coherent}} view and <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> stakeholder engagement’s contribution to corporate sustainability value creation. Theory suggests that corporate sustainability relies on sustainable relationships between the firm and its multiple stakeholders. This study is qualitative and evidence is derived from integrative analysis of literature, secondary data and case study analysis. The findings from the interviews analysis supplement the framework developed as {{the results of the}} literature review. The results obtained throughout the thesis research imply that stakeholder engagement helps develop more <b>thorough</b> <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> issues and alternative perspectives, which in turn facilitates the decision-making processes improvement. The improvement is also achieved through ethical analysis, by weighing the impact of firm’s decisions on all relevant groups. Therefore, clear communication and exchange of information also improve the acceptance of sustainability initiatives amongst stakeholders both in terms of building trust and managing expectations. As practical implications, this thesis presents organizational practices that can be employed by companies to support effective engagement with stakeholders. The described practices could enhance processes such as partnership and co-creation resulting in greater sustainable development...|$|R

I propose some foundations for thinking about queer qualitative methods that employs queer theory in relation to a self - reflexive creative perspective towards ethics, research and representation. Moreover, I critically analyze the HBO trans documentary, Middle Sexes: Redefining He and She (Antony Thomas 2005), in order to move beyond complacent documentaries that employ interviews as a way of categorizing and containing gender diversity. I work towards future methodological promises for the exploration of queer and trans subjects.

The theory girding such programs suggests that pay {{as an economic}} incentive can help cause teachers to increase student outcomes as measured by standardized test scores. What is little noticed by many educationists, but particularly by policy makers, is how programmatic effects affect the ontology of educational environment. There {{are several ways to}} approach the viability of such programs. In this study of three pay-for-performance programs, two in the U.
