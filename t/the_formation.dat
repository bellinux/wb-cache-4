5|$|A limited fauna {{is known}} from the upper section of the Oldman Formation, and Corythosaurus casuarius as well as C. intermedius are among the taxa.

50|$|The {{sedimentary}} rocks in Montour County are {{from either the}} Devonian Period or the Silurian Period. The Devonian Period rocks are more common than Silurian Period rocks, making up {{two thirds of the}} county.

5|$|In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} <b>the</b> <b>formation,</b> as a whole, {{was not to}} stay together, saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> would break apart. Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes, and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative.|$|E
