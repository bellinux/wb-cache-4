40|$|Water flux {{rates and}} osmotic {{responses}} of Kemp's Ridley sea turtles (Lepidochelys kempi) acutely exposed <b>to</b> fresh <b>water</b> were quantified. Salt-water adapted turtles were exposed <b>to</b> fresh <b>water</b> for 4 d before being returned <b>to</b> salt <b>water.</b> During the initial salt water phase, absolute and relative water flux rates were 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 l d(- 1) and 123. 0 +/- 6. 8 ml kg(- 1) d(- 1), respectively. When turtles were exposed <b>to</b> fresh <b>water,</b> rates increased by approximately 30 %. Upon return <b>to</b> salt <b>water,</b> rates decreased <b>to</b> original levels. Plasma osmolality, Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-) decreased during exposure <b>to</b> fresh <b>water,</b> and subsequently increased during the return <b>to</b> salt <b>water.</b> The Na(+) :K(+) ratio was elevated during the fresh water phase and subsequently decreased upon return <b>to</b> salt <b>water.</b> Aldosterone and corticosterone were not altered during exposure <b>to</b> fresh <b>water.</b> Elevated water flux rates during fresh water exposure reflected {{an increase in}} water consumption, resulting in a decrease in ionic and osmotic concentrations. The lack {{of a change in}} adrenocorticoids <b>to</b> acute fresh <b>water</b> exposure suggests that adrenal responsiveness to an hypo-osmotic environment may be delayed in marine turtles when compared to marine mammals...|$|R
