25|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>PPE</b> and SPE are RISC {{architectures}} with a fixed-width 32-bit instruction format. <b>The</b> <b>PPE</b> {{contains a}} 64-bit {{general purpose register}} set (GPR), a 64-bit floating point register set (FPR), and a 128-bit Altivec register set. The SPE contains 128-bit registers only. These {{can be used for}} scalar data types ranging from 8-bits to 64-bits in size or for SIMD computations on a variety of integer and floating point formats. System memory addresses for both <b>the</b> <b>PPE</b> and SPE are expressed as 64-bit values for a theoretic address range of 264 bytes (16 exabytes or 16,777,216 terabytes). In practice, not all of these bits are implemented in hardware. Local store addresses internal to the SPU (Synergistic Processor Unit) processor are expressed as a 32-bit word. In documentation relating to Cell a word is always taken to mean 32 bits, a doubleword means 64 bits, and a quadword means 128 bits.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>PPE,</b> {{which is}} capable of running a {{conventional}} operating system, has control over the SPEs and can start, stop, interrupt, and schedule processes running on the SPEs. To this end <b>the</b> <b>PPE</b> has additional instructions relating to control of the SPEs. Unlike SPEs, <b>the</b> <b>PPE</b> can read and write the main memory and the local memories of SPEs through the standard load/store instructions. [...] Despite having Turing complete architectures, the SPEs are not fully autonomous and require <b>the</b> <b>PPE</b> to prime them before they can do any useful work. As most of the [...] "horsepower" [...] of the system comes from the synergistic processing elements, the use of DMA {{as a method of}} data transfer and the limited local memory footprint of each SPE pose a major challenge to software developers who wish {{to make the most of}} this horsepower, demanding careful hand-tuning of programs to extract maximal performance from this CPU.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>PPE</b> is the Power Architecture based, dual issue in-order two-way multithreaded core with 23-stages {{pipeline}} {{acting as}} the controller for the eight SPEs, which handle most of the computational workload.

[...] <b>The</b> <b>PPE</b> will work with conventional operating systems due to its similarity to other 64-bit PowerPC processors, while the SPEs are designed for vectorized floating point code execution. <b>The</b> <b>PPE</b> contains a 64 KiB level 1 cache (32 KiB instruction and a 32 KiB data) and a 512 KiB Level 2 cache.

Additionally, IBM has included an AltiVec(VMX) unit which is fully pipelined for single precision floating point (Altivec 1 does not support double precision floating-point vectors.), 32-bit Fixed Point Unit (FXU) with 64-bit register file per thread, Load and Store Unit (LSU), 64-bit Floating-Point Unit (FPU) , Branch Unit (BRU) and Branch Execution Unit(BXU).|$|E
2500|$|While the Cell chip {{can have}} a number of {{different}} configurations, the basic configuration is a multi-core chip composed of one [...] "Power Processor Element" [...] ("PPE") (sometimes called [...] "Processing Element", or [...] "PE"), and multiple [...] "Synergistic Processing Elements" [...] ("SPE"). <b>The</b> <b>PPE</b> and SPEs are linked together by an internal high speed bus dubbed [...] "Element Interconnect Bus" [...] ("EIB"). Due to the nature of its applications, Cell is optimized towards single precision floating point computation. The SPEs are capable of performing double precision calculations, albeit with an order of magnitude performance penalty. [...] New chips expected mid-2008 are rumored to boost SPE double precision performance as high as 5x over pre-2008 designs.

40|$|International audienceInformation on {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of past vegetation on local, regional and global scales is increasingly used within climate modelling, nature conservancy and archaeology. It is possible to obtain such information from fossil pollen records in lakes and bogs using the landscape reconstruction algorithm (LRA) and its two models, REVEALS and LOVE. These models assume that reliable pollen productivity estimates (PPEs) are available for the plant taxa involved in the quantitative reconstruc -tions of past vegetation, and that PPEs are constant through time. This paper presents and discusses <b>the</b> <b>PPEs</b> for 15 tree and 18 herb taxa obtained in nine study areas of Europe. Observed differences in PPEs between regions {{may be explained by}} methodological issues and environmental variables, of which climate and related factors such as reproduction strategies and growth forms appear to be the most important. An evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>PPEs</b> at hand so far suggests that they can be used in modelling applications and quantitative reconstructions of pastvegetation, provided that consideration of past environmental variability within the region is used to inform selection of PPEs, and bearing in mind that PPEs might have changed through time as a response to climate change. Application of a range of possible PPEs will allow a better evaluation of the results...|$|R
2500|$|To {{achieve the}} high {{performance}} needed for mathematically intensive tasks, such as decoding/encoding MPEG streams, generating or transforming three-dimensional data, or undertaking Fourier analysis of data, the Cell processor marries the SPEs and <b>the</b> <b>PPE</b> via EIB to give access, via fully cache coherent DMA (direct memory access), to both main memory {{and to other}} external data storage. To {{make the best of}} EIB, and to overlap computation and data transfer, each of the nine processing elements (PPE and SPEs) is equipped with a DMA engine. [...] Since the SPE's load/store instructions can only access its own local scratchpad memory, each SPE entirely depends on DMAs to transfer data to and from the main memory and other SPEs' local memories. A DMA operation can transfer either a single block area of size up to 16KB, or a list of 2 to 2048 such blocks. One of the major design decisions in the architecture of Cell is the use of DMAs as a central means of intra-chip data transfer, with a view to enabling maximal asynchrony and concurrency in data processing inside a chip.|$|E
2500|$|Each SPE is a dual {{issue in}} order {{processor}} {{composed of a}} [...] "Synergistic Processing Unit", SPU, and a [...] "Memory Flow Controller", MFC (DMA, MMU, and bus interface). SPEs don't have any branch prediction hardware (hence there is a heavy burden on the compiler). Each SPE has 6 execution units divided among odd and even pipelines on each SPE : The SPU runs a specially developed instruction set (ISA) with 128-bit SIMD organization for single and double precision instructions. With {{the current generation of}} the Cell, each SPE contains a 256KiB embedded SRAM for instruction and data, called [...] "Local Storage" [...] (not to be mistaken for [...] "Local Memory" [...] in Sony's documents that refer to the VRAM) which is visible to <b>the</b> <b>PPE</b> and can be addressed directly by software. Each SPE can support up to 4 GiB of local store memory. The local store does not operate like a conventional CPU cache since it is neither transparent to software nor does it contain hardware structures that predict which data to load. The SPEs contain a 128-bit, 128-entry register file and measures 14.5mm2 on a 90nm process. An SPE can operate on sixteen 8-bit integers, eight 16-bit integers, four 32-bit integers, or four single-precision floating-point numbers in a single clock cycle, as well as a memory operation.

40|$|In a {{previous}} study we found that certain 3 -phenylpiperidines (PPEs, 5) display a good activity at alpha(2) -adrenergic receptors (alpha(2) -AR), whereas they are completely inactive at alpha(1) -AR. <b>The</b> <b>PPEs</b> 5 are conformationally restricted analogs of the corresponding adrenergic drug with a phenylethylamine structure (PAEs, 4) in which the benzylic hydroxyl group characteristic of the adrenergic catecholamines is not present.

As such PPE 5 a provided a unique template for the design of alpha(2) -AR ligands. On the basis of these premises, we synthesized all the possible dimethylphenyl-substituted isomers of PPE 5 a.
