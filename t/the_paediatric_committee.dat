The objective of the workshop was to analyse which juvenile animal studies proposals were received and agreed by <b>the</b> <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee,</b> to check consistency and how to apply the existing European guideline on juvenile animal studies. A comparison of main organ system development in man vs. animal species was presented to guide the review and to support species selection and protocol design. An analysis of juvenile animal studies included in finalised PIP's was also presented. Out of 109 paediatric investigation plans finalised between November 2008 and March 2009, 43 included one or more juvenile animal studies. In most cases the preferred species was the rat; one species only was requested to be studied (20 / 22), but in a minority two species were required (2 / 22). When deciding {{on the characteristics of}} the juvenile animal studies, such as age of animals at study start, the age of the children targeted by the medicine was considered. It is expected that the increasing experience gained by Applicants and Regulators will allow further refining the criteria for these juvenile animal studies. Further research on this topic is highly encouraged in the European Regulatory framework...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Status epilepticus (SE) is a lifethreatening {{neurological}} emergency. SE lasting {{longer than}} 120 min and not responding to first-line and second-line antiepileptic drugs {{is defined as}} 'refractory' (RCSE) and requires intensive care unit treatment. There is currently neither evidence nor consensus to guide either the optimal choice of therapy or treatment goals for RCSE, which is generally treated with coma induction using conventional anaesthetics (high dose midazolam, thiopental and/or propofol). Increasing evidence indicates that ketamine (KE), a strong N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, may be effective in treating RCSE. We hypothesised that intravenous KE is more efficacious and safer than conventional anaesthetics in treating RCSE. Methods and analysis: A multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-profit, sequentially designed study will be conducted to assess the efficacy of KE compared with conventional anaesthetics {{in the treatment of}} RCSE in children. 10 Italian centres/ hospitals are involved in enrolling 57 patients aged 1 month to 18 years with RCSE. Primary outcome is the resolution of SE up to 24 hours after withdrawal of therapy and is updated for each patient treated according to the sequential method. Ethics and dissemination: The study received ethical approval from <b>the</b> Tuscan <b>Paediatric</b> Ethics <b>Committee</b> (12 / 2015). The results of this study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences...|$|R
40|$|The {{timing of}} immunisations for preterm infants is controversial. Because of the {{statement}} by <b>the</b> British <b>Paediatric</b> Association/Joint <b>Committee</b> on Vaccination and Immunisation Liaison group that immunisations should normally begin {{three months after the}} date of birth, the records of all infants born in 1984 and currently (June 1986) resident in the London Borough of Newham were studied to find out if this recommendation was being implemented. Subjects were divided into groups by birth weight and where possible by gestational age. Cumulative uptakes by age of any component of the first and third triple immunisations, and of the pertussis component, were plotted separately. Comparison of uptake of the first course showed a considerable initial delay for infants weighing less than 2000 g at birth compared with heavier babies, but by 18 months the coverage was almost identical. This difference was not evident for the third course. A similar delay was apparent when infants of 37 weeks' gestation or less were compared with babies born at full term, though recording of gestational age was incomplete. Final overall uptake was poor for all groups. Differences among groups in numbers consenting were not an important factor. Informing those responsible for giving the immunisations of these findings has stimulated their interest in improving practice by implementing the recommendations...|$|R

40|$|This European Respiratory Society {{task force}} has {{reviewed}} {{the evidence for}} paediatric medicines in respiratory disease occurring in adults and children. We describe off-licence use, research priorities and ongoing studies. Off-licence and off-label prescribing in children is widespread and potentially harmful. Research areas in asthma include novel formulations and regimens, and individualised prescribing. In cystic fibrosis, future studies will focus on screened infants and robust outcome measures are needed. Other areas include new enzyme and antibiotic formulations and the basic defect. Research into pneumonia should include evaluation of new antibacterials and regimens, rapid diagnostic tests and, in pleural infection, antibiotic penetration, fibrinolytics and surveillance. In uncommon conditions, such as primary ciliary dyskinesia, congenital pulmonary abnormalities or neuromuscular disorders, drugs indicated for other conditions (e. g. dornase alfa) are commonly used and trials are needed. In neuromuscular disorders, the beta-agonists may enhance muscle strength and {{are in need of}} evaluation.

In children with UTI different authors suggest an incidence of VUR between 22 % to 52 % (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). With growth and maturation of the vesicoureteral junction up to 79 % of VURs disappear spontaneously (6, 7). VUR is more common in siblings of patients with VUR (8, 9) and in children of parents with documented VUR (10).

[1] However this guideline contains information more specifically adapted to the European practice. This guideline summarises the views of <b>the</b> <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine. II Background and Definition Cystography is undertaken most commonly to detect vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR). [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] The generally accepted reference method is the radiological micturating cystogram (MCU) although the direct catheter isotope cystogram (DIC) is as sensitive as and has a lower radiation burden than the MCU [2]. The indirect radionuclide cystogram (IRC) offers the possibility of detecting VUR without a bladder catheter, and allows micturition to be studied under physiological conditions [8, 9, 10]. With MCU and DIC both the filling and micturition phases can be studied, however only the micturition phase may be studied with the IRC [11, 12, 13, 14].

40|$|Aims In the EU, {{development}} of new medicines for children should follow a prospectively agreed paediatric investigation plan (PIP). Finding the right dose for children is crucial but challenging due to the variability of pharmacokinetics across age groups and the limited sample sizes available. We examined strategies adopted in PIPs to support paediatric dosing recommendations to identify common assumptions underlying dose investigations and the attempts planned to verify them in children. Methods We extracted data from 73 PIP opinions recently adopted by <b>the</b> <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> of the European Medicines Agency. These opinions represented 79 medicinal development programmes and comprised a total of 97 dose investigation studies. We identified the design of these dose investigation studies, recorded the analyses planned and determined the criteria used to define target doses. Results Most dose investigation studies are clinical trials (83 of 97) that evaluate a single dosing rule. Sample sizes used to investigate dose are highly variable across programmes, with smaller numbers used in younger children (< 2 years). Many studies (40 of 97) do not pre-specify a target dose criterion. Of those that do, most (33 of 57 studies) guide decisions using pharmacokinetic data alone. Conclusions Common assumptions underlying dose investigation strategies include dose proportionality and similar exposure−response relationships in adults and children. Few development programmes pre-specify steps to verify assumptions in children. There is scope {{for the use of}} Bayesian methods as a framework for synthesizing existing information to quantify prior uncertainty about assumptions.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Since 2007, it is {{mandatory}} for {{the pharmaceutical companies}} to submit a Paediatric Investigation Plan to <b>the</b> <b>Paediatric</b> <b>Committee</b> at the European Medicines Agency for any drug in development in adults, and it often leads {{to the need to}} conduct a pharmacokinetic study in children. Pharmacokinetic studies in children raise ethical and methodological issues. Because of limitation of sampling times, appropriate methods, such as the population approach, are necessary for analysis of the pharmacokinetic data. The choice of the pharmacokinetic sampling design has an important impact on the precision of population parameter estimates. Approaches for design evaluation and optimization based on the evaluation of the Fisher information matrix (M(F)) have been proposed and are now implemented in several software packages, such as PFIM in R. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this work were to (1) develop a joint population pharmacokinetic model to describe the pharmacokinetic characteristics of a drug S and its active metabolite in children after intravenous drug administration from simulated plasma concentration-time data produced using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) predictions; (2) optimize the pharmacokinetic sampling times for an upcoming clinical study using a multi-response design approach, considering clinical constraints; and (3) evaluate the resulting design taking data below the lower limit of quantification (BLQ) into account. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles were simulated in children using a PBPK model previously developed with the software SIMCYP(®) for the parent drug and its active metabolite. Data were analysed using non-linear mixed-effect models with the software NONMEM(®), using a joint model for the parent drug and its metabolite. The population pharmacokinetic design, for the future study in 82 children from 2 to 18 years old, each receiving a single dose of the drug, was then optimized using PFIM, assuming identical times for parent and metabolite concentration measurements and considering clinical constraints. Design evaluation was based on the relative standard errors (RSEs) of the parameters of interest. In the final evaluation of the proposed design, an approach was used to assess the possible effect of BLQ concentrations on the design efficiency. This approach consists of rescaling the M(F), using, at each sampling time, the probability of observing a concentration BLQ computed from Monte-Carlo simulations. RESULTS: A joint pharmacokinetic model with three compartments for the parent drug and one for its active metabolite, with random effects on four parameters, was used to fit the simulated PBPK concentration-time data. A combined error model best described the residual variability. Parameters and dose were expressed per kilogram of bodyweight. Reaching a compromise between PFIM results and clinical constraints, the optimal design was composed of four samples at 0. 1, 1. 8, 5 and 10 h after drug injection. This design predicted RSE lower than 30 % for the four parameters of interest. For this design, rescaling M(F) for BLQ data had very little influence on predicted RSE. CONCLUSION: PFIM was a useful tool to find an optimal sampling design in children, considering clinical constraints. Even if it was not forecasted initially by the investigators, this approach showed that it was really necessary to include a late sampling time for all children. Moreover, we described an approach to evaluate designs assuming expected proportions of BLQ data are omitted...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The lack of {{availability}} of appropriate medicines for children is an extensive and well known problem. Paediatricians and Physicians who {{take care of}} <b>the</b> <b>paediatric</b> population are primarily exposed {{to cope with this}} negative situation very often as {{more than half of the}} children are prescribed off-label or unlicensed medicines. Discussion Medicinal products used to treat this population should be subjected to ethical research of high quality and be explicitly authorised for use in children as it happens in adults. For that reason, and following the US experience, <b>the</b> European <b>Paediatric</b> Regulation has been amended in January 2007 by the European Commission. The objective of <b>the</b> <b>Paediatric</b> Regulation is to improve the development of high quality and ethically researched medicines for children aged 0 to 17 years, to facilitate the {{availability of}} information on the use of medicines for children, without subjecting children to unnecessary trials, or delaying the authorisation of medicines for use in adults. Summary <b>The</b> <b>Paediatric</b> Regulation is dramatically changing the regulatory environment for paediatric medicines in Europe and is fuelling an increased number of clinical trials in <b>the</b> <b>paediatric</b> population. Nevertheless, there are some risks and pitfalls that need to be anticipated and controlled in order to ensure that children will ultimately benefit from this European initiative. </p...|$|R
