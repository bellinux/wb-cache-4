40|$|Building on {{register}} data describing monthly {{labour market}} status {{for the whole}} Norwegian population 1992 - 95, we estimate grouped competing risk hazard rate models for transitions between employment, unemployment and non-participation. The models impose no parametric restrictions on either calendar time- or spell duration effects. There is a substantial business cycle element in all <b>transition</b> rates apart <b>from</b> <b>transitions</b> <b>from</b> employment to non-participation. Conditioned on observed covariates, {{there is a strong}} negative duration dependence in <b>transitions</b> <b>from</b> unemployment to employment. Economic incentives {{play an important role in}} <b>transitions</b> <b>from</b> unemployment to employment, as well as in <b>transitions</b> <b>from</b> employment to nonparticipation. A 10 per cent increase in the unemployment benefit replacement ratio reduces the <b>transition</b> rate <b>from</b> unemployment to employment with 4 - 7 per cent, while it reduces the <b>transition</b> rate <b>from</b> unemployment to non-participation with 10 - 13 per cent. Access to a particularly generous voluntary early retirement scheme increases the hazard rate from employment to non-participation with 40 - 80 per cent. More human capital entails higher job-to-job transition rates and lower transition rates to unemployment and non-participation. It is also associated with higher <b>transition</b> rates <b>from</b> unemployment to employment...|$|R

5|$|While the <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> the Early Neolithic to the Late Neolithic—which {{took place}} with the <b>transition</b> <b>from</b> the fourth to the third {{millennium}} BCE—witnessed much economic and technological continuity, it also saw a considerable change {{in the style of}} monuments erected, particularly in southern and eastern England. By 3,000 BCE, the long barrows, causewayed enclosures, and cursuses which had predominated in the Early Neolithic had ceased being built, and were instead replaced by circular monuments of various kinds. These include earthen henges, timber circles, and stone circles. These stone rings are found in most areas of Britain where stone is available, {{with the exception of the}} island's south-eastern corner. Stone circles are most densely concentrated in south-western Britain and on the north-eastern horn of Scotland, near Aberdeen.|$|E
