Dealing with Indonesian military operations in Aceh, the play was later performed in five other cities. In December 2002 it was scheduled to be broadcast on TVRI in commemoration of Human Rights Day, but pulled at the last minute due <b>to</b> <b>intervention</b> from the military.

5|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death (30%) amongst women in the United States, and the leading cause of chronic disease amongst them, {{affecting}} nearly 40% (Gronowski and Schindler, Tables I and IV). The onset occurs at a later age in women than in men. For instance the incidence of stroke in women under the age of 80 is less than that in men, but higher in those aged over 80. Overall the lifetime risk of stroke in women exceeds that in men. The risk of cardiovascular disease amongst those with diabetes and amongst smokers is also higher in women than in men. Many aspects of cardiovascular disease vary between women and men, including risk factors, prevalence, physiology, symptoms, response <b>to</b> <b>intervention</b> and outcome.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by the {{establishment}} of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of anti-fascism, and {{was close to the}} French Communist Party (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by Kurt Schwitters in Hanover, works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, ration stamp with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he briefly left France and joined the Republican forces. Alongside Soviet reporter Ilya Ehrenburg, Tzara visited Madrid, which was besieged by the Nationalists (see Siege of Madrid). Upon his return, he published the collection of poems Midis gagnés ("Conquered Southern Regions"). Some of them had previously been printed in the brochure Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists, Nancy Cunard and the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. Tzara had also signed Cunard's June 1937 call <b>to</b> <b>intervention</b> against Francisco Franco. Reportedly, he and Nancy Cunard were romantically involved.|$|E

50|$|In {{the context}} of a cluster {{randomised}} trial, the stepped-wedge design involves the collection of observations at a baseline period in which no clusters are exposed <b>to</b> the <b>intervention.</b> Following this, at regular intervals, or steps, a cluster (or group of clusters) is randomised <b>to</b> receive the <b>intervention.</b> This process continues until all clusters have crossed over <b>to</b> receive the <b>intervention.</b> Observations are taken at every cluster and at each time period.

40|$|Abstract. The Technicians and Interventions Scheduling Problem for Telecommunications embeds the {{scheduling}} of interventions, {{the assignment}} of teams <b>to</b> <b>interventions</b> and {{the assignment of}} technicians <b>to</b> teams. Every <b>intervention</b> is characterized, among others attributes, by a priority. The objective of this problem is <b>to</b> schedule <b>interventions</b> such that the interventions with the highest priority are scheduled at the earliest time possible while satisfying a set of constraints like the precedence between some interventions {{and the number of}} technicians with the required skill level by domain. To solve this problem, we propose a GRASP algorithm based on the dynamic update of the weights assigned <b>to</b> the <b>interventions</b> combined with a local search procedure. We also compute lower bounds and present experimental results that validate the effectiveness of this approach...|$|R
25|$|A causal {{network is}} a Bayesian network with an {{explicit}} {{requirement that the}} relationships be causal. The additional semantics of the causal networks specify that if a node X is actively caused {{to be in a}} given state x (an action written as do(X=x)), then the probability density function changes to the one of the network obtained by cutting the links from the parents of X to X, and setting X to the caused value x. Using these semantics, one can predict the impact of external interventions from data obtained prior <b>to</b> <b>intervention.</b>|$|E

Worried about the fate of the Beta Israel during the transition period, the Israeli government, with the help of several private groups, resumed the migration. Over the course of 36 hours, a total of 34 El Al passenger planes, with their seats removed to maximize passenger capacity, flew 14,325 Beta Israel non-stop to Israel.

Local firms are able to take capital out of the country in order to expand globally. However, local households are restricted in their ability to diversify globally. Because of the expansion of the current and capital accounts, India is increasingly moving towards full de facto convertibility.|$|E
