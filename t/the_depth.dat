5|$|<b>The</b> <b>depth</b> of {{the first}} stop is found from the tissue {{compartment}} with the highest partial pressure, and <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of first decompression stop is the standard stop depth where this partial pressure is nearest without exceeding the critical pressure ratio.|$|E
5|$|A PDIS {{is not a}} {{mandatory}} stop, nor is it considered {{a substitute for the}} more important shallow safety stop on a no-stop dive. Switching breathing gas mix during the ascent will influence <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the stop.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{factors were}} added to <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> in <b>the</b> table {{to take into account}} <b>depth</b> gauge errors. <b>The</b> <b>depths</b> used for {{calculations}} were 2.4% greater than <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> listed in <b>the</b> two lower altitude tables, and 3% + 1msw greater than <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> listed in <b>the</b> highest altitude table.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a {{hidden line removal}} scheme for 2 D cartoon images. <b>The</b> <b>depths</b> are introduced to the polylines of the image. The surfaces of the image are classified and their depths updated according to <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> of polylines forming the surfaces. The hidden lines are identified by comparing <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> of <b>the</b> polylines with <b>the</b> <b>depths</b> of <b>the</b> surfaces. This algorithm has been applied successfully to our cartoon development system...|$|R

5|$|A divers' {{cognition}} may {{be affected}} on dives as shallow as , but the changes are not usually noticeable. There is no reliable method to predict <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> at which narcosis becomes noticeable, or {{the severity of the}} effect on an individual diver, as it may vary from dive to dive even on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels produce sonar {{waves in}} order to measure <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract is that the animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E
5|$|An ice core is a {{vertical}} column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into firn. Firn is not dense {{enough to prevent}} air from escaping; but at a density of about 830kg/m3 it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture {{the composition of the}} atmosphere at the time the ice formed. <b>The</b> <b>depth</b> at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64m to 115m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At Summit Camp in Greenland, <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at Dome C in Antarctica <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500m the crystal structure of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a clathrate. The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.|$|E

5|$|Apart from <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> and {{consistent}} {{nature of the}} alluvium, Mummy Cave is also characterized by extreme dryness. The pointed shape of the cliff above prevents rain and meltwater from percolating through the rock to the cave, {{and there are no}} vertical joints in the rock above.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{which follows}} the {{procedure}} of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth {{is known as}} staged decompression. The ascent rate and <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression {{is that it is}} far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to high ambient pressure have physiological effects that limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Humans are not physiologically and anatomically well adapted to the environmental conditions of diving, and various equipment has been developed to extend <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> and duration of human dives, and allow different types {{of work to be}} done.|$|E

5|$|It {{consists}} of a horizontal bar or bars suspended at <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of intended decompression stops by buoys.

5|$|Like most corvettes, Fredericton was {{installed}} with a Type 123A ASDIC detection system. This technology was designed in 1934 for armed trawlers and minesweepers of the Royal Navy. The system was outdated but {{was the best}} system available to the Canadian Navy at the time. Type 123A could detect the distance to underwater sounds but could not determine <b>the</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|E
5|$|PDISs are {{intermediate}} {{stops at}} a depth above <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> at which the leading compartment for the decompression calculation switches from ongassing to offgassing and below <b>the</b> <b>depth</b> of the first obligatory decompression stop, (or the surface, on a no-decompression dive). The ambient pressure at that depth is low enough {{to ensure that the}} tissues are mostly offgassing inert gas, although under a very small pressure gradient. This combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth. The leading compartment is generally not the fastest compartment except in very short dives, for which this model does not require an intermediate stop.|$|E
