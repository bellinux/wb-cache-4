Alignment procedures usually consist of cross-correlation routines between subsequent images in the tilt series—either across the whole image or between manually indicated regions of the image (for instance, a low concentration of gold nanoparticles are sometimes added to samples before imaging to serve as fiducial markers). Alignment is usually more accurate when carried out using fiducial markers because of their high contrast, but they can obscure parts of the sample through shadowing effects.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since Hebb’s {{work on the}} {{organization}} of the brain [16] finding cell assemblies in neural spike trains has become a vivid field of research. As modern multi-electrode techniques allow to record the electrical potentials of many neurons in parallel, there is an increasing need for efficient and reliable algorithms to identify assemblies as expressed by synchronous spiking activity. We present a method that is able to cope with two core challenges of this complex task: temporal imprecision (spikes are <b>not</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>aligned</b> across the spike trains) and selective participation (neurons in an ensemble do not all contribute a spike to all synchronous spiking events).

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a survey {{comparing}} different deflection routing based techniques applied to optical burst switching (OBS) networks. For such study we consider the E-OBS architecture proposed in [1] which is an advantageous solution for OBS networks since routing decision can be taken freely inside the network without constraints {{on the length of}} the path. Under this environment, several effective routing strategies proposed in the literature are applied, namely deflection routing, reflection routing, reflection-deflection routing and multitopology routing. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse all these techniques considering both asynchronous and synchronous burst arrivals and compare their benefits. Moreover, we focus on a quasi-synchronous burst arrival case (with bursts <b>not</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>aligned)</b> and analyse the trade-off between performance and alignment.
