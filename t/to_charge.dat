5|$|Another {{prominent}} initiate was Gabriel Carillo (Caradoc ap Cador), who in {{the late}} 1970s developed a written body of Feri teachings, and began offering paid classes in the tradition in the 1980s, generating the Bloodrose lineage; doing so generated controversy among Feri initiates, with critics believing that it was morally wrong <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> for teaching.|$|E
5|$|Article 14(2)(a) of the Constitution {{provides}} that Parliament may restrict {{the right to}} {{freedom of speech and}} expression to provide against contempt of court.

40|$|We {{present an}} exactly {{solvable}} model for one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases with Z_N×Z_N symmetry. The model works by binding point topological defects (domain walls) of one symmetry <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> {{of the other}} and condensing these bound states. Binding single topological defects <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> leads <b>to</b> symmetry-protected topological phases, while binding multiple topological defects <b>to</b> <b>charges</b> leads <b>to</b> phases {{with a combination of}} symmetry-breaking and topological properties.

5|$|Like their English counterparts, Welsh {{universities}} are able <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> up to £9,000 {{a year in}} tuition fees.

5|$|Portable devices {{having an}} USB On-The-Go port may want <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> and access USB {{peripheral}} {{at the same}} time, but having only a single port (both due to On-The-Go and space requirement) prevents this. Accessory charging adapters (ACA) are devices which allow a charging power to be injected into an On-The-Go connection between host and peripheral.|$|E

5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E

Booth was a graceful right-handed middle order batsman at No. 4 or 5, and occasionally bowled right arm medium pace or off spin.
