5|$|The {{cardiac glycosides}} are {{powerful}} drugs from medicinal plants including foxglove and lily of the valley. They include digoxin and digitoxin which support <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> the heart, {{and act as}} diuretics.|$|E
5|$|CSF {{moves in}} a single outward {{direction}} from the ventricles, but multidirectionally in the subarachnoid space. Fluid movement is pulsatile, matching the pressure waves generated in blood vessels by <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> the heart. Some authors dispute this, posing {{that there is no}} unidirectional CSF circulation, but cardiac cycle-dependent bi-directional systolic-diastolic to-and-fro cranio-spinal CSF movements.|$|E
5|$|When prey is swallowed, it is {{liquefied}} in the pharynx by enzymes and by muscular contractions of the pharynx. The resulting slurry is wafted {{through the}} canal system by <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> the cilia, and digested by the nutritive cells. The ciliary rosettes in the canals {{may help to}} transport nutrients to muscles in the mesoglea. The anal pores may eject unwanted small particles, but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via the mouth.|$|E

5|$|The {{violence}} was worse in Huế, where {{the approach of}} government forces was met by <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> Buddhist drums and cymbals to alert the populace. The townsfolk left {{their homes in the}} middle of the night in an attempt to defend the city's pagodas. At Từ Đàm, the temple of Buddhist protest leader Thích Trí Quang, monks attempted to burn the coffin of a monk who had self-immolated recently. Government soldiers, firing M1 rifles, overran the pagoda and confiscated the coffin. They demolished a statue of Gautama Buddha and looted and vandalized the pagoda. They then set off an explosion, leveling much of the pagoda. Many Buddhists were shot, beheaded, confiscated, and clubbed to death.|$|E
5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember the bounds of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

25|$|Several months later, Catherine Lavaux {{used the}} {{expression}} {{in the title of}} a work: La Réunion, du battant des lames au sommet des montagnes ("Réunion, from <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> the waves to the summit of the mountains"). The work appeared in several editions, the latest in 1998.|$|E
25|$|Justifications for harsher punishments for {{hate crimes}} {{focus on the}} notion that hate crimes cause greater {{individual}} and societal harm. It is said that, when the core of a person’s identity is attacked, the degradation and dehumanization is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the disempowerment of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The riots in Los Angeles, California that followed <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> Rodney King, a Black motorist, by a group of White police officers are cited as support for this argument. <b>The</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> white truck driver Reginald Denny by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{came to a}} head in November 1942 {{sparked by}} <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> a {{suspected}} informer on Saturday evening November 14. Further beatings and arrests of two suspects inflamed the situation and workers went on strike on November 19. A compromise was reached by the director and the evacuees' Emergency Executive Council, ending the strike on November 24.|$|E

25|$|The {{book also}} {{describes}} a second method of black bear hunting involving <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> small patches of forest, when the bears march out in single file. However, black bears were rarely hunted for sport, {{because of the}} poor quality of their fur and the ease by which they could be shot in trees, or stalked, as their hearing was poor.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the shooting, CAIR reported an escalation in anti-Muslim hate crimes in the U.S., including the throwing of a pig's head at a mosque in Philadelphia, <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> a Queens shop owner, and incidents of death threats and vandalism. A number of attacks and incidents of vandalism in southern California in the weeks following the attack were investigated as anti-Muslim hate crimes.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Soapy and {{his brother}} Bascomb Smith became too well known, {{and even the most}} corrupt city {{officials}} could no longer protect them. Their influence and Denver-based empire began to crumble. When they were charged with attempted murder for <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> a saloon manager, Bascomb was jailed, but Soapy managed to escape, becoming a wanted man in Colorado. Lou Blonger {{and his brother}} Sam, rivals of the Soap Gang, acquired his former control of Denver's criminals.|$|E
5000|$|The music {{actually}} effects the environment. The entire backdrop bumps to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> background music. Different events {{occur on}} <b>the</b> <b>beats</b> <b>of</b> each song - {{some of which}} are dangerous. For example, a column of fire shoots up from a ruined gas station on every [...] "bass hit" [...] of a song's chorus. Other changes will be purely cosmetic: hubcaps on cars will spin and twinkle to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> each song. <b>The</b> developers have added more damage to a fighter's punches and kicks if they occur [...] "to the beat" [...] or making a rapper stronger if one of their songs is playing. By listening to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song and then timing a throw, the player can toss his opponent into an environmental hazard just as it goes off. On the Xbox 360 Console, players are also able to load up their own music (Custom Soundtracks), and the game has a form <b>of</b> <b>beat</b> detection to find <b>the</b> <b>beats</b> from any song.|$|R

25|$|By 1990, the LAPD, {{which had}} {{followed}} a para-militaristic model since Chief Parker's {{regime in the}} 1950s, became more alienated from minority communities following accusations of racial profiling. In 1992, a jury in suburban Simi Valley acquitted white Los Angeles police officers involved in <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> a black motorist, Rodney King, the year before. After four days of rioting, more than fifty deaths, {{and billions of dollars}} of property losses, mostly in the Central City, the National Guard and the police finally regained control.|$|E
25|$|Three other NYPD officers, Bruder, Bellomo, and Wiese, {{were indicted}} {{for trying to}} cover up the assault. On March 9, 2000, Wiese and Bruder along with Schwarz were convicted on the charge of {{conspiracy}} to obstruct a federal investigation into the assault on Louima, but their convictions were reversed by a federal appeals court in February 2002 for insufficient evidence. Bellomo was found not guilty of {{trying to cover up}} <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> Louima and that of another Haitian immigrant by Volpe earlier that evening.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{as soon as}} the {{disturbances}} {{broke out}} in South Central, local television news cameras were on the scene to record the events as they happened. Television coverage of the riots was near-continuous, starting with <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> motorists at the intersection of Florence and Normandie broadcast live by television news pilot/reporter Bob Tur and his camera operator Marika Gerrard. By virtue of their extensive coverage, mainstream television stations provided a vivid, comprehensive and valuable record of the violence occurring on the streets of Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|At Nalanda, a Buddhist university, {{four hours}} a day and {{four hours a}}t night were {{measured}} by a water clock, which consisted of a copper bowl holding two large floats in a larger bowl filled with water. The bowl was filled with water from a small hole at its bottom; it sank when completely filled and was marked by <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> a drum at daytime. The amount of water added varied with the seasons and this clock was operated by the students of the university.|$|E
25|$|Blood squirt (blood spurt, blood spray, blood gush, {{or blood}} jet) {{is the effect}} when an artery, a blood vessel {{in the human body}} (or other organism's body) is cut. Blood {{pressure}} causes the blood to bleed out at a rapid, intermittent rate, in a spray or jet, coinciding with <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> the heart, rather than the slower, but steady flow of venous bleeding. Also known as arterial bleeding, arterial spurting, or arterial gushing, the amount of blood loss can be copious, occur very rapidly, and can lead to death.|$|E
25|$|Herod enters, {{followed}} {{by his wife}} and court. He slips in Narraboth's blood and starts hallucinating. He hears <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> <b>of</b> wings. Despite Herodias' objections, Herod stares lustfully at Salome, who rejects him. Jochanaan harasses Herodias from the well, calling her incestuous marriage to Herod sinful. She demands that Herod silence him. Herod refuses, and she mocks his fear. Five Jews argue concerning the nature of God. Two Nazarenes tell of Christ's miracles; at one point they bring up the raising of Jairus' daughter from the dead, which Herod finds frightening.|$|E
