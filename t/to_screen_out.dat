5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men. Women were also {{accepted into the}} military in the U.S. Women's Army Corps (WACs) and U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). Unlike processes <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> male homosexuals, which had been in place since the creation of the American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by {{the military in the}} 1940s, and frailty discouraged.|$|E
25|$|In urban areas, {{increased}} egg-eating raccoons, foxes, and coyotes, {{as well as}} feral dogs or cats, may impact painted turtles. Some {{cities have}} experimented with nest enclosures <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> predators.|$|E
25|$|Bills {{receive a}} First Reading {{when they are}} {{published}} in the House Journal. They then undergo a Second Reading upon assignment to committee. The committee system is designed <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> legislation that is, in the committee's judgment, unnecessary or not ready for passage.|$|E
50|$|Labor {{relations}} consulting firms began providing {{seminars on}} union avoidance {{strategies in the}} 1970s. Agencies moved from subverting unions <b>to</b> <b>screening</b> <b>out</b> union sympathizers during hiring, indoctrinating workforces, and propagandizing against unions.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{it can be}} {{inferred}} {{that the use of}} bulk foam stability tests should be restricted <b>to</b> <b>screening</b> <b>out</b> significantly lower performers. <b>Screening</b> <b>out</b> surfactants with closely matching performance by bulk foam stability tests alone is open to the risk of eliminating competent surfactants.|$|R

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{controversy}} {{is the relationship}} between smoking and sensory gating in schizophrenia. Nicotine may help improve auditory gating, the ability <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> intrusive environmental sounds. This may help improve attention spans and reduce auditory hallucinations, allowing people with schizophrenia to perceive the environment more effectively and engage in smoother motor functions. However, research shows this effect alone cannot account for increased smoking rates.|$|E
25|$|The EEG {{has been}} used for many {{purposes}} besides the conventional uses of clinical diagnosis and conventional cognitive neuroscience. An early use was during World War II by the U.S. Army Air Corps <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> pilots in danger of having seizures; long-term EEG recordings in epilepsy patients are still used today for seizure prediction. Neurofeedback remains an important extension, and in its most advanced form is also attempted as the basis of brain computer interfaces. The EEG is also used quite extensively in the field of neuromarketing. In recent years, researchers have relied on EEG to understand the neural basis of swallowing.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "sect filter", {{also known}} as a [...] "protective declaration" [...] (Schutzerklärung), is a {{document}} that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract. Such sect filters, primarily used <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> Scientologists, have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses. [...] "Sect commissioner's" [...] offices exist in Germany as part of regional or local government.|$|E

500|$|Shelters were {{established}} [...] due north, west {{and south of}} the tower, known as N-10,000, W-10,000 and S-10,000. Each had its own shelter chief: Robert Wilson at N-10,000, John Manley at W-10,000 and Frank Oppenheimer at S-10,000. Many other observers were around [...] away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations. Richard Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the goggles provided, relying on a truck windshield <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> harmful ultraviolet wavelengths.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early in}} March 2013, Qiao Xiaoyang, {{chairman}} of the Law Committee under the NPCSC, stated that Chief Executive candidates must be persons who love the country and love Hong Kong, who do not insist on confronting the central government. Observers stated that Qiao comment was <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> candidates from the opposition pro-democracy camp. Qiao also mentioned that [...] "the nominating committee is in fact an organisation. The nomination of Chief Executive candidates by the nominating committee {{is a form of}} organisational nomination.|$|E
2500|$|The pan-democracy camp {{saw it as}} {{the method}} <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> the {{opposition}} candidates as the pan-democrat candidates would not get a majority support from the nominating committee if its composition mirrors the existing Election Committee which dominated by pro-Beijing interests. The pan-democrat candidates were able to enter the Chief Executive elections by getting just one-eighth of the nomination threshold from the Election Committee. There were also some interpretations that an organisational nomination would be a breach of the Basic Law. The Democratic Party vowed to [...] "veto this revolting proposal." ...|$|E

2500|$|In many {{countries}} and cultures, {{it is the}} process that romantic relationships are developed and future spouses are found. Some people go on first dates to evaluate a person’s potential as a sexual partner. Often, people have dates arranged for them by their friends, or they meet the individual at work, a party, in class, in their community or online on a social media website or dating website. During the date, each participant can evaluate the compatibility of the other party and get the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> individuals who engage in behaviour that a person does not prefer.|$|E
2500|$|Admissions tries <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> {{difficult}} people. According to Dunbar, {{many colleges}} are [...] "afraid of aggression." [...] He recommends avoiding [...] "harsh humor" [...] or signs of severe emotion, anger, or aggression. Admissions evaluators look for signals that might indicate a difficult person, such as nonconstructive or disrespectful criticisms of others, or evidence of substance abuse. Colleges try {{to weed out}} dependent people who either follow their parents too closely, or do only what the [...] "cool kids" [...] do. Dunbar advised that [...] "parental control of any kind, if detected, can be very damaging," [...] and advised that students should {{not appear to be}} controlled by parental whims.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{difference between the}} basis of Professor Janda's conclusions and the concerns of industry is the presumption of how easy, or not, {{it will be for}} the Minister receiving a complaint to determine if it is [...] "frivolous or vexatious". [...] Professor Janda states that [...] "the general requirement that a complaint appear to be reasonable on its face is nevertheless sufficiently stringent to allow the Minister in question efficiently <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> complaints that are frivolous and vexatious", whereas industry representatives state that this will not be an easy determination, given that the complaints will likely relate to activities in remote areas and particularly if the complaint comes from an individual outside of Canada (in a developing country).|$|E

5000|$|The great {{advantage}} of universal, government-provided health insurance is lower costs. Canada's government-run insurance system has much less bureaucracy and much lower administrative costs than our largely private system. Medicare has much lower administrative costs than private insurance. The {{reason is that}} single-payer systems do not devote large resources <b>to</b> <b>screening</b> <b>out</b> high-risk clients or charging them higher fees. The savings from a single-payer system would probably exceed $200 billion a year, {{far more than the}} cost of covering all of those now uninsured.|$|R
2500|$|Rainwater tanks {{may have}} a high (perceived) initial cost. However, many homes use small scale rain barrels to harvest minute {{quantities}} of water for landscaping/gardening applications {{rather than as a}} potable water surrogate. These small rain barrels, often recycled from food storage and transport barrels or, in some cases, whiskey and wine aging barrels, are often inexpensive. [...] There are also many low cost designs that use locally available materials and village level technologies for applications in developing countries where there are limited alternatives for potable drinking water. [...] While most are properly engineered <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> mosquitoes, the lack of proper filtering or closed loop systems may create breeding grounds for larvae. With tanks used for drinking water, the user runs a health risk if maintenance is not carried out.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accuracy}} of the MBTI depends on honest self-reporting. Unlike some personality questionnaires, such as the 16PF Questionnaire, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, or the Personality Assessment Inventory, the MBTI does not use validity scales to assess exaggerated or socially desirable responses. As a result, individuals motivated to do so can fake their responses, and {{one study found that}} the MBTI judgment/perception dimension correlates weakly with the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire lie scale. If respondents [...] "fear they have something to lose, they may answer as they assume they should." [...] However, the MBTI ethical guidelines state, [...] "It is unethical and in many cases illegal to require job applicants to take the Indicator if the results will be used <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> applicants." [...] The intent of the MBTI is to provide [...] "a framework for understanding individual differences, and... a dynamic model of individual development".|$|E

'I shall go {{at once to}} {{my niece}} and tell her the whole circumstances--tell her that, by marrying Sir William, she allies herself with an unhappy gentleman {{in the power of}} a {{criminal}} son who makes his life a burden to him by perpetual demands upon his purse; who will increase those demands with his accession to wealth, threaten to degrade her by exposing her husband's antecedents if she opposes his extortions, and who will make her miserable by letting her know that her old lover was shamefully victimized by a youth she is bound <b>to</b> <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> of respect to her husband's feelings.
