40|$|The Rhine is {{the largest}} river {{discharge}} of the North Sea, and has considerable ecological importance {{as a source of}} nutrients and pollutants. While much of the Dutch coastal zone is intensively monitored, it is difficult to perform measurements within the first few km of discharge, a region of very high horizontal and vertical gradients, which influences strongly the fate of freshwater and riverborne material. A fine resolution 3 D hydrodynamic model, MU-ROFI, has been developed to simulate the flow in this initial discharge zone. The model is described briefly and a first set of model results is presented and discussed. The process of front formation and associated downwelling on the upstream (with respect to the <b>tide)</b> <b>boundary</b> of the freshwater plume, switching from the South to the North boundary as the tide turns, is illustrated. Qualitative comparison with CTD and airborne remotely sensed measurement indicates that such a behaviour is realistic, at least in conditions of low wind and neap tide...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of downscaling effects when modelling waves, tides and storm surge using a nested modelling system. In this study, the coupled POLCOMS/ProWAM models are used, with 3 nested computational domains, the largest of which covers part of north-eastern Atlantic Ocean with a coarse resolution grid and the smallest covers the surrounding waters of south-west Cornish coast of the UK with a finer resolution grid. Applying the identical surface wind forcing to all 3 computational domains and the wave and <b>tide</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions provided from the coarse to finer domains, the computed wave heights, tides and surge levels are examined at selected locations to study the downscaling effects. The results show that downscaling could considerably increase accuracy of model predictions in the local domain. For the particular test conditions used in the present study, 3 -level and 2 -level downscaling produces similar results in the local domain. The results also indicate that downscaling with reduction of grid resolution by 6 times is acceptable for the study site...|$|E

A nested, barotropic numerical tidal model was applied to the southern New England Bight (Long Island, Block Island, Rhode Island Sounds, Buzzards Bay, and the shelf south of Block Island).

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{developed}} a two-dimensional numerical model to predict tide and typhoon surge around Taiwan. The storm surge associating with a typhoon approaching to Taiwan {{is one of the}} main causes that floods frequently occur in the low land areas in certain exposed coastlines. The finite difference method is used to solve the control equations. The model area is 900 km × 900 km, and Taiwan lies in the central part of model. The <b>tides</b> at open <b>boundaries</b> of model are the driving forces for tidal flow inside the model. The <b>tides</b> at model <b>boundaries</b> are calculated through harmonic method making use of the principal tidal constants of M 2, S 2, K 1 and O 1 partial tides. Air pressure gradient and wind stress are considered as the driving forces for typhoon surge in this model. A circular storm model of Jelesnianski (1965) is taken here as the typhoon model. The combined effect of typhoon surge and tide will be studied in this model. The computed results are compared to the observed ones at some tidal stations around Taiwan. For strong wind region near typhoon center the computed results agree well with the observed data in most tidal gauge stations. For some typhoons, where the winds are weak and unstable, the computed results are poorly comparable to the observed ones. This may be due to the discrepancy between circular typhoon model and real typhoon. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} a spherical {{harmonic}} theory of ocean tides is presented. The theory {{is based on}} Laplace tide equations modified to include turbulence with constant eddy viscosity, linearized bottom friction, and oceanic loading and self-gravitation. Variable bathymetry is also treated in harmonic terms, and no-flow boundary conditions are applied at continental coastlines. The <b>tide</b> and <b>boundary</b> constraint equations are reduced to matrix form and solved by a weighted least-squares procedure. Five zonal luni-solar tides, ranging in period from 14 days to 18. 6 yr, are investigated using the theory; such tides have typically been difficult to compute using traditional numerical approaches. The polar motion {{and changes in the}} length of day induced by these long-period tides are calculated. Tidal solutions are compared extensively with results from other tidal theories and from recent satellite and sea-level observations. The greatest limitation to accurate prediction of zonal tides - for any theory - appears to be the marginal failure of all tide theories to conserve mass globally; the use of additional mass constraints may be warranted...|$|R
50|$|The topset beds of an {{advancing}} delta are {{deposited in}} {{turn over the}} previously laid foresets, truncating or covering them. Topsets are nearly horizontal layers of smaller-sized sediment deposited {{on the top of}} the delta and form an extension of the landward alluvial plain. As the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta, the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced, causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta's top. Topset beds are subdivided into two regions: the upper delta plain and the lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is unaffected by the <b>tide,</b> while the <b>boundary</b> with the lower delta plain is defined by the upper limit of tidal influence.|$|R
40|$|The investigation's main {{goals are}} to produce {{accurate}} tidal {{maps of the}} main diurnal, semidiurnal, and long-period tidal components in the world's deep oceans.

In the prelaunch phase, we will use in our simulations and preliminary work data supplied by previous oceanographic missions, such as Seasat and Geosat. These results will be of scientific interest in themselves. The investigation will also be concerned with the estimation of new values, and their uncertainties, for tidal currents and for the physical parameters appearing in the Laplace tidal equations, such as bottom friction coefficients and eddy viscosity coefficients. This will be done by incorporating the altimetry-derived charts of vertical <b>tides</b> as <b>boundary</b> conditions in the integration of those equations. The methodology of the tidal representation will include the use of appropriate series expansions such as ocean-basin normal modes and spherical harmonics.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some issues}} {{of the flow of}} ice in long and converging channels which may affect navigation. The emphasis is on pressure distributions and the role of ice properties and tidal currents. The present work employs an ice dynamics model that is based on a viscous plastic constitutive model with an elliptical yield envelope, the thickness redistribution model of Savage (2007), and a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) advection approach. Pressure distributions are obtained for an idealized geometry and uniform wind forcing. The results indicate that zones of relatively low pressures develop along the centre of the channel. Increasing the shear strength of the ice cover leads to somewhat lower pressures within such zones along the centre of the channel. That reduction of pressure is caused by the increased transfer of wind forces to land <b>boundaries.</b> <b>Tides</b> are shown to generally decrease pressures. The tidal currents also increase the overall drift, although drift slows and even reverses direction during parts of the tidal cycle. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Coral reefs {{are highly}} diverse {{ecosystems}} that provide food, income, and coastal protection {{for hundreds of}} millions of coastal dwellers. They are found in tropical and semi tropical areas spread throughout South-east Asia, the Caribbean, the Indonesian archipelago, on Australian coasts and in the Pacific islands. Coral reefs are subject to both anthropogenic and natural threats such as biological perturbations, floods, outflows carrying pollutants from land, runoff sediment, sewage, oil wastes, mining and quarrying processes, fisheries, tourism and coastal urbanization. The period for which these pollutants stay within the lagoon depends on the residence time. The longer a pollutant stays in the lagoon before being flushed away, the more destructive it will be to the lagoon and coral reef ecosystem. Residence time is probably influenced by many factors. This study established two numerical models, a simple model and the Delft 3 D model, of a lagoon fringed by coral reefs with <b>tides</b> as the <b>boundary</b> conditions. The study compares the simple and Delft 3 D model. Then a sensitivity analysis is made of several important parameters such as tides, coral reef depth, inlet geometry and lagoon geometry.

40|$|DESCRIPTION: The {{leatherback}} is the largest, deepest diving, {{and most}} migratory and wide ranging of all sea turtles. The adult leatherback can reach 4 to 8 {{feet in length}} and 500 to 2000 pounds in weight. Its shell is composed of a mosaic of small bones covered by firm, rubbery skin with seven longitudinal ridges or keels. The skin is predominantly black {{with varying degrees of}} pale spotting; including a notable pink spot on the dorsal surface of the head in adults. A toothlike cusp is located {{on each side of the}} gray upper jaw; the lower jaw is hooked anteriorly. The paddle-like clawless limbs are black with white margins and pale spotting. Hatchlings are predominantly black with white flipper margins and keels on the carapace. Jellyfish are the main staple of its diet, but it is also known to feed on sea urchins, squid, crustaceans, tunicates, fish, blue-green algae, and floating seaweed. HABITAT: The leatherback is the most pelagic of the sea turtles. Adult females require sandy nesting beaches backed with vegetation and sloped sufficiently so the distance to dry sand is limited. Their preferred beaches have proximity to deep water and generally rough seas. CRITICAL HABITAT: 50 CFR 17. 95 U. S.

40|$|The {{bathymetry}} of long-stretched tidal basins {{consists of}} different kinds of undulations in the seabed (dunes, shoals, et cetera) and a system of meandering and braiding channels. Knowledge about the behaviour of these channel-shoal systems is relevant, both for estuarine management and scientific purposes. Various studies indicate that the interaction between the local bathymetry and the flow leads to residual flow circulations, which {{play a role in the}} development of channels and shoals in a tidal basin. A particular form of residual flow circulation is secondary flow induced by curvature of the flow. A curvature of the flow originates for example when water flows through a bend or around a shoal. This secondary flow is a three-dimensional, transversal flow circulation. The main objective of this study is to identify the feedback mechanisms in channel-shoal formation in long-stretched tidal basins. Use is made of the process-based Delft 3 D modelling system. A tidal basin with a rectangular geometry is modelled, with a semi-diurnal <b>tide</b> as <b>boundary</b> condition at the seaward side. The model simulates two states of the development of channels and shoals in a tidal basin. The first state is an initial state, where the basin consists of channels and shoals that form relatively small, sinusoidal undulations in the seabed. The other state is a state where the basin consists of channels and shoals that are more developed and form relatively large, sinusoidal undulations in the seabed. The main conclusion of this study is that although secondary flow is present in the investigated basins, its magnitude is very small and its effect on residual transports in transversal direction too. The presence of secondary flow in transversal direction and its magnitude is an indication of the three-dimensional character of the flow and therewith an indication of the necessity of carrying out three-dimensional calculations. In future research to the initial development of the morphology of tidal basins with a rectangular geometry with corresponding characteristics as in this research, use can be made of modelling systems making two-dimensional calculations.

The three-dimensional hydrodynamical model ROMS-COAWST was implemented for simulation of the complex hydrodynamics of SBNS and sediment transport. The first level of nesting with the resolution of 1 km was used in the area of Belgian Economical Zone. In order to reach a fine resolution of 250 m in the BCZ, the second level of nesting will be used. Six-hourly ECMWF ERA-interim meteorological data was used to force the model at the sea-air boundary and the coarse resolution model results available from Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service were used to force the model at the open <b>boundaries.</b> <b>Tides</b> and rivers were also considered.

40|$|Mangroves and saltmarshes are ecologically {{important}} coastal ecosystems; unfortunately, these low-lying coastal {{ecosystems are}} vulnerable to global climate change. As sea-levels rise, mangroves are expected to shift their distribution landward towards higher elevation sites that are occupied by other plants, including saltmarsh taxa. Therefore, mangrove recruits {{at the leading edge}} of expansion may interact with diverse assemblages of saltmarsh plants, and these interactions could influence the success of mangrove encroachment into higher tidal-elevation areas. The purpose of the research presented here was to investigate empirically the ecological interactions that may influence the recruitment of the black mangrove, Avicennia germinans, into saltmarsh habitats. Saltmarsh plants frequently occurred at the landward boundary of mangrove forests at two sites selected for field studies along the west coast of Florida: Cannon Island and Upper Tampa Bay Park. On Cannon Island, two different field tests investigated mangrove propagule entrapment and dispersal within saltmarsh vegetation. In the first experiment, the entrapment of mangrove propagules within saltmarsh plants, exhibiting different growth forms, was examined during seasonal high tide events. Natural polyculture plots retained a mean (±;SE) 59. 3 % (±; 11. 0) of emplaced propagules. Monocultures varied in their propagule retention capacities with plots of S. virginicus retaining on average 65. 7 % (±; 11. 5) of transplanted propagules compared to 7. 2 % (±; 1. 8) by B. maritima and 5. 0 % (±; 1. 9) by S. portulacastrum. Monocultures of the salt marsh grass, Sporobolus virginicus, and natural saltmarsh polycultures containing S. virginicus retained significantly more propagules than either of two succulent plants (i. e., Batis maritima and Sesuvium portulacastrum). Using digital images, saltmarsh plant structure was quantified; the number of entrapped mangrove propagules displayed a significant and positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 6253, p = 0. 00001) with the amount of structure provided by saltmarsh plants. Therefore, the first field study identified structural and functional differences between saltmarsh plants. A second field study employed marked propagules in order to further examine the dispersal patterns of propagules at saltmarsh boundaries comprised of plants with different growth forms (i. e., grass vs. succulent) during seasonal high <b>tides.</b> Saltmarsh plant <b>boundaries</b> erected by taxa with distinct growth forms differentially influenced the proportion of propagules that dispersed seaward and the distance propagules moved seaward. In fact, nearly twice as many propagules dispersed seaward at boundaries erected by succulent plants compared to boundaries composed of grass. The results of this field study support my previous findings that propagule dispersal is comparatively lower in saltmarsh grass than in succulent saltmarsh plants. The findings from these two field studies suggest that the permeability of boundaries formed by saltmarsh plants may modulate landward dispersal of A. germinans propagules. The final field study was conducted at Upper Tampa Bay Park, where a second species of saltmarsh grass, Monanthochloe littoralis, co-occurred with the grass, S. virginicus, and succulent saltmarsh plants to form a mosaic landscape of saltmarsh plant patches. Patches were weeded to create 3 saltmarsh treatments: 1) M. littoralis monoculture; 2) S. virginicus monoculture; and 3) polycultures containing both grasses and at least one other saltmarsh taxa. Propagules of A. germinans were emplaced into saltmarsh patches and followed for 11 weeks. On the last sampling date, the greatest number of A. germinans (n = 51) had successfully established as seedlings within the M. littoralis monoculture plots. In contrast, only 20 (22 % of the propagules initially emplaced) A. germinans seedlings established in S. virginicus monoculture plots. These findings suggest that among grass taxa, species identity influences mangrove establishment success, which builds upon our previous findings that demonstrated that saltmarsh growth form (i. e., grass vs. succulent) influenced mangrove propagule dispersal. Combined the findings from these field studies indicate that interactions among the early life history stages of black mangroves and neighboring plants influence mangrove recruitment. Specifically, these field studies provide empirical evidence that the species composition of saltmarsh plants influences mangrove propagule dispersal and seedling establishment. The work presented here has implications for understanding the suite of ecological interactions that may influence mangrove encroachment into saltmarsh habitats at higher tidal elevations as sea-levels rise...|$|R
