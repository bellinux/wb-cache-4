40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} a simple two-stage supply chain {{with a single}} retailer facing i. i. d. demand and a single manufacturer with finite production capacity. We analyze the value of information sharing between the retailer and <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> over a finite time horizon. In our model, <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> receives demand information from the retailer even during time periods in which the retailer does not order. To analyze the impact of information sharing, we consider the following three strategies: (1) the retailer does not share demand information with the manufacturer; (2) the retailer does share demand information with <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> uses <b>the</b> optimal policy to schedule production; (3) the retailer shares demand information with <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> uses a greedy policy to schedule production. These strategies allow us to study the impact of information sharing on <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> {{as a function of}} the production capacity, and the frequency and timing in whic...|$|R

5|$|It was {{revealed}} in December 2005 that Bayh had raised $1.2 {{million in the}} first two quarters of 2005, more than any other potential candidate with the exception of Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. But the cash did not translate into high marks among possible voters as a CNN poll conducted December 9–11 found that Bayh had the support of only 1% of self-identified Democrats, placing him seventh among possible candidates. Later in the month, Bayh was criticized by the video game industry for political posturing in his quest along with Senator Hillary Clinton to crack down on explicit content in video games. <b>The</b> <b>manufacturers</b> claimed that the movements were simply attempts to increase his appeal to values voters for his presidential run.|$|E
5|$|Maeser's primary {{responsibility}} was {{to head the}} Utah exhibit at the Mid-winter Fair in San Francisco in 1894, while he was serving as Superintendent of Church Schools. The exposition was patterned after Chicago World's Fair of 1893. At the Chicago exhibit, the church had displayed minerals and produce from Utah. In the San Francisco exhibit, Maeser chose {{to focus more on}} beliefs of the church and educational accomplishments of students in the church school systems. The church had an exhibit in <b>the</b> <b>Manufacturers</b> and Liberal Arts Building, and Maeser gave a series of lectures to bring more publicity to the church school exhibit. Utah's participation in the exhibit attempted to gain favor for its becoming a state. He and his companions helped distribute information about the history of Utah. No one was baptized into the church while Maeser was president of the mission; however, he did help create friendlier public-relations between Utah and California.|$|E

5|$|The {{new group}} of drugs was {{initially}} greeted with optimism by the medical profession, but gradually concerns arose; in particular, the risk of dependence became evident in the 1980s. Benzodiazepines have a unique history in that they {{were responsible for the}} largest-ever class-action lawsuit against drug manufacturers in the United Kingdom, involving 14,000 patients and 1,800 law firms that alleged <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers</b> knew of the dependence potential but intentionally withheld this information from doctors. At the same time, 117 general practitioners and 50 health authorities were sued by patients to recover damages for the harmful effects of dependence and withdrawal. This led some doctors to require a signed consent form from their patients and to recommend that all patients be adequately warned of the risks of dependence and withdrawal before starting treatment with benzodiazepines. The court case against the drug manufacturers never reached a verdict; legal aid had been withdrawn and there were allegations that the consultant psychiatrists, the expert witnesses, had a conflict of interest. This litigation led to changes in the British law, making class action lawsuits more difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861 between {{the northern and southern}} states also contributed to the trend. The war disrupted the sale of northern ice to the south, and Maine merchants instead turned to supplying the Union Army, whose forces used ice in their more southern campaigns. James L. Cheeseman had responded to the 1860 ice famine by moving his ice trading business from the Hudson northwards into Maine, bringing with him the latest technology and techniques; Cheeseman went on to win valuable contracts with the Union Army during the war years. Carré ice machines were brought into New Orleans to make up the shortfall in the south, focusing in particular on supplying southern hospitals. In the post-war years, the number of such plants increased, but once competition from the north recommenced, cheaper natural ice initially made it hard for <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers</b> to make a profit. By the late 1870s, however, efficiency improvements were allowing them to squeeze natural ice out of the marketplace in the south.|$|E
5|$|The works {{was shut}} down on 25 June 2007, after the Don burst its banks, and the entire site was engulfed by several feet of water. It {{remained}} submerged for over a week, {{with much of the}} equipment suffering catastrophic damage. Once the water subsided, imaginative ways had to be found to return it to operation within a reasonable time. The analyser which measures emissions from the incinerator plant had been completely destroyed, and in order to mitigate a 16-week delivery time, <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers</b> removed one from a training centre at Telford, and it was hired by Yorkshire Water until a new unit could be supplied. The plant was recommissioned and operational just 18 days after its inundation.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} taxes paid by both <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and <b>the</b> {{retailer}} {{to the government}} are 10% of the values added by their respective business practices (e.g. the value added by <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> is $1.20 minus $1.00, thus the tax payable by <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> is ($1.20 – $1.00) × 10% = $0.02).|$|R
40|$|In {{the extant}} supply-risk {{management}} literature, most research assumes <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> is as knowledgeable about supply disruption risk as its suppliers. In practice, however, a supplier often has better information about its likelihood of experiencing a disruption than <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> it serves. This dissertation studies <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer's</b> supply risk management under asymmetric information about supply disruption risk. In the first essay, we consider {{a supply chain}} with one manufacturer and one unreliable supplier, who has private information about its probability of a disruption. In case of a disruption, the supplier runs backup production or pays penalty for non-delivery. We find information asymmetry about supply risk discourages <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> from invoking <b>the</b> supplier's backup production option. However, asymmetric information could make backup production more valuable. Under asymmetric information, backup production could become more valuable, even as the probability of drawing a high-reliability supplier increases. Finally, higher reliability {{need not be a}} substitute for information. In the second essay, we study <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer's</b> supply-risk management when it has a dual-sourcing option, that is, there are two unreliable suppliers in the supply base for the same part. We find information asymmetry pushes <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> away from diversification (ordering from both suppliers) toward sole-sourcing to leverage supplier competition. Asymmetric information may cause <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> to stop diversifying, even as the supply-base reliability worsens. Hence, information becomes more valuable when changes in the underlying business condition encourage diversification, such as an increase in <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer's</b> cost of disruption and a decrease in the codependence between the suppliers' disruptions. Lastly, asymmetric information may make a dual-sourcing option more or less valuable. In the third essay, <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> delegates procurement of a part to one of its two unreliable suppliers, who then collaborate to fulfill <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer's</b> requirement. <b>The</b> preliminary results show that, compared to direct contracting, under delegation <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> may induce more or less diversification, depending on the suppliers' reliability types. Delegation may decrease or increase <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer's</b> profit. These effects of delegation would not be observed under symmetric information...|$|R

5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. The chemical was used to kill roughly one million people in gas chambers installed in extermination camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and elsewhere. Most {{of the victims were}} Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz. Zyklon B was supplied to concentration camps at Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald by the distributor Heli, and to Auschwitz and Majdanek by Testa. Camps also occasionally bought Zyklon B directly from <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers.</b> Of the 729 metric tons of Zyklon B sold in Germany in 1942–44, 56 metric tons (about 8 per cent of domestic sales) were sold to concentration camps. Auschwitz received 23.8 tons, of which 6 tons were used for fumigation. The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to spoilage (the product had a stated shelf life of only three months). Testa conducted fumigations for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for fumigation purposes. In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized applier of the chemical, and thus they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, a {{decentralized}} {{supply chain}} involving a supplier, a manufacturer and a wholesaler under two-scenario is considered. Here, we assume that, {{as the first}} scenario, a return contract is concluded between the outside supplier and the supplier and also between <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and <b>the</b> wholesaler. In this chain, under the first scenario, the supplier receives the raw material and after inspecting them, send back the defective ones where those are purchased and the outside supplier purchase the defective raw material at a lower price. Then the supplier ships the healthy raw material to <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> transmutes them to the finished product to satisfy the wholesaler’s demand. In this stage of chain, <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> employs a return policy to incentive the wholesaler’s orders where <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> ships <b>the</b> products to the wholesaler and the wholesaler after receiving and inspecting items, returns the defective items to <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and fulfill <b>the</b> market demand with the health ones. Then <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> purchases returned items at a lower price. In the second scenario, the return policy between <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and its wholesaler is not applied to examine the difference of the chain profit under both scenarios. Besides, backordering shortage is permitted and demand is price-sensitive.|$|R
