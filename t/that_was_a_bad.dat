2500|$|I don't {{think that}} the gossipy or {{official}} versions of what happened are right, but I feel definitely that if I {{were back in the}} situation again as the person I am now, it wouldn't have happened. [...] Which means it's basically my fault. [...] I had a kind of insecurity and self-importance, which I didn't see for a long time, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> dynamic in the community.|$|E
2500|$|With Aukerman away at college, the Descendents added Ray Cooper as both {{singer and}} second guitarist. They {{performed}} with this lineup, and occasionally as a quintet when Aukerman would make return visits to Los Angeles. Stevenson {{pushed for the}} band to tour, which Navetta and Lombardo were against: [...] "Bill kind of sat down with me and Frank and {{said something to the}} effect of we were at a point where we needed to grow by going on the road", Lombardo later said. [...] "Frank said no, and I had to say no also, so he said he had to leave the band and we were both kind of bummed out. I don’t think Frank even believed him at first. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> scenario." [...] Navetta, Lombardo, and Cooper tried to start a new band, the Ascendants. [...] "We played one show", said Lombardo. [...] "Frank played in his underwear, and I don’t mean boxers. It was all a disaster, it was sad, for me anyway." [...] Navetta ultimately quit the band by setting all of his musical equipment on fire and moving to Oregon, where he became a full-time fisherman.|$|E

2500|$|Spurrier {{spoke about}} his NFL {{coaching}} experience during SEC Media Days in 2014. [...] "When I left Florida after 12 years, I thought I {{was going to}} coach in the NFL {{five or six years}} and retire to the beach, and play golf a bunch, and travel around, this, that and the other. But <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> plan. It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's the way I was thinking back then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok. I probably didn’t do a very good job, and the situation wasn’t what I was looking for, so {{it was time to move}} on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jacob Grimm {{reported}} the superstition [...] "if, while riding a horse overland, {{a man should}} come upon a woman spinning, then <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very <b>bad</b> sign; he should turn around and take another way." [...] (Deutsche Mythologie 1835, v3.135) ...|$|R
50|$|Franco, for his way, {{has shown}} a little {{disappointment}} with Paulo Henrique Ganso, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> playing <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> football for club, and believes <b>that</b> his dismissed <b>was</b> caused because of the elimination of São Paulo in Libertadores, against Atlético Mineiro, another Brazilian side.|$|R

The shock threw the poor little wife, who had always been rather delicate, into bad health, rendering a warm climate necessary for her {{at a time when}} they could not afford to travel.

6000|$|... {33} Pausanias, iii. 15. When {{the boys}} were being cruelly scourged, the priestess of Artemis Orthia held an ancient barbaric wooden image of the goddess in her hands. If {{the boys were}} spared, the image grew heavy; the more they were tortured, the lighter grew the image. In Samoa the image (shark's teeth) of the god Taema is {{consulted}} before battle. 'If it felt heavy, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> omen; if light, the sign was good'--the god was pleased (Turner's Samoa, p. 55).|$|E

6000|$|There was a {{mounting}} {{sensation of}} prophetic certainty. Old fox Wehying appeared nervous. He wasted two balls on Red; {{then he put}} one over the plate, and then he wasted another. Three balls and one strike! <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> place for a pitcher, and with Red Gilbat up it was worse. Wehying swung longer and harder to get all his left behind the throw and let drive. Red lunged and cracked the ball. It went up and up and kept going up and farther out, and as the murmuring audience was slowly transfixed into late realization the ball soared to its height and dropped beyond the left-field fence. A home run! ...|$|E
50|$|In 1860 Satank <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{frequent}} visitor at the Peacock Ranch near present-day Great Bend, Kansas. Satank asked Mr. George Peacock {{to write}} a letter of introduction (begging paper) saying <b>that</b> Satank <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good Indian. Peacock took advantage of Satank's illiteracy, and instead wrote <b>that</b> Satank <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> Indian. When the Chief learned about the trick from Buffalo Bill Mathewson, Satank's tribe killed Peacock and several other people at Peacock Ranch.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of the show Sock and Josie have just broken their {{relationship}} off but they get back together in the 14th episode and break off again in the final episode, with Josie saying <b>that</b> Sock <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> boyfriend. In the last episode of the first season Sock kissed the succubus Marlena multiple times, losing one year from his life for each kiss (he estimates he has three years left).|$|R
25|$|Hungerford {{began to}} sense <b>that</b> Patterson <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> businessman. <b>As</b> a result, {{he sold his}} {{ownership}} interest in the bank to Patterson on December 16, 1858. However, {{it was not until}} January 21, 1859, when the New York Legislature passed an Act, actually authorizing Hungerford to transfer his interest in the bank to Patterson; both would be jointly and severally liable for all bank debts incurred prior to the date of passage.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> business," [...] Captain Martin agreed; [...] "a {{very bad}} business, comrade. And {{although}} {{these things were}} done by a mere handful of the scum of the town the respectable citizens raised no hand to stop it, although they can turn out the town guard readily enough {{to put a stop}} to a quarrel between the members of two of the guilds. There were plenty of men who have banded themselves together under the name of 'the beggars,' and swore to fight for their religion, to have put these fellows down if they had chosen. They did not choose, and now Philip's vengeance will fall on them all alike." ...|$|E

"Once upon a time, long, long ago, {{when the}} world was young, lived old Mr. Snake, the {{grandfather}} a thousand times removed of little Mr. Greensnake {{and all the other}} Snakes whom you know. Of course he wasn't old then. He was young and spry and smart, was Mr. Snake. Now {{there is such a thing}} as being too smart. That was the trouble with Mr. Snake. Yes, Sir, that was the trouble with Mr. Snake. He was so smart that he soon found out that he was the smartest of all the meadow and forest people, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> thing. It certainly was a very bad thing."

6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> night, {{and the day}} was worse. Bertha {{had more}} strength, but more fever; and the much-enduring Phoebe could hardly be persuaded to leave her to Miss Charlecote at dusk, and air herself with her {{brothers}} in the garden. The weather was close and misty, and Honora set {{open the door to}} admit the air from the open passage window. A low, soft, lulling sound came in, so much softened by distance that the tune alone showed that it was an infant school ditty sung by Maria, while rocking herself in her low chair over the school-room fire. Turning to discover whether the invalid were annoyed by it, Honor beheld the hard, keen little eyes intently fixed, until presently they filled with tears; and with a heavy sigh, the words broke forth, 'Oh! to be as silly as she is!' ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Bad</b> Dog <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Canadian {{animated}} series {{produced by}} Saban Entertainment and CinéGroupe for the Teletoon and Fox Family Channel networks, first airing on Teletoon on March 1, 1999. The cartoon {{focused on the}} Potanski family and their dog Berkeley. The show's gimmick <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> whenever Berkeley <b>was</b> told <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> dog, he would freeze and pretend to be dead until someone told him he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> good dog. This would happen in every episode.|$|R
40|$|Conference on Financing Global AgingThe {{question}} assigned <b>is</b> whether <b>an</b> {{aging population}} should be financed by governments or markets? The broad answer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we need both government provided benefits and supplementary private pensions. Each has its place. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> not the debate. The debate centers {{on whether to}} cut back on the existing Social Security program and to replace it with private accounts. I think <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> idea because it shifts the nature of basic retirement income from a defined benefit to a defined contribution plan, which puts people’s basic retirement income at risk. Moreover, “privatizing ” will not, in and of itself, improve the financing of the system or raise the return on Social Security contributions. Improving the system’s finances and diversifying investments for <b>a</b> higher return <b>are</b> laudable goals, but they can be accomplished within the existing structure. I. Private Accounts on Their Own Do Not Help Financing Proponents of privatization rarely articulate how shifting responsibilities from the government to the private sector will contribute to Social Security finances.

40|$|This play Cow Going Abstract came onto my radar exactly 98 days {{too late}} to help me in my time of need!

6000|$|... "No, indeed. I'm not yet {{quite ready}} to spring my trap," [...] she replied. [...] "When the time comes, I must have assistance, but I want to get all my {{evidence}} shipshape before I call on the Secret Service to make the capture. I can't afford to bungle so important a thing, you know, and this ten dollar bill, so carelessly given the storekeeper, {{is going to put}} one powerful bit of evidence in my hands. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> slip on old Cragg's part, for he has been very cautious in covering his tracks, until now. But I surmise that Mary Louise's pleading for Ingua, this morning, touched his pride, and having no real money at hand he ventured to give the storekeeper a counterfeit. And old Sol, having been caught by a counterfeit once before--I wonder if Old Swallowtail gave him that one, too?--became suspicious of the newness of the bill and so played directly into our hands. So now, if you'll excuse me, I'll run to town without further delay. I won't rest easy until that bill is in my possession." ...|$|E
6000|$|I think I {{ought to}} be allowed to talk as long as I want to, for the reason that I have {{cancelled}} all my winter's engagements of every kind, for good and sufficient reasons, and am making no new engagements for this winter, and, therefore, this is the only chance I shall have to disembowel my skull for a year--close the mouth in that portrait for a year. I want to offer thanks and homage to the chairman for this innovation which he has introduced here, which is an improvement, as I consider it, on the old-fashioned style of conducting occasions like this. That was bad <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad,</b> bad, bad arrangement. Under that old custom the chairman got up and made a speech, he introduced the prisoner at the bar, and covered him all over with compliments, nothing but compliments, not a thing but compliments, never a slur, and sat down and left that man to get up and talk without a text. You cannot talk on compliments; that is not a text. No modest person, and I was born one, can talk on compliments. A man gets up and is filled to the eyes with happy emotions, but his tongue is tied; he has nothing to say; he is in the condition of Doctor Rice's friend who came home drunk and explained it to his wife, and his wife said to him, [...] "John, when you have drunk all the whiskey you want, you ought to ask for sarsaparilla." [...] He said, [...] "Yes, but when I have drunk all the whiskey I want I can't say sarsaparilla." [...] And so I think it is much better to leave a man unmolested until the testimony and pleadings are all in. Otherwise he is dumb--he is at the sarsaparilla stage.|$|E
