5|$|Fame was {{the last}} musical film to be {{produced}} by MGM, before the studio merged with United Artists in 1981. The film has been credited with revitalizing the teen musical subgenre by adding dramatic elements into its story, echoing 1950s melodramas. Its presentation of musical numbers in <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> music video—through the use of quick cuts with multiple angles and crowded, kinetic frames—was {{a major influence on}} other 1980s films in the dance film genre, such as Flashdance (1983), Footloose (1984) and Dirty Dancing (1987). It also inspired the creation of many similar performing arts schools around the world—notably the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA)— and popularized the use of leg warmers.|$|E

There is also a memorial to the KMT soldiers who died in their fight against communism, The Martyrs' Memorial, a museum whose wooden panels bear the names of the dead, set on an altar in the main building.

The museum also features exhibits describing the struggles of the KMT soldiers and the development of the Doi Mae Salong valley.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{stated that}} {{the energy of the}} group was fast-paced, replicating <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> music video, which {{children}} seem to enjoy. The educational theories incorporated were disguised with music and entertainment, with the band's work being designed to have multiple layers and cater {{for a wide range of}} ages in the audience, while being primarily aimed at those aged 2–8. Harris explained that Hi-5 was primarily a television series, but the music itself had the ability to stand alone. She expected that the series would initially become formatted into international versions, however was so confident with the original cast that the Australian series was sold overseas instead.|$|E
5|$|In response, English Heritage and Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council {{formed a}} {{three-way}} agreement in 1988 with the Ivanhoe Trust, a local charity designed to generate new {{employment in the}} region. Under this agreement the trust would manage the site, English Heritage would maintain the historic fabric of the castle, while the council would construct a new visitors' centre. A new, controversial visitor's centre was built in <b>the</b> <b>style</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> collection of jousting tents, while the floors and roof of the keep were reinstalled between 1993 and 1995 with European Union funding, {{in an attempt to}} limit the erosion of the castle stonework.|$|E
