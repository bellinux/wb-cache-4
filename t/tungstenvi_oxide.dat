50|$|Ammonium {{paratungstate}} {{is produced}} by separating tungsten from its ore. Once the ammonium paratungstate is prepared, it is heated to its decomposition temperature, 600 °C. Left over is WO3, <b>tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide.</b> From there, the oxide is heated {{in an atmosphere of}} hydrogen, reducing the tungsten to elemental powder, leaving behind water vapor. From there, the tungsten powder can be fused into any number of things, from wire to bars to other shapes.|$|E
50|$|Tungsten is {{extracted}} from its ores in several stages. The ore is eventually converted to <b>tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide</b> (WO3), which is heated with hydrogen or carbon to produce powdered tungsten. Because of tungsten's high melting point, {{it is not}} commercially feasible to cast tungsten ingots. Instead, powdered tungsten is mixed with small amounts of powdered nickel or other metals, and sintered. During the sintering process, the nickel diffuses into the tungsten, producing an alloy.|$|E
50|$|Tungsten {{bonds to}} the glass via the {{intermediate}} layer of <b>tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide.</b> A properly formed bond has characteristic coppery/orange/brown-yellow color in lithium-free glasses; in lithium-containing glasses the bond is blue due to formation of lithium tungstate. Due to its low thermal expansion coefficient, matched to glass, tungsten is frequently used for glass-metal bonds. Tungsten forms satisfying bonds with glasses with similar thermal expansion coefficient such as high-borosilicate glass. The surface of both the metal and glass should be smooth, without scratches. Tungsten has the lowest expansion coefficient of metals and the highest melting point.|$|E
40|$|New {{results are}} {{presented}} concerning the topotactic self-assembly, n-type doping and band-gap engineering of an intrazeolite <b>tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide</b> supralattice n(W 03) -Na 56 Y, where 0 < η < 32, built-up of single size and shape (W 03) 2 dimers. In particular {{it has been found}} that the oxygen content of these dimers can be quantitatively adjusted by means of a thermal vacuum induced reversible reductive-elimination oxidative-addition of dioxygen. This provides access to new n(W 03. x) -Na 56 Y materials (0 < χ ^ 1. 0) in which the oxygen content, structural properties and electronic architecture of the dimers are changed. In this way one can precisely control the oxidation state, degree of η-doping and band-filling of a <b>tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide</b> supralattice through an approach which can be considered akin to, but distinct in detail to, that found in the Magneli crystallographic shear phases of non-stoichiometric bulk W 03. x. Another discovery concerns the ability to alter local electrostatic fields experienced by the <b>tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide</b> moieties housed in the 13 Ä supercages of 16 (W 03) -M 36 Y, by varying the ionic potential of the constituent supercage M + cations across the alkali metal series. This method provides the first opportunity to fine-tune the band-gap of a <b>tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide</b> supralattice. Α miniband electronic description is advanced as a qualitative first attempt to understand the origin of the above effects. The implications of these discoveries are that cluster size, composition and intrinsic electrostatic field effects can be used to "chemically manipulate" (engineer) the doping and band architecture of intrazeolite supralattices of possible interest in quantum electronics and nonlinear optics. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{fossil fuels}} become {{increasingly}} depleted, {{the development of}} clean energy sources increasingly becomes more important. Both titanium(IV) oxide and <b>tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide</b> nanowires {{have been shown to}} harness the electromagnetic waves given off by the sun to turn water into hydrogen and oxygen gas; using the UV and visible spectrum, respectively. Investing in this principle, we have designed a novel device that converts carbon dioxide and water vapor into methane in a cost effective manner. The device uses a composite of the two complementary nanowires in order to obtain broader solar absorption. This was done by first synthesizing the needed self-assembling TiO 2 and WO 3 nanowires. A thin layer of the nanowires was then applied to silk worm silk; a substrate that gases can pass through. Finally, photoelectric tests were run to determine the efficiency of the device...|$|E

These heterostructures possess a mesoscopic order of discernible domains of parallel-arranged uniform nanorods and exhibit relatively large internal surface area and quite narrow pore size distribution. The chemical composition and mesoporous structure of as-prepared materials were characterized by using various techniques like X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) and Raman spectroscopy and nitrogen porosimetry. The integration of regular porosity and WO 3 –V 2 O 5 composition makes these materials highly promising for applications in oxidation catalysis. Our {{results indicated that the}} inclusion of V 2 O 5 compounds in mesoporous structure has a beneficial effect on the catalytic activity of these materials. Although WO 3 alone show little catalytic activity, the WO 3 –V 2 O 5 heterostructures exhibit high activity in hydrogen peroxide mediated oxidation of 1 -phenylethanol under mild conditions. Indeed, the oxidation activity of WO 3 –V 2 O 5 composites is strongly related to the chemical composition of composite structure, with particular relevance of the V 2 O 3 content. Furthermore, the mesoporous WO 3 –V 2 O 5 catalysts demonstrated remarkable activity and stability for the oxidation of selected para–substituted benzyl alcohols, giving good-to-high yields (ca. 63 – 82 %) within a short reaction time (0. 5 – 1 h) ...|$|E

Thermal {{treatment of}} oxobis(2, 4 -pentanedionato-O,O′) titanium (TiO(acac) 2) in ethylene glycol (EG) {{in the presence}} of sodium acetate and a small amount of water at 573 K yielded microcrystalline brookite-type TiO 2. <b>Tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide</b> (WO 3) powders of monoclinic crystal structure with high crystallinity were synthesized by hydrothermal treatment (HTT), at 523 or 573 K, of aqueous tungstic acid (H 2 WO 4) solutions prepared from sodium tungstate by ion-exchange (IE) with a proton-type resin. Anatase and brookite TiO 2 products were calcined at various temperatures and then used for photocatalytic mineralization of acetic acid in aqueous solutions under aerated conditions and dehydrogenation of 2 -propanol under deaerated conditions. Almost all the anatase-type TiO 2 samples showed the activities more than twice higher than those of representative active photocatalysts, Degussa P- 25 and Ishihara ST- 01 in both reactions. A brookite sample with improved crystallinity and sufficient surface area obtained by calcination at 973 K exhibited the hydrogen evolution rate almost equal to P- 25. HTT WO 3 powders with various physical properties were used as photocatalyst for evolution of oxygen (O 2) from an aqueous silver sulfate solution.

40|$|Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4) has {{attracted}} much attention as a metal-free semiconductor having visible light absorption and relatively high chemical stability. g-C 3 N 4 can reduce CO 2 to organic fuels such as methanol (CH 3 OH), formic acid (HCO 2 H), and methane (CH 4) under visible light irradiation. However, oxidation potential of g-C 3 N 4 {{is not enough for}} water oxidation. Therefore, we focused on hybridization of g-C 3 N 4 and <b>tungsten(VI)</b> <b>oxide</b> (WO 3) which has high oxidation potential for water oxidation. In this study, we examined CO 2 reduction by composite photocatalyst of g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3, which was prepared by three methods (mixture using an agate mortar, impregnation and planetary mill). As a result, composite photocatalyst prepared with planetary mill showed the highest photocatalytic activity. Photodeposition of silver or gold nanoparticles only on g-C 3 N 4 of the hybrid photocatalyst induced an increase in CH 3 OH because the loaded metal nanoparticles {{play an important role in}} multi-electron reduction of CO 2. Photocatalytic activity of the Au-loaded hybrid photocatalyst composed of g-C 3 N 4 and WO 3 was 1. 7 -times higher than that of the hybrid photocatalyst without Au loading. In addition, we investigated photocatalytic reaction mechanism of composite photocatalyst by double-beam photoacoustic spectroscopy. This result revealed Z-scheme reaction proceeds in the composite photocatalyst to maintain high oxidation ability of WO 3 and high reduction ability of g-C 3 N 4, resulting in high photocatalytic activity...|$|E
