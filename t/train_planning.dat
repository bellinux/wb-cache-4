50|$|The first {{element of}} {{controlling}} train lengths was {{to place a}} cap on train size. To avoid train meets where both trains were overlength for a siding’s capacity, an instruction was issued to the Thunder Bay yardmasters to ensure that eastward trains leaving their terminal for the Nipigon Subdivision did not exceed a length of 6200 feet. This capping {{of the length of}} eastward trains also tacitly acknowledged that westward trains would have no length restrictions. When first implemented, this length target was difficult to meet as there was no process in place to deliver an accurate train length measurement. Thus sometimes there were surprises when, on a planned meet, a train did not fit into a siding. In such instances, the excess length would have to be moved into the siding’s back track, if possible, until the opposing train had passed. Under such a scenario, delays could be incurred by both trains. Canadian Pacific Railway took train length determination a step further and implemented on the Division a basic process to capture actual train lengths and pass this information along to the train dispatcher to assist in <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> while limiting train delays.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of Loughborough University for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy. <b>Train</b> <b>Planning</b> (also known as railway scheduling) {{is an area of}} substantial importance to the success of any railway. Through <b>train</b> <b>planning,</b> railway managers aim {{to meet the needs of}} customers whilst using as low a level of resources (infrastructure, rolling stock and staff) as possible. Efficient and effective <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> is essential to get the best possible performance out of a railway network. The author of this thesis aims, firstly, to analyse the processes which are used to develop train plans and the extent to which they meet the objectives that they might be expected to meet and, secondly, to investigate selected new and innovative software approaches that might make a material difference to the effectiveness and/or efficiency of <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> processes. These aims are delivered using a range of primarily qualitative research methods, including literature reviews, interviews, participant observation and case studies, to understand these processes and software. Conclusions regarding <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> processes include how the complexity of these processes hinders their effectiveness, the negative impact of the privatisation of British Rail on these processes and the conflicting nature of objectives for <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> in the privatised railway. <b>Train</b> <b>planning</b> software is found not to adequately support train planners in meeting the objectives they are set.

40|$|Abstract- In <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> and timetabling, {{the trip}} time on each link {{is assumed to}} depend on the type of train and {{characteristics}} of the link, but is usually treated as independent of the time interval (headway) between trains. However, in practice trains are subject to delays from a variety of causes, and since normally they are not allowed to pass each other on a link, any delay to one train may cause “knock-on ” delays to following trains. This is especially true of the high density double and multiple track railways in Britain and Europe. The shorter the scheduled headway between trains, the greater is the expected knock-on delay and hence the greater the expected trip times of following trains. We develop simple stochastic approximations to these knock-on train delays. To test and calibrate the approximations, we conduct detailed stochastic simulation of the interaction between trains as they traverse sections of the link. The approximate relationships that we derive between scheduled headways and knock-on delays can be used, for example, (a) to provide correction factors for other stochastic or deterministic models of <b>train</b> <b>planning,</b> dispatch-ing, or control; (b) to adjust train timetables, which are currently produced without explicitly considering the expected knock-on effects, and (c) to make it feasible to conduct larger scale simulations of train networks, by reducing or removing the need to simulate behaviour within each link. 1...|$|E

This is primarily done by connecting together schedules at their terminal locations (known as schedule associations). Platforming allocation is the process of assigning those associations to particular platforms. A simple last-in, first-legal-out algorithm is used for rolling stock allocation that performs comparably to the traditional manual approach but only takes a few seconds as opposed to days or weeks in many manual cases. A simple stochastic hill-climbing approach is used for assigning associations to platforms to provide a conflict-free platform allocation within a few seconds. These two approaches are tested on real <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> problems with excellent results that would allow an expert to rapidly produce optimal or near optimal solutions. The time saving using these approaches can be used by the train planner to try out various options or have greater checking of robustness of the solutions created...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, Europe was {{dominated}} by state-owned, vertically integrated railroads. Lately, European Union (EU) policies and relevant legislation have introduced the legal separation between railroad operations and infrastructure management. Thus, the railroad infrastructure management companies have started applying charges (termed access pricing) to railroad companies for using infrastructure. Although European policies and legislation set the basic access pricing principles, they did not provide specific rules or methods for deriving infrastructure charging systems. An access pricing system for suburban (commuter) rail services was developed. An overview of practices in EU member states and the United States is presented. The basic principles and economic characteristics of infrastructure charging are outlined. The proposed structure of the infrastructure charging system is discussed, with {{a distinction between the}} basic charge - which includes costs for <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> and line operations, infrastructure damage and wear and tear costs, and quality of services - and additional components. Each component is mathematically expressed. The proposed charging system does not include costs related to train operations. To test the robustness of the proposed system, it is applied to the suburban rail services provided by the Greek company AMEL, with trains running on the Greek railroads' infrastructure. The proposed infrastructure charging system can be applied to any railroad by changing the variable values...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> or scheduling for large, busy, complex train stations, which are common in Europe and elsewhere, though not in North America. We develop the constraints and objectives for this problem, but these are too computationally complex to solve by standard combinatorial search or integer programming methods. Also, the problem is somewhat political in nature, that is, {{it does not have}} a clear objective function because it involves multiple train operators with conflicting interests. We therefore develop scheduling heuristics analogous to those successfully adopted by train planners using "manual" methods. We tested the model and algorithms by applying to a typical large station that exhibits most of the complexities found in practice. The results compare well with those found by traditional methods, and take account of cost and preference trade-offs not handled by those methods. With successive refinements, the algorithm eventually took only a few seconds to run, the time depending on the version of the algorithm and the scheduling problem. The scheduling models and algorithms developed and tested here can be used on their own, or as key components for a more general system for train scheduling for a rail line or network.

40|$|After a brief {{outline of}} freight rail {{operations}} planning, the paper reviews {{the research and}} development of optimization and simulation tools to undertake <b>train</b> <b>planning,</b> train and locomotive scheduling, as well as track maintenance planning. Although optimum solutions can be obtained using such tools, they have not been widely embraced by rail organizations. The simplifying assumptions made by most models make their practical application difficult to achieve. Whilst drawing on overseas research, the paper focuses mainly on the Australian experience for operations planning practice. Freight rail market share increases are closely related to the level of service offered, particularly in transit times and reliability of arrivals. Both these two levels of service attributes are associated with track infrastructure design and maintenance standards. The paper summarizes some of the requirements for track maintenance planning, and describes a model designed to optimize the location of sidings on a single track corridor. Considerable research has been devoted to the development of operations research applications for individual planning and control tasks. However, the use of such techniques to optimize an entire rail operation, subject to resource and customer service constraints, has not been attempted. This is mainly due to the complexity of the overall task, {{and the degree to which}} practical issues prevent optimal solutions from being implemented. The use of simulation and expert systems approaches would seem to offer a useful practical path in operations planning. ...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{loading and}} {{unloading}} of trains is crucial if rail transport is to compete with road transport. The cost of rail transport can be reduced by improving the placement of containers on trains so {{that the number of}} wagons required is minimised and so that the train can be operated safely and efficiently. The cost of terminal operations, and the delays experienced by customers' trucks, can be reduced by improving the procedures used to load and unload trains. We divided the problem into three subtasks. The first task is to develop a load plan for a train based on the expected mix of containers. An ideal plan specifies positions on the train for various container types in a way that minimises the number of wagons required while meeting a number of packing, safety and aerodynamic constraints. The second task is truck dispatching - when a truck arrives at the terminal, where should it be sent? This problem is not straightforward because trucks arrive randomly and {{loading and unloading}} occur simultaneously, and so the ideal position for a container may not yet be available. The third task is to dispatch the stackers that transfer containers between trains and trucks {{in such a way that}} truck waiting time is minimised. The <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> problem can be formulated as an integer programming problem, but it can also be solved using the OASIS software already owned by National Rail Corporation. Train plans can be made more flexible by using container classes rather than specific container details. The study group suggested several truck dispatch schemes, but did not have sufficient data to evaluate the schemes...|$|E
40|$|Robot {{planning}} {{is the process}} of selecting a sequence of actions that optimize for a task specific objective. The optimal solutions to such tasks are heavily influenced by the implicit structure in the environment, i. e. the configuration of objects in the world. State-of-the-art planning approaches, however, do not exploit this structure, thereby expending valuable effort searching the action space instead of focusing on potentially good actions. In this paper, we address the problem of enabling planners to adapt their search strategies by inferring such good actions in an efficient manner using only the information uncovered by the search up until that time. We formulate this as a problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty where at a given iteration a planning policy must map the state of the search to a planning action. Unfortunately, the training process for such partial information based policies is slow to converge and susceptible to poor local minima. Our key insight is that if we could fully observe the underlying world map, we would easily be able to disambiguate between good and bad actions. We hence present a novel data-driven imitation learning framework to efficiently <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> policies by imitating a clairvoyant oracle - an oracle that at train time has full knowledge about the world map and can compute optimal decisions. We leverage the fact that for planning problems, such oracles can be efficiently computed and derive performance guarantees for the learnt policy. We examine two important domains that rely on partial information based policies - informative path planning and search based motion planning. We validate the approach on a spectrum of environments for both problem domains, including experiments on a real UAV, and show that the learnt policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms...|$|E
