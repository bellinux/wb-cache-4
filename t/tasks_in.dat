They might alternatively be required to chop firewood, clean the wards, or carry out other domestic <b>tasks.</b> <b>In</b> 1882 Lady Brabazon, later the Countess of Meath, set up a project to provide alternative occupation for non-able-bodied inmates, known as the Brabazon scheme. Volunteers provided training in crafts such as knitting, embroidery and lace making, all costs initially being borne by Lady Brabazon herself. Although slow to take off, when workhouses discovered that the goods being produced were saleable and could make the enterprise self-financing, the scheme gradually spread across the country, and by 1897 there were more than 100 branches.|$|E

Both plants continued to build the B-52E, with 42 built at Seattle and 58 at Wichita, and the B-52F (44 from Seattle and 45 from Wichita). For the B-52G, it was decided in 1957 to transfer all production to Wichita, which freed up Seattle for other <b>tasks</b> (<b>in</b> particular the {{production of}} airliners).

The Swedes rented factories or houses from the mandarins at other locations as well, but the one on 13:e Faktorigatan (the 13th Factory street) operated as their main building.

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that social presence influences size perception by increas-ing context sensitivity. Consistent with Allport’s prediction, we expected to find greater con-text sensitivity in participants who perform a visual <b>task</b> <b>in</b> {{the presence of other}} people (i. e., in co-action) than in participants who perform the <b>task</b> <b>in</b> isolation. Supporting this hypothe-sis, participants performing an Ebbinghaus illusion-based <b>task</b> <b>in</b> co-action showed greater size illusions than those performing the <b>task</b> <b>in</b> isolation. Specifically, participants in a social context had greater difficulty perceiving the correct size of a target circle and ignoring its sur-roundings. Analyses of delta plot functions suggest a mechanism of interference monitor-ing, since that when individuals take longer to respond, they are better able to ignore the surrounding circles. However, this type of monitoring interference was not moderated by social presence. We discuss how this lack of moderation might be the reason why the impact of social presence on context sensitivity is able to be detected <b>in</b> <b>tasks</b> such as the Ebbinghaus illusion...|$|R

5|$|In 2072, {{after the}} Citadel Station's demise, TriOptimum's {{attempts}} {{to cover up}} the incident were exposed to the media and the corporation was brought up on charges from multiple individuals and companies for the ensuing scandal. The virus developed there killed the station's population; the ruthless malevolent A.I supercomputer named SHODAN controlled, and eventually destroyed the Citadel Station in hopes of enslaving and destroying humanity. After a massive number of trials, the company went bankrupt and their operations were shut down. The United Nations Nominate (UNN), a UN successor, was established to combat the malevolence and corruption of power-hungry corporations, including TriOptimum. Artificial intelligence was reduced to most rudimentary <b>tasks</b> <b>in</b> order to prevent the creation of another SHODAN-like malevolent AI, and development of new technologies was halted. Meanwhile, the hacker, who became the most famous person in the world, vanished from public eye.|$|E
5|$|Menace is a {{horizontal}} side-scrolling shooter that uses 2D computer graphics. Players control a powerful alien space fighter, moving through six stages {{on the planet}} of Draconia to advance through the game. Players use the ship's weaponry—lasers and cannons—to attack all advancing enemies, and defeat the level's boss: a guardian of Draconia. The six bosses act as Draconia's living defence mechanisms—the planet was created to habituate gruesome and harmful creatures, {{of which there are}} over sixty, participating in unlawful <b>tasks.</b> <b>In</b> the game's levels, players discover space debris, which can be converted into upgrades for the ship. The debris appears as tokens, and grants players additional weapons and upgrades, such as lasers, cannons, and improved ship and weapon power. The ship also has a shield, which provides temporary protection from enemies; contact with enemies and walls depletes the shields, increasing players' vulnerability to death.|$|E
