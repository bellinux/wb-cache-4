25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets {{has given me}} the most pleasure...I no longer stop to <b>think.</b> <b>My</b> answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. That I was not over the hill as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten by a good delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E
25|$|It's {{tougher to}} {{be a young}} writer today than when I was a young writer. I don't <b>think</b> <b>my</b> first novel would have been {{published}} today as I submitted it. I don't think an editor would have read 50 pages of it. It was very overdone and shaggy, but two young editors saw something that seemed worth pursuing and eventually we all did some work on the book and it was published. I don't think publishers {{have that kind of}} tolerance these days, and I guess possibly as a result, more writers go to writing class now than then. I think first, fiction, and second, novels, are much more refined in terms of language, but they may tend to be too well behaved, almost in response to the narrower market.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his failure}} to take power, Khiêm said he was “very happy. I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> {{objective}} has been realized.” The new junta decided to ignore Khiêm's involvement in the coup and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. In October 1965 the junta of Kỳ and Thiệu made Khiêm the Ambassador to Taiwan; he served there until mid-1968, then returned to Vietnam and served under President Thiệu as Interior Minister for a year before becoming Deputy Prime Minister {{at the start of}} 1969. In September 1969 he became prime minister and defense minister, and he stayed in the role until April 1975 when he resigned and left the country as the communists {{were in the process of}} completing their victory over South Vietnam. However, he had little power as Thiệu operated virtually one-man rule.|$|E
25|$|I admire {{a lot of}} what's {{going on}} out there, but the {{oversize}} kind of cartoon action movies is not something I'm terribly comfortable with. I think what I do is much more in the tradition that the bullets are real and they'll knock you down. I used to really get criticized for my lack of realism, but now I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> films {{are perceived to be}} vastly more realistic than most of the action movies that are happening out there... I {{think one of the things}} about being a director is, you should always try to re-create within yourself the kind of emotions you had watching film when you were very young. The kind of action movies that I always liked, the kind of comic books I always liked, were the serious ones. The characters were very realistic within the framework of the drama, and that kind of action movie interests me a lot more than the super-heroes. And so in that sense, maybe I'm slightly out of step, I suppose, but so be it.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not have done better.|$|E

He stated that he declined {{tens of millions of}} dollars of endorsement opportunities during the peak of Linsanity.

Lin called business outside of basketball [...] "definitely secondary to my primary job".|$|E

[...] The Jets loss to the Raiders in 1967 knocked New York out of a tie for first place in their {{division}} – the AFL East was won by the Houston Oilers.|$|E

5000|$|Everywhere We Go is {{the sixth}} studio album by country music singer Kenny Chesney. It was {{released}} on March 2, 1999 on BNA Records. The first in his career to receive 2× Platinum certification for sales of two million copies, it produced four singles: [...] "How Forever Feels", [...] "You Had Me from Hello", [...] "She <b>Thinks</b> <b>My</b> Tractor's Sexy", and [...] "What I Need to Do". The first two singles were Number One hits on the Billboard country charts and were also Kenny's first Top 40 hits on the pop chart, [...] "She <b>Thinks</b> <b>My</b> Tractor's Sexy" [...] was a number 11 hit on that same chart, and [...] "What I Need to Do" [...] a number 8. The singles [...] "You Had Me from Hello" [...] and [...] "She <b>Thinks</b> <b>My</b> Tractor's Sexy" [...] were both certified gold by the RIAA. This was Kenny's first album to have a crossover-friendly country-pop sound, which was a departure from his earlier neotraditional country albums.|$|R

500|$|After he too {{had been}} exiled the {{following}} year, Thi said [...] "It {{was necessary to}} move against him because our army was dependent on the Americans, and we could not get along without them." [...] Thi accused overseas-based Diệm supporters for the coup. Despite his failure to take power, Khiêm said Khánh’s demise made him [...] "very happy. I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> objective has been realized." [...] The Soviet Union responded to the coup by saying [...] "The farce will go on" [...] and lampooning South Vietnam's [...] "bankrupt politicians and warriors".|$|E
500|$|The title [...] "The Holy Bible" [...] {{was chosen}} by Edwards to reflect an idea, {{according}} to Bradfield, that [...] "everything on {{there has to be}} perfection". Interviewed at the end of 1994, Edwards said: [...] "The way religions choose to speak their truth to the public has always been to beat them down [...] I think that if a Holy Bible is true, it should be about the way the world is and that's what I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> lyrics are about. [...] doesn't pretend things don't exist".|$|E
500|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> father really decided {{for me that}} I {{should work}} in fashion," [...] she {{recalled}} in The September Issue. He arranged for his daughter's first job, at the influential Biba boutique, when she was 15. The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods. At her parents' behest, she also took fashion classes at a nearby school. Soon she gave them up, saying, [...] "You either know fashion or you don't." [...] Another older boyfriend, Richard Neville, gave her {{her first experience of}} magazine production at his popular and controversial Oz.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Tim McGraw" [...] regard a summer romance {{that came to}} a sudden halt. The song fondly reminisces an ex-boyfriend, and directs the lyrics towards him, rather than country singer Tim McGraw himself. It uses McGraw's music as a marker in their {{relationship}} timeline: [...] "When you think Tim McGraw / I hope you <b>think</b> <b>my</b> favorite song." [...] Sean Dooley of About.com stated, [...] "Music {{has the power to}} evoke memories, and it's an old Tim McGraw song that triggers her happy memories." [...] McGraw's reference is one of the several items used for association of the failed relationship, along with other items and places, such as a little black dress.|$|E
500|$|Jackson told Sister 2 Sister magazine, [...] "There {{were some}} people who didn't like the {{direction}} I took with this album. I love doing dance songs and I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> fans expect that of me. I have been getting more behind the scenes with film and television. I will probably continue to do music – and acting is still a strong passion of mine – but I really have been loving behind-the-scenes work: producing, directing and all the technical stuff". A {{few months before the}} split, a spokesperson for the label told Billboard, [...] "Unfortunately we haven't experienced the results we would have liked with this new album. But we respect and support Janet".|$|E
500|$|Meyer, a Mormon, {{acknowledges}} that her faith has influenced her work. In particular, {{she says that}} her characters [...] "tend to think more about where they came from, {{and where they are}} going, than might be typical." [...] Meyer also steers her work from subjects such as sex, despite the romantic nature of the novels. Meyer says that she does not consciously intend her novels to be Mormon-influenced, or to promote the virtues of sexual abstinence and spiritual purity, but admits that her writing is shaped by her values, saying, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>my</b> books are going to be really graphic or dark, because of who I am. There's {{always going to be a}} lot of light in my stories." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Now they're {{having me}} sing. I sort of half-sing, half-talk, with hips-and-eye stuff. You know what I mean—like Maurice Chevalier. I {{used to sing}} at home and people would say, 'Pipe down! You're terrible!' But the studio <b>thinks</b> <b>my</b> voice is great." ...|$|R
500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> confidence level will drop, but when it was presented to us by this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|Comparing his law and officiating professions, he says [...] "A {{trial is}} nothing, pressure-wise, {{compared}} to the NFL. … I have that long [...] {{to make a decision}} with a million people watching and second-guessing (by video) in slow-motion. You've got to be right or wrong. I love the satisfaction when you are right — and the agony when you are wrong." [...] Hochuli finds similarities between the football field and courtroom saying, [...] "On the football field, people like that I'm in charge and know what I'm doing, {{but a lot of the}} time, it's just appearance. [...] I'm going to sell you on my decision. It's the same in the courtroom. You don't stand in front of a jury and say, 'I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> client is innocent.' You say, 'We're right!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Kafka {{was invited}} to the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, which started on February 24, along with {{teammates}} Corey Wootton and Sherrick McManis. Kafka chose Mike McCartney of Priority Sports of Chicago as his agent, who also represents Wootton. Priority hired former Chicago Bears quarterback Erik Kramer and a trainer in Phoenix, Arizona, to help Kafka prepare for the NFL Scouting Combine. To prepare for the Combine, Kafka worked out twice a day in Arizona, and held practice sessions with Notre Dame wide receiver Golden Tate. At the Combine, Kafka said, [...] "I {{want to be an}} NFL starter. I'm not going to the league to be a No. 2. I <b>think</b> <b>my</b> whole game can go to another level. I'm ready to take it up another notch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My submission," [...] she said, [...] "only {{respected}} those {{lands and}} estates which your Grace's ancestors gave to mine, and which I resign to the House of Burgundy, if <b>my</b> Sovereign <b>thinks</b> <b>my</b> disobedience {{in this matter}} renders me unworthy to hold them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yankovic {{replaces the}} {{original}} lyrics [...] "I've been blastin' and laughin' {{so long that}} even <b>my</b> momma <b>thinks</b> that <b>my</b> mind is gone" [...] with the lyrics [...] "I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that even Ezekiel <b>thinks</b> that <b>my</b> mind is gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor fellow either way. You don't {{know the}} {{atmosphere}} in which I live, the horror, the scandal my apostasy would provoke, the injury and suffering it would inflict.
