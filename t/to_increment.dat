That can create a carry, which is why the arms move in a spiral. At the same time, the sector gears are returned to their original position, which causes them <b>to</b> <b>increment</b> the even column wheels back to their original values. The sector gears are double-high on one side so they can be lifted to disengage from the odd column wheels while they still remain in contact with the even column wheels.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the urging}} of John Shaw Billings, Hollerith {{developed}} a mechanism using electrical connections <b>to</b> <b>increment</b> a counter, recording information. [...] A key idea was that a datum could be recorded by {{the presence or absence}} of a hole at a specific location on a card. For example, if a specific hole location indicates marital status, then a hole there can indicate married while not having a hole indicates single. [...] Hollerith determined that data in specified locations on a card, the now-familiar rows and columns, could be counted or sorted electromechanically. A description of this system, An Electric Tabulating System (1889), was submitted by Hollerith to Columbia University as his doctoral thesis, and is reprinted in Randell's book. On January 8, 1889, Hollerith was issued U.S. Patent 395,782, claim 2 of which reads: ...|$|E
2500|$|The USAF BIG SAFARI program office {{managed the}} Predator program {{and was given}} {{direction}} on 21 June 2000 to explore options to arm the aircraft. [...] This led to it being fitted with reinforced wings and stores pylons to carry munitions, {{as well as a}} laser designator. The RQ-1 conducted its first firing of a Hellfire anti-tank missile on 16 February 2001; over a bombing range near Indian Springs Air Force Station north of Las Vegas, Nevada, an inert AGM-114C successfully hit a tank target. This led to a series of tests on 21 February 2001 in which the Predator fired three Hellfire missiles, scoring hits on a stationary tank with all three missiles. Following the February tests, {{the decision was made to}} move immediately <b>to</b> <b>increment</b> two of the testing phase, which involved more complex tests to hunt for simulated moving targets from greater altitudes with the more advanced AGM-114K version. The scheme was put into service, with the armed Predators given the new designation of MQ-1A. The Predator gives little warning of attack; it is relatively quiet and the Hellfire is supersonic, so it strikes before it is heard by the target.|$|E

50|$|As before, {{one of the}} {{counters}} is used as scratchpad. The other holds an integer whose prime factorization is 2a3b5c7d. The exponents a, b, c, and d {{can be thought of}} as four virtual counters that are being packed (via Gödel numbering) into a single real counter. If the real counter is set <b>to</b> zero then <b>incremented</b> once, that is equivalent to setting all the virtual counters to zero. If the real counter is doubled, that is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>incrementing</b> a, and if it's halved, that's equivalent to decrementing a.

Similarly, c and d can be <b>incremented</b> or decremented. <b>To</b> check if a virtual counter such as c is equal to zero, just divide the real counter by 5, see what the remainder is, then multiply by 5 and add back the remainder. That leaves the real counter unchanged. The remainder will have been nonzero if and only if c was zero.|$|R

Database searches have yielded 11 G-subunits, a single G-subunit, but no G-subunits. We report here the purification, cDNA isolation, and functional analysis of a G-subunit. Like G, the G appears to be unique and hybridization studies show that G and G are expressed in parallel during development. Species-wide sequence comparisons of G-subunits and -like domains of RGS proteins reveal short stretches of highly conserved residues as well as the common CXXL motif at the COOH-terminal of Gs that target Gs to plasma membrane.
