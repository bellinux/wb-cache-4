40|$|Children working, eating, {{sleeping}} {{and growing up}} on the streets a. k. a. ‘Street Children’ {{is a problem that}} has long accompanied the history of development of big metropolitan centers. According to UNICEF {{it is almost impossible to}} determine the exact amount of street children but it is likely the numbers are increasing as the global population grows and urbanization continues at a rapid pace. As one way to cope with this crisis, the aim of this work is to study the utilization of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to reduce the number of street children. The idea is to evolve the concept of telecenters and <b>telecottages,</b> which has been largely reviewed in the literature, into Digital Knowledge Information Centers (DKICs) tailored to street children’s need. The objective is to use ICT tools to offer content and activities that can capture their attention thus attracting them out of the streets while at the same time improve their literacy, e-literacy and provide useful skills to reduce their marginality and improve a future reinsertion in the society. In practice, every city in the world has some street children but, for the sake of this work, the city of Santa Fe in Argentina was chosen because it already has structures such as ‘Centers for Family Action’ scattered in the poorest neighborhoods that can be easily turned into successful DKICs...|$|R

40|$|Community Informatics (CI) is the {{application}} of information and communications technologies (ICTs) to enable community processes and the achievement of community objectives. CI goes beyond the "Digital Divide" to making ICT access usable and useful to excluded populations and communities for local economic development, social justice, and political empowerment. CI approaches ICTs from a "community" perspective and develops strategies and techniques for managing their use by communities both virtual and physical including the variety of Community Networking applications. CI assumes that both communities have characteristics, requirements, and opportunities that require different strategies for ICT intervention and development from individual access and use. Also, CI addresses ICT use in Developing Countries as well as among the poor, the marginalized, the elderly, or those living in remote locations in Developed Countries. CI is of interest both to ICT practitioners and academic researchers and addresses the connections between the policy and pragmatic issues arising from {{the tens of thousands}} of Community Networks, Community Technology Centres, Telecentres, Community Communications Centres, and <b>Telecottages</b> globally along with the rapidly emerging field of electronically based virtual "communities".

40|$|Influenced by {{international}} streams {{of the last}} decades Hungary recognised the necessity of focusing on new dimensions of regional competitiveness, namely on regional development questions of information society, {{as well as on}} the elaboration of regional strategies based on information and communication technologies (ICT). After national level strategies (MITS) regional policy also acknowledged the importance of this topic or at least its possibilities. Documents of enhancing regional information society development, the Regional Information Society Strategies (RITS) formulated several development opportunities, directions and proposals. After a couple of years it can be already seen what changes happened or happened not in the reduction of regional inequalities and in the development of the information society. This paper aims to present through the introduction of plans and experiences the real application possibilities of the tool of ICT-based development policy. Since 2004 and 2005, when Regional Information Strategies were created, it was entitled to expect wider range of results of information society development in the Hungarian regions. Real experiences of development policy are, however, not reassuring enough. Aims and thoughts formulated in regional strategies has been achieved and accomplished slightly or just indirectly. Interviews made with fellows of regional development agencies focusing on the afterlife and consequences of Regional Information Society Strategies tried to reveal real opportunities of this development tool. It made possible also to emphasise problems of information society development, and to collect the steps done since the publication of the strategies. According to the opinion of the professionals of regional development agencies the effectiveness of strategies are questionable, however, there were some good examples (e. g. the network of <b>telecottages)</b> on regional (local) information society development, which had on the other hand not much connection with the previously mentioned strategies...|$|R
40|$|It {{is about}} a flexible, {{atypical}} and nonstandard form of an employment contarct and engaging employees. The term teleworking {{is used for the}} employment contract for performing the work at home. Referring to the employment contract for doing work from home the term teleworking is used, which in many comparative legislatures and practises has become an official word. Тeleworking is a work on a location different from the employer’s premise and more often it includes computer-telecomunication technology. The teleworking presents an effective mechanism for working, both for the employers who work for a well-known employer (classical labour relations) and for the workers registered as self-employed. In many legislatures, and in the practice in different counties it comes to an identification of the teleworking itself (the contract on a separate work place) with the working from home (employment contract for performing the work from home). Home telework, represents the most exloited form of teleworking, where the employee performs paid work from his/her home The work in <b>telecottages</b> represents a work on a separate working place, which includes employees (teleworkers) not willing to stay home and therefore they use these local centres (out of the employer’s premise). What are the advantages on side of the employers and the employees? The advantages, in terms of the employers, are: saving money for the lease of a premise and the necessary logistics, saving energy and saving travelling and food expenses. In terms of the employees, it a work from home, with the presence of their families and they have more free time and free schedule of work time, as well as the help {{of the members of the}} family. The people with handicap also have some advantages of this model. The institute-contract for employment with teleworking is a modern advantage in the Macedonian labour-legal legislation which is in accordance with the Convention and recommendation of MOT num. 177 from 1996 for teleworking and with the Framework Contract for teleworking in EU from 2012. However, there are particular elements which must be specified additionally in the Law on Labour Relations. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{telecentre}} movement’s origins can {{be traced}} to Europe's <b>telecottage</b> and Electronic Village Halls (originally in Denmark) and Community Technology Centers (CTCs) in the United States, both of which emerged in the 1980s as a result of advances in computing. At a time when computers were available but not yet a common household good, public access to computers emerged as a solution. Today, although home ownership of computers is widespread in the United States and other industrialized countries, there remains a need for free public access to computing, whether it is in CTCs, telecottages or public libraries to ensure that everyone has access to technologies that have become essential.|$|E

40|$|Between the {{cultures}} of economic development and the economics of cultural production Information society “effectively utilises information and knowledge and their related technologies to promote human well-being ” (UN). The phenomenon is also linked with the controversial concept of globalisation. Assumedly, the global flow of information, if achieved, will not standardize the existing diversity of values, lifestyles, and attitudes. Indeed, national and regional identities, the ‘locale ’ will not only retain {{but more and more}} emphasize their significance and uniqueness, as a defensive reaction to, or a way to compete in, a globalizing context. In such a revival of local and regional identities, and in the revitalisation of local economies, seemingly paradoxically, ICT may come to help. Informational development and regional socio-economic inequalities are in many ways connected. As society is culturally, historically determined and varies in space, no two localities or regions can be found which have identical responses to the new challenges. Even if technological infrastructure is physically accessible, the advantage it provides is a potential only, and depends greatly on the social capital present in a region or locality. Consequently, there is no standardised formula for a successful ‘intelligent region ’ on any spatial level. Social Capital and ICTs in Local Development: The Case of the Hungarian <b>Telecottage</b> Movement Isolation is not sustainable any more: regions and communities cut off from the flow of information are seriously disadvantaged, and can become easily irreversibly peripheral. How then, is it possible to both link up to the networked world and keep traditional values and uniqueness as important endogenous resources at the same time? The study gives an account of an example from Hungary, the <b>telecottage</b> movement, which tailored the Scandinavian ‘invention ’ of telecentres for community development to the current needs and peculiarities of the Central-Eastern European social and economic context...|$|E
40|$|Rural areas cover 87 % of the {{territory}} and are inhabited by 45 % {{of the population in}} Hungary. These areas have the same problem as most of the rural areas in Europe: migration of the active, well-trained labour force, depopulation, unfavourable age structure, high unemployment rate with critical labour market situation in the small settlements. Information and Communication Technology – if used properly – can serve as a solution to these problems, although there is much to be done in this field. The authors have started to examine the current situation of the basic ICT-indicators in Hungary, with a special focus on small settlements, and they have also given a historical overview on the past years’ governmental strategies (especially the National Information Society Strategy), the new National Rural Development Strategy and civic efforts (ex.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{establishing}} telecottages {{is to improve the}} provision of IT infÂ¬rastructure in rural settlements via providing community access. The quantity and quality of staffing is a key factor in the long term operation of the telecottages. National and international literature focuses on the fact that use of the IT tools of telecottages requires suitable staffing. Asurvey conducted in 2004 showed that managers working in the questioned telecottages typically have higher education qualification, but only 54 % of them receive any sort of remuneration for their work. More than half of the client service associates have secondary qualification, and every third of them does not receive any remuneration for their work. The survey findings indicate that the skills of the client service associates of the telecottages are quite appropriate, but the lack of financial incentives causes significant fluctuation among staff due to social insecurity. Asurvey conducted by Fabulya conducted two years later (in 2006) indicated that the situation had not improved but had gotten worse: in 2006, half of the telecottages surveyed operated without any paid employees. To successfully operate a <b>telecottage,</b> employees need to be motivated and financially encouraged. Due to the constant lack of financial resources, telecottages are not able to provide appropriate financial incentive to the workforce. Difficulties of the operation can be resolved by transforming the system of grants and subsidies.

40|$|Telecommuting {{centers have}} been in {{existence}} {{for more than a}} decade in countries outside the United States. More recently, in the U. S. the potential for these telecenters to relieve urban congestion, to contribute to air quality improvement, and to encourage local economic growth has been recognized. This growing awareness has brought about the need to understand better those pioneering experiences with telecommuting centers, both in the U. S. and elsewhere. This report collects and analyzes information on established telecommuting centers and related concepts for the purpose of providing input to the planning and operation stages of the Residential-Area-Based Offices (RABO) Project, sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). These remote work centers are found on five continents, in at least twenty countries including the U. S., and in a variety of functional forms. Few of these existing centers are consistent with the emphasis of the RABO project on residential proximity with primary access being via walking, bicycling, transit and neighborhood clean fuel vehicles. Despite these differences, this review still has important lessons for the RABO and other telecommuting center projects. Our findings suggest that the most persistent of these remote work center forms at this point are the rural <b>telecottage</b> and single-employer satellite office. The multiple-employer telecenter has had mixed success in demonstrations to date, possibly due to the complexity involved in implementing and operating this type of facility. It was found that early, extensive marketing efforts are crucial to center success, as is close attentiont to the elements of site selection. Critical barriers are to the adoption of multiple-employer telecommuting centers include reluctance of employers to bear the cost of two workspaces per telecommuting employee, and managerial resistance to supervising remote employees, and concern over the security of proprietary information. In general, the concept of a multiple-use center (rather than a "pure" telecommuting center) appears to be a robust model for success in remote work facilities. Telecommuting...|$|E
