Points that lie strictly to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>of</b> the curve are said to be inefficient, because existing resources would allow for production of more of at least one good without sacrificing the production of any other good. An efficient point is one that lies on the production possibilities curve. At any such point, more of one good can be produced only by producing less of the other.|$|E

40|$|Subjects with hemispatial neglect often exhibit {{representational}} neglect: {{a failure}} to report details from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> side <b>of</b> mentally visualized images.
