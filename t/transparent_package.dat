40|$|A virtual {{cluster is}} a {{promising}} technology for reduc-ing management costs and improving capacity utiliza-tion in datacenters and computer centers. However, re-cent cluster virtualization systems {{do not have}} the max-imum scalability and flexibility required, due to lim-ited hardware resources at one site. Therefore, we are now developing an advanced cluster management sys-tem for multi-site virtual clusters; which provides a vir-tual cluster composed of distributed computer resources over wide area networks. This system has great advan-tages over other cluster management systems designed only for single-site resources; users can create a clus-ter of virtual machines from local and remote physical clusters in a scalable manner, and dynamically change the number of cluster nodes on demand, seamlessly. In our system, a multi-site cluster achieves a monolithic system view of cluster nodes to enable existing appli-cations to be deployed quickly and managed flexibly, just as in physical clusters. In this paper, we propose an advanced cluster virtualization mechanism composed of two key techniques. An L 2 network extension of virtual machine networks allows transparent deployment over networks for distributed virtual cluster nodes, and a <b>transparent</b> <b>package</b> caching mechanism greatly opti-mizes data transfers in virtual cluster deployment over network latencies. Experimental results show multi-site virtual clusters have sufficient feasibility in WAN envi-ronments and promise great scalability for a large-scale number of virtual nodes. ...|$|E
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes is {{a common}} {{post-processing}} contaminant in ready-to-eat vacuum packaged (VP) cold smoked salmon. Since this psychrotrophic pathogen can grow at refrigerated temperatures (~ 4 °C), other safety barriers in addition to temperature are needed to ensure the continued safety of VP cold smoked salmon. One such novel barrier could be the pulsed light (PL) treatment of the product prior to packaging or treating the product through a <b>transparent</b> <b>package.</b> Pulsed light destruction kinetics of L. monocytogenes were evaluated while dispensed into a liquid media, {{on the surface of}} a general purpose agar and on the surface of cold smoked salmon. Results showed that PL technology was an effective surface sanitation method (a decimal reduction time or D-value of 0. 91, 1. 37 and 2. 25 s exposure of PL at 800, 700 and 600 V, respectively, and a resulting z value of 500 V) on the agar plate. However, it had only a limited success when applied to liquid samples as well as directly on the surface of cold smoked salmon (D-value ranged from 93 s to 24 min). Sensory quality of VP cold smoked salmon subjected to selected PL treatments was monitored during storage for 14 days at 4 °C. Both color and odor scores remained within acceptable limits over the 14 day storage period. Subsequent challenge studies were carried out with L. monocytogenes applied on VP cold smoked salmon. An overall reduction in counts was observed in samples stored at 4 °C over 28 days; however, after PL treatment (day 0), there was no significant reduction in counts. Color and odor scores maintained acceptable values over 14 days. Additional experiments were carried out {{to determine the effects of}} (1) 1. 5 % salt, (2) 6 % oil, (3) a representative salmon media and (4) background microflora (lactic acid bacteria) on the PL inactivation of L. monocytogenes. All of these factors significantly affected the destruction of L. monocytogenes by increasing the D-value (adding resistance to pulsed light destruction). Overall, these studies have shown that PL treatment in combination with low temperature storage (4 °C) has the potential to extend the shelf-life of VP cold smoked salmon products without compromising sensory quality. However further investigation into higher treatment voltages is necessary in order to achieve a higher target kill of L. monocytogenes...|$|E

40|$|Summary This thesis {{reports on}} the design of new types of planar optical sensors (often {{referred}} to as optodes) for oxygen and carbon dioxide, respectively. Such sensors are of highest interest for monitoring oxygen and CO 2 in modified atmospheric packaging (MAP). The oxygen sensors are based on the quenching effect that oxygen exerts on the fluorescence (or luminescence in general) of certain fluorophores. In the particular case, luminophores out of the group of ruthenium dipyridyl and ruthenium phenanthroline complexes have been used. These have absorption maxima at around 450 nm which make them compatible with blue light emitting diodes (LEDs) which can acts as low-cost light sources for fluorescence excitation. Their luminescence is far red-shifted and peaks at around 620 nm. Both the intensity and the decay time of the luminescence of the ruthenium complexes is strongly affected by molecular oxygen, and this finding forms the basis for the sensing scheme applied here. The sensor for carbon dioxide (CO 2) is based on a quite different analytical approach. CO 2 is a weakly acidic gas that can change the pH of a buffer contained inside a gas-permeable sensor membrane. The acidification of such an "immobilised" buffer resulting from exposure to CO 2 is indicated by a fluorescent pH indicator. Several possibilities were considered, of which the measurement of fluorescence intensity, fluorescence decay time, fluorescence energy transfer, and of "dual luminophore referenced luminescence" (DLRF) came into closer consideration. A careful analysis of the merits of each method was performed which led to the following conclusions: (a) In case of oxygen sensors it is found that the measurement of luminescence intensity is slightly inferior to measurement of fluorescence decay time. However, in view of the substantial additional costs for decay time based sensors it is recommended that luminescence intensity be measured which still gives adequate results for many MAP applications. (b) The situation is different for CO 2 sensors where the superiority of DLRF became quite obvious after a short time. Energy transfer is second to it yet much better than the other two methods. The method of DLRF is therefore described in some detail (chapter 3) both in theory and in terms of practical implementation and choice of materials (chapter 4). The last experimental chapter (no. 5) refers to the use of microparticles and nanoparticles which are shown to be useful reference materials in optical sensors. These are made from sol-gels and modified sol-gels and have unique properties including narrow particle distribution and high luminescent brightness. In order to test the sensor obtained in the studies summarised before, all sensor types were tested for the parameters and properties that are of relevance in context with MAP. In conclusion, {{it can be said that}} the two types of optical presented here represent a novel type of sensors for MAP applications, with several advantages over existing sensor types. In particular, the costs for sensor preparation, the ease of depositing the material on package materials, and the possibility of reading the signal through an optically <b>transparent</b> <b>package</b> material (usually colourless plastic), thereby avoiding the risk of bacterial contamination (as a result of opening the package) are substantial advantages that make the results of this work highly promising. I am confident that further studies (to be performed in the respective industry) will demonstrate the enormous potential of this new method...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{presence}} of oxygen causes deterioration of oxygen-sensitive foodstuffs. This {{leads to a}} deterioration of quality characteristics like colour, freshness and organoleptic properties. Due to the strong influence of temperature and exposure to light (photo-induced oxidation processes) this effect especially appears in <b>transparent</b> <b>packaged</b> chilled products (like sausages). Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} reduce the oxygen content in the headspace of the package. One possibility is the use of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). But even at optimised processes the residual oxygen-concentration is up to 0. 5 – 2 %. To reduce this destructive oxygen, the additional use of oxygen scavengers becomes more and more attractive. Fraunhofer Institute for Process Engineering and Packaging worked together with industrial partners on an improvement of the kinetics of oxygen scavengers. In the AiF-funded project “Optimisation of <b>transparent</b> <b>packaging</b> materials with iron-based oxygen-scavengers for chilled products” (Nr. 15555 N) the kinetics of oxygen-scavengers should be improved. Background of this was that the systems that are already available at the market do not work fast enough at low temperatures (5 °C). Therefore the aim of the project was to incorporate the oxygen scavenger into the packaging material and thus achieving better quality preservation and longer shelf-life of the chilled food. It could be shown that integrating the masterbatch SHELFPLUS® 2500 (SP 2500) in a polymer (EVA) with high oxygen permeability resulted in higher oxygen consumption. Comparisons of the oxygen consumption of sausage and film showed that the use of the multilayer film PE/AL(SP 2500; EVA) in combination with the food (exposed to light) resulted eight days earlier in a total consumption of the oxygen than storing the sausage without active film. This leads to a certain protection of the sausage...|$|R

UV absorbers prevent photo-degradation of the product {{as a result of}} the UV light barrier properties of the packaging, which protect the product against UV rays in the wavelength range of 200 - 380 nm. Although a number of studies indicate the need for the use of UV absorbers, they do not mention any technical reference data that could be used as quality parameters for packaging systems.

Since large intravenous sensors are not feasible, measuring inside the interstitial fluid is considered the best alternative. This option, unfortunately, has the drawback of a lag time with blood glucose values. A good strategy to circumvent this is to enhance tissue integration and enrich the peri-implant vasculature. Implants of different optically transparent biomaterials (poly(methyl-methacrylate) [PMMA] and poly(dimethylsiloxane) [PDMS]) - enabling glucose monitoring in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum - were surface-treated and subsequently implanted in goats at various implantation sites for up to 3 months. The overall in vivo biocompatibility, tissue integration, and vascularization at close proximity of the surfaces of these materials were assessed. Histological screening showed similar tissue reactions independent of the implantation site. No significant inflammation reaction was observed. Tissue integration and vascularization correlated, to some extent, with the biomaterial composition.

This experiment compared packaging designs with: a transparent window, an image of the product on opaque packaging, or plain opaque packaging.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) {{can be used}} {{to tackle}} vitamin A deficiency, a major public health problem in most {{developing}} countries. In East Africa, common ways of using sweetpotato include drying and subsequent storage. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the impact of drying and storage on the total carotenoid retention (as an estimate of provitamin A retention) from OFSP. RESULTS: Losses of total carotenoid during drying were generally low (15 % or less). Total carotenoid retention in OFSP was not dependent on the type of dryer (solar or sun). Sweetpotato cultivar (Ejumula, Kakamega, SPK 004 / 1, SPK 004 / 1 / 1, SPK 004 / 6 or SPK 004 / 6 / 6) had a significant effect on retention in drying (P < 0. 05). High percentage losses of total carotenoids were, however, correlated with high moisture content and high carotenoid content in fresh sweetpotato roots. After 4 months' storage at room temperature in Uganda, losses of total carotenoid in dried sweetpotato chips were high (about 70 %) and this was not dependent on the use of opaque or <b>transparent</b> <b>packaging.</b> CONCLUSION: Losses of carotenoids during storage were considered to be more of a nutritional constraint to the utilisation of dried sweetpotato than losses occurring during drying.

It is therefore a challenge to come up with innovative <b>transparent</b> <b>packaging</b> solutions that still have optimal light barrier properties. The aim of this thesis was to study the effect of different wavelengths of light and storage conditions on photooxidation in dairy products. The knowledge obtained from these photooxidation studies was then used to design appropriate light barrier packaging materials for preventing photooxidation in dairy products. Descriptive sensory evaluation has been the main method for measuring photooxidation in this study since it is sensitive and relevant. Fluorescence spectroscopy has been an important tool for studying and understanding the photobleaching going on in dairy products. The method allows monitoring of the photodegradation of the photosensitizers during light exposure, and can help to understand differences caused by different wavelengths of exposure light. Singlet Oxygen Sensor Green® (SOSG) reagent was applied for the first time in a food study. It was used to measure the amount of singlet oxygen formed in photooxidation Type II reaction. In these studies, we have observed that long wavelengths (> 550 nm) in the visible region (orange light) tended to give more photooxidation in milk than did shorter wavelengths (< 500 nm) of blue light. The photooxidation from light above 550 nm was most likely due to the naturally occurring photosensitizers chlorophyll and protoporphyrin IX which absorb light in this region. Additionally, β-carotene will probably act as an optical filter in the blue region (< 500 nm) reducing the amount of light to react with the photosensitizers absorbing in this region (riboflavin, chlorophyll and protoporphyrin IX). It was also documented that with regard to photooxidation there was an interaction effect between wavelength of light and the storage atmosphere. Wavelengths in the red region resulted in stronger photooxidation in low oxygen atmosphere, whereas blue light gave stronger phtooxidation in high oxygen atmosphere. This indicates that different photooxidation pathways are active for different wavelengths. In a study on cheese, it was shown that longer wavelengths also penetrated deeper into the food matrix, generating off-flavors further into the cheese than shorter wavelengths. This might also explain why longer wavelengths resulted in more photooxidation, and it also illustrated the importance of proper sampling with regard to studies of photooxidation. New transparent materials with tailor made light barrier were developed by using different pigments and additives and combinations of them. All films had a shade of green and transmitted light in the green region to avoid the main absorption areas of known photosensitizers in the blue and red regions. The best protection of photooxidation in pasteurized milk was obtained by blocking wavelengths below 450 nm and also minimizing light at wavelengths longer than 600 nm. The approach of first elucidating the photooxidation properties and then, based on this, design optimized packaging materials is a general methodology that can be used for other food products in the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} role of food packaging {{is continuing to}} evolve in response to changing market needs. Current drivers such as consumer’s demand for safer, “healthier,” and higher-quality foods, ideally with a long shelf-life; the demand for convenient and <b>transparent</b> <b>packaging,</b> and the preference for more sustainable packaging materials, {{have led to the}} development of new packaging technologies, such as active packaging (AP). As defined in the European regulation (EC) No 450 / 2009, AP systems are designed to “deliberately incorporate components that would release or absorb substances into or from the packaged food or the environment surrounding the food. ” Active packaging materials are thereby "intended to extend the shelf-life or to maintain or improve the condition of packaged food. ” Although extensive research on AP technologies is being undertaken, many of these technologies have not yet been implemented successfully in commercial food packaging systems. Broad communication of their benefits in food product applications will facilitate the successful development and market introduction. In this review, an overview of AP technologies, such as antimicrobial, antioxidant or carbon dioxide-releasing systems, and systems absorbing oxygen, moisture or ethylene, is provided, and, in particular, scientific publications illustrating the benefits of such technologies for specific food products are reviewed. Furthermore, the challenges in applying such AP technologies to food systems and the anticipated direction of future developments are discussed. This review will provide food and packaging scientists with a thorough understanding of the benefits of AP technologies when applied to specific foods and hence can assist in accelerating commercial adoption...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo design new {{packaging}} {{for fresh}} food, stakeholders {{of the food}} chain express their needs and requirements, according to some goals and objectives. These requirements can be gathered into two groups: (i) fresh food related characteristics and (ii) packaging intrinsic characteristics. Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP) is an efficient way to delay senescence and spoilage and thus to extend the very short shelf life of respiring products such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Consequently, packaging O 2 /CO 2 permeabilities must fit the requirements of fresh fruits and vegetable as predicted by virtual MAP simulating tools. Beyond gas permeabilities, the choice of a packaging material for fresh produce includes numerous other factors such as the cost, availability, potential contaminants of raw materials, process ability, waste management constraints, etc. For instance, the user may have the following multi-criteria query for his/her product asking for a packaging with optimal gas permeabilities that guarantee product quality and optionally a <b>transparent</b> <b>packaging</b> material made from renewable resources with a cost for raw material less than 3 e/ kg. To help stakeholders taking a rational decision based on the expressed needs, a new multi-criteria Decision Support System (DSS) for designing biodegradable packaging for fresh produce has been built. In this paper we present the functional specification, the software architecture and the implementation of the developed tool. This tool includes (i) a MAP simulation module combining mass transfer models and respiration of the food, (ii) a multi-criteria flexible querying module which handles imprecise, uncertain and missing data stored in the database.

40|$|Although the use {{of plastic}} in {{packaging}} has largely increased, consumer research consistently indicates that consumers attach a high quality perception to glass packaged products. The goal {{of this study was}} to examine individuals’ recognition and affective judgments of 30 food packages after visual and haptic exploration. We included packages of three food products that are more often packaged in glass (wine, honey, chocolate cream) and three products that are usually plastic packaged (yogurt, milk, juice). For each product, five packages were used: a glass package; a <b>transparent</b> plastic <b>package</b> with a shape similar to the glass package; a <b>transparent</b> plastic <b>package</b> with a shape different from the glass package; a non-transparent plastic package; a plastic package with a very unusual shape. 30 participants were randomly assigned to three conditions: visual, haptic, and visual + haptic exploration. The visual group watched the packages while their eye-movements were recorded, whereas participants of the other two groups were video-recorded and haptic Exploration Procedures were coded. All participants were asked to name each package and to rate how much they liked it. Moreover, they blind tasted 20 products and were asked to judge liking and quality. Participants were unaware that, for each food category, they were tasting the exact same product repeatedly. The results show that pleasantness judgments were higher for glass packages than for plastic packages. Similarly, participants reported to like the products they believed to come from glass packages more than products contained in plastic packages. Unusual shapes required longer visual and haptic exploration, were overall rated as less pleasant and containing the lowest quality products. The implications for packaging material, shape and design are discussed...|$|R
