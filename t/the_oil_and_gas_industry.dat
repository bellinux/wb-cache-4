5|$|Fluor {{was founded}} in 1912 by John Simon Fluor as Fluor Construction Company. It grew quickly, {{predominantly}} by building oil refineries, pipelines and other facilities for <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>industry,</b> at first in California, {{and then in the}} Middle East and globally. In the late 1960s, it began diversifying into oil drilling, coal mining and other raw materials like lead. A global recession in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>industry</b> and losses from its mining operation led to restructuring and layoffs in the 1980s. Fluor sold its oil operations and diversified its construction work into a broader range of services and industries.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of using {{of the strategic}} management as management technology on enterprises of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> complex with <b>the</b> aim of providing energy security of Ukraine has been considered.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research conducted to measure the importance of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> complex in <b>the</b> Brazilian economy and in its states, henceforth called O&G. 	Initially, the efforts were concentrated on the construction of an interregional input-output system for the 27 states of the Brazilian economy at the level of 42 industries, for the year of 2002. 	By using this system, it was possible to make an analysis of the role played by <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> complex in <b>the</b> Brazilian economy and its states. First it was made an analysis of the economic flows linked to <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> production, <b>and</b> then it is made an estimation of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) value generated by <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> complex in <b>the</b> Brazilian economy and its states. It was also made a detailed analysis of the productive chain of <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas,</b> starting from <b>the</b> suppliers of inputs to <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> production, going through the production itself and the various stages of refining and processing, and ending at the measuring of the services and distribution activities. 	The results show that <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> complex has a share of around 10. 4 % of the Brazilian GDP, while the share in the GDP of the states ranges from less than 1 % to 27 %. ...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} developments in Texan government resulted from the creation of a state oil production tax in 1905. The revenue generated by the tax made funds available for development in the state without the need for income taxes and similar revenue mechanisms adopted in other states. In 1919, tax revenue from oil production surpassed $1 million ($ in today's terms) and in 1929 it reached $6 million ($ in today's terms). By 1940, <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>industry</b> accounted for approximately half of all taxes paid in the state.|$|E

5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>industry,</b> research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E

5|$|Tidal action {{along the}} coast {{affected}} the balance of salinity in coastal marshes and water bodies. The sudden intrusion of saltwater stressed delicate plants. Fish, shrimp and oysters also suffered the ecological effects of Hurricane Carmen. Flooding on land caused some wildlife to drown. Several parks in Louisiana sustained damage, either from flooding or high winds; losses to Grand Island State Park in particular totaled $114,600. <b>The</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>industry</b> was also affected, and its estimated $24.7million in losses resulted mainly from damage to equipment and offshore facilities. The storm diminished oil production by 1.4 million barrels when it shut down operations for 24 to 48 hours at various locations. Over 60,000 electric cooperative customers lost power.|$|E

ExxonMobil Canada is headquartered in St. John's and companies such as Chevron, Husky Energy, Suncor Energy and Statoil have major regional operations in the city. Three major offshore oil developments, Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose, are in production off the coast of the city and a fourth development, Hebron, is expected to be producing oil by 2017.|$|E
5|$|When he played, Bates {{stood at}} , {{something}} that teammates taunted him about: in Milwaukee spring training camp, players threw {{a cap on}} the ground and addressed {{it as if it were}} Bates. During the MLB off-season, he worked as a substitute school teacher in Houston. Before the World Series, Bates raced against an unchained cheetah in a promotional event for the Cincinnati Zoo at Riverfront Stadium. The premise of the event was to show that a cheetah could defeat a human (with a five-second head start) in a 100-yard race. The cheetah was supposed to chase a toy, but about halfway through the race, Bates' hat fell off, and instead, it went after the hat; Bates won the race. In 2000, the University of Texas inducted him into their Men's Athletics Hall of Honor. , Bates lives in Houston and works for an equipment supplier in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>industry.</b> He also coaches his daughter's softball team outside of work.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> incessant <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> {{pipeline}} vandalization (sabotage) {{in developing}} nations like Nigeria has become a thing of serious concern which threatens both human and national security.

Taking only the lifecycle view of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline management cannot fully account for <b>the</b> problem of <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline vandalization (sabotage) since this problem involves certain factors external to <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline.

5|$|Born in Houston, Bates {{attended}} the University of Texas and, in his freshman season, won the 1983 College World Series {{as a part}} of the Texas Longhorns baseball team. For the next two seasons, Bates was named to the College Baseball All-America Team, a team composed of the best collegiate baseball athletes in America. Drafted by Milwaukee in the 4th round of the 1985 MLB draft, he rose through the Brewers' farm system and teams that he played for won multiple minor league titles. He subsequently made his MLB debut in 1989, after Milwaukee starting second baseman became injured. A trade sent Bates to Cincinnati in 1990, where the Reds used him as a pinch runner at the end of the regular season and into the postseason. Facing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series, Bates reached base on a pinch hit single against Dennis Eckersley and later scored the winning run in Game 2, as the Reds ultimately swept the Athletics, four games to none. Following the World Series championship, Bates spent two years in minor league baseball, one for the Reds and one for the Chicago Cubs, and last played exhibition baseball in 1995. After retirement, he worked as an equipment supplier in <b>the</b> <b>oil</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> <b>industry</b> in Houston and coached his daughter's softball team.|$|E
