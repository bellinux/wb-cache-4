5|$|As noted below, such a {{cloud of}} {{collectors}} would alter the light emitted by the star system. However, the disruption compared to a star's overall natural emitted spectrum would most likely be too small for Earth-based astronomers <b>to</b> <b>observe.</b>|$|E
5|$|Currently, astronomers {{know little}} about the shape and size of our galaxy {{relative}} to {{what they know about}} other galaxies; it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> the entire Milky Way from the inside. A good analogy is trying <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> a marching band {{as a member of the}} band. Observing other galaxies is much easier because humans are outside those galaxies. Steven Majewski and his team planned to use SIM Lite to help determine not only the shape and size of the Galaxy but also the distribution of its mass and the motion of its stars.|$|E

40|$|Abstract _ This paper {{compares the}} {{structure}} of three models for estimating future growth in a time series. It is shown that a regression model gives minimum weight <b>to</b> the last <b>observed</b> growth and maximum weight <b>to</b> the <b>observed</b> growth {{in the middle of}} the sample period. A first order integrated ARIMA model, or 1 (1) model, gives uniform weights <b>to</b> all <b>observed</b> growths. Finally, a second order integrated ARIMA model gives maximum weights <b>to</b> the last <b>observed</b> gro~ 1 h and minimum weights <b>to</b> the <b>observed</b> growths at the beginning of the sample period...|$|R
