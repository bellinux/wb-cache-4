5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} into one of three groups by its elimination half-life, or <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since the eclipse limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E

5|$|When on the beach, most of {{them get}} stuck. Those that have {{remained}} too far in the water are dragged onto the beach by putting a hook in their blowhole. When on land, they are killed by cutting down to the major arteries and spinal cord at the neck. The <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a whale to die varies from a few seconds Up to half a minute, depending on the cut. If the locals fail to beach the animals altogether, they are let free again.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E
5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some {{may have an}} allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although {{it is said to}} have a very distinctive taste like that of the king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the genus Crocuta diverged from Hyaena (the genus of striped and brown hyenas) 10 million years ago. The {{ancestors of}} the spotted hyena probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses, which forced them to operate in teams. At one point in their evolution, spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity, {{as is the case}} for brown and striped hyenas, and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers. They began forming increasingly larger territories, necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory, and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan's land. It has been theorised that female dominance in spotted hyena clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills, and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs. Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws, thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females. Its appearance in Europe and China during the Cromerian period coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of Pachycrocuta brevirostris, the giant short-faced hyena. As {{there is no evidence of}} environmental change being responsible, it is likely that the giant short-faced hyena became extinct due to competition with the spotted hyena.|$|E

25|$|Trypsin {{can be used}} {{to break}} down casein in breast milk. If trypsin is added to a {{solution}} of milk powder, the breakdown of casein will cause the milk to become translucent.

25|$|Since some processes, such as gene transcription, involve many {{reactions}} {{and could not}} be correctly modeled as an instantaneous reaction in a single step, it was proposed to model these reactions as single step multiple delayed reactions in order to account for the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the entire process to be complete.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a brood to fully develop is highly {{variable}} and {{is complicated by}} occurrences of nest cannibalism, which is often undetected as replacement eggs appear. Males leave the nest 2–7 days after eclosion. Tenure on the nest for a worker female is more variable. Their residence time ranges from 1–60 days.|$|E
25|$|Distance {{may also}} be {{measured}} {{as a function of}} time. The radar mile is the amount of <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a radar pulse to travel one nautical mile, reflect off a target, and return to the radar antenna. Since a nautical mile is defined as 1,852m, then dividing this distance by the speed of light (299,792,458m/s), and then multiplying the result by 2 yields a result of 12.36μs in duration.|$|E

25|$|Quasi-adiabatic switching, however, {{requires}} that the tunneling barriers of a cell be switched relatively slowly compared to the intrinsic switching speed of a QCA. This prevents ringing and metastable states observed when cells are switched abruptly. Therefore, the switching speed of a QCA is limited not by the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a cell to change polarization, but by the appropriate quasi-adiabatic switching time of the clocks being used.|$|E
25|$|One way {{to obtain}} a {{distance}} measurement {{is based on the}} time-of-flight: transmit a short pulse of radio signal (electromagnetic radiation) and measure the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the reflection to return. The distance is one-half the product of the round trip time (because the signal has to travel to the target and then back to the receiver) and the speed of the signal. Since radio waves travel at the speed of light, accurate distance measurement requires high-speed electronics.|$|E
25|$|The sight {{distance}} {{needed for a}} given situation is the distance travelled during the two phases of a driving maneuver: perception-reaction time (PRT), and maneuver time (MT). Perception-reaction time is the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> a road user to realize that a reaction is needed to a road condition, decided what maneuver is appropriate, and start the maneuver. Maneuver time is {{the time it takes}} to complete the maneuver. The distance driven during perception-reaction time and maneuver time is the {{sight distance}} needed.|$|E
50|$|Albert's swarm was {{an immense}} {{concentration}} of the Rocky Mountain locust that in 1875 swarmed the Western United States.

50|$|There is {{a serious}} {{practical}} problem with this approach - {{in order to measure}} the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>for</b> the signals to reach the receiver, the receiver must know the precise time that the signal was originally sent.

25|$|Sound is {{transmitted}} about 4.3 times faster in water (1,484m/s in fresh water) {{as it is}} in air (343m/s). The human brain can determine the direction of sound in air by detecting small differences in the <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> sound waves in air to reach each of the two ears. For these reasons divers find it difficult to determine the direction of sound underwater. However, some animals have adapted to this difference and many use sound to navigate underwater.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} each period is {{determined}} by the rate of change and the required change in gain. For more intuitive operation, a compressor's attack and release controls are labeled as a unit of time (often milliseconds). This is the amount of <b>time</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>for</b> the gain to change a set amount of dB, decided by the manufacturer—often 10dB. For example, if the compressor's time constants are referenced to 10dB, and the attack time is set to 1ms, it takes 1ms for the gain to decrease by 10dB, and 2ms to decrease by 20dB.|$|E
