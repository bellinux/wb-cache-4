500|$|The Curtis-Wright reactor was {{dismantled}} and its fuel {{returned to}} the AEC. Martin Company, which soon became Martin Marietta, leased the hot cells, intending to use them {{in the manufacture of}} small radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Curtiss-Wright warned Penn State [...] "that the radiation involved in Martin's operations would be 'extremely high' and of a type that posed a particular risk to human health", but Curtiss-Wright itself had left both solid and liquid radioactive waste in the facility. Some of the Curtiss-Wright waste was contaminated with toxic beryllium oxide. Penn State had acquired the reactor license, and with it came legal responsibility for the nuclear waste on the site; its plan with the AEC called for the release of 90percent of the liquid radioactive waste into the environment and the burial of most radioactive solids on site. Items coated with beryllium oxide dust [...] "were covered in plastic and buried out in the woods", where some were unearthed by black bears and white-tailed deer. Once jet engine testing stopped, the bunkers at the <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> were used [...] "to store hazardous and explosive material".|$|E
500|$|The state {{constructed}} $1.6million {{of roads}} to the area; the Quehanna Highway {{was built on}} parts of an old CCC road, which followed an earlier logging railroad grade. Pennsylvania also canceled 212camp site leases to help ensure security for the installation. Curtiss-Wright built three facilities on its land. The first was a nuclear research center with a nuclear reactor and six shielded radiation containment chambers for handling radioactive isotopes, referred to as hot cells, {{at the end of}} Reactor Road. The second was for jet engine trials, and had two <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> with bunkers just north of Quehanna Highway, about [...] apart. The northern test cell {{was at the center of}} the 16-sided polygon; even if a jet engine broke its moorings, it could not leave the polygonal area. Both of these were on the land which Curtiss-Wright had purchased, which was a regular octagon surrounded with a [...] fence built by forest rangers, supervised from three guard houses on Quehanna Highway and Wykoff Run Road. The third installation was an industrial complex at the southeast edge of the polygon, in Karthaus Township, on the Quehanna Highway. At this site, a Curtiss-Wright division manufactured Curon foam for furniture and household products and used beryllium oxide to make high-temperature ceramics for application in the nuclear industry.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, {{no one in}} {{the company}} had any direct {{experience}} with fuel cells, and Ballard himself reputedly stated [...] "What's a fuel cell?" [...] when the topic was first brought up. Prater, with an extensive electrochemical background, [...] flew to the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, where limited PEM research was still being carried out. He managed to gather a small number of parts from <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> that would provide an early start. Meanwhile, Ballard sent teams to Ottawa to better understand the contract. Armed with this information from both sources, they won the $500,000 contract, which called for them to provide three prototype cells that produced between 50 and 150 watts and be ready in 28 months. After meeting the requirements, they won a follow-up contract, and it was during this project, in 1986, when they reached a milestone of producing four times as much energy per unit volume as any previous fuel cell.|$|E
50|$|Atec has {{designed}} and manufactured many modular turbine <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> for APU, turboshaft, and turbojet engines. Notably, Atec designed and fielded 2 modular, regenerative turboshaft <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> for Rolls-Royce. These <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> were {{developed for the}} M250 engine and were tailored to Rolls-Royce’s Indianapolis production facility. Typical turboshaft <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> often utilize a water brake or other type of dynamometer to place a load on the engine, absorbing (and wasting) the produced energy. The Atec <b>test</b> <b>cells</b> use 500 hp electric generators to convert the rotational energy of the turboshaft into electrical energy. This allows Rolls-Royce to power the engine facility and sell excess generated power back to the Electric utility. Other electric regen system installations include those for Bell and Bristow.|$|E

40|$|The {{assembly}} and tack welding of jet engine turbine exhaust cases (TEC) {{is a complex}} and time consuming operation currently performed manually at Volvo Aero Norway. The assembly tolerances are very tight with a maximum alignment offset of 0. 7 mm. The company wants to investigate the possibility ofa complete or partial automation of this process. A <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> developed for studying the possibility of automating the {{assembly and}} tack welding operations of TEC components is presented. The <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> assembles TEC components using a control algorithm that combines high accuracy sensor measurements with an iterative stepwise alignment process performed bya robot. This <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> has been physically implemented and used for verifying the developed methodology. The equipment used in the <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> is specified in the thesis. The <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> consists of two industrial robots, fixtures and a high accuracy laser sensor. The laser sensor is mounted on the tool flange of one robot; the other robot is fitted with a specially designed gripper for performing the adjustment operation. A modular fixture system has also been developed focusing on flexibility and simplicity. A developed control algorithm that coordinates the different operations performed by {{the elements of the}} <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> is presented. This control algorithm is implemented using the Python programming language; the implementation is described in detail. The <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> assembly operation is based on the alignment of certain points on the components such that the offset is within tolerances. The iterative stepwise alignment process is described, including an operation for orienting the sensor for minimizing the offset measurement error. Once the points are aligned, the <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> simulates the tack welding operation. Multiple tests have been performed in order to verify the <b>test</b> <b>cell’s</b> capability of aligning the components within tolerances. These tests have shown positive results for assessment of the automation of the current process. To conclude, this thesis describes the developed <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> in detail. This includes the equipment used, the developed control algorithm, as well as multiple tests which confirm the <b>test</b> <b>cell’s</b> capability of aligningthe TEC components within tolerances. A valid methodology for robotic tack welding is also presented. Different studies for further development of the automation are finally proposed. </p...|$|R

40|$|A long-channel {{membrane}} <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> (LCMTC) {{with the}} same length as full-scale elements was developed to simulate performance and fouling in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis spiral-wound membrane modules (SWMs). The transparent LCMTC enabled simultaneous monitoring of SWM performance indicators: feed channel pressure drop, permeate flux and salt passage. Both permeate flux and salt passage were monitored over five sections of the <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> and {{were related to the}} amount and composition of the accumulated foulant in these five sections, illustrating the unique features of the <b>test</b> <b>cell.</b> Validation experiments at various feed pressures showed the same flow profile and the same hydraulic behaviour as SWMs used in practice, confirming the representativeness and suitability of the <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> to study SWM operation and fouling. The importance to apply feed spacers matching the flow channel height in <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> systems was demonstrated. Biofouling studies showed that the dosage of a biodegradable substrate to the feed of the LCMTC accelerated the gradual decrease of membrane performance and the accumulation of biomass on the spacer and membrane sheets.

40|$|Tritium and {{deuterium}} {{are expected}} to be the fuel for the first fusion power reactors. Being radioactive, tritium is a health, safety and environment concern. Room air tritium clean systems can be used to handle tritium that has been lost to the room from primary or secondary containment. Such a system called the Experimental Tritium Cleanup (ETC) systems is installed at the Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The ETC consists of (1) two compressors which draw air from the room, (2) a catalyst bed for conversion of tritium to tritiated water, and (3) molecular sieve beds for collection of the water. The exhaust from this system can be returned to the room or vented to the stack. As part of the US/Japan fusion collaboration, on two separate occasions, tritium was released into the 3000 m 3 TSTA <b>test</b> <b>cell,</b> and the ETC was used to handle these releases. Each release consisted of about one Curie of tritium. Tritium concentrations in the room were monitored at numerous locations. Also recorded were the HT and HTO concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the catalyst bed. Tritium surface concentrations in the <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> were measured before and at a series of times after the releases. Surfaces included normal <b>test</b> <b>cell</b> equipment as well as idealized test specimens.
