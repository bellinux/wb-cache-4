5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the USSR {{had built up}} a {{military}} arsenal and army surpassing <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military. This buildup was accelerated by the Reagan administration, which increased the military spending from 5.3 percent of GNP in 1981 to 6.5 percent in 1986, the largest peacetime defense buildup in United States history.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, more Arabian horses, mostly of Crabbet bloodlines, arrived in Australia. The first Arabians of Polish {{breeding}} arrived in 1966, and Egyptian lines were first imported in 1970. Arabian horses {{from the rest}} of the world followed, and today the Australian Arabian horse registry is the second largest in the world, next to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of 2007, the brewing {{industry}} is a global business, consisting of several dominant multinational companies and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to regional breweries. As of 2006, more than 133 billion litres (35 billion gallons), {{the equivalent of a}} cube 510 metres on a side, of beer are sold per year, producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion). In 2010, China's beer consumption hit 450 million hectolitres (45 billion litres), or nearly twice <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> but only 5 per cent sold were premium draught beers, compared with 50 per cent in France and Germany.|$|E

5|$|Tensions between Britain and the United States {{escalated}} {{again during}} the Napoleonic Wars, as Britain tried to cut off American trade with France and boarded American ships to impress men into the Royal Navy. The US declared war, the War of 1812, and invaded Canadian territory. In response Britain invaded the US, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, ensuring Canada's future would be separate from <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Abwehr {{was also}} active in Ireland. German {{intelligence}} operations effectively ended in September 1941 when police made arrests {{on the basis}} of surveillance carried out on the key diplomatic legations in Dublin, including <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence. With a regular army of only slightly over seven thousand men {{at the start of the}} war, and with limited supplies of modern weapons, the state would have had great difficulty in defending itself from invasion from either side in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{government}} secretly {{returned the}} unprofitable Louisiana territory to France in October 1800 in the Treaty of San Ildefonso. The Spanish officially transferred control in October 1802; however, Spanish administrators remained {{in charge of}} St. Louis throughout the time of French ownership. Shortly afterward, a team of American negotiators purchased Louisiana, including St. Louis. On March 8 or 9, 1804, the flag of Spain was lowered at the government buildings in St. Louis and, according to local tradition, the flag of France was raised. On March 10, 1804, the French flag was replaced by <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E

5|$|The battle {{lasted about}} two hours and Harrison lost 62 men (37 killed in action and 25 mortally wounded); about 126 were less seriously hurt. The Yellow Jackets {{suffered}} the highest casualties of the battle, with 30% of their numbers killed or wounded. The number of Native American casualties is still the subject of debate, but it was certainly lower than <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> forces. Historians estimate {{that as many as}} 50 were killed and about 70–80 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers report, India's GDP at {{purchasing}} power parity could overtake <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> by 2045. During {{the next four}} decades, Indian GDP {{is expected to grow}} at an annualised average of 8%, making it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until 2050. The report highlights key growth factors: a young and rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by a rapidly growing middle class. The World Bank cautions that, for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to focus on public sector reform, transport infrastructure, agricultural and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education, energy security, and public health and nutrition.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, British {{alternative}} {{rock was}} distinguished from <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> early on {{by a more}} pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US. Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, and Annie Nightingale. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.|$|E
50|$|Equipment, capabilities, {{and combat}} {{performance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IRIAF strongly influenced <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iraqi Air Force (IQAF), during the 1980s, but also <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Arab Emirates Air Force, in the 1990s {{and the most}} recent times.|$|R

25|$|Lastly, {{there was}} the {{international}} question: <b>the</b> rival ambitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German powers involved, and beyond them <b>the</b> interests <b>of</b> other European states, notably <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom in preventing <b>the</b> rise <b>of</b> a German sea-power in the north.|$|R

500|$|France too {{has shown}} its anger at its downgrade. French central bank chief Christian Noyer criticised <b>the</b> {{decision}} <b>of</b> Standard & Poor's to lower <b>the</b> rating <b>of</b> France but not <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom, which [...] "has more deficits, as much debt, more inflation, less growth than us".|$|R
50|$|During the Empire {{industrial}} production increased by 73 percent, growing twice {{as rapidly as}} <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom, though its total output remained lower. From 1850 to 1857, the French economy grew at a pace of five percent a year, and exports grew by sixty percent between 1855 and 1869.|$|R
50|$|CAEs were {{designed}} to complement universities, forming a binary system modelled on <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom.

That alone makes the charge of genocide--i.e., intentional destruction of a whole people--rather grotesque.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of natural Christmas trees in Canada developed similarly to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Into the 1930s nearly all Canadian Christmas trees were harvested from native stands within local forests.

25|$|Chile's {{judiciary}} {{is independent}} {{and includes a}} court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the Supreme Court of Chile. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system. The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E
50|$|During {{the decade}} prior to World War I, the German Merchant Marine {{had grown to}} a size only second to <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom. Not only the vessels themselves, proudly bearing three or four funnels, but even the cargoes and the passenger, were {{depicted}} in order to publicize the various shipping lines.

2500|$|Aided {{by these}} projects, the French economy {{recorded}} growth rates unrivalled since the 19th century.
