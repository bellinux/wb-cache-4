5|$|Another {{story of}} the poem's origin claimed that Helmer's funeral was held {{on the morning of}} May 2, after which McCrae wrote <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> in 20 minutes. A third claim, by Morrison, was that McCrae worked on <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> as time allowed between arrivals of wounded {{soldiers}} in need of medical attention. Regardless of its true origin, McCrae worked on <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> for months before considering it ready for publication. He submitted it to The Spectator in London but it was rejected. It was then sent to Punch, where it was published on December 8, 1915. It was published anonymously, but Punch attributed <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> to McCrae in its year-end index.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHaving the {{students}} do the studies related to phonetics and semantics on the couplets of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> is significant to diagnose their emotions. If the sudents can comprehend the phoneme and semantic relations truly, they will perceive {{the feelings of}} <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> correctly. In <b>the</b> traditional poetry teaching, we used to recite <b>the</b> <b>poems,</b> find <b>the</b> meaning of the unknown words, explain and comment the lines of poetry. However {{the students}} should work on phonetics-semantics relations suitable for the constructive approach so as to comprehend <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> accurately. Through <b>the</b> teaching related to phonetics-semantics, the students {{will be able to}} realize the contributions {{of the value of the}} sound to the rhythm, music and meaning of <b>the</b> <b>poems.</b> By this way they will perceive the feelings of the poet and appropriate and enjoy <b>the</b> <b>poems.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> cannot be appropriated, they have no meaning in the students’ minds. Therefore, teaching the relation between phonetics-semantics is very crucial in Turkish and Turkish Literature classes...|$|R
5|$|Coleridge {{began writing}} The Eolian Harp on 20 August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. Like his previous poem Lines Written at Shurton Bars, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> discusses both his engagement and his future marriage. Coleridge {{was inspired to}} write <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> after {{a visit to a}} house in Clevedon that would serve as his and Fricker's home after their marriage. As Coleridge worked on <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> he and Fricker were married and they moved to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of his life with Fricker, and these thoughts work their way into <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The Eolian Harp was his favourite.|$|E
5|$|Divided {{into five}} stanzas of ten lines each, the ode {{contains}} a narrator's discourse {{on a series}} of designs on a Grecian urn. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> focuses on two scenes: one in which a lover eternally pursues a beloved without fulfilment, and another of villagers about to perform a sacrifice. The final lines of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> declare that beauty is truth, truth beauty,' – that is all / Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know", and literary critics have debated whether they increase or diminish the overall beauty of <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> Critics have focused on other aspects of <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> including the role of the narrator, the inspirational qualities of real-world objects, and the paradoxical relationship between the poem's world and reality.|$|E
5|$|From 1350 to 1400—the {{period in}} which <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> {{is thought to have}} been written—Wales {{experienced}} several raids {{at the hands of the}} English, who were attempting to colonise the area. The Gawain poet uses a North West Midlands dialect common on the Welsh–English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> through the lens of postcolonialism, and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b>|$|E

By July, he was able to complete <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> and in October <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> was edited and ready for publication. John Rickman served as Southey's agent in selling the book. Although finished, Southey continued to work on fixing the end of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> until January 1801 after receiving suggestions from his friends. After Portugal went to war with France and Spain, Southey left the country and he returned to England in June 1801. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> was published in 1801 by Longman with 1,000 copies, but only sold half by 1804.

5|$|In {{describing}} the narrator's analysis of his surroundings, Gray employed John Locke's {{philosophy of the}} sensations, which argued that the senses were the origin of ideas. Information described {{in the beginning of}} <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is reused by the narrator as he contemplates life near the end. The description of death and obscurity adopts Locke's political philosophy as it emphasises the inevitability and finality of death. The end of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is connected to Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding in that the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> deals with the senses and the ending describes how we are limited in our ability to understand the world. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> takes the ideas and transforms them into a discussion of blissful ignorance by adopting Locke's resolution to be content with our limited understanding. Unlike Locke, the narrator of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> knows that he is unable to fathom the universe, but still questions the matter.|$|E
5|$|Koch himself {{believes}} that a considerable part of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> can be dated to the 6th century.

5|$|Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement is a poem {{written by}} English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1796. Like his earlier poem The Eolian Harp, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> {{discusses}} Coleridge's understanding {{of nature and}} his married life, which was suffering from problems that developed after the previous poem. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> focuses on humanity's relationship with nature in its various aspects ranging from experiencing an Edenic state to having to abandon a unity with nature {{in order to fulfill}} a moral obligation to humanity. The discussion of man's obligation to each other leads into a discussion on the difference between the life of a philosopher and the life of a poet. By the end of <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> the narrator follows the philosophical path {{in a manner similar to}} what Coleridge sought to do.

5|$|The central {{discussion}} within <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> is on {{the nature}} of time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and to {{know that there is a}} universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> However, others complained that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b>|$|E
5|$|The opening {{lines of}} <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> contain a {{dedication}} to Miles de Nanteuil, an early 13th-century churchman {{who was elected}} (but not confirmed) in 1201 as archbishop of Reims, and later became bishop of Beauvais, in northern France; he died circa 1235. According to Todd, the nobleman de Nanteuil {{may have been too}} young and wild to be elevated to the , but this would have made him a good candidate for Renart's dedication. This, plus evidence based on other names found in <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> led Todd to conclude that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> was composed around the year 1200. Later critics and researchers, however, date <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> between 1204 and 1228, and tend toward the earlier date.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>poem</b> is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. <b>The</b> <b>poem</b> argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of <b>the</b> <b>poem,</b> Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, but the final version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>poems</b> in this {{collection}} are poems of discovery and explanation. They are the recordings and insights {{of what it means}} to be a young male in the North American Midwest in the year 1992. Some are memories of what was or what should have been. Some of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> are attempts to give meaning to what is, or more importantly, to give meaning to the "who" that is becoming. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> deal with opposing tensions, especially between society and the individual, and between knowing and the unknown. In almost all <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> there are two forces pulling at the narrator, and there is an axis between the poles which must remain balanced. The need for balance becomes a central element because of the narrative influence in <b>the</b> <b>poems.</b> They represent a coming of age and contain the myriad viewpoints struggling for recognition at such a time. Some of <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> seem to detail this process; others seem to be results of it. In either case, <b>the</b> <b>poems</b> try to capture the emotive and cognitive quality of a moment. The frequent tension between the conflicting emotive and analytical qualities often results in an ambiguity in <b>the</b> <b>poems.</b> This collection is not so much a finished piece of work as a still continuing process.

After many victories, <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> ends with Charles crowned King of France. Joan of Arc serves {{as a way for}} Southey to express his views on history and on politics; these include his republican ideals, his claims that political tyranny was a common element in Europe, and his opposition to Christian practices that he thought were superstitious. Later editions of <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> shifted from a promotion of a deistic view of religion to a more traditional view. Critics gave the work mixed reviews, with some emphasising the quality of the images and themes of <b>the</b> <b>poem.</b> However, others believed that <b>the</b> <b>poem</b> lacked merit and some believed that the subject matter was inappropriate to the time.
