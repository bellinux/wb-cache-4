Sa'd al-Dawla himself oscillated between the Fatimids and Byzantium: {{on the one hand}} he resented Byzantine overlordship and was willing to acknowledge the Fatimid Caliph, {{but on the other hand}} he did not want to see his domain become merely another Fatimid province like southern Syria. His first attempt to shake free of the Byzantine protectorate, in 981, thus ended in failure due to lack of outside support, when a Byzantine army appeared before Aleppo's walls to enforce compliance. The Fatimids now induced Bakjur to act, and in September 983, the latter launched an attack on Aleppo with the support of Fatimid troops. Sa'd al-Dawla was forced to appeal to the Byzantine emperor Basil II for help, and the siege was raised by a Byzantine army under Bardas Phokas the Younger. The Byzantines then proceeded to sack Homs in October. The city was returned to Hamdanid control, while Bakjur fled to Fatimid territory, where he assumed the governorship of Damascus. It is an indication of the strained relations between Sa'd al-Dawla and his [...] "saviours" [...] that after Bakjur's flight, there were clashes between Byzantine and Hamdanid troops, which were settled only when the Hamdanid emir agreed to pay twice the usual yearly amount of tribute of 20,000 gold dinars.|$|E

The arc control on the contacts is critical for successful current interruption (103 104 A) in low voltage (250 V) devices. Previous work has shown how arc root commutation from the contact region into the arc chamber is affected by arc chamber materials, contact materials and the gap behind the moving contact for contact velocities between 1 ms 1 and 10 ms 1. This work is extended using a commercially available piezoelectric actuator <b>to</b> <b>open</b> the <b>contacts.</b> Contact opening speeds are assessed and the arc root mobility is characterized under this operating regime. A flexible test apparatus and solid-state high-speed arc imaging system are used to gather data on the arc root during {{the opening of the}} contacts. New experimental results are presented on the anode and cathode root velocity and arc root motion in an arc chamber with piezoelectrically actuated contact opening.
