He also made improvements to the chamber. The first example of this design, nicknamed [...] "Old Number One", is currently {{on display at the}} Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Emerson continued to make improvements to the iron lung, adding a quick opening and closing function, an improved pressure gauge, and emergency hand operation. His final improvement was the addition of a <b>transparent</b> <b>positive</b> pressure dome, allowing ventilation when the chamber was opened to care for the patient.|$|E
50|$|The first {{widely used}} method of color {{photography}} was the Autochrome plate, a process inventors and brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière {{began working on}} in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907. It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together {{in the eye and}} produce the same additive color synthesis as the filtered projection of three separate photographs. Autochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then {{through the use of a}} rolling press, five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged together. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance silver bromide after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, reversal processing was used to develop each plate into a <b>transparent</b> <b>positive</b> that could be viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed. Another drawback was that the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to compare and contrast, photographically, the {{crystallization}} properties of naturally occurring sandstone cements, such as calcite and quartz, with sandstone cements produced in the laboratory, such as table salt, table sugar, Dekton photographic developer, Photoflow, and rochelle salt. These substances were chosen for three major reason: 1) obtainability, 2) rapid crystallization, 3) variance of crystal forms and properties. The pictures of the laboratory-created sandstones will be, in final form, <b>transparent</b> <b>positives</b> (slide photomicrographs) {{that can be easily}} enlarged by projection and readily compared with slides of natural cements in sandstones. Along with the slides, black and white photos will be provided for comparison with black and white text material collected during the initial research. The reason for this research is the need {{for the development of a}} sandstone prepared in the laboratory that can be reproduced easily and rapidly for the study of properties in naturally formed sandstones that can take thousands of years to develop. Obviously, a researcher cannot observe the development of a sandstone cement for such an extended length of time; thus, this project’s aim is to find process to be observed and analyzed "in situ"� within the laboratory.

40|$|Organic {{electronic}} devices are receiving growing interest {{because of their}} potential to employ lightweight, low-cost materials in a flexible architecture. Typically, indium tin oxide (ITO) is utilized as the <b>transparent</b> <b>positive</b> electrode in these devices due to its combination of high transmission in the visible spectrum and high electrical conductivity. However, ITO may ultimately hinder the full market integration of organic electronics due to its increasing cost, the limited availability of indium, lack of mechanical flexibility, and sustainability {{with regards to the}} environment and material utilization. Therefore, alternatives for ITO in organic electronics are currently being pursued. Transparent electrodes comprised of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are an appealing choice as a surrogate because of the extraordinary electrical and mechanical properties these 1 -D structures posses. As such, the research presented in this dissertation has been conducted to advance the goal of manufacturing SWNT networks with transparent electrode properties that meet or exceed those of ITO. To this end, SWNT films were characterized with regard to the collective and individual optoelectronic properties of the SWNTs that comprise the network. Specifically, corroborative theoretical and experimental observations were employed to expand the understanding of how the optoelectronic properties of polydisperse and monodisperse SWNT networks are enhanced and sustained through chemical treatment and subsequent processing. In addition, the impact of interfacial electrical contact resistance between SWNT electrodes and metallic fingers often used in photovoltaic system applications was elucidated. In summary, the research presented in this dissertation can be leveraged with present state of the art in SWNT films to facilitate future SWNT electrode development. Ph. D.

5000|$|Miethe was the {{designer}} {{of a camera}} for color photography, the first photographic product made by the Berlin cabinetmaker Wilhelm Bermpohl. Introduced {{to the public in}} 1903, it produced sets of three separate black-and-white images on glass plates by making a series of three photographs of the subject through red, green and blue color fliters, a method of color photography first proposed by James Clerk Maxwell. These were used to reconstitute the full original range of color by projecting <b>transparent</b> <b>positives</b> made from them through similar filters and exactly superimposing the images on the projection screen (additive color), or by making three prints consisting of transparent pigment or dye images in the complementary colors and superimposing those to make a single full-color transparency or print on paper (subtractive color). They were also used to prepare printing plates for illustrating books, periodicals and other mechanically printed media, the only form in which early color photographs were likely to be seen by the general public. There were a number of technical issues with the system, including the relatively long time required to make each sequence of three exposures and the difficulty of correctly balancing them to obtain accurate color values under different lighting conditions. In 1901, Miethe had introduced [...] "Ethyl Red", a sensitizing dye that greatly improved the characteristics of panchromatically sensitized photographic emulsions, which in turn obviated the very long exposures previously needed to photograph red-filtered images, simplified color filter design, and generally cleared the path for future progress. Miethe's innovations provided the technological foundation used by such photographic pioneers as the Russian Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky, who studied with Miethe for several weeks in 1902.|$|R

40|$|A {{growing area}} of {{research}} into rebound effects from increased energy efficiency involves application of demand-driven input-output models to consider indirect energy consumption effects associated with re-spending decisions by households with reduced energy spending requirements. However, {{there is often a}} lack of clarity in applied studies as to how indirect effects involving energy use and/or carbon emissions in supply chains of both energy and non-energy goods and services have been calculated. We propose that more transparency for policymakers may be introduced by replacing consideration of what are often referred to as ‘indirect rebound’ effects with a simple carbon saving multiplier metric. We illustrate using results from a demand-driven input-output model that tracks supply chain activity at national and/or global level.

40|$|In 1844, Mormon Church leader Joseph Smith {{and others}} acted against disparaging media {{coverage}} by destroying {{the printing press}} of the Nauvoo Expositor. Today, the Church reacts differently to disparaging media such as purchasing full-page ads in the playbills of the controversial Broadway musical, “The Book of Mormon;” telling viewers {{now that they have}} seen the musical, they should read the book, because the book is always better. The ads include an offer for a free Book of Mormon. Clearly something has changed. This paper demonstrates that the Mormon cartoon books of Calvin Grondahl and Pat Bagley, published from 1978 to 1987, {{had a significant impact on}} the general membership of the Church and were influential in changing the Church 2 ̆ 7 s negative, guarded stance to a more <b>positive,</b> <b>transparent</b> one which is manifest in the Church 2 ̆ 7 s recent approach to dealing with disparaging media coverage.

40|$|Chinese {{relative}} clauses (RCs) have {{word order}} properties that are distinctly rare across languages of the world; such properties {{provide a good}} testing ground to tease apart predictions regarding the relative complexity of subject and object RCs in acquisition and processing. This study considers these special word order properties in a multilingual acquisition context, examining how Cantonese(L 1) -English(L 2) -Mandarin(L 3) trilingual children process RCs in two Chinese languages differing in exposure conditions. Studying in an English immersion international school, these trilinguals are also under intensive exposure to English. Comparisons of the trilinguals with their monolingual counterparts are made {{with a focus on}} the directionality of cross-linguistic influence. The study considers how various factors such as language exposure, structural overlaps in the target languages, typological distance, and language dominance can account for the linguistic abilities and vulnerabilities exhibited by a group of children in a trilingual acquisition context. Twenty-one trilingual 5 - to 6 -year-olds completed tests of subject- and object- RC comprehension in all three languages. Twenty-four age-matched Cantonese monolinguals and 24 age-matched Mandarin monolinguals served as comparison groups. Despite limited exposure to Mandarin, the trilinguals performed comparable to the monolinguals. Their Cantonese performance uniquely predicts their Mandarin performance, suggesting positive transfer from L 1 Cantonese to L 3 Mandarin. In Cantonese, however, despite extensive exposure from birth, the trilinguals comprehended object RCs significantly worse than the monolinguals. Error analyses suggested an English-based head-initial analysis, implying negative transfer from L 2 English to L 1 Cantonese. Overall, we identified a specific case of bi-directional influence between the first and second/third languages. The trilinguals experience facilitation in processing Mandarin RCs, because parallels and overlaps in both form and function provide a <b>transparent</b> basis for <b>positive</b> transfer from L 1 Cantonese to L 3 Mandarin. On the other hand, they experience more difficulty in processing object RCs in Cantonese compared to their monolingual peers, because structural overlaps with competing structures from English plus intensive exposure to English lead to negative transfer from L 2 English to L 1 Cantonese.

Due to federal and state mandates, educators are challenged to ensure that all students succeed as defined by scoring "proficient" on California Standards Tests (CST) in language arts and math. So why are some schools succeeding and others failing? The main research question which guided this research was: In the implementation of standards-based reform, what is the leadership role of the principal in building school capacity and accountability to sustain student academic growth? To guide the research, the following four sub-questions included: A. How has the leadership role of the principal changed with the implementation of standards-based reform? B. How has the principal empowered teachers in the implementation of standards-based reform and the decision-making process? C. How does the principal hold individuals accountable for implementing standards-based reform to improve and sustain student academic growth? D. How does the principal build school capacity to sustain student academic growth in the following five areas? a. teachers' knowledge, skills, and dispositions; b. professional community; c. program coherence; d. technical resources; e. principal leadership.; A qualitative case study of McGarvin Intermediate School located in the Garden Grove Unified School District, who is considered a high poverty high achieving school and has sustained an Academic Performance Index (API) above the state requirement of 800 for two consecutive years was studied in-depth. Data collection included a total of 15 participants including one principal, nine teachers (one from every department), three support staff, and two parents. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted over a two month period. In addition, classroom observations, campus observations, document review, faculty and leadership meetings were observed.; Three major findings emerged from this study: 1. The principal has used a combination of leadership styles and has created a unique leadership style through her background, training, and experience at the district level and her directness in monitoring and evaluating teacher and student performance. The researcher describes this unique direct leadership as holding individuals accountable for meeting clearly defined expectations, focusing on standards-based instruction, and providing specific support for those individuals not meeting expectations or standards. 2. The principal empowers teachers through <b>transparent</b> communication, <b>positive</b> relationships, and collaborative decision-making. In this study, teachers report the principal openly discusses information, shares her "bottom line" on where she stands on issues, and "buffers" teachers from unnecessary tasks that distract from the goal of student success. Further, the principal maintains a laser-like focus on instruction and does not let anything or anyone take her school or teachers away from the vision of success for all. 3. The principal has successfully built school capacity using the Building School Capacity Model described by Newmann, King & Youngs (2000) to sustain student academic growth and hold individuals accountable for improved student achievement. Specifically, the findings suggest the principal has established program coherence at McGarvin, through the coordination of school programs, collegial collaboration, targeted intervention programs, and promoting co-curricular/elective programs to support student success.; The principal is a visionary, instructional, transformational leader who uses a unique direct leadership style to build school capacity and accountability to sustain student academic growth. [...] This study recommends further research of successful principal leadership in high poverty high achieving schools, and the principal's perceived role as an instructional leader. Additional exploration in principal background, training, experience, including district level experience, and principal hiring practices from the superintendent's perspective warrant further study. Lastly, future research should consider examining the sustainability of student academic growth after the current principal leaves and the school is under new leadership...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the failure}} of {{top-down}} centralised management approaches to natural resources, attention has shifted {{in the last two}} decades to participatory approaches. Unfortunately, participatory resource management projects have produced disappointing results. They have failed to meet the objectives of enhancing sustainable management of resources and of improving the well-being of local people. These efforts have recently been criticized by environmental conservationists, who continue to believe that participation by local people has resulted in increased degradation and loss of biodiversity. Proponents of participation however take the option of reverting back to top-down management approaches as ‘reinventing the square wheel’ since top-down approaches have an even worse record in resource management. The proponents of participation, therefore, call for alternative approaches that combine improvements of both human well-being and the status of natural resources. It is against this background - a conviction that community participation must be the way forward, despite a number of failed participatory initiatives - that the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) initiated in 1999 a multi-country, multi-site Adaptive Collaborative Management (ACM) project. The starting point of the ACM approach is that sustainable resource management can only be achieved if local people participate in the utilisation and management of those resources. The approach makes use of various theories and concepts from several disciplines including complex systems theory, adaptive management, social learning, cooperation and competition, and theories of human interaction. The ACM project was implemented in Mafungautsi in Zimbabwe forest by a multi-disciplinary team of researchers from 1999 to 2003, and aimed to strengthen an on-going Resource Sharing Project that began in 1994. This thesis documents and critically analyses the interventions facilitated by the ACM team and their outcomes. It also traces these outcomes to check if they were sustained or not, and why. Evidence presented in Chapter 4 shows some of the complexities encountered in implementing the ACM approach. Several activities and processes were initiated simultaneously in the different sites. ACM researchers facilitated stakeholders to go use Participatory Action Research (PAR) processes to deal with their problems and learn from the impacts of their actions, they, too, had to learn by doing. Through context studies the team realised a number of issues had to be addressed at the outset. The context studies revealed a range of issues to be addressed if stakeholders were effectively to participate in the PAR process. These included numerous conflicts among stakeholders at various levels, unequal distribution of power, misunderstandings, passiveness of local community members in issues related to the management of the forest, the fact that not all stakeholders in local communities were interested in all resources in the forest, and finally weak leadership skills among stakeholders. The ACM team therefore developed several interventions to resolve conflicts and build stakeholder capacities before the PAR process could progress. These interventions included empowerment training workshops, conflict resolution workshops, training on leadership skills and finally the formation of the resource user groups. Implementing these interventions took considerable amounts of time. PAR processes were later initiated with various resource user groups. Stakeholders at a range of scales, including resource user groups, resource management committees, and FC officers and researchers, were included in processes to develop visions and implement action plans. The process however was not so neat in all cases and some of the action plans were never implemented. Opportunities were created for stakeholders to share experiences, and learn together. The team also facilitated the development of a collaborative monitoring system to help stakeholders learn about the impact of their actions. The process for doing this was time consuming since several relevant stakeholders had to participate in the process. The CM system was initially not welcomed by all resource users. Follow up studies showed that stakeholders in various RMC areas did not implement all the aspects of the CM system but chose only certain aspects. The development of a plot system in Gababe to monitor the quality of the grass resource as well as resolve problems related to favouritism in allocation of resource harvesting areas was an interesting outcome. The CM system however in some cases (like in the Batanai area) collapsed due to political factors at play. The interventions by the ACM team resulted in some positive outcomes including the empowerment of local communities, some improvement in incomes obtained through value addition and seeking alternative markets, improvement in stakeholders’ knowledge about their forest resources through their monitoring activities and the use of sustainable harvesting methods. However, a follow-up study four years after the project ended showed that these positive developments were not sustained. The ACM team also aimed to influence resource management institutions and Chapter 5 traces how the Resource Management Committees (RMC) transformed over time. The chapter shows that the RMCs (especially the one in Gababe) over time, with capacity building on both the RMCs and local communities transformed into downwardly accountable and <b>transparent</b> organisations. The <b>positive</b> change was however short-lived, when the FC officer died. A follow up study four years later showed that, the RMCs were no longer accountable to their communities and several conflicts were now present among stakeholders. These were simply ignored. In trying to understand why things turned out this way, I address one central question – to what extent was failure a result of misconceptualization and misapplication of the participatory approach, as distinct from being a product of the general rapidly declining socio-economic conditions in the country? Although from a superficial analysis one can conclude that wider events in the country finished off a beautiful initiative in its infancy, I argue that the initiative would have failed anyway even if the environment had not changed. I identify key factors that would have led to {{the failure of}} the project. First, the overestimation of what the ACM team could do given the limited period and the complexity of the situation in Mafungautsi. Second, the ACM team did not address issues of power and its unequal distribution. Third, the ACM team did not facilitate the development of clear rules and their means of enforcement to support management activities. Fourth, the ACM team paid insufficient attention to the conflicting needs of local resource users, and finally, the team left the future work with an underfunded and understaffed organisation. I conclude that if ACM and other learning-based participatory resource management initiatives are to succeed, they must empower the poor and marginalised and explicitly address issues of power and politics. Joint learning processes should not be taken as a panacea but must integrate elements from other disciplines such as political ecology. Such projects should also ensure that clear rules for management and use of resources are agreed upon as well as their means of enforcement...|$|R
