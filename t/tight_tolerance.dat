50|$|Zerodur (notation of the manufacturer: ZERODUR®), a {{registered}} trademark of Schott AG, is a lithium-aluminosilicate glass-ceramic produced by Schott AG since 1968. It {{has been used}} for a number of very large telescope mirrors including Keck I, Keck II, and SOFIA, as well as some smaller telescopes (such as the GREGOR Solar Telescope). With its very low coefficient of thermal expansion {{it can be used to}} produce mirrors that retain acceptable figures in extremely cold environments such as deep space. Although it has advantages for applications requiring a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of borosilicate glass, it remains very expensive as compared to borosilicate. The <b>tight</b> <b>tolerance</b> on CTE, ±0.007 K−1, allows highly accurate applications that require high-precision.|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, {{based on}} {{funding from the}} Office of Naval Research, Visotek led a team {{consisting}} of Fraunhofer USA CLT and Bender Shipbuilding & Repair that enabled Bender {{to become the first}} U.S. shipyard to successfully laser weld a structural steel panel from one side, without flipping it over, utilizing the shipyard's production equipment. [...] It was proven that laser welding is not only feasible in shipbuilding; it is the future of welding in shipbuilding. A proprietary special laser processing tool, FLO (Flexibible Laser Optic), was developed for this application that enables rapid two dimensional scanning and auto focus using a variety of laser sources with output powers up to 15 kW. Welding of thick plates with variable weld seam width was achieved, successfully overcoming the gap and <b>tight</b> <b>tolerance</b> fit-up issues. This is a particular breakthrough as the barriers to effective laser welding implementation in shipbuilding are formidable. The same laser processing tool was also successfully applied in the automotive industry for 3-D robotic remote welding. The process achieved 250 welded spots per minute with 6 kW of laser power.|$|E
