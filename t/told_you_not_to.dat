25|$|Doug Walters {{went to the}} wicket when Australia's total {{stood at}} 4/192 just before tea and played his shots to such telling effect that, by the time stumps arrived, he had scored 103...He opened the dressing-room door, expecting a flood of {{congratulations}} from his fellow players on the brilliance of his stroke play. His team mates, however, had anticipated Walters' expectations and were hidden in the shower room. Ian Chappell, the Aussie skipper, {{was alone in the}} room, hunched over a newspaper crossword. Chappell looked up as Walters entered, well ahead of his fellow batsmen. 'What {{the hell are you doing}} back here? I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get out tonight'...|$|E
500|$|Irataba {{was away}} at Fort Yuma during {{the attack on}} the settlers, and upon hearing of it he scolded the Mohave. Chooksa homar participated in the events and {{reported}} that Irataba told the warriors, [...] "I hear you fought, though I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to.</b> And you will have war again: I know it. You used to fight the Maricopa. I want to go [...] to see the Maricopa and tell them: 'The Mohave will not come any more to attack you'." [...] Irataba, weary of the constant fighting and worried that further conflicts with neighboring tribes would draw more attention from the US soldiers, organized a peace expedition to the Maricopa, settling the ancient disputes between the two peoples.|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, Amahl's mother weeps, {{praying that}} Amahl {{not become a}} beggar ("Don't Cry Mother Dear"). After bedtime ("From Far Away We Come"), {{there is a knock}} at the door and the mother tells Amahl to go see who it is ("Amahl ... Yes Mother!"). He is amazed when he sees three splendidly dressed kings (the Magi). At first the mother does not believe Amahl, but when she goes to the door to see for herself, she is stunned. The Three Kings tell the mother and Amahl they are on a long journey to give gifts to a wondrous Child and they would like to rest at their house, to which the mother agrees ("Good Evening!"; [...] "Come In!"), saying that all she can offer is [...] "a cold {{fireplace}} and a bed of straw". The mother goes to fetch firewood, and Amahl seizes the opportunity to speak with the kings. King Balthazar answers Amahl's questions about his life as a king and asks what Amahl does. Amahl responds that he was once a shepherd, but his mother had to sell his sheep. Now, he and his mother will have to go begging. Amahl then talks with King Kaspar, who is childlike, eccentric, and a bit deaf. Kaspar shows Amahl his box of magic stones, beads, and licorice, and offers Amahl some of the candy ("Are You A Real King?"; [...] "This is My Box"). The mother returns ("Amahl, I <b>Told</b> <b>You</b> <b>Not</b> <b>To</b> Be A Nuisance!"). He defends himself, saying [...] "They kept asking me questions," [...] when of course it has in fact been Amahl asking the kings questions. Amahl is told to go fetch the neighbors ("All These Beautiful Things"; [...] "Have You Seen a Child?") so the kings may be fed and entertained properly ("Shepherds! Shepherds!"; [...] "Emily! Emily"; [...] "Olives and Quinces"; [...] "Dance of the Shepherds").|$|E

6000|$|... 'I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> Ave, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> let the drawing-room books {{be carried}} {{about the house}} to be spoilt!' said Henry, who seldom reproved his brother direct, but {{generally}} through Ave.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> I was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be interrupted," [...] said Allan, irritably. [...] "Good heavens! am I {{never to}} have done with them? Another letter!" ...|$|R

60|$|MINNIE. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{worry about}} me and George. I ran away from him once--I guess I won't {{have to do it}} again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Violets! Oh, and spring! Daren, it {{was good}} of you to gather them for me. I remember.... But I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> come again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{did hear}} <b>you</b> <b>told</b> him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be a--perhaps I had better say--a simple fool," [...] Helen {{answered}} mischievously; and Bransome coughed before he made reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "We needn't believe {{everything}} {{she said to}} realize that she suffered. But girls exaggerate their sufferings. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>told</b> her <b>not</b> <b>to</b> think of it any more?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How often," [...] said Mactavish, {{going up}} {{to him with a}} look of annoyance--"how often have I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> Mr Somerville, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> leave an entry half {{finished}} on any account!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I believe,' she said, 'I {{was rude}} just now when I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> talk. I am sorry for it; I shall know better next time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{bother with}} them," [...] panted Glutts, who was {{somewhat}} out of breath. [...] "Now, {{for all you}} know, they'll have us arrested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> interrupt," [...] {{said the}} Lonesome Duck, sternly. [...] "If you get TOO disagreeable, you'll drive me away before I finish this incantation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't say you'd {{be making}} them fight, Father John. I only said, if <b>you</b> <b>told</b> Thady <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be meddling with Myles, why, in course, they wouldn't be quarrelling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me <b>not</b> <b>to</b> look at you," [...] {{explained}} meekly the fishy-eyed young gentleman. [...] "I must go off somehow. I regard {{you as a}} {{very difficult}} man to please." ...|$|R
6000|$|Don. Clara. No, no; {{just now}} <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me <b>not</b> <b>to</b> tease you--"Who do you want, good signor?" [...] "Not <b>you,</b> <b>not</b> you!" [...] Oh you blind wretch! but swear {{never to be}} jealous again, and I'll forgive you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hannah! Hannah!" [...] exclaimed her mother; [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go {{near that}} tree! Get your flowers quick, {{if you must}} get them, and come away." ...|$|E
60|$|BEATRICE. To the Crossway Hotel, miles out--in my own name. They don't know me there. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hope, Michael. I've done my best; I swear it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> {{eat that}} pie tonight," [...] put in Sam. [...] "He saved his pie from dinner, {{and ate it}} just before we came up here,"--which was true.|$|E
6000|$|... "You wanted {{what was}} impossible, you know, Chettam," [...] said Mr. Brooke. [...] "You wanted him shipped off. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> Ladislaw was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be done as we liked with: {{he had his}} ideas. He was a {{remarkable}} fellow--I always {{said he was a}} remarkable fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother," [...] he said presently, {{with a more}} lively tone, [...] "at {{any rate}} he disobeyed you; for <b>you</b> <b>told</b> him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go near the brook where the bank was high; and he did, or else {{he never would have}} fallen in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{often have}} I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> young ones, <b>not</b> <b>to</b> stay out after sundown on Saturday night?

6000|$|... "No, it wasn't. You fell {{because you}} {{let go of}} my hand and bent too far forward. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do that. So that it was your own fault." ...|$|E
6000|$|She roused {{herself to}} her duties as nurse. [...] "What are you doing? Why {{are you trying to}} sit up? Sit down! Don't touch your bandages. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> talk." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I was {{frequently}} <b>told</b> <b>to</b> caution <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> engage the French, sir, until the other division had closed, {{and was ready}} to assist. But, really, whether this was owing to some secret information that the rear-admiral had obtained, or to a natural desire to have a share in the battle, is more than I can say." ...|$|R
6000|$|For Albinia {{had turned}} quite white at {{hearing that the}} boy, on whom she had fixed her warm affection, had been {{carrying}} on a course of falsehood; but a moment's hope restored her. 'I did keep him at home on Tuesday,' she said, 'it was so very hot, {{and he had a}} headache. I thought I might. <b>You</b> <b>told</b> me <b>not</b> <b>to</b> send him on doubtful days.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Capitally," [...] he said. [...] "I {{pretended to}} be half an idiot, and so got safely out, though I fell into Sheridan's hands.

6000|$|... "Don't talk to {{me about}} her, John: I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should {{associate}} with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|BEATRICE. I know. It's cruel--it's horrible. But I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hope, Michael. I've done my best. All {{these months}} at Mentone, I've been {{wondering}} why I ever let you marry me--when that feeling wasn't dead! ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the seventh}} day sabbath, as I <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> manna was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be found. But why? For that that day was of Moses and of the ministration of death. But manna was not of him. Moses, saith Christ, 'gave <b>you</b> <b>not</b> that bread of heaven' (John 6:31,32). Moses, as was said, gave that sabbath in tables of stone, and God gave that manna from heaven. Christ, nor his Father, gives grace by the law; no not by that law in which is {{contained}} the old seventh day sabbath itself.|$|R
5000|$|Also, in {{the early}} 1960s two volunteers started a {{movement}} to draft Barry Goldwater, an unlikely and unwilling candidate back then. Goldwater initially gave such remarks as [...] "I'm not a candidate. And I'm <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> be. I {{have no intention of}} running for the Presidency", and [...] "'Draft' nothing. I <b>told</b> <b>you</b> I'm <b>not</b> going <b>to</b> run." [...] However, the effort eventually convinced Goldwater and won him the Republican nomination in 1964 {{in the face of the}} self-financed campaign of Nelson Rockefeller, the ridicule of the national press, and the refusal by Goldwater to run.|$|R
6000|$|... "At first I didn't {{mean to tell}} you," [...] said Tessa, {{speaking}} {{almost in}} a whisper, as if that would mitigate the offence; [...] "because we thought the old man would be gone away before you came again, {{and it would be}} as if it had not been. But now he is there, and you are come, and I never did anything <b>you</b> <b>told</b> me <b>not</b> <b>to</b> do before. And I want to tell you, and then you will perhaps forgive me, for it is a long while before I go to confession." ...|$|R
