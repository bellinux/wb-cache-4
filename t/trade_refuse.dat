50|$|By the 1920s, a {{combination}} of the reducing calorific value of the waste and an end to Sunday collection of waste, led to an additional Babcock & Wilcox boiler being installed and used when there was insufficient waste for the destructor furnaces. This boiler was fuelled by coke, a by-product of the Coal gas production process, often being sourced from the Cambridge gas works next to the pumping station.By 1942 this boiler provided the main steam supply, the destructor cells being used only for <b>trade</b> <b>refuse</b> and standby duty.|$|E
40|$|At present, the {{utilization}} of waste products in Germany {{is characterized by the}} enforcement of rigorous environmental standards (pre-treatment of waste, sealing of dumps) and following from that a temporary capacity problem regarding the disposal of pre-treated household refuse and the incineration of calorie intensive <b>trade</b> <b>refuse.</b> The privatization of commercial waste for utilization under the Waste Management Law of 1996 resulted in a low level of capacity utilization of municipal waste treatment facilities. Besides, the requirements concerning the (thermal or mechanical-biological) pre-treatment of waste are not met on time, as a consequence of omissions at local level and privately. In order to explain the fundamental change from the former “battle over waste” among privately owned and municipal enterprises to the present bottleneck in refuse disposal, first of all the waste industry is briefly characterized in the context of environmental protection (2.). After that its legal framework is dealt with in an abridged version and partly commented on (3.). In this the basic problem is the distinction between energetic waste utilization and thermal waste disposal that is in dispute in case of waste incineration. The actual legal practice of the European Court of Justice has resulted in a utilization instead of the former disposal friendly interpretation of the concept of waste. It contributed – among other reasons – to a surplus capacity of municipal incinerating plants. The object of chapter 4 is the calculation of fees of the different services of waste disposal and their possible ecological design. As an alternative solution of regulating {{the utilization}} of waste products in form of the current juxtaposition of public and private refuse disposal and waste utilization, its possible further privatization is dealt with controversially. A few variants from this are distinguished in more detail like competition in and for the market, besides the increase of efficiency in the present legal and organizational framework. Privatization of governmental duties in case of {{the utilization of}} waste products is limited to the performance of but does not include the responsibility for its tasks. waste utilization, refuse disposal, waste charges, liberalization of waste management...|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally SMWIA journeymen had {{relied on}} {{economic}} power to control fabrication work: Members {{employed in the}} building <b>trades</b> <b>refused</b> to handle work that was not fabricated at building-trades rates, a strategy that forced contractors to deal with union firms only. But that strategy proved risky after 1947 when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed secondary boycotts. Forced to adapt to change, the IA took a new approach: In 1956 the union established the Organizing Department to bring those workers employed by large scale manufacturers like Carrier and GE-Hotpoint into the union fold. The effort paid off: Thanks to new shop workers, IA membership grew from almost 88,000 in 1954, to more than 102,000 in 1958, to 111,000 in 1962, a 26 percent increase in less than 10 years’ time.

[...] The CCS transferred securities electronically, eliminating their physical handling for settlement purposes, and kept track {{of the total number of}} shares held by NYSE members. [...] This relieved brokerage firms of the work of inspecting, counting, and storing certificates. Haack labeled it [...] "top priority", $5 million was spent on it, and its goal was to eliminate up to 75% of the physical handling of stock certificates traded between brokers. One problem, however, was that it was voluntary, and brokers responsible for two-thirds of all <b>trades</b> <b>refused</b> to use it.|$|R
