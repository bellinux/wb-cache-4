5|$|Over the years, {{there have}} been various small controversies, the most infamous being the scandal {{involving}} the Steinmetz High School team, which was caught cheating at the 1995 Illinois state finals. This event was later dramatized in the 2000 film Cheaters. Academic Decathlon has been criticized by educators {{for the amount of}} time it requires students to spend on the material, as it constitutes an entire curriculum beyond the one provided by the school. Around the turn of the millennium, several coaches protested the USAD's decision to publish error-ridden Resource Guides rather than provide <b>topics</b> <b>for</b> students to research.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and ethics of the work were perfectly reasonable debate <b>topics</b> <b>for</b> {{those who had not}} even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|From 1953 to 1961 Grant {{immersed}} {{himself in}} the study of Hinduism, becoming a follower of the Hindu guru Ramana Maharshi. He was also interested in the work of another Hindu teacher, Lord Kusuma Haranath, and was credited with encouraging and helping to create the three-volume Lord Haranath: A Biography by Akella Ramakrishna Sastri. He also authored articles on Advaita Vedanta and other Hindu <b>topics</b> <b>for</b> Indian journals like the Bombay-based The Call Divine, as well as for Richard Cavendish's Man, Myth & Magic. Many of these articles would be collected into a single anthology and published as At the Feet of the Guru in 2005. Grant believed that the O.T.O.'s sex magic teachings needed to be refashioned along tantric principles from Indian religion, in doing so relying heavily on Curwen's ideas about tantra.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels, who {{aspired to}} be an author, {{obtained}} a Doctor of Philosophy degree from the University of Heidelberg in 1921. He joined the Nazi Party in 1924, and worked with Gregor Strasser in their northern branch. He was appointed as Gauleiter (district leader) for Berlin in 1926, where he began to {{take an interest in}} the use of propaganda to promote the party and its programme. After the Nazi Seizure of Power in 1933, Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry quickly gained and exerted controlling supervision over the news media, arts, and information in Germany. He was particularly adept at using the relatively new media of radio and film for propaganda purposes. <b>Topics</b> <b>for</b> party propaganda included antisemitism, attacks on the Christian churches, and (after the start of the Second World War) attempting to shape morale.|$|E

The students’ activities on forums, including number of views and posts, were extracted from system logs. Altogether, the students from both institutes posted 301 messages on the three discussion <b>topics</b> (124 <b>for</b> <b>topic</b> 1, 95 <b>for</b> <b>topic</b> 2, and 82 <b>for</b> <b>topic</b> 3) and 263 responses (126 <b>for</b> <b>topic</b> 1, 71 <b>for</b> <b>topic</b> 2, 66 <b>for</b> <b>topic</b> 3). On average, each student posted 3.35 times on topic 1, 2.57 times on topic 2, and 2.21 on topic 3. As the student could choose to post in languages they were comfortable with, the posts on the forums showed the mixture of both English and Chinese.|$|R

5|$|Lady's Realm printed an {{assortment}} of Court and society news alongside articles on more daily tasks such as food, homemaking, and methods for female readers to earn money. It covered the London Season, displaying photographs of significant society figures and débutantes. It claimed to feature over 500 illustrations in each volume. Theatre was another regular topic of the magazine's, as was fiction, poetry, and reports on fashion. The Lady's Realms fashion editor Marian Pritchard regularly wrote articles on emerging fashions in London and Paris, and recommended locations where readers could buy them. While still featuring fashion and beauty, it also encouraged careers for women in music, art, business, and millinery. The magazine maintained this blend of topics relatively consistently, though it gradually made {{minor changes to the}} proportion it focused on different <b>topics,</b> <b>for</b> instance later focusing less on the nobility and more on the lives of clergymen and governors general.|$|E
5|$|Senate {{committees}} can {{be affected}} by the party composition of the Senate. The Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, argued that a government majority of seats in the Senate resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information. Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian Democrats have been used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government control of the Senate, particularly in respect of selection of <b>topics</b> <b>for</b> committee inquiry. However Senator Minchin, the leader of the government in the Senate in the mid-2000s, pointed out that their political rivals had previously cut off debate on more bills in the Senate than had his government.|$|E
5|$|Eager {{to promote}} and defend her religion, she {{played a leading role}} in both the Witchcraft Research Association and then the Pagan Front during the 1960s and 1970s. That latter decade also saw her briefly involve herself in far right {{politics}} as well as becoming a keen ley hunter and proponent of Earth mysteries. As well as regularly writing articles on esoteric <b>topics</b> <b>for</b> various magazines, from the 1960s onward she authored a number of books on the subject of Wicca, as well as contributing to the publication of works by Wiccan friends Stewart Farrar, Janet Farrar, and Evan John Jones. In these works also she became an early advocate of the idea that anyone could practice Wicca without requiring initiation by a pre-existing Wiccan, while also contributing to and encouraging research into the religion's early history. Living in Brighton during these years, she worked with both her partner and initiate Ron Cook and {{was a member of the}} Silver Malkin coven. In her final years she served as patron of the Sussex-based Centre for Pagan Studies prior to her death from pancreatic cancer.|$|E
