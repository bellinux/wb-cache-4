The inaccurate AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in many films and paintings (such as Rudolph Zallinger's famous mural The Age of Reptiles in Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History) until the 1990s, when films such as Jurassic Park introduced a more accurate posture to the general public.|$|E

5000|$|At heel contact <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> is maximally flexed at {{approximately}} 30 degrees. <b>The</b> <b>hip</b> extensor muscles are active {{and prepared to}} extend <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> to prevent any uncontrolled trunk flexion over the femur.

Between 30-50% of the gait cycle, <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> flexor muscles are eccentrically acting as <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> continues to extend, until reaching maximal extension {{at approximately}} 10-15 degrees past neutral.

5|$|Daspletosaurus {{shared the}} same body form as other tyrannosaurids, with a short, S-shaped neck {{supporting}} the massive skull. It walked on its two thick hindlimbs, which ended in four-toed feet, although the first digit (the hallux) did not contact the ground. In contrast, the forelimbs were extremely small and bore only two digits, although Daspletosaurus had the longest forelimbs in proportion to body size of any tyrannosaurid. A long, heavy tail served as a counterweight to the head and torso, with {{the center of gravity}} over <b>the</b> <b>hips.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like other hadrosaurids, it {{was able}} to walk on either two legs or four. It {{probably}} preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over <b>the</b> <b>hips,</b> they increased the height of the back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures.|$|E
5|$|Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta {{was covered}} in armor formed from bony masses {{embedded}} in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter and other scientists to accurately describe this protection. Two parallel rows of domed scutes ran down {{the top of the}} neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back). On the upper surface of the back and tail, the skin {{was covered in}} small, bony nodules (ossicles), which separated larger conical scutes arranged in parallel rows along the mediolateral axis (side to side). Over <b>the</b> <b>hips,</b> the ossicles and larger domed plates were interlocked very tightly to form a structure called a sacral shield. This shield is also found in ankylosaurs like Polacanthus and Antarctopelta. Large, pointed spines lined the sides of the neck, increasing in size towards the shoulders, and then decreasing in size again {{along the side of the}} body until they stopped just before <b>the</b> <b>hips.</b> Behind <b>the</b> <b>hips,</b> flat triangular plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing laterally (outwards) and decreasing in size towards the end of the tail. Carpenter originally described the cervical (neck) spines and caudal plates as belonging to a single row on each side, although more recently he and Jim Kirkland reconstructed them in two parallel rows on each side, one above the other. The upper row of cervical spines pointed backwards and upwards (posterodorsally), while the lower row pointed backwards and outwards (posterolaterally). The bases of each pair of cervical spines and each pair of caudal plates were fused together, greatly restricting mobility in both the neck and upper tail.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{propulsion}} {{and adaptation}} to speed requirements {{is important in}} determining appropriate therapies for gait disorders. We hypothesize that adaptations for changing speed requirements occur primarily at <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b> <b>The</b> slow, normal and fast gait of 24 healthy young subjects was analyzed.

5|$|The skull {{was perched}} {{at the end}} of a thick, S-shaped neck, and a long, heavy tail acted as a {{counterweight}} to balance out the head and torso, with the center of mass over <b>the</b> <b>hips.</b> Tyrannosaurids are known for their proportionately very small two-fingered forelimbs, although remnants of a vestigial third digit are sometimes found. Tarbosaurus had the shortest forelimbs compared to its body size, while Daspletosaurus had the longest.|$|E
5|$|Bats are {{adapted to}} roosting, hanging upside {{down from their}} feet. The femurs are {{attached}} at <b>the</b> <b>hips</b> {{in a way that}} allows them to bend outward and upward in flight. The ankle joint can flex so as to allow the trailing edge of the wings to bend downwards. However, this design does not permit many movements other than hanging or clambering up trees. Most megabats roost with the head tucked towards the belly, whereas most microbats roost with the neck curled towards the back. This difference is reflected {{in the structure of the}} cervical vertebrae in the two groups, which are clearly distinct. Tendons allow bats to lock their feet closed when hanging from a roost. Muscular power is needed to let go, but not to grasp a perch or when holding on.|$|E
5|$|The tail of Sauropelta was {{characteristically}} {{long and}} made up {{nearly half of the}} body length. One skeleton preserved forty caudal (tail) vertebrae, although some were missing, suggesting that the true number of caudal vertebrae may have exceeded fifty. Ossified tendons stiffened the tail along its length. Like other ankylosaurs, Sauropelta had a wide body, with a very broad pelvis and ribcage. The forelimbs were shorter than the hindlimbs, which resulted in an arched back, with the highest point over <b>the</b> <b>hips.</b> Its feet, limbs, shoulders, and pelvis were all very stoutly constructed and reinforced to support a great deal of weight. American paleontologist Ken Carpenter estimated the mass of S. edwardsorum at 1,500kilograms (3,300lb).|$|E
50|$|Posterior pelvic tilt is the opposite, {{when the}} front of the pelvis rises and the back of the pelvis drops. This happens when <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> flexors {{lengthen}} and <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> extensors shorten, particularly the gluteus maximus which is the primary hyperextensor of <b>the</b> <b>hip.</b>|$|R

30|$|We {{found that}} {{involvement}} of the labrum in <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint in tuberculosis gives poor functional outcome. The presence of labral tear can, thus, serve as a watershed for treatment decisions in such patients. The labrum helps in deepening the acetabulum, thereby decreasing stresses on <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint and increasing its stability [20, 21]. Labral tears may affect the stability of <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint [22]. Labral tears are also believed to result in premature articular damage, which may further affect the functional characteristics and mobility of <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint [23, 24]. Affection of the acetabular labrum (arthroscopic grade 2) in tuberculosis of <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> thus points to a poor prognosis, validating our arthroscopic classification of tuberculosis of <b>the</b> <b>hip</b> joint.|$|R

5|$|Hennig and Janensch, while {{grouping}} the dermal armour elements {{into four}} distinct types, recognised an apparently continuous change of shape among them, shorter and flatter plates {{at the front}} gradually merging into longer and more pointed spikes towards the rear, suggesting an uninterrupted distribution along the entire body, in fifteen pairs. Because each type of osteoderm was found in mirrored left and right versions, it seems probable that all types of osteoderms were distributed in two rows {{along the back of}} the animal, a marked contrast to the better-known North American Stegosaurus, which had one row of plates on the neck, trunk and tail, and two rows of spikes on the tail tip. There is one type of spike that differs from all others in being strongly, and not only slightly, asymmetrical, and having a very broad base. Because of bone morphology classic reconstructions placed it on <b>the</b> <b>hips,</b> at the iliac blade, while many recent reconstructions place it on the shoulder, because a similarly shaped spike is known to have existed on the shoulder in the Chinese stegosaurs Gigantspinosaurus and Huayangosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of <b>the</b> <b>hips.</b> In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E

5|$|Kata is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the posture and movement associated with taiko performance. The term is used in martial arts in a similar way: for example, both traditions include the idea that the hara is the center of being. Author Sean Bender argues that kata is the primary feature that distinguishes different taiko groups from one another, and is a key factor in judging the quality of performance. For this reason, many practice rooms intended for taiko contain mirrors to provide visual feedback to players. An important part of kata in taiko is keeping the body stabilized while performing, and can be accomplished by keeping a wide, low stance with the legs, with the left knee bent over the toes and keeping the right leg straight. It is important that <b>the</b> <b>hips</b> face the drum and the shoulders are relaxed. Some teachers note a tendency to rely on the upper body while playing, and emphasize the importance of the holistic use of the body during performance.|$|E
5|$|Though Kentrosaurus likely {{stood with}} forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is {{hypothesised}} {{that the animal}} adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough {{to allow it to}} keep sight of predators, as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around <b>the</b> <b>hips</b> by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping the tail pointed at the attacker. Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could have made it to the tail base (where the impact speed would be much lower) when the tail passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected by the tail swings. A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required group hunting. Compared to the more robust spikes of Stegosaurus, the thinner spikes of Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting <b>the</b> <b>hips.</b> The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a sexual characteristic, with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E

5|$|Like {{those of}} other sauropods, the neck {{vertebrae}} are deeply bifurcated; they carried neural spines with a large trough in the middle, resulting in a wide, deep neck. The vertebral formula for the holotype of A.louisae is 15cervicals, 10dorsals, 5sacrals, and 82caudals. The caudal vertebra number may vary, even within species. The cervical vertebrae of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus are stouter and more robust than {{those of other}} diplodocids and {{were found to be}} most similar to Camarasaurus by Charles Whitney Gilmore. In addition, they support cervical ribs that extend farther towards the ground than in diplodocines, and have vertebrae and ribs that are narrower towards the top of the neck, making the neck nearly triangular in cross-section. In Apatosaurus louisae, the atlas-axis complex of the first cervicals is nearly fused. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae and are instead loosely articulated. Apatosaurus has ten dorsal ribs {{on either side of the}} body. The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. Apatosaurus, like its close relative Supersaurus, has tall neural spines, which make up more than half the height of the individual bones of its vertebrae. The shape of the tail is unusual for a diplodocid; it is comparatively slender because of the rapidly decreasing height of the vertebral spines with increasing distance from <b>the</b> <b>hips.</b> Apatosaurus also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving it an unusually deep chest. As in other diplodocids, the tail transformed into a whip-like structure towards the end.|$|E
5|$|The postcranial {{skeleton}} of Majungasaurus closely resembles those of Carnotaurus and Aucasaurus, {{the only other}} abelisaurid genera for which complete skeletal material is known. Majungasaurus was bipedal, with a long tail to balance out the head and torso, putting {{the center of gravity}} over <b>the</b> <b>hips.</b> Although the cervical (neck) vertebrae had numerous cavities and excavations (pleurocoels) to reduce their weight, they were robust, with exaggerated muscle attachment sites and ribs that interlocked for strength. Ossified tendons attached to the cervical ribs, giving them a forked appearance, as seen in Carnotaurus. All of these features resulted in a very strong and muscular neck. Uniquely, the cervical ribs of Majungasaurus had long depressions along the sides for weight reduction. The humerus (upper arm bone) was short and curved, closely resembling those of Aucasaurus and Carnotaurus. Also like related dinosaurs, Majungasaurus had very short forelimbs with four extremely reduced digits, first reported with only two very short external fingers and no claws. The hand and finger bones of Majungasaurus, like other majungasaurines, lacked the characteristic pits and grooves where claws and tendons would normally attach, and its finger bones were fused together, indicating that the hand was immobile. In 2012, a better specimen was described, showing that the lower arm was robust, though short, and that the hand contained four metatarsals and four, probably inflexible and very reduced, fingers, with small claws on the second and third finger. The phalanx formula was 1-2-2-1-0.|$|E
