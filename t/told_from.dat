5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it {{deviates}} from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid focusing on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being <b>told</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of a different character. The book's foundation is built on the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to sell her to a childless couple in Kabul, an event that ties the various narratives together.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not certain}} that the slaves were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus. While this is the unspoken assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view of military power and responsibility on the ad hoc organization of the slaves. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be <b>told</b> <b>from</b> the historical evidence whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Tomoyo After {{follows a}} branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, {{and focuses on}} {{the appeal of the}} title character Tomoyo. Being a spin-off of Clannad, where Tomoyo is one of the game's heroines, Tomoyo After provides an expansion of Tomoyo's story after the events of Clannad and is written by Jun Maeda and Leo Kashida. The art was done by Fumio, as opposed to Itaru Hinoue who had done the art in Clannad. The game ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 twice more afterwards. A manga adaptation illustrated by Yukiko Sumiyoshi, under the title Tomoyo After: Dear Shining Memories, was serialized in Fujimi Shobo's Dragon Age Pure in 2007. Unlike the game which is <b>told</b> <b>from</b> Tomoya's point of view, the manga is <b>told</b> <b>from</b> Tomoyo's perspective. A single tankōbon volume was released in Japan in December 2007.|$|E

5|$|Thomas {{originally}} wrote Veronica Mars as a {{young adult}} novel, featuring a male as the protagonist.

5|$|Director John Lasseter's first {{experience}} with computer animation was during his work as an animator at Walt Disney Feature Animation, when two of his friends showed him the lightcycle scene from Tron. It was an eye-opening experience which awakened Lasseter to the possibilities offered by the new medium of computer-generated animation. Lasseter tried to pitch The Brave Little Toaster as a fully computer-animated film to Disney, but the idea was rejected and Lasseter was fired. He {{then went on to}} work at Lucasfilm and later as a founding member of Pixar, which was purchased by entrepreneur and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs in 1986. At Pixar, Lasseter created short, computer-animated films to show off the Pixar Image Computer's capabilities, and Tin Toy (1988) —a short story <b>told</b> <b>from</b> the perspective of a toy, referencing Lasseter's love of classic toys— would go on to claim the 1988 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, the first computer-generated film to do so.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is <b>told</b> <b>from</b> {{the perspective of}} multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective on religion. Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life, or as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E
