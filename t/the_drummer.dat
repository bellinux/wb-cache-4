50|$|Mercury clocks used a drum {{with several}} {{chambers}} that were connected through calibrated holes. A rope was wound around <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> with a weight connected to one end. The weight pulling down turned <b>the</b> <b>drum,</b> and <b>the</b> mercury in <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> chambers resisted <b>the</b> turning motion by slowly flowing from one segment of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> to <b>the</b> next, thus inhibiting {{the movement of}} <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> and making it turn at {{a more or less}} constant speed. The movement of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> could be used to measure time.|$|R

5000|$|In {{deciding}} {{to use the}} CR-78 for [...] "Heart of Glass", the choice was made to combine the sound of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> machine with <b>the</b> sound of actual <b>drumming.</b> This reflected <b>the</b> hybrid nature of the song, {{the combination of a}} drum machine that was typically used in the context of dance music with <b>the</b> actual <b>drum</b> sound that was a traditional aspect of rock recordings. In combining these elements, the sound of <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> machine was first recorded on an individual track. To synchronize <b>the</b> actual <b>drum</b> play with <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> machine, <b>the</b> <b>drums</b> were also recorded on separate tracks, with <b>the</b> bass <b>drum</b> recorded separately from the rest of <b>the</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|R

50|$|Care {{for this}} {{instrument}} is peculiar in that <b>the</b> <b>drum</b> heads must {{be exposed to}} moisture to produce a desirable sound.
