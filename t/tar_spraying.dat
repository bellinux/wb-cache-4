Whilst not as large as the GLCC's Beckton Products Works, this made a significant contribution to the Company’s production, particularly of creosote and road tar. The works was situated {{on the opposite side of}} London to Beckton, which facilitated the company’s road <b>tar</b> <b>spraying</b> operations on that side of the metropolis. Southall Products Works continued to manufacture ammonium sulphate until 1946.|$|E

In addition the company produced a range of tractors for both road and agricultural use. Another popular product for municipal use was their lightweight patching roller, used for road repair. In 1924 the company introduced their superb Mann Express wagon, with shaft drive, high-speed engine and fully enclosed cab. Unfortunately this wagon was not a commercial success and by 1926 Mann's Patent Steam Cart and Wagon Company was in trouble. Despite attempts to provide additional finance {{it was not possible to}} save the company, and in 1929 the works closed completely.|$|E

40|$|Quackgrass or {{witchgrass}} is a creeping perennial grass, {{related to}} common wheat, {{and one of}} the most widely distributed and destructive weeds in the North Temperate Zone [...] Quackgrass can rarely be exterminated on large areas, but it can be brought under reasonable control. The best plan is to allow it to form a sod and then plow it in midsummer during dry hot weather. Attacking the weed in wet weather or in the spring when the rootstocks are growing vigorously is almost a waste of time. After plowing, the field should be harrowed frequently until winter and the following year planted with a cultivated crop. A smother crop may follow the cultivated crop. On small areas quackgrass can be eradicated by hand digging, smothering with <b>tar</b> paper, <b>spraying</b> with chemicals, or by other means. Quackgrass makes good hay, pasturage, silage, and lawns and often can be utilized more economically than it can be destroyed. " [...] p. ...|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of motor vehicles, dust became a serious problem on macadam roads. The area of low air {{pressure}} created under fast-moving vehicles sucked dust from the road surface, creating dust clouds and a gradual unraveling of the road material. This problem was approached by <b>spraying</b> <b>tar</b> on the surface to create tar-bound macadam. On March 13, 1902 in Monaco, a Swiss doctor, Ernest Guglielminetti, came upon {{the idea of using}} tar from Monaco's Gasworks for binding the dust. Later a mixture of coal tar and ironworks slag, patented by Edgar Purnell Hooley as tarmac, was introduced.|$|R
