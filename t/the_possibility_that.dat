5|$|In 2010, a European science team {{investigated}} the star using the CORALIE spectrograph and collected seventeen spectra of WASP-44. From the spectra, radial velocity measurements were extrapolated. Analysis of collected CORALIE data ruled out <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the detected radial velocity {{was caused by}} the blended spectrum of a spectroscopic binary star, supporting <b>the</b> <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> the body orbiting WASP-44 was indeed a planet, designated WASP-44b.|$|E

40|$|World Heritage (WH) is an {{organization}} which aims at preserving particularly interesting areas, monuments etc. Each of these “sites ” are described on a website. In order to help users navigate the existing World Heritage website, some categorizations have been created. For instance {{it is possible to}} browse categories based on location or site type. It is difficult to make good categorizations and take advantage of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> they offer. But good categorizations expresses a lot of information about the sites that they cover. Categorizations {{can be used to make}} some complex queries. For example it is possible to suggest sites that are related to each other based on some category property. The goal of this project is to explore <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> emerging XML technologies offer, and based on the technologies suggest a way of making categorizations of semistructured data. Furthermore we explore <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> categorizations of semistructured data offer, and create a framework that supports easy generatio...|$|R

50|$|Byrne (2005) {{outlined}} {{a set of}} cognitive principles <b>that</b> guide <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> people think about when they imagine an alternative to reality. Experiments show that people tend to think about realistic possibilities, rather than unrealistic possibilities, {{and they tend to}} think about few possibilities rather than many. Counterfactuals are special in part because they require people to think about at least two possibilities (reality, and an alternative to reality), and to think about a <b>possibility</b> <b>that</b> is false, temporarily assumed to be true. Experiments have corroborated the proposal that the principles <b>that</b> guide <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> <b>that</b> people think about most readily, explain their tendencies to focus on, for example, exceptional events rather than normal events, actions rather than inactions, and more recent events rather than earlier events in a sequence.|$|R
