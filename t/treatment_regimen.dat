The higher dose did its job and his cancer never returned. This treatment became standard for many cancers and is still used.|$|E

5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same <b>treatment</b> <b>regimen,</b> thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{preferred}} terminology remains {{a matter of}} debate.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} the trends in product regimens {{used to treat}} depression to investigate whether {{there has been a}} shift in treatment patterns following the May 2008 launch of desvenalfaxine in the United States and the approval of an atypical antipsychotic as add-on therapy to antidepressants. Our analysis suggests that antidepressant monotherapy continues to be the most widely used drug treatment approach, accounting for 84 percent of depression <b>treatment</b> <b>regimens.</b> Antidepressant monotherapy is more prevalent among primary care physician-prescribed <b>treatment</b> <b>regimens</b> (92 %) than psychiatry-prescribed regimens (73 %). Combination <b>treatment</b> <b>regimens</b> have become increasingly more common as physician perception of disease severity increases, with antidepressant combination therapy accounting for eight percent, 17 percent, and 27 percent of <b>treatment</b> <b>regimens</b> for mild, moderate, and severe depression, respectively. The most commonly used agents in addition to an antidepressant in combination <b>treatment</b> <b>regimens</b> include another antidepressant (40 % of combination regimens), an anxiety agent (40 %), and/or atypical antipsychotics (18 %). A trend analysis suggests that combination regimens that include an antidepressant plus an atypical antipsychotic, anxiety agent, or a prescription sleep aid comprise a greater share of combination regimens in 12 months ending May 2009 than they did in 12 months ending June 2008...|$|R

25|$|DCC is {{expressed}} {{at very low}} levels {{through most of the}} body but at higher levels {{in many areas of the}} brain, particularly in dopamine neurons. Recently it has been shown that a sensitizing <b>treatment</b> <b>regimen</b> of amphetamines causes markedly increased levels of DCC and UNC-5 expression on neuron cell bodies.

30|$|As {{discussed}} earlier, patient compliance is a {{key factor}} in the success of <b>treatment</b> <b>regimens.</b> Considering also that most patients are willing to receive medication reminders (Kebede, et al. 2015) and likely to possess smartphones, medication reminder apps can improve compliance.

25|$|Surgical {{treatments}} such as nerve grafting, tendon lengthening, tendon transfers, {{and limb}} lengthening and shortening were used extensively during this time. Patients with residual paralysis {{were treated with}} braces and taught to compensate for lost function {{with the help of}} calipers, crutches and wheelchairs. The use of devices such as rigid braces and body casts, which tended to cause muscle atrophy due to the limited movement of the user, were also touted as effective treatments. Massage and passive motion exercises were also used to treat polio victims. Most of these treatments proved to be of little therapeutic value, however several effective supportive measures for the treatment of polio did emerge during these decades including the iron lung, an anti-polio antibody serum, and a <b>treatment</b> <b>regimen</b> developed by Sister Elizabeth Kenny.|$|E
25|$|Preventive dental {{treatment}} {{is also necessary}} (and often overlooked by the patient), as the lack of saliva associated with xerostomia creates an ideal environment for the proliferation of bacteria that cause cavities. Treatments include at-home topical fluoride application to strengthen tooth enamel and frequent teeth cleanings by a dental hygienist. Existing cavities must also be treated, as cavities that extend into the tooth can not be effectively treated through teeth cleaning alone, and are at {{a high risk of}} spreading into the pulp of the tooth, leading to the loss of vitality and need for extraction or root canal therapy. This <b>treatment</b> <b>regimen</b> is the same as that used for all xerostomia patients, such as those undergoing head and neck radiation therapy which often damages the salivary glands, as they are more susceptible to radiation than other body tissues.|$|E
25|$|The {{provision}} of free antiretroviral therapy to rural residents {{and the urban}} poor became policy in 2003 under the 'Four Free and One Care' policy. The National HIV/AIDS Clinical Taskforce {{took the lead in}} establishing the programme, and set up a database to monitor it. As of the end of 2006, more than 30,640 patients have been treated in 800 counties in all 31 provinces. Research to inform further expansion and improvement of the programme is ongoing. Initial reports indicate that the current <b>treatment</b> <b>regimen</b> has a high drop-out rate (at least 8%), mainly due to side-effects, drug resistance, difficulty with adherence, and progression of disease. Therefore, the government is currently exploring options within the pharmaceutical industry to make additional regimens available, which will address both the issues of compliance, by making regimens with fewer side-effects available, and resistance, by making available additional lines of treatment.|$|E

25|$|Self-efficacy is a person's {{belief that}} he or she can {{accomplish}} a particular activity. It is a related concept introduced by Albert Bandura, and has been measured by means of a psychometric scale. It differs from locus of control by relating to competence in circumscribed situations and activities (rather than more general cross-situational beliefs about control). Bandura has also emphasised differences between self-efficacy and self-esteem, using examples where low self-efficacy (for instance, in ballroom dancing) are unlikely to result in low self-esteem because competence in that domain is not very important to an individual. Although individuals may have a high internal health locus of control and feel in control of their own health, they may not feel efficacious in performing a specific <b>treatment</b> <b>regimen</b> that is essential to maintaining their own health. Self-efficacy {{plays an important role in}} one's health because when people feel that they have self-efficacy over their health conditions, the effects of their health becomes less of a stressor.|$|E

Moderate severity acne is said to occur when a higher number of inflammatory papules and pustules occur on the face compared to mild cases of acne and are found on the trunk of the body. Severe acne is said to occur when nodules (the painful 'bumps' lying under the skin) are the characteristic facial lesions and involvement of the trunk is extensive.|$|E
500|$|Rho(D) immune {{globulin}} antibodies {{are specific}} for human RhD antigen. Anti-RhD antibodies are administered {{as part of}} a prenatal <b>treatment</b> <b>regimen</b> to prevent sensitization that may occur when a Rh-negative mother has a Rh-positive fetus.
