40|$|Inorganic {{particles}} are commonly cleaned with solvents such as alcohols before being incorporated into thermoset polymers as fillers or <b>tougheners,</b> but {{the role of}} the cleaning process has never been examined. In this study, the effect of the cleaning process on the fracture behavior of particulate composites is investigated using glass bead filled epoxies as model systems. The cleaning process is shown to be a simple method to strengthen the interface between the glass beads and the epoxy matrix. Although the chemistry of the glass bead surface is unlikely to be altered by the cleaning process, submicron particles that exist on the glass bead surfaces are removed by cleaning with distilled water or ultrasonic vibration. The removal of submicron particles increases the interfacial strength between the glass beads and the matrix and changes the tensile strength of the composites. However, the modulus and fracture toughness of the composites is not significantly dependent on the cleaning process. Thus, it may be the case that debonding of the glass beads {{is not one of the}} major energy dissipating mechanisms in the fracture of glass bead filled thermoset systems. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{of a range of}} two-part toughened epoxy adhesives has been assessed in a number of modes. The structural behaviour of the adhesives in the bulk mode (cohesive) {{as a function of the}} level of cure applied has been evaluated through extensive mechanical experimentation. Thermal analysis has also been performed upon the adhesives in order to quantify the variation in both the degree of conversion and the glass transition temperature as a function of cure. Correlations between adhesive and bulk cohesive behaviour were made possible through the {{performance of}} fundamental joint strength tests. Fracture surfaces of flexural test specimens were analysed using SEM techniques allowing more detailed analysis to be made of the adhesive microstructure, specifically the morphology of the toughening phase. The mechanical {{performance of a}} range of adhesives in the presence of drawing oil was assessed as a function of cure level and substrate condition. The oil is used upon sheet steel by the automotive industry to aid forming processes and is frequently left upon substrates that are to be bonded. The effect of the presence of oil upon adhesive performance has been quantified through joint strength tests, absorption experiments and thermal analysis. The toughening components employed are of great importance to the fracture behaviour of the adhesive. When such elements are used correctly, significant gains in material performance can be made. Fracture mechanics tests were performed for various cure levels. Identical levels were also used in tests designed to monitor the phase out process of the toughening element in order to facilitate direct comparison. Using a bespoke light box and photocell, the turbidity of a model epoxy system was measured in both toughened and untoughened forms. The fracture behaviour is then directly correlated to the <b>toughener</b> phase out process. This method also allowed for deductions to be made on the morphology of the <b>toughener.</b> The work has also made many recommendations for improved processing controls as the performance of the adhesive can be tailored by alterations to not only cure temperature and durations but also substrate condition and joint design.

This property {{can be achieved}} with <b>tougheners.</b> For the present paper, core-shell impact modifiers were synthesized using ethylene–propylene copolymers (EPM), ethylene–propylene-diene copolymers (EPDM) or a mixture of both types (EP(D) M) as core material, as well as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as shell material. EP(D) M-based polymers were dispersed in water using an Ultra-Turrax® and a high pressure homogenizer. The prepared artificial latexes were used, either without further treatment or after crosslinking, as seed latexes in the emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA). The free radical seeded emulsion polymerization of MMA was investigated {{in the presence of}} an oil-soluble initiator, i. e. cumene hydroperoxide (CHP), combined with a redox system, i. e. sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate hydrate (SFS), disodium salt of ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), iron (II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO 4). This initiation system promotes polymerization of MMA near the surface of the seed particles, partially suppressing homogeneous secondary nucleation and polymerization in the aqueous phase. Kinetic and thermodynamic considerations were used to predict the particle morphology. The monomer type, the monomer-to-rubber ratio, the monomer feed type, and crosslinking of the seed latex particles were investigated, to optimize the polymerization kinetics and the properties of the resulting dispersions. The particle morphology was determined by cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Monomer-flooded conditions {{led to the formation of}} inverted core-shell particles, whereas starved–feed MMA or MMA/styrene mixtures gave rise to partially engulfed structures, i. e. snowman-like. Crosslinking of the EP(D) M seed particles was found to be required to provide the desired core-shell structures.

Epoxy resins blended with 10 wt per cent of the polyetherester exhibit an increase in toughness by 50 - 150 %, while strength and modulus decrease by 20 per cent or less. An optimal phase adhesion at levels between 70 and 85 wt per cent of soft segments in the modifier results in a maximum of toughness enhancement (by about 150 per cent) of the resin accompanied with only a slight drop in strength and stiffness (by about 15 per cent).

The nanocomposite was obtained by direct compounding of commercial PP with nanoclay masterbatch. The as-molded morphology was analyzed by X-ray and TEM analyses in terms of skin-core structure and nanoclay particle dispersion. The nanoclay particles induced the reduction of b-form spherulites, a known <b>toughener.</b> The impact behavior was assessed in tensile and biaxial modes. The PP nanocomposite molding toughness was practically unaffected by the processing melt temperature and flow rate. Conversely the nanoclay presence is influent in the impact performance. Under biaxial stress impact, the regions close to weld lines are tougher than the bulk and the fracture develops with main crack paths along the flow direction and the weld line. Cracking along the weld line results from less macromolecular interpenetration and chain entanglement, and unfavorable nanoparticle orientation. It seems that a failure mechanism which involves nanoclay delamination and multiple matrix crazing explains the toughening of PP in the directions where the nanoparticle orientation with respect to loading is adequate.

For instance, Bartkowiak-Jowsa et al.

Their results showed that PLA (PLLA) is a typical brittle material, with relatively high Young’s modulus but limited deformation at failure when compared to PCL/PGLA. In fact, mechanical brittleness or poor elongation (≤ 3  %), as well as low strength, of PL(L)A has limited its medical applications considerably. As such, some other polymers (i.e., PCL and PES) have been proposed to fabricate PLA blends for improved mechanical properties. Liang et al. (2013) investigated the tensile mechanical properties of PLLA/PCL/nano-CaCO 3 composite and evaluated the effects of blend composition on their mechanical properties. Their results showed that PCL content is helpful to improve the ductility of PLLA composite but with a sacrifice of the strength. Lu et al. (2007) examined the tensile mechanical properties of PLLA/PES composites by tensile testing and observed that the Young’s modulus increased significantly with the increase of weight fraction of PES but with a dramatic decrease of the elongation at break. In addition, the increase of temperature can also affect the ductility of the PLA as shown in Rezgui et al. (2005) who investigated the mechanical behaviour of PLA upon stretching at 50  °C. It was found that PLA underwent extensive plastic deformation, due to a dramatic reduction of yield stress, followed by a progressively increasing strain hardening. It has also been proved that the mechanical properties of PLA are less dependent on the molecular weight. For example, the tensile strength rises 20  % only when the molecular weight increases from 107, 000 to 550, 000  g/mol (Isabelle & Lan 2009). As reviewed by Hamad et al. (2015), PLA has good mechanical properties, especially tensile Young’s modulus and tensile strength, but limited elongation at fracture and low impact strength when compared to other traditional polymers. To improve its ductility, PLA can be blended with polymeric <b>tougheners</b> (e.g., PCL, PBS, PPC and PHA) and the effects can be controlled by varying size, volume fraction, substructure and inherent property of the dispersed toughening phase (Liu & Zhang 2011). As reported in Rasal et al. (2010), surface- and bulk-modification strategies could be used to toughen PLA, but usually associated with a loss of tensile strength or modulus. They pointed out that the development of PLA-nanocomposites may be a promising approach to improve PLA properties.|$|R

Polypopylene/nanoclay three-dimensional {{parts were}} produced without intermediate steps by direct injection molding {{to explore the}} influence of flow features and nanoclay incorporation in their impact performance. The nanocomposite was obtained by direct compounding of commercial PP with nanoclay masterbatch. The as-molded morphology was analyzed by X-ray and TEM analyses in terms of skin-core structure and nanoclay particle dispersion. The nanoclay particles induced the reduction of β-form spherulites, a known <b>toughener.</b> The impact behavior was assessed in tensile and biaxial modes. The PP nanocomposite molding toughness was practically unaffected by the processing melt temperature and flow rate. Conversely the nanoclay presence is influent in the impact performance. Under biaxial stress impact, the regions close to weld lines are tougher than the bulk and the fracture develops with main crack paths along the flow direction and the weld line. Cracking along the weld line results from less macromolecular interpenetration and chain entanglement, and unfavorable nanoparticle orientation. It seems that a failure mechanism which involves nanoclay delamination and multiple matrix crazing explains the toughening of PP in the directions where the nanoparticle orientation with respect to loading is adequate.

40|$|As {{a part of}} {{a larger}} effort towards the {{fundamental}} understanding of mechanical behaviors of polymers toughened by nanoparticles, this dissertation focuses on the structure-property relationship of epoxies modified with nano-sized poly(ethylene-altpropylene) - b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEP-PEO) block copolymer (BCP) micelle particles. The amphiphilic BCP <b>toughener</b> was incorporated into a liquid epoxy resin and selfassembled into well-dispersed 15 nm spherical micelle particles. The nano-sized BCP, at 5 wt% loading, can significantly improve the fracture toughness of epoxy (ca. 180 % improvement) without reducing modulus at room temperature and exhibits only a slight drop (ca. 5 ?C) in glass transition temperature (Tg). The toughening mechanisms were found to be BCP micelle nanoparticle cavitation, followed by matrix shear banding, which mainly accounted for the observed remarkable toughening effect. The unexpected ?nano-cavitation? phenomenon cannot be predicted by existing physical models. The plausible causes for the observed nano-scale cavitation and other mechanical behaviors may include the unique structural characteristics of BCP micelles and the influence from the surrounding epoxy network, which is significantly modified by the epoxy-miscible PEO block. Other mechanisms, such as crack tip blunting, may also {{play a role in the}} toughening. Structure-property relationships of this nano-domain modified polymer are discussed. In addition, other important factors, such as strain rate dependence and matrix crosslink density effect on toughening, have been investigated. This BCP toughening approach and conventional rubber toughening techniques are compared. Insights on the decoupling of modulus, toughness, and Tg for designing high performance thermosetting materials with desirable physical and mechanical properties are discussed...|$|E
