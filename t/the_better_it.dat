25|$|The factors {{governing}} the word order within noun phrases are not known.

25|$|Radar systems must {{overcome}} unwanted signals {{in order to}} focus on the targets of interest. These unwanted signals may originate from internal and external sources, both passive and active. The ability of the radar system to overcome these unwanted signals defines its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). SNR is defined as the ratio of the signal power to the noise power within the desired signal; it compares the level of a desired target signal to the level of background noise (atmospheric noise and noise generated within the receiver). The higher a system's SNR <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>it</b> is at discriminating actual targets from noise signals.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} in {{the characteristics of the}} nests within the Vespula vulgaris species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close {{to the surface of the}} ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. Because heat is less well insulated above the ground, the wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>it</b> will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32°C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.|$|E

25|$|The Samaritans {{interpret}} the deuteronomic commandment to mean displaying any select text from the Samaritan {{version of the}} five Books of Moses. This can contain a blessing or a particularly holy or uplifting message. In the past they placed a stone plaque inscribed with the Ten Commandments above the house door, some examples {{dating back to the}} Byzantine (4th-7th century) and Early Muslim (7th-11th century) periods being now shown in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. Nowadays a Samaritan mezuzah is usually made of either marble, a wooden plate, or a sheet of parchment or high quality paper, on which they inscribe select verses from the Samaritan Torah. This they place either above the house door, or inside the house, in the entrance hall or at a prominent place on a large wall. These mezuzot are found in every Samaritan household {{as well as in the}} synagogue. Today some Samaritans would also use a Jewish-style mezuzah case and place inside it a small written Samaritan scroll, i.e. a text from the Samaritan Torah, written in the Samaritan alphabet. The more such mezuzot there are in the house, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>it</b> is considered to be.|$|E
25|$|Plots of {{the four}} results above in the ROC space are given in the figure. The result of method A clearly shows the best {{predictive}} power among A, B, and C. The result of B lies on the random guess line (the diagonal line), {{and it can be}} seen in the table that the accuracy of B is 50%. However, when C is mirrored across the center point (0.5,0.5), the resulting method C′ is even better than A. This mirrored method simply reverses the predictions of whatever method or test produced the C contingency table. Although the original C method has negative predictive power, simply reversing its decisions leads to a new predictive method C′ which has positive predictive power. When the C method predicts p or n, the C′ method would predict n or p, respectively. In this manner, the C′ test would perform the best. The closer a result from a contingency table is to the upper left corner, <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>it</b> predicts, but the distance from the random guess line in either direction is the best indicator of how much predictive power a method has. If the result is below the line (i.e. the method is worse than a random guess), all of the method's predictions must be reversed in order to utilize its power, thereby moving the result above the random guess line.|$|E

500|$|Until 1956, tankers were {{designed}} {{to be able to}} navigate the Suez Canal. This size restriction became much less of a priority after the closing of the canal during the Suez Crisis of 1956. Forced to move oil around the Cape of Good Hope, shipowners realized that bigger tankers were the key to more efficient transport. While a typical T2 tanker of the World War II era was [...] long and had a capacity of , the ultra-large crude carriers (ULCC) built in the 1970s were over [...] long and had a capacity of [...] Several factors encouraged this growth. Hostilities in the Middle East which interrupted traffic through the Suez Canal contributed, as did nationalization of Middle East oil refineries. Fierce competition among shipowners also played a part. But apart from these considerations is a simple economic advantage: the larger an oil tanker is, the more cheaply it can move crude oil, and <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>it</b> can help meet growing demands for oil.|$|E
500|$|Once the Mangekyou Sharingan {{has been}} gained, the Uchiha user suffers from ever-deteriorating eyesight, {{a process that}} is aggravated by {{repeated}} use and culminates in blindness. One's eyesight can be permanently restored by taking and transplanting the eyes of another Uchiha clan member, a process that results in the creation of an [...] "Eternal" [...] Mangekyō Sharingan (永遠の万華鏡写輪眼, Eien no Mangekyō Sharingan). The tighter the blood ties are between the [...] "donor" [...] and the receiver (e.g.: siblings), <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>it</b> is for compatibility. Not only does this process permanently restore one's eyesight, with the exception of using Izanagi or Izanami, but it also gives the person even greater power. The Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan also seems to change form from the original, with {{what appears to be a}} fusion of the current owner's Mangekyo with the previous owner's. Madara was the first Uchiha to awaken the Eternal Mangekyō by taking the eyes of his younger brother, Izuna, to regain his sight, giving him great power. After suffering from onset near-total blindness from overuse of his ocular powers, Sasuke underwent the process himself with Itachi's eyes, granting him all of Itachi's ocular powers in addition to his own. However, the side effects of using the Mangekyō might not be applicable to all users, as Obito has been shown to use his Kamui ability nearly all the time and does not become exhausted or suffer from deteriorating eyesight. Mangekyō Sharingan can also evolve further to become Rinnegan, as in the case of Madara. However, he only managed to achieve that because he was the current reincarnation of one of the Sage of the Six Paths' son, Indra, and had injected himself with the DNA of Hashirama (the reincarnation of the sage's other son, Asura), which would grant the person with the sage's own power. The process also happens only near the end of the user's natural lifespan. However, Sasuke awakened a Rinnegan unique to him in his left eye after receiving the Sage of the Six Paths' Yin Chakra. His Rinnegan is a six-tomoe variant, with six tomoe on the first two rings of the Rinnegan. Although he awakened the Rinnegan, Sasuke can still access the powers of his Mangekyō Sharingan (e.g. Amaterasu and Susanoo). He also awakened a Perfect Susanoo (Complete Body Susanoo) that rivals Madara's. His Susanoo has wings that enable him to fly.|$|E
