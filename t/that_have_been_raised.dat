25|$|The Shroud of Turin, a linen cloth that {{tradition}} associates with the crucifixion and burial of Jesus, has undergone numerous scientific tests, {{the most notable}} of which is radiocarbon dating, {{in an attempt to}} determine the relic's authenticity. In 1988, scientists at three separate laboratories dated samples from the Shroud to a range of 1260–1390 CE, which coincides with the first certain appearance of the shroud in the 1350s and is much later than the burial of Jesus in 30 or 33 CE. Aspects of the 1988 test continue to be debated. Despite some technical concerns <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about radiocarbon dating of the Shroud, most experts assert that such dating is reliable.|$|E
25|$|Some {{concerns}} <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> {{about the}} MRHA include {{the lack of}} checks on the Minister's power to issue a restraining order; the difficulty of distinguishing between religious and political matters where moral and social issues are involved, which might be a particular problem for religions such as Islam and Christianity that have comprehensive worldviews; {{and the lack of}} transparency of the PCRH's proceedings which are held in private. The consistency of the MRHA with Article 15 of the Constitution of Singapore, which guarantees the right to freedom of religion, has not yet been tested in court, though the Act may be a restriction on the right authorized by Article 15(4) as it can be regarded as a law relating to public order.|$|E

500|$|... {{international}} observers noted {{issues in}} several human rights areas. Excessive force {{was seen to}} be used by police forces, security forces were able to act with impunity, mob violence was occasionally seen, and prison conditions continued to be harsh and sometimes life-threatening. However, the government was seen to make some effort to prosecute security forces who used excessive force. Other legal issues included limits on free speech and freedom of the press, lengthy pretrial detentions, and arbitrary arrests and detentions. Societal issues found included violence against women, human trafficking, and child labour. Corruption within the government is seen as a major issue, despite the Malawi Anti-Corruption Bureau's (ACB) attempts to reduce it. The ACB appears to be successful at finding and prosecuting low level corruption, but higher level officials appear to be able to act with impunity. Corruption within security forces is also an issue. Malawi had one of the highest rates of child marriage in the world. In 2015 Malawi raised the legal age for marriage from 15 to 18. Other issues <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> are lack of adequate legal protection of women from sexual abuse and harassment, very high maternal mortality rate, and abuse related to accusations of witchcraft.|$|E

2500|$|This {{case has}} {{prompted}} some commentators {{to discuss the}} futility of life support in such cases and even {{refer to it as}} [...] "death support". Other questions <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> include how California law treats brain death and whether McMath's case could change existing laws and practices. McMath's attorney, Christopher Dolan said, [...] "There would have been no legal battle if Jahi had had her tonsils out in New Jersey”, referring to a New Jersey state law allowing religious objection to a declaration of death on the basis of neurological criteria. Public confusion surrounding differences between brain death and cardiac death raised by this case led some doctors to voice concern about how the case could affect live organ recovery from brain dead patients. The impact of this case on medical negligence awards in California has also been discussed, as there is no compensation limit if the patient is alive, while compensation is capped at $250,000 if the patient has died.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{articles}} from August 2012 by Joel Wing, {{who runs the}} blog Musings on Iraq, explore many of the major flaws <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> by various researchers over the years. Wing notes that, [...] "The two Lancet studies taken at face value seemed like legitimate {{estimates of the number}} of Iraqis that might have been killed after the 2003 invasion," [...] but finds that, [...] "There is evidence that the authors overestimated the number of post-invasion Iraq deaths, did not include data that contradicted their findings, and misrepresented other reports about casualties during the Iraq War to bolster their argument. The Iraqi survey teams might not have followed protocol and the methodology, and some may have faked their results. The responses of the Lancet writers to their critics have been a series of convenient and contradictory statements, and their refusal to openly share all of their data only adds to the suspicions that their work is deeply flawed." [...] Wing concludes that other credible studies [...] "should be consulted first, while the two Lancet papers should be dismissed." ...|$|E
2500|$|United States State Department {{spokesman}} Robert Wood said [...] "we're {{calling on}} the parties to refrain from further violence and resolve their differences peacefully and through peaceful means." [...] In regard {{to the way the}} election was handled, Wood declared that the State Department is [...] "still assessing" [...] and that, at the moment of the briefing, [...] "he thinks [...] we basically share that assessment that the OSCE gave." [...] Asif Chaudhry, the US ambassador, stated that [...] "the authorities acted with restraint on Tuesday, as the demonstration in front of the Presidential Palace and the Parliament building went out of control resulting in property damage and injuries. Thus, the potential for more grave consequences was avoided." [...] He also expressed concerns about the arrests that took place after the riot. United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton wrote to president Vladimir Voronin: [...] "As our Embassy and the Department of State noted in public statements, we condemn the violence which occurred in the days following the election. We believe it would be helpful for your Government to address the concerns <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about the conduct of the election, as well as the treatment of detainees, journalists, and representatives of civil society following the violence." [...] Students and activists hoisted picket signs in Boston, Washington, D.C., and New York City on 13 April, to protest the incumbent Communist Party's victory.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the criticisms}} <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about the way that Campbell laid out the monomyth of the hero's journey in Hero with a Thousand Faces was that it focused on the {{masculine}} journey. Although this was not altogether true—the princess of the Grimms' [...] "The Frog Prince" [...] tale and the saga of the hero-goddess Inanna's descent into the underworld feature prominently in Campbell's schema—it was, nonetheless, a criticism <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> about the book since its publication.|$|R

60|$|Each man {{born into}} the world is born like Shelton in this book--to go a journey, {{and for the most}} part he is born on the high road. At first he sits there in the dust, with his little chubby hands {{reaching}} at nothing, and his little solemn eyes staring into space. As soon as he can toddle, he moves, by the queer instinct we call the love of life, straight along this road, looking neither to the right nor left, so pleased is he to walk. And he is charmed with everything--with the nice flat road, all broad and white, with his own feet, and with the prospect he can see on either hand. The sun shines, and he finds the road a little hot and dusty; the rain falls, and he splashes through the muddy puddles. It makes no matter--all is pleasant; his fathers went this way before him; they made this road for him to tread, and, when they bred him, passed into his fibre the love of doing things as they themselves had done them. So he walks on and on, resting comfortably at nights under the roofs <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> to shelter him, by those who went before.|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the day alluded to, Westminster Abbey, as usual, was open to the {{inspection}} of the curious and interested. Several parties were scattered among its aisles and chapels, some reading the inscriptions on the simple tablets of the dead which illustrate a nation, in illustrating themselves; others listening to the names of princes who derived their consequence from their thrones and alliances; and still other sets, who were wandering among the more elaborate memorials <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> equally to illustrate insignificance, and to mark the final resting-places of more modern heroes and statesmen. The beauty of the weather had brought out more visiters than common, and not less than half-a-dozen equipages were in waiting, in and about Palace Yard. Among others, one had a ducal coronet. This carriage did not fail to attract the attention that is more than usually bestowed on rank, in England. All were empty, however, and more than one party of pedestrians entered the venerable edifice, rejoicing that the view of a duke or a duchess, was to be thrown in, among the other sights, gratuitously. All who passed on foot, however, were not influenced by this vulgar feeling; for, one group went by, that did not even cast a glance at the collection of carriages; the seniors of the party being too much accustomed to such things to lend them a thought, and the juniors too full of anticipations of what they were about to see, to think of other matters. This party consisted of a handsome man of fifty-odd, a lady some three or four years his junior well preserved and still exceedingly attractive; a young man of twenty-six, and two lovely girls, that looked like twins; though one was really twenty-one, and the other but nineteen. These were Sir Wycherly and Lady Wychecombe, Wycherly their only son, then just returned from a five years' peregrination on the continent of Europe, and Mildred and Agnes, their daughters. The rest of the family had arrived in England about a fortnight before, to greet the heir on his return from the grand tour, as it was then termed. The meeting had been one of love, though Lady Wychecombe had to reprove a few innocent foreign affectations, as she fancied them to be, in her son; and the baronet, himself, laughed at the scraps of French, Italian, and German, that quite naturally mingled in the young man's discourse. All this, however, cast no cloud over the party, for it had ever been a family of entire confidence and unbroken love.|$|E
