40|$|Confocal laser {{scanning}} microscopy (CLSM) {{is a relatively new}} technique for microscopic imaging. It has found a wide field of application in the general sphere of biological sciences. It has completely changed the study of cells and tissues by allowing greater resolution, optical sectioning of the sample and three-dimensional sanoke reconstruction. Confocal microscopy represents a valid, precious and useful tool capable of providing data (images) of unrivalled clearness and definition. This review discusses the possible applications of confocal microscopy in specific fields of forensic investigation, with specific regard to ballistics, forensic histopathology and <b>toxicological</b> <b>pathology...</b>|$|E
40|$|Polymerase chain {{reaction}} (PCR) and {{in situ hybridization}} (ISH) have revolutionized the study of genes and gene expression, {{and many of these}} molecular biology advances will greatly impact research in <b>toxicological</b> <b>pathology.</b> PCR {{is one of the most}} powerful tools in molecular biology and involves primer-mediated enzymatic in vitro amplification of specific target DNA sequences. Recent innovative methods utilizing PCR technology have been developed to detect mutations in neoplastic and small subpopulations of cells, to study biomarkers of genetic susceptibility and genes involved with carcinogen metabolism, to estimate mutation frequencies, to find novel genes induced by chemical exposure, and to characterize gene expression. ISH provides data on individual cells rather than an average of total cellular populations and allows analysis for heterogeneity. When combined with PCR. the sensitivity of ISH is elevated, and single-copy DNA sequences, single-base mutations, or low copies of messenger RNA (mRNA) can potentially be detected within individual cells. Herein are reviewed ISH- and PCR-based techniques such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect point mutations, allelotypic analysis for loss of heterozygosity, differential display of mRNA to characterize gene expression, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase {{chain reaction}}, and in situ polymerase chain reaction with emphasis on current or potential applications in <b>toxicological</b> <b>pathology.</b> These new and evolving techniques offer tremendous potential in providing new insights into the molecular basis of toxicity and carcinogenesis...|$|E

40|$|The rodent {{bioassay}} {{has been}} a mainstay of carcinogenic risk assessment for close to half a century; not {{that it has been}} without criticism in that time. As early as the 1990 s, there were clearly established shortcomings with regard to relevance and extrapolation, but despite these concerns, this test continues relatively unchanged. As our understanding of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and the availability of investigative techniques improve, there seems less reason than ever to persist with this exercise that provides little meaningful scientific data at great cost in terms of animal usage and pathologist time. This article highlights possible ways to gather and present data pertinent to carcinogenesis in man and suggests that it is the <b>toxicological</b> <b>pathology</b> community that should take the lead here in persuading regulators that there is great room for improvement in this par-ticular aspect of regulatory pathology...|$|E
40|$|It {{is highly}} {{desirable}} to use experimental methodologies in <b>toxicological</b> <b>pathology</b> that combine statistical power, practicality, and objective reviewability to detect small differences. The {{different ways of}} gathering data at the microscope can result in clear differences in power to discriminate small, but real, differences between treated and control rodent groups with nonneoplastic lesions. Six alternative methods of gathering and analysing results are compared. They {{are referred to as}} the Measuring, Ordering, Scoring (or Grading), Pair-contrast, Outside-control, and Affected methods. Measuring and Ordering methods are uniformly more powerful than other more common and highly esteemed methods, such as Scoring/Grading. From the practical perspective, Measuring and Ordering can be applied objectively, reviewed objectively, and interpreted to standards that are widely accepted as valid throughout experimental science e. g., using confidence limits and intervals. They also are intuitively natural extensions of routine toxicological histopathological examinations. Establishing a small difference between control and treated groups is commonly a problem when reporting no-observed-effect levels. Ordering is the recommended method for assessing if a small difference between treated and control groups is within chance variation or {{is the result of a}} true treatment effect, when measurement is impractical...|$|E
40|$|<b>Toxicological</b> <b>pathology</b> of lymphoid organs {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the risk assessment process of immunotoxicants. Identification of chemicals that have the potential to cause injury to the immune system is of considerable public health significance because of the role of the immune system in infectious diseases, hypersensitivity reactions and autoimmune diseases. In assessing immunotoxicity, a two-tier testing system is usually employed in rodents in which the first tier is a general screen for (immuno) toxicity including enhanced histopathology of lymphoid organs and the second tier consists of more specific immune function studies including host resistance tests or mechanistic studies. Studies with the potent immunotoxicants TCDD, TBTO, HCB, azathioprine and cyclosporin A are discussed, which provide data correlating histopathology with immune function changes. This is followed by a discussion of the outcomes of enhanced histopathology investigation in the interlaboratory validation studies with azathioprine, cyclosporin A and HCB in the rat, as well as the results of a recent evaluation of enhanced histopathology in the mouse as an indicator of immunotoxicity. From these studies, that have been the basis for a number of regulatory activities, the following conclusions can be drawn: i) the consistency between histopathology and functional tests, ii) the complimentary information of pathology and immunology observations, and iii) the dependence on standardised protocols and trained toxicologic pathologists to accurately identify and grade microscopical changes in lymphoid organs and tissues...|$|E
40|$|The latest {{advances}} in digital cameras combined with powerful computer software {{enable us to}} store high-quality microscopy images of specimen. Studying hundreds of images manually is very time consuming and has the problem of human subjectivity and inconsistency. Quantitative image analysis is an emerging field and has {{found its way into}} analysis of microscopy images for clinical and research purposes. When developing a pipeline, it is important that its components are simple enough to be generalized and have predictive value. This thesis addresses the automation of quantitative analysis of tissue in two different fields: pathology and plant biology. Testicular tissue is a complex structure consisting of seminiferous tubules. The epithelial layer of a seminiferous tubule contains cells that differentiate from primitive germ cells to spermatozoa in a number of steps. These steps are combined in 12 stages in the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium in the mink. The society of <b>toxicological</b> <b>pathology</b> recommends classifying the testicular epithelial into different stages when assessing tissue damage to determine if the dynamics in the spermatogenic cycle have been disturbed. This thesis presents two automated methods for fast and robust segmentation of tubules, and an automated method of staging them. For better accuracy and statistical analysis, we proposed to pool stages into 5 groups. This pooling is suggested based on the morphology of tubules. In the 5 stage case, the overall number of correctly classified tubules is 79. 6 %. Contextual information on the localization of fluorescence in microscopy images of plant specimen help us to better understand differentiation and maturation of stem cells into tissues. We propose a pipeline for automated segmentation and classification of the cells in a whole cross-section of Arabidopsis hypocotyl, stem, or root. As proof-of-concept that the classification provides a meaningful basis to group cells for fluorescence characterization, we probed tissues with an antibody specific to xylem vessels in the secondary cell wall. Fluorescence intensity in different classes of cells is measured by the pipeline. The measurement results clearly show that the xylem vessels are the dominant cell type that exhibit a fluorescence signal...|$|E
