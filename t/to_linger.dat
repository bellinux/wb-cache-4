5|$|Decapitation was the {{preferred}} method in German and western Slavic areas, {{with the head}} buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act {{was seen as a}} way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremony}} is often held weeks, months, or {{years after the}} death so that the deceased's family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses. Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward Puya (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, {{the body of the}} deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the tongkonan. The soul of the deceased is thought <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> around the village until the funeral {{ceremony is}} completed, after which it begins its journey to Puya.|$|E

5|$|Socio-economic {{problems}} of the region {{that had not been}} addressed during British Raj continued <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> and were reflected in a representation made to the Constituent Assembly of India in 1947, which highlighted the issues of regional autonomy and Nepali nationality in Darjeeling and adjacent areas. After the independence of India in 1947, Darjeeling was merged with the state of West Bengal. A separate district of Darjeeling was established consisting of the hill towns of Darjeeling, Kurseong, Kalimpong and some parts of the Terai region. While the hill population comprised mainly ethnic Nepalis, the plains harboured a large ethnic Bengali population who were refugees from the Partition of India. A cautious and non-receptive response by the West Bengal government to most demands of the ethnic Nepali population led to increased calls, in the 1950s and 1960s, for Darjeeling's autonomy and for the recognition of the Nepali language; the state government acceded to the latter demand in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} Dutch attacks led Sudirman, {{perhaps at}} the suggestion of one of his men, to change his clothes and give his old outfit to one of his soldiers, Second Lieutenant Heru Kesser– who bore a resemblance to Sudirman. Kesser was ordered to head south with a large company of soldiers, remove the clothes, and furtively return north, while Sudirman waited in Karangnongko. The diversion was successful, and on 27December Sudirman and his men made their way to Jambu Village. Arriving on 9January 1949, Sudirman met with several government ministers who had not been present during the Dutch attack on Yogyakarta: Supeno, Susanto Tirtoprojo, and Susilowati. With the politicians, Sudirman made his way to Banyutuwo, ordering some of his soldiers <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> back and hold off Dutch ground troops. In Banyutuwo, they held for over a week. However, on 21January, when Dutch forces approached the village, Sudirman and his entourage were forced to leave, fighting their way out in heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|Tomb of Horrors {{is set in}} the World of Greyhawk, a D {{campaign}} setting. In Tomb of Horrors, the adventurers {{encounter a}} number of tricks and traps while attempting to penetrate the tomb of a dead wizard. As the scenario begins, the players are told that the evil wizard Acererak is said <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> in his ancient tomb in undead form. Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.|$|E

25|$|The {{flora and}} the fauna consist of taxa adapted to drought. Terrestrial fauna is scant; {{there are no}} truly native land mammals and only one native land bird – Kiribati's endemic reed-warbler, the bokikokiko (Acrocephalus aequinoctialis). The 1957 attempt to {{introduce}} the endangered Rimitara lorikeet (Vini kuhlii) has largely failed; a few birds seem <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> on, {{but the lack of}} abundant coconut palm forest, on which this tiny parrot depends, makes Kiritimati a suboptimal habitat for this species.|$|E
25|$|By early August, Zissu and the Mossad {{were again}} collaborating on {{the rescue of}} Hungarian Jews {{escaping}} the Holocaust. His work was tolerated by Antonescu, on condition that no refugees would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> in Romania-proper. In all, Zissu claimed to have personally rescued some 14,000 of his coreligionists by obtaining them safe passage to Turkey. He is also credited with having sent over seven individual transports, of which the Mefküre was torpedoed by the Germans.|$|E
25|$|Johann Pachelbel {{died at the}} age of 52, {{in early}} March 1706, and was buried on 9 March; Mattheson cites either 3 March or 7 March 1706 as the death date, yet it is {{unlikely}} that the corpse was allowed <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> unburied as long as six days. Contemporary custom was to bury the dead on the third or fourth post-mortem day; so, either 6 or 7 March 1706 is a likelier death date. He is buried in the St. Rochus Cemetery.|$|E
50|$|Kiira Korpi was {{originally}} nominated to represent Finland, but announced her withdrawal on March 16, 2012 due <b>to</b> <b>lingering</b> foot and hip injuries. Alisa Mikonsaari {{was chosen to}} take {{her place in the}} competition.|$|R

25|$|In the United States, {{developers}} such as A. Alfred Taubman of Taubman Centers {{extended the}} concept further in 1980, with terrazzo tiles at the Mall at Short Hills in New Jersey, indoor fountains, and two levels allowing a shopper {{to make a}} circuit of all the stores. Taubman believed carpeting increased friction, slowing down customers, so it was removed. Fading daylight through glass panels was supplemented by gradually increased electric lighting, making it seem like the afternoon was lasting longer, which encouraged shoppers <b>to</b> <b>linger.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{phenomena}} {{are well}} documented during witnessed meteorite falls {{too small to}} produce hypervelocity craters. The fireball that occurs as the meteoroid passes through the atmosphere can appear to be very bright, rivaling the sun in intensity, although most are far dimmer and {{may not even be}} noticed during daytime. Various colors have been reported, including yellow, green, and red. Flashes and bursts of light can occur as the object breaks up. Explosions, detonations, and rumblings are often heard during meteorite falls, which can be caused by sonic booms as well as shock waves resulting from major fragmentation events. These sounds can be heard over wide areas, with a radius of a hundred or more kilometers. Whistling and hissing sounds are also sometimes heard, but are poorly understood. Following passage of the fireball, {{it is not unusual for}} a dust trail <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> in the atmosphere for several minutes.|$|E
25|$|The Nets {{were in the}} mix {{prior to}} the season to be contenders in the Eastern Conference {{alongside}} the Miami Heat. Pierce and Garnett were set to be the 'supporting cast' to Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, and Brook Lopez. However, with Lopez going down with a season-ending injury in December, Pierce was entrusted with the starting power forward spot. As the season moved along and the Nets continued to struggle, doubt began to creep around the locker room, front office, and fan base. That's when the Nets saw revitalization in Pierce's game and his never-say-die attitude. After scrapping past the Toronto Raptors {{in the first round}} of the playoffs thanks to a last-second block from Pierce in Game 7, their attempt to get past the Heat and win a championship fell short. They lost to Miami in five games in the second round, and questions began <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> about whether Pierce would give it another year in Brooklyn.|$|E

25|$|National Museum of the Château de Pau: {{created in}} 1929 and {{housed in the}} castle in which was born the future Henry IV on 13 December 1553. Not only a genuine medieval fortress, but also a Renaissance palace and Royal residence, this {{beautiful}} museum located {{in the heart of}} the city is one of the most visited national museums of France (average of 100,000 visitors per year). Visitors like <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> before the huge turtle shell, legendary birthplace of the good King Henry IV. Successive conservators are keen to bring together paintings, art objects and documents relating to the time of Henry IV. Inside, simple and warm decor with wood-panelled walls, enhanced with threads of gold, coffered ceilings and superb Gobelins tapestries, houses one of the finest collections of France. The dining room always surprises the visitors by its large table that can accommodate 100 guests while stunning works of art lining the major walls show colourfully.|$|E
25|$|Three {{recent studies}} by the Washington Department of Ecology showed that toxic {{chemicals}} banned decades ago continue <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> in the environment and concentrate in the food chain. In one of the studies, state government scientists found unacceptable levels of toxic substances in 93 samples of freshwater fish collected from 45 sites. The toxic substances included PCBs; dioxins, two chlorinated pesticides, DDE and dieldrin, and PBDEs. As {{a result of the}} study, the department will investigate the sources of PCBs in the Wenatchee River, where unhealthy levels of PCBs were found in mountain whitefish. Based on the 2007 information and a previous 2004 Ecology study, the Washington State Department of Health is advising the public not to eat mountain whitefish from the Wenatchee River from Leavenworth downstream to where the river joins the Columbia, due to unhealthy levels of PCBs. Study results also indicated high levels of contaminants in fish tissue that scientists collected from Lake Washington and the Spokane River, where fish consumption advisories are already in effect.|$|E
500|$|In 1829, Irving {{moved into}} Granada's ancient palace Alhambra, [...] "determined <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> here", he said, [...] "until I get some {{writings}} under way {{connected with the}} place". Before he could get any significant writing underway, however, he was notified of his appointment as Secretary to the American Legation in London. Worried he would disappoint friends and family if he refused the position, Irving left Spain for England in July 1829.|$|E
50|$|In December 2007, {{after much}} {{speculation}}, Tredrea re-signed with the Power {{for a further}} year.

500|$|In 2004, GNT Planning {{included}} the theater as an [...] "Investment and Identity Site" [...] in their report, which {{was commissioned by}} the Division Vision Coalition (DVC), a coalition of community members from the nearby business and neighborhood associations. DVC is invested in the [...] "economy of locally-owned businesses, an attractive streetscape that invites neighbors <b>to</b> <b>linger,</b> and sustainable features that are ecologically sensitive". The building was identified as having attributes valued by the community, including quality architecture, local ownership, and orientation to the street.|$|E
500|$|Chaco Canyon is watered by winter {{storms and}} {{localized}} summer rains that fill the arroyos. Chaco Wash is deep, and it drains {{to the water}} table located [...] below the canyon floor. Farming terraces on the mesa wall behind Chetro Ketl {{may have been used}} for growing specialized crops such as tobacco, and canals running from Pueblo Bonito to Chetro Ketl probably carried rain water. Chetro Ketl's position in downtown Chaco and its proximity to South Gap further aided agricultural efforts near the great house, as summer storms tended <b>to</b> <b>linger</b> in the opening, funneling moisture to the area.|$|E
500|$|In April 1850, the Ohio Women's Convention met in Salem, Ohio a {{few weeks}} before a state {{convention}} met to revise the Ohio state constitution.

[...] Stone sent a letter praising their initiative and said, “Massachusetts ought to have taken the lead in the work you are now doing, but if she chooses <b>to</b> <b>linger,</b> let her young sisters of the West set her a worthy example; and if the ‘Pilgrim spirit is not dead,’ we’ll pledge Massachusetts to follow her.” ...|$|E
