5|$|The Bible {{may contain}} an early account of rhabdomyolysis.

A plague then broke out, killing numerous people. Rhabdomyolysis after consuming quail was described in more recent times and called coturnism (after Coturnix, the main quail genus). Migrating quail consume large amounts of hemlock, a known cause of rhabdomyolysis.|$|E

5|$|Freeway {{construction}} {{continued through}} the 1970s. On April 6, 1972, the New Buffalo Welcome Center was relocated from its previous location next to US12 to one adjacent to I-94. Later that year, the state switched paint colors for its centerlines; yellow {{was used for the}} lines separating directions of travel and white for lines separating lanes <b>traveling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction. Also in 1972, a gas tax increase was passed to facilitate US and state highway improvement projects. The final section of I-75 between Alger and Roscommon was opened on November 1, 1973, in a dedication by Governor William G. Milliken, completing the longest highway in the state. In 1974, the state implemented mileage-based exit numbers along the remaining Interstates in Michigan. By late 1977, the state highway department shifted its focus from construction of new highways to improvements of the existing system.|$|E

5|$|From August 1940 to June 1941, the German Luftwaffe (air force) unit III./KG 40, {{which was}} based at Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport in {{southern}} France and equipped with Focke-Wulf Fw200 Condors, attacked Allied shipping travelling in the Atlantic. The unit {{made a number of}} successful attacks on convoys and individual ships <b>traveling</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Western Approaches {{as well as on the}} route between Britain and Gibraltar. In response, the Allies increased the anti-aircraft armament carried by many merchant ships, and began to deploy CAM ships and escort carriers to provide fighter protection for convoys. During the last six months of 1941 these improved defences inflicted heavy losses on the Condor force, and it ceased attacking shipping in early 1942. In 1942, III./KG40 mainly operated in the reconnaissance role and reported targets for U-boats to attack. A small number of attacks were made on ships travelling between Britain and Gibraltar from May onwards, but these cost the unit eight Condors destroyed in action and seven in accidents for no sinkings. As a result of the Condor's vulnerability to Allied defences, the commander of the Luftwaffe's Atlantic anti-shipping force (Fliegerführer Atlantik) recommended in December that the aircraft be withdrawn from service.|$|E
