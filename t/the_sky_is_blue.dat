5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> <b>blue.</b> Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E
5|$|The Mysore Zoo, {{established}} in 1892, the Karanji, Kukkarahalli and the Blue Lagoon Lake are popular recreational destinations. Blue Lagoon {{which is a}} lake with a mini island is located behind KRS water Dam {{and it is very}} mesmerising to be there and watch the sunset and sunrise. The colour of the water and <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> <b>Blue</b> and there is a mini island in the middle due to which it was named as Blue Lagoon. Mysuru has the Regional Museum of Natural History, the Folk Lore Museum, the Railway Museum and the Oriental Research Institute. The city is a centre for yoga-related health tourism that attracts domestic and foreign visitors, particularly those who, for years, came to study with the late ashtanga yoga guru K. Pattabhi Jois.|$|E

25|$|East Asian {{languages}} {{may have}} had some influence {{on the development of}} Esperanto grammar after its creation.

(may my daughter be beautiful!) for the mia filino estu bela! mentioned above.|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Mental Events" [...] (1970) Davidson {{advanced}} {{a form of}} token identity {{theory about}} the mind: token mental events are identical to token physical events. One previous difficulty with such a view was {{that it did not}} seem feasible to provide laws relating mental states, like believing that <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> <b>blue</b> or wanting a hamburger, to physical states, such as patterns of neural activity in the brain. [...] Davidson argued that such a reduction would not be necessary to a token identity thesis: it is possible that each individual mental event just is the corresponding physical event, without there being laws relating types (as opposed to tokens) of mental events to types of physical events. Davidson argued that the fact that no such a reduction could be had does not entail that the mind is anything more than the brain. Hence, Davidson called his position anomalous monism: monism, because it claims that only one thing is at issue in questions of mental and physical events; anomalous (from a-, [...] "not," [...] and omalos, [...] "regular") because mental and physical event types could not be connected by strict laws (laws without exceptions).|$|E

Merry laughter often rises from the groups on the bank, and the air rings with the sharp sound made by pieces of ice sent skimming by mischievous boys over the glassy surface, to the disgust of skaters, who foresee future falls as the result of these fragments should a slight thaw freeze them to the surface.|$|E
