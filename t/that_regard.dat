5|$|Cast members {{observed}} {{the staff at}} real hospitals in preparation for their roles. Stephenson and Griffin spent time at Watford Hospital, where they underwent {{a crash course in}} nursing basics, including handling bed pans and learning to make beds with hospital corners. Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, while French shadowed a consultant and registrar at Papworth Hospital, observing a heart bypass and lung biopsy procedure. Young explained that viewers believe in Casualty and trust the show to be realistic, and that he wanted Holby City to be the same in <b>that</b> <b>regard.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{it came to}} {{personal}} politics, Crawford aligned herself as a Democrat who greatly supported, and admired, the administrations of John F. Kennedy and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She was once noted as saying: The Democratic party is one that I've always observed. I have struggled greatly in life from the day I was born and I am honored {{to be a part}} of something that focuses on working class citizens and molds them into a proud specimen. Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Kennedy have done so much in <b>that</b> <b>regard</b> for the two generations they've won over during their career course.|$|E

5|$|Similarly, {{there are}} no {{regulations}} at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. A fence in foul territory that {{is close to the}} outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. The surface of the field is also unregulated. While the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement (and the one used by virtually all MLB teams with naturally surfaced fields), teams are free to decide what areas will be grassed or bare. Some fields—including several in MLB—use an artificial surface, such as AstroTurf. Surface variations can {{have a significant effect on}} how ground balls behave and are fielded as well as on baserunning. Similarly, the presence of a roof (seven major league teams play in stadiums with permanent or retractable roofs) can greatly affect how fly balls are played. While football and soccer players deal with similar variations of field surface and stadium covering, the size and shape of their fields are much more standardized. The area out-of-bounds on a football or soccer field does not affect play the way foul territory in baseball does, so variations in <b>that</b> <b>regard</b> are largely insignificant.|$|E

25|$|In Williams and Cremin the {{categories}} are: (1) models <b>that</b> <b>regard</b> {{the origin and}} formation of the planets as being essentially related to the Sun, with the 2 formation processes taking place concurrently or consecutively, (2) models <b>that</b> <b>regard</b> formation of the planets as being independent of the formation process of the Sun, the planets forming after the Sun becomes a normal star; this has 2 subcategories: a) where the material {{for the formation of}} the planets is extracted either from the Sun or another star, b) where the material is acquired from interstellar space. They conclude that the best models are Hoyle's magnetic coupling and McCrea's floccules.|$|E

However, the current whereabouts of the codex are unknown. It appears to have been lost in the mid-twentieth century.

The codex consists of three parts, two of which are more important, one <b>that</b> <b>regards</b> the pre-Hispanic history of Central Mexico, the Anales de Cuauhtitlan and the other <b>that</b> <b>regards</b> the study of Aztec cosmology, the Leyenda de los Soles.|$|R

25|$|Mechatronic engineering, like systems engineering, is a {{multidisciplinary}} field of engineering that uses dynamical systems modeling to express tangible constructs.

As such, both fields are distinguished by the scope of their projects rather than the methodology of their practice.|$|E

25|$|The Santa Fe Railway {{still wanted}} to reach California on its own rails (it leased the SP line from Needles to Barstow), {{and the state of}} California eagerly courted the {{railroad}} to break SP's monopoly.

It was unique in <b>that</b> <b>regard</b> until the Milwaukee Road completed its extension to Puget Sound in 1909.|$|E
