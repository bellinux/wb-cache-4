5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics, who complimented its mix of different styles and Spears's songwriting, but criticized her vocals for being distant and processed. Commercially, In <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> became an international success, debuting atop the charts in France and the United States, and peaking inside {{the top ten}} in fifteen countries. In the United States, {{she became the first}} female artist to have four consecutive number-one albums.|$|E

50|$|Zones of {{infection}} have been described. These are (superficial to deep) <b>the</b> bacterial <b>zone,</b> <b>the</b> neutrophil rich <b>zone,</b> <b>the</b> necrotic <b>zone</b> and <b>the</b> spirochetal <b>zone.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> aphotic <b>zone</b> {{is further}} divided into {{additional}} zones: <b>the</b> bathyal <b>zone,</b> <b>the</b> abyssal <b>zone,</b> and <b>the</b> hadal <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> bathyal <b>zone</b> extends from 200 m to 2000 m. <b>The</b> abyssal <b>zone</b> extends from 2000 m to 6000 m. <b>The</b> hadal <b>zone</b> spans from depths of 6000 m {{to the ocean}} floor. Creatures in these areas {{must be able to}} live in complete darkness.|$|R
5|$|Overall, <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> has a {{population}} of 118 million and covers 220,000 square kilometres. Various major expressways and railways run through <b>the</b> <b>zone,</b> and each of the three cities has a major international airport.|$|E
5|$|The Onyx Hotel Tour was {{the fifth}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Britney Spears. It showcased her fourth studio album, In <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> (2003) and visited North America and Europe. A tour to promote the album was announced in December 2003. Its original name was the In <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> Tour, but Spears was sued for trademark infringement and banned from using the name.|$|E

30|$|Although we see {{generally}} the same behavior for all <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> in Fig. 10, {{such as high}} number of exterior cells, we can also observe more unique behavior for some of <b>the</b> <b>zones.</b> <b>The</b> <b>zones</b> number 2 and 6 have the lowest ratio of exterior cells under the vegetation surface, and <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> 1, 4, and 5 seem to follow the same pattern for both absolute and relative counts.|$|R
5|$|A {{significant}} {{but small}} percentage of people have employment {{in the oil industry}} owing to the proximity of oil rigs on the Cromarty Firth. Other locally significant industries include forestry, tourism and catering. A significant number of people work in larger nearby localities, such as Inverness, Dingwall, Alness and Invergordon, which is why only 14% of households in <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> own no car. 10.4% of the population of <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> are self-employed, and 28% economically inactive, roughly corresponding with the Highland averages. There are also two hotels and two bars, which soak up much of the tourist income that the town generates.|$|E
5|$|As {{implemented}} in October 1970, the CDH system {{is divided into}} eight zones: six in the Lower Peninsula and two in the Upper Peninsula. This contrasts to the state highway system that makes no attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> letter followed by a two-digit number. Within <b>the</b> <b>zone,</b> numbers are assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd numbers and east–west highways have even numbers. Lower numbers are used to the south or west sides of the zones.|$|E
5|$|Astrid Kruse Jensen (born 1975, {{educated in}} the Netherlands and Scotland) specializes in {{photographs}} taken at night which evoke <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> between reality and imagination. Carefully combining the effects of artificial light with the surrounding darkness, she creates mysterious images of lakes, swimming pools and solitary figures in the twilight. Since 2003, she has participated in key exhibitions in Denmark and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> pelagic <b>zone</b> can {{be further}} {{subdivided}} into two subregions: <b>the</b> neritic <b>zone</b> and <b>the</b> oceanic <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> neritic <b>zone</b> encompasses <b>the</b> water mass directly above the continental shelves whereas <b>the</b> oceanic <b>zone</b> includes all <b>the</b> completely open water.|$|R

5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:50, 107mm rocket fire began impacting in {{the vicinity}} of LZ Hotel. Less than 10 minutes later, the LZ also received 82mm mortar fire. As soon as the Khmer Rouge fire commenced, the controllers in <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> notified the Air Force forward air controllers (FACs) flying overhead in 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron OV-10s. The FACs immediately made low passes over the east bank of the Mekong, but could not spot any fire coming from known enemy positions in that location. At 10:59, the last element of 2nd Battalion 4th Marines left <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> and the last marine helicopter landed on the USS Okinawa at 12:15.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1990s, the {{pedestrian}} mall became noted for hosting a growing presence of at-risk and homeless youth. Three youth centers – Hameshulash, Hezroni's Squat, and <b>The</b> <b>Zone</b> – operate {{in the vicinity of}} Zion Square.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Sheffield City Region Enterprise Zone was {{launched}} to promote {{development in a}} number of sites in Sheffield and across the wider region. In March 2014 additional sites were added to <b>the</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E
30|$|The TMZ {{system is}} {{designed}} based on the TEE system of the global platform and implements <b>the</b> secure <b>zone</b> as software. <b>The</b> TMZ system constructs <b>the</b> secure <b>zone</b> and <b>the</b> normal <b>zone</b> in smart mobile devices through hypervisor technologies. The android OS runs in <b>the</b> normal <b>zone,</b> and <b>the</b> secure OS runs in <b>the</b> secure <b>zone,</b> which is separated from <b>the</b> normal <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> TMZ system blocks the leakage of data from <b>the</b> secure <b>zone.</b>|$|R
30|$|The channel means {{a logical}} {{connection}} between a security application of <b>the</b> normal <b>zone</b> and <b>the</b> secure functions of <b>the</b> secure <b>zone</b> and {{is assigned to}} all applications of <b>the</b> normal <b>zone</b> {{that are going to}} communicate with <b>the</b> secure <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> security applications of <b>the</b> normal <b>zone</b> request channel creation to <b>the</b> secure <b>zone</b> with <b>the</b> access control data generated by the AC agent through the session management API in order {{to make use of the}} secure functions of <b>the</b> secure <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> session is needed in order to communicate securely between <b>the</b> normal <b>zone</b> and <b>the</b> secure <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> session is generated after the creation of the channel and the successful authentication of the user who triggers the security application. The security applications of <b>the</b> normal <b>zone</b> call <b>the</b> session management API with the user’s input data (e.g., PIN, fingerprint) for user authentication. Upon the completion of the channel and the session between <b>the</b> normal <b>zone</b> and <b>the</b> secure <b>zone,</b> <b>the</b> security applications can take advantage of other NZ-security APIs.|$|R
50|$|Morocco {{provides}} {{a refuge for}} a rich and diverse flora with about 4,200 taxa, of which 22% (879 taxa) are endemic. <b>The</b> phytogeographic <b>zones</b> of Morocco comprise 8 zones: <b>the</b> Mediterranean <b>zone</b> (central 0-500m, middle 500-1,000m and upper 1,100-1500m), <b>the</b> Cedar <b>zone</b> (1000-2000m), <b>the</b> sub-Alpine <b>zone</b> (2,000-2,500m), <b>the</b> Alpine <b>zone</b> (2,500m+), <b>the</b> semi-desert scrub <b>zone,</b> <b>the</b> Reg , <b>the</b> sandy desert <b>zone</b> and <b>the</b> oases.|$|R

500|$|The stratum of {{the water}} column nearest {{the surface of the}} ocean (sea level) is {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> photic <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> photic <b>zone</b> can be subdivided into two different vertical regions. The uppermost portion of <b>the</b> photic <b>zone,</b> where there is adequate light to support photosynthesis by phytoplankton and plants, is referred to as <b>the</b> euphotic <b>zone</b> (also referred to as <b>the</b> epipelagic <b>zone,</b> or surface <b>zone).</b> <b>The</b> lower portion of <b>the</b> photic <b>zone,</b> where <b>the</b> light intensity is insufficient for photosynthesis, is called <b>the</b> dysphotic <b>zone</b> (dysphotic means [...] "poorly lit" [...] in Greek). <b>The</b> dysphotic <b>zone</b> is also referred to as <b>the</b> mesopelagic <b>zone,</b> or <b>the</b> twilight <b>zone.</b> Its lowermost boundary is at a thermocline of , which, in the tropics generally lies between 200 and 1000metres.|$|R
25|$|Epipelagic fish inhabit <b>the</b> epipelagic <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> epipelagic <b>zone</b> is <b>the</b> {{water from}} the surface of the sea down to 200 metres. It is also {{referred}} to as the surface waters or <b>the</b> sunlit <b>zone,</b> and includes <b>the</b> photic <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> photic <b>zone</b> is defined as the surface waters down to the point where the sunlight has attenuated to 1% of the surface value. This depth depends on how turbid the water is, but in clear water can extend to 200 metres, coinciding with <b>the</b> epipelagic <b>zone.</b> <b>The</b> photic <b>zone</b> has sufficient light for phytoplankton to photosynthese.|$|R
50|$|Companies outside <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> {{can apply}} for free zone status as Single Entity Free <b>Zones.</b> Created under <b>the</b> Jamaica Export Free <b>Zones</b> Act, <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> are {{operated}} by <b>the</b> government. <b>The</b> <b>zones</b> were initially used to promote textile manufacturing and related industries. The program has been expanded to include information technology, with addition clauses added to the act in 1996. Businesses that operate in <b>the</b> <b>zones</b> {{must be in the}} fields of manufacturing, warehousing and storage, distribution, processing, refining, assembly, packaging, or service operations.|$|R
5|$|Still farther northward in <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans {{were also}} active. At 06:00 on September 3, 300 North Koreans {{launched}} an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post. This fight continued until September 5. On that day F Company captured Hill 284 killing 150 North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|The President {{was coming}} into {{increasing}} conflict with Congress on {{the handling of}} <b>the</b> <b>Zone,</b> including the unusual consolidation of power. In addition to not officially restructuring the Commission, Congress increasingly fought or {{raised questions about the}} appointments of replacement commissioners. In November 1905, Panama was visited by Poultney Bigelow, a lecturer and writer for the American Geographical Society, who wrote a scathing report on progress in the Canal Zone—a report that was well-publicized in the States. This report criticized the efficiency of the work being performed as well as the quality of its management. Magoon countered this negative press by stressing that Bigelow had visited <b>the</b> <b>Zone</b> for less than two days, one of which was Thanksgiving Day, and that work was naturally lax on the holiday.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>zone</b> was originally proposed by Chongqing in 2009, {{as part of}} the 12th Chinese 5-year plan. Xi'an and Chengdu agreed to the proposal.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue line}} is {{considered}} part of whichever <b>zone</b> <b>the</b> puck is in.
