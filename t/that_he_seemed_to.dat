25|$|As in {{the case}} in World War I, Hillman used the {{influence}} of the federal government to advance both labor's social goals and its immediate organizing needs. Hillman was not able to persuade the Board to debar labor law violators, but did help introduce arbitration as an alternative to strikes in defense industries. At times, however, Hillman identified so closely with the government <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have lost sight of his roots in the labor movement; his denunciation of the UAW members who struck North American Aviation in 1941, only to face troops sent by the Roosevelt administration to guard the plant, brought down a great deal of criticism from others within the CIO.|$|E
25|$|In 305 BC the consuls {{were sent}} to Samnium. Lucius Postumius Megellus marched on Tifernum and Titus Minucius Augurinus on Bovianum. There was a battle at Tifernum where some of Livy's sources say that Postumius was defeated, while others say that the battle was even and he withdrew to the {{mountains}} at night. The Samnites followed him and encamped near him. Livy said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have wanted to gain {{a position where he}} could get abundant supplies. Postumius then left a garrison at this camp and marched to his colleague who was also encamped facing the enemy. He instigated Titus Minucius to give battle, which dragged on until the late afternoon. Then Postumius joined in and the Samnites were slaughtered. The next day the consuls begun the siege of Bovianum, which fell quickly. In 304 BC the Samnites sent envoys to Rome to negotiate a peace. The suspicious Romans sent the consul Publius Sempronius Sophus to Samnium with an army to investigate the true intentions of the Samnites. He travelled all over Samnium and everywhere he found peaceable people who gave him supplies. Livy said that the ancient treaty with the Samnites was restored. He did not specify what the terms were.|$|E

500|$|Many of Teller's {{colleagues were}} irritated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> enjoy taking full credit for {{something}} he had only a part in, and in response, with encouragement from Enrico Fermi, Teller authored an article titled [...] "The Work of Many People," [...] which appeared in Science magazine in February 1955, emphasizing {{that he was not}} alone in the weapon's development. He would later write in his memoirs that he had told a [...] "white lie" [...] in the 1955 article in order to [...] "soothe ruffled feelings", and claimed full credit for the invention.|$|E
500|$|Morgan's script {{turned out}} to be the most comedic episode of the series so far. The {{departure}} from The X-Files usual style made some of the crew, including director Kim Manners, uncomfortable, and some of the more explicitly comic scenes were cut. After [...] "Humbug", Morgan went on to write three more comedy-infused stories for the show: [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] and [...] "Jose Chung's From Outer Space". David Duchovny later commented, [...] "what I loved about his scripts was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be trying to destroy the show." [...] The plot for [...] "Humbug" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin.|$|E

He also felt that there wasn't much follow up on Manheim's experiments and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be left to cause a more serious accident in the future. Keith DeCandido watched the episode for Tor.com in July 2011.

500|$|Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, {{without a}} steady job or plan. In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read {{the description of the}} formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: [...] "I think he was happier than at any time I had ever seen him in his entire life." ...|$|E
500|$|W. G. Grace, the Victorian era's {{most famous}} cricketer, brought an English team to Australia in 1873–74. Wills {{was desperate to}} play for Victoria against Grace and rival cricketing factions fought over his {{possible}} inclusion. Hammersley, a selector, ensured his omission. Wills toured with the team, playing for country sides. Irked by Wills' constant presence, Grace remarked <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> regard himself {{as a representative of}} the whole of Australia. It was assumed that, on his homeward journey, Grace would play a final match in the South Australian capital of Adelaide, but he bypassed the city when Kadina, a remote mining town in the Copper Triangle, offered him more money. Wills coached the locals. Played in an open, rock-strewn plain of baked earth, the game was deemed a farce. Wills made a pair and Grace later wrote derisively of the [...] "old Rugbeian" [...] as a has-been. Grace neglected to mention that Wills bowled him, ending with 6/28.|$|E

500|$|He {{also built}} a roughly semi-circular, terraced amphitheater at the {{foundation}} of the Pyramid which he called the [...] "foyer". He intended to rent this out and use the revenue for the pyramid project. The land for the amphitheater was first dug in late 1923, and construction continued off and on {{for the next five years}} whenever financing, building materials, and labor were available. Unlike other Monte Ne building projects designed by architect A. O. Clark, the amphitheater apparently had no architectural input and was not built according to blueprints or a single design. Those who worked with Harvey noted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> just [...] "work it out in his mind from day to day". The result was a unique structure, irregular in formation, with seating capacity for anywhere from 500 to 1,000. The amphitheater averaged [...] high and [...] long. In the middle of the amphitheater was a small island with two concrete chairs and a concrete couch, intended for an orchestra to play or a speaker to make a presentation. Harvey dedicated the amphitheater before 500 people in 1928.|$|E
500|$|Darin Morgan {{had a small}} {{involvement}} in the second season, and was asked to contribute more content for the third. He first appeared in [...] "The Host" [...] as the Flukeman, and was brought on by his brother Glen Morgan to help write the episode [...] "Blood". Morgan's first sole credit as a writer came in the episode [...] "Humbug", which received a positive reception by the staff. David Duchovny expressed an enjoyment for working with Morgan, commenting [...] "what I loved about his scripts was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be trying to destroy the show." [...] Morgan wrote {{a total of three}} episodes, but later left the series because he could not keep up with the fast-paced nature of network television. He also expressed a negative opinion of the way his teleplays were handled, despite a positive reception by both critics and the crew of his work. He also contributed to the script for the episode [...] "Quagmire". After writing one episode the previous season, Vince Gilligan returned to write another solo episode for the season, now credited as a creative consultant. Cast member David Duchovny collaborated with Howard Gordon and Chris Carter for two episodes receiving story credit.|$|E
500|$|Roy, who {{had taught}} Cho in Introduction to Poetry the {{previous}} year, {{described him as}} [...] "an intelligent man," [...] and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be an awkward, lonely and insecure student who never took off his sunglasses, even indoors. She described Cho's behavior as [...] "arrogant" [...] and [...] "obnoxious" [...] at times, and that she tried several different ways to help him. Roy {{declined to comment on}} Cho's writings, saying only in general that they [...] "seemed very angry." [...] She added that Cho, when called on in class, would take 20 seconds to answer questions, and whispered his response. He also took cell phone pictures of her in class. After Roy became concerned with Cho's behavior and the themes in his writings, she started meeting with Cho to work with him one-on-one. However, she soon became concerned for her safety, and told her assistant that she would use the name of a dead professor as a duress code, in order to alert the assistant to call security. After Roy notified authorities of Cho's behavior, she urged Cho to seek counseling, but to her knowledge, Cho never followed through with the request, in spite of his insistence to the contrary.|$|E

500|$|Hutton's batting {{technique}} was orthodox and conventional. John Woodcock writes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> possess great intuition, for example playing mystery spinners Ramadhin and Iverson with ease. His batting stance was relaxed and still, his first movement being to slide {{his right foot}} back and across towards middle stump. He often played the ball off the back foot, getting right back onto his stumps, but never played as far forward, preferring to let the ball come to him and play it late. Occasionally, he left a slight gap between his bat and pads, meaning he was sometimes bowled through it when out of form. This arose mainly through the wartime injury to his arm and by 1950 he had adjusted his technique to compensate and had fewer problems. Immediately before the war, Hutton batted in a more attacking style {{and several of his}} contemporaries remembered his attractive strokeplay. By his own admission, Hutton was not the same player after the war. A combination of the effects of his injury and the responsibility of opening the batting in generally weak Yorkshire and England teams, whose success often depended on Hutton, meant that he batted cautiously. Hutton only played attacking shots when they presented no risk, and he rarely lifted the ball in the air; he hit just seven sixes in Test matches. However, Patrick Murphy writes: [...] "Just now and again he would play an innings of genius, when bowlers could not contain him." [...] One such innings was his score of 37 in the second Test of 1946–47 in which the attacking shots he played reminded older spectators of Victor Trumper, regarded as the ultimate Australian strokeplayer. In all his innings, he was expert at hitting the ball just {{out of the reach of}} fieldsmen to allow runs to be taken. Several of his contemporaries believed he did not get enough credit for surviving the short-pitched attacks of the Australian bowlers following the war.|$|E

In 1994, he was admitted to the hospital to detox, during which time a doctor told Jeanene Van Zandt that trying to detox Townes again could potentially kill him.

2500|$|The {{method of}} play Sewell was {{referring}} to is back-play, which allowed Shrewsbury to master the bad wickets which were often found on county grounds. Most batsmen of 1870s and 1880s typically played off the front foot. His Wisden obituary contains similar sentiments: [...] "As a batsman he had a style of back play peculiarly his own, and his judgment {{of the length of}} bowling was almost unequalled.
