The reduction of the atrial size and repair of the tricuspid valve resulted in a restoration of the conduit and reservoir function of the right atrium. Given the chronicity of the disease process and the long-standing atrial fibrillation, there is no impact of this operation on right atrial contraction.

40|$|Abstract Background Right {{ventricular}} (RV) dysfunction following implantation of a {{left ventricular}} assist device (LVAD) {{is a serious}} condition and is associated with increased mortality. Methods The aim {{of the study is}} to investigate the significance of pre-existing RV dysfunction, <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> (TV) <b>insufficiency,</b> and the severity of septal deviation following LVAD implantation on RV dysfunction, as well as the outcome and short-term complications in 51 patients from June 2006 to August 2010. Student t test was used to compare the data and estimate the p value. Results Mean age was 55. 1 ± 13, with a male to female ratio of 3. 25. The 30 -day mortality was 13. 7 % (7 / 51 patients), and the overall mortality was 23. 5 % (12 / 51 patients). Meanwhile, 21 patients (21 / 51; 41. 2 %) have undergone orthotopic heart transplantation. The mean time of support was 314. 5 ± 235 [*]days with a median of 240 [*]days at the time of closing this study. Echocardiographic evaluation of RV function pre- and post-implantation of an LVAD demonstrated septal deviation towards the left ventricle in immediate postoperative phase, which correlated with acute RV dysfunction (p [*]=[*] 0. 002).

Canines with PH may have right heart pathology documented via echocardiographic color Doppler interrogation including <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation, pulmonic <b>valve</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> elevated pulmonary arterial systolic pressure, elevated pulmonary arterial diastolic pressure, and alterations in ejection profiles. Two-dimensional echocardiographic findings may include right ventricular hypertrophy, interventricular septal flattening, paradoxical interventricular septal motion, pulmonary artery dilation, and potentially abnormal left heart dimensions. In veterinary medicine, much confidence {{is given to the}} measurement of pulmonary arterial systolic pressure estimated from <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation to grade the severity of PH and monitor its improvement with little emphasis placed on the integration of two-dimensional echocardiographic right and left heart pathology in conjunction with Doppler findings.

The aim of our study was to evaluate {{the impact of the}} total FAVA remodelling, using a prosthetic ring, on mid-term clinical and echocardiographic-RESULTS:-after aortic valve repair. METHODS: Since February 2003, 250 patients with <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (AI) underwent aortic valve repair. FAVA dilatation was treated by prosthetic ring in 52 patients, by isolated subcommissural plasty in 62, by subcommissural plasty plus ascending aortic replacement in 57 and by David's reimplantation procedure in 79. Survival rate and freedom from recurrent AI {{greater than or equal to}} moderate were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier. RESULTS: Overall late survival was 90. 4 %. Late cardiac-related deaths occurred in 15 patients. At follow-up, 36 (16 %) patients had recurrent AI greater than or equal to moderate because of cusp reprolapse and/or FAVA redilatation. Freedom from recurrent AI was significantly higher for patients who underwent David's procedure or FAVA remodelling by prosthetic ring than those who underwent isolated subcommissural plasty (P < 0. 01) or subcommissural plasty plus ascending aortic replacement (P = 0. 02). There was no statistical difference between David's procedure and prosthetic ring annuloplasty (P = 0. 26). CONCLUSIONFAVA remodelling using a prosthetic ring is a safe procedure in aortic valve repair surgery thanks to long-term annulus stabilization and it is a pliable alternative to David's procedure in selected patients. This technique may be used in all patients with slight root dilatation to avoid aggressive root reimplantation. We also recommended total FAVA annuloplasty in all patients who underwent aortic valve repair to improve long-term repair-RESULTS:. © 2013 The Author...|$|R

30|$|The <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve,</b> {{which is}} the {{atrioventricular}} valve attached to the morphological right ventricle, is affected by {{a wide range of}} pathological processes. <b>Tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> diseases are now increasingly recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.

40|$|ObjectiveLong-term {{functional}} outcomes after Norwood palliation {{are likely}} to depend on <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> performance in the systemic role. We therefore aimed to characterize features associated with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> intervention. MethodsAll 219 children (1990 – 2007) who underwent Norwood stage 1 palliation resulting in a systemic right ventricle were investigated. In parametric competing risks analyses, primary end points included surgical <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> intervention (repair =  27, replacement =  3) and death (N =  105). All 2705 echocardiogram reports were included in time-related analyses of outcome adjusted for repeated measures. Variable selection used bootstrapping. ResultsApproximately 25 % of survivors underwent <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> repair at some point, especially in children with mitral atresia (P = . 04, 53 % reliability), longer myocardial ischemic time during Norwood (P = . 02, 50 %), and moderate/severe tricuspid regurgitation immediately post-Norwood (P = . 006, 86 %). Risk of <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> intervention was mainly early, but a late risk emerged 10 to 15 years after Norwood. <b>Tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> intervention was successful in restoring functional natural history {{to that of the}} remainder of the cohort. <b>Tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> intervention did not compromise survival (82 % ± 2 % 5 years after <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> intervention), and right ventricular function was not worse in patients requiring <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> intervention. Repeat <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> interventions were undertaken in 6 patients (3 repairs, 3 replacements). At latest follow-up, the degree of <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation was not different between those who did and did not receive intervention. ConclusionsTricuspid valve surgery is common after single ventricle palliation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, necessary in up to 25 % of survivors. Mitral atresia and lengthy myocardial ischemic times during Norwood surgery are prominent risks. Right ventricular function was preserved by tricuspid repair. However, the emerging late hazard for <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> intervention may have implications for long-term outcome and should be explored further...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{compared}} the long-term results of surgical valvotomy (S) versus balloon valvuloplasty (BV) for pulmonary valve stenosis in infants and children. METHODS: Results after surgical pulmonary valvotomy (with concomitant ASD/VSD closure) (n = 62, age 2. 9 +/- 3. 5 years) and balloon valvuloplasty (n = 108, age 3. 6 +/- 3. 9 years) were analyzed. Transvalvular mean pressure gradient decrease, freedom from reintervention for restenosis, pulmonary valve insufficiency, and <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> <b>insufficiency</b> were considered. RESULTS: Mean pressure gradient decreased significantly {{more in the}} surgical group (from 64. 8 +/- 30. 8 mm Hg to 12. 8 +/- 9. 8 mm Hg at a mean follow-up of 9. 8 years) than after BV (decreasing from 66. 2 +/- 21. 4 mm Hg to 21. 5 +/- 15. 9 mm Hg after a mean of 5. 4 years; p &lt; 0. 001). Moderate pulmonary valve insufficiency occurred in 44 % after surgery, and in 11 % after BV (p &lt; 0. 001). <b>Tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> <b>insufficiency</b> occurred in 2 % after surgery, and in 5 % after BV. Restenosis occurred in 3 surgical patients (5. 6 %), 2 patients required reoperation, and 1 patient required a balloon valvotomy. Restenosis developed in 13 BV patients (14. 1 %) : 6 patients were redilated and 7 patients required surgery. Surgical valvotomy led to significantly less reinterventions than balloon valvuloplasty (p &lt; 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical relief of pulmonary valve stenosis produces lower long-term gradients and results in longer freedom from reintervention. Balloon valvuloplasty may remain, despite these results, the preferred therapy for isolated pulmonary valve stenosis, because it is less invasive, less expensive, and requires a shorter hospital stay. Surgery should remain the exclusive form of therapy {{in the presence of}} concomitant intracardiac defects, which need to be addressed...|$|E
