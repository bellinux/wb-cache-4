Consequently, the original authority to levy taxes is vested in the individual cantons of Switzerland through their constitutions.

While the formal framework of the most important cantonal direct taxes has been harmonised through the 1990 Federal <b>Tax</b> <b>Harmonisation</b> Law, the cantons (and, as the case may be, the municipalities) remain free to set their tax rates or establish new taxes, except on tax objects already taxed under federal law.|$|E

5000|$|The {{question}} of <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation</b> touched on a vital {{interest of the}} Grand Duchy. Wealth management remained the principal activity of the financial centre, even though other sectors such as management of investment funds were developing. However, considerations of confidentiality constituted the life of private banking. In negotiations on the European level, the Luxembourgish government demanded the maintenance of banking secrecy as long as its principal financial-service competitors maintained it as well. But this confidentiality {{should not be used}} for criminal activities. This was why the previous government had put through anti-money laundering legislation. The Juncker-Polfer government extended these measures to improve the effectiveness of the fight against fraud and economic and financial crime. In terms of <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation,</b> the European summit of Feira in June 2000 was a way towards a compromise. An action plan with a deadline of 2010 was agreed. In January 2003 in Brussels. in an [...] "Economic and Financial affairs" [...] council meeting, the European Ministers for Finances and the Economy finally reached an agreement on the taxation of revenue from savings. The agreement stipulated that EU member states could choose between two models: information exchanges between tax administrations, or the introduction of a withholding tax with a progressive increase in the rate of revenue which, after a transition period, would reach 35% from 1 January 2011. The move to the generalised automatic exchange of information was coupled to a similar action by third-party countries, including Switzerland.|$|E
50|$|The first {{action at}} the European Commission level was a Tax Transparency Package that {{commissioner}} Pierre Moscovici presented on 18 March 2015.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model {{that can be used}} to predict the likely impacts of tobacco <b>tax</b> {{increases}} and <b>harmonisation</b> in the East African Community. The model has five sections, one for each EAC country. These sections consider different cigarette market segments based on tax or price differentials. The model can therefore calculate the likely effects of excise <b>tax</b> increases and <b>harmonisation</b> on the retail selling price of cigarettes, cigarette consumption, government revenue and industry revenue for each individual country and for the EAC as a whole. Two Scenarios are presented in this paper. Scenario 1 explores an increase in the current excise tax rates and a harmonisation across the EAC of a uniform specific tax of UDS 0. 60. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the robustness of the assumptions in this scenario. Scenario 2 discusses the use of a mixed tax structure with a specific excise tax of USD 0. 60 or an ad valorem excise tax of 40 % of the retail selling price, whichever is higher. The advantages and disadvantages of a uniform specific excise tax and other tax structures such as tiered specific taxes, ad valorem taxes and mixed tax structures are explored. Factors such as administrative ease, predictability of revenue flows, inflation and income growth are discussed. A uniform specific tax is shown to be the most preferable excise tax structure, even over a mixed tax structure. The results show that, with an assumed price elasticity of demand of - 0. 6, as excise tax is increased in the region, consumption decreases and government revenue increases. Scenario 1 shows a decrease in consumption by around 2. 3 billlion cigarettes, or 18 %, compared to current consumption levels across the EAC of around 12. 9 billion cigarettes. Scenario 2 shows a slightly higher decline in consumption of 2. 7 billion cigarettes or 21 %. In terms of government excise revenue, Scenario 1 shows an increase of around USD 140 million or 80 % from the current government revenue of around USD 176 million across the EAC. The second scenario reveals an even greater increase of USD 173 million or 98 %. These results show that excise <b>tax</b> increases and <b>harmonisation</b> will contribute to public health and financial objectives of governments in the region.

5000|$|In the European sphere, the {{government}} gave priority {{to questions of}} employment, <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation,</b> {{and the introduction of}} the single currency. When it came to employment, it advocated the idea that all European countries should enact a minimum wage. In terms of the harmonisation and coordination of fiscal policies, the Luxembourgish authorities were not opposed to a regulation at the level of all European states of the question of the withholding tax. But this had to take account of the interests of all member states. A minimal taxation of capital revenues had to go hand in hand with progress in the area of taxation of businesses. The most spectacular performance of the European Union during this period was certainly the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999. During the Luxembourgish presidency of the Council of the European Union in 1997, significant advances were achieved in the long process of creating a common currency. In 1996, Luxembourg, along with other member states of the European Union, had concluded the growth and stability pact which was to guarantee the stability of the future single currency.|$|E

40|$|In most OECD {{countries}} the redistributive {{effect of the}} tax system has been substantially weakened by deliberate tax policies over the last decades. Despite some signs that this trend may have recently {{come to a halt}} a comprehensive policy change is not underway. One major argument brought forward against such a change is that of a serious trade-off between equity and efficiency: According to the dominant view higher taxes on top personal incomes, corporate income and wealth are detrimental to growth and employment. This paper argues that even the dominating theoreti cal framework leaves substantial leeway for redistributive taxation. From a Keynesian macroeconomic perspective redistribution may even be systematically conducive to growth and employment. Therefore, besides attempts at international <b>tax</b> coordination and <b>harmonisation,</b> national <b>tax</b> policies should actively use their room of manoeuvre for progressive taxation to correct the disparities in the income distribution {{and at the same time}} to increase the fiscal space...|$|R
40|$|The {{liberalization}} of international financial flows and {{foreign direct investment}} has induced countries to use diverse measures to attract inflow of foreign capital and foreign direct investment, {{which is expected to}} {{have a positive effect on}} the growth of GDP and thus a positive effect on social welfare. Tax exemption, reduction of tax rate, tax holiday, or diverse subsidies are some of the most important measures used. In this paper we study international tax cooperation, i. e., countries change and especially reduce tax rate for corporate income or for asset revenues to attract inflow of foreign direct investment. Both theoretical and empirical studies have shown the sensibility of foreign direct investment decision with respect to tax rate differences between home countries and host countries. In general, more inflow of foreign direct investment can be expected if the tax rate of the home country is lower than that of foreign countries. This is the main reason for international tax cooperation. In this paper we propose a simple model to prove the sub-optimal Nash non cooperative solution in a two-country tax-competition game. The model shows that international tax cooperation can improve welfare of the participating countries. How to reach a cooperative solution for an international tax competition game (ITCG) is therefore an important issue for further discussions and studies. International institutions can play a crucial role to reach international tax cooperation or international tax harmonization.

In such cases, <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation</b> converges towards the optimal tax and leads to the API. For instance, in a two-country framework, if the foreign country has an initial level of distortion higher than the home country around the optimal tax, its initial tax rate must be lower (higher) than home country in order to obtain a PPI.

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{multi-level}} taxation is currently highly relevant to two issues – European <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation</b> {{and local government}} taxation in the UK. This paper presents a general economic analysis of multi-level government and taxation and the characteristics that might make a particular tax appropriate as a regional or local tax. In applying this analysis to European <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation</b> {{it is clear that}} there is little harmony in the meaning of the term and a classification is presented. The main driving force for EU <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation</b> has been the promotion of economic efficiency in the form of free trade in order to achieve the establishment and functioning of the European internal market. Differing regional needs and preferences regarding public sector expenditure and taxation may not always be properly recognised. It is suggested that a greater emphasis be placed on equity as an economic criteria in developing European <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation.</b> Applying the analysis specifically to local government in the UK, it is clear that taxes on property meet most of the criteria relating both to taxes in general and lower level taxes in particular. However {{as in the case of}} European <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation,</b> there seems to have been insufficient account taken of matters of equity as compared to economic efficiency. It has been the issue of equity that caused the demise of local authority domestic rates and the community charge in turn and continues to raise difficulties with the present council tax. It is therefore suggested that coverage of the income tax feature of council tax – council tax rebates – be extended. The experience to date suggests equity as well as economic efficiency is important in the successful development of both European <b>tax</b> <b>harmonisation</b> and UK local government finance and perhaps should be given greater prominence in the development of systems of multi-level taxation more generally. ...|$|E

Whether these are too high or too low from a social point of view is ambiguous. The only unambiguous prediction is that the non-cooperative payroll tax is inefficiently low.
