5|$|After sacrificing an animal, another {{important}} rite of Hajj is shaving head or trimming hair (known as Halak). All male pilgrims shave their head or trim <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> {{on the day}} of Eid al Adha and women pilgrims cut the tips of <b>their</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
5|$|In ancient China and Korea, {{hair was}} {{regarded}} as a precious legacy from parents. Most people would never cut <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> after they became adults, and cutting off one's hair was a penalty for minor crimes. Both men and women would coil up <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> and many hair-coiling styles were developed.|$|E
5|$|East Asian {{cultures}} have traditionally seen long, unkempt {{hair in a}} woman {{as a sign of}} sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter, as usually <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> is tied up in styles such as the ponytail, plait, or any bun.|$|E
50|$|Many {{competitive}} swimmers remove {{nearly all}} of <b>their</b> body <b>hair,</b> including <b>their</b> underarm <b>hair,</b> believing it makes their bodies more streamlined during races. Many male bodybuilders also remove <b>their</b> body <b>hair</b> for cosmetic purposes.|$|R

5|$|In {{rural areas}} in certain Asian countries, for example India, girls still usually let <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> grow long, and knee-length hair is not unusual.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools {{is one of}} the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men would wear shirts made of piña raffia with a Chinese-style collar, black breeches, and cotton berets. Women wore piña dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> with cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted to cut <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1619, {{the ethnic}} Manchu Qing dynasty forced all men in China {{to adopt the}} queue: a long braid down the back with the hair near the {{forehead}} completely shaved. Hair length and style became a life-or-death matter in 1645 as the Manchu told them either <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> or their head would be cut.|$|E
50|$|Xylorhiza cognata is a woody {{subshrub}} with branching stems {{that may}} approach 1.5 m in height. They are hairy and glandular when new and lose <b>their</b> <b>hairs</b> with age. The leaves are lance-shaped to oval with smooth, toothed, or spiny 'holly-like' edges.|$|R

50|$|Dalaketnons {{were known}} to be rather {{beautiful}} elitists. They have a bit of a coño, a kind of telekinesis as well as corporeal duplication—meaning they could generate tangible, living copies of themselves indefinitely, and <b>their</b> <b>hairs</b> and eyes turn white whenever their power manifests.|$|R
5|$|Having lost <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> {{from the}} lake's pollution, the Griffins {{are at home}} wearing {{powdered}} wigs, an effect that compels Stewie to play several classical compositions, including those by Joseph Haydn and Georg Friedrich Handel, with Peter appearing as Antonio Salieri.

5|$|Historically, East Asian {{cultures}} viewed {{long hair}} {{as a sign}} of youth and aesthetic beauty. Long hair is associated with private life and sexuality. East Asian cultures see long, unkempt hair in a woman {{as a sign of}} sexual intent or a recent sexual encounter, as usually <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> is tied up. Lay Buddhists have long hair, while Buddhist monks have shaved heads.|$|E
5|$|The dogs of {{all these}} islands were short, and their sizes vary {{from that of a}} lap-dog to the largest spaniel. Their head is broad, the snout pointed, the eyes very small, the ears upright, and <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> rather long, lank, hard, and of {{different}} colours, but most commonly white and brown. They seldom if ever barked, but howled sometimes, and were shy of strangers to a degree of aversion.|$|E
25|$|Many Orthodox Jews, {{including}} Hasidism, {{refrain from}} cutting their beards altogether, and, {{with the exception}} of occasionally trimming their moustaches when they interfere with eating, never cut <b>their</b> facial <b>hair.</b> Those Orthodox Jews who do shave <b>their</b> facial <b>hair</b> must utilize electric shavers, as opposed to razors.|$|R
50|$|It is {{said that}} if even one of <b>their</b> <b>hairs</b> is plucked, the Vila will die, or be forced to change back to her true shape. A human may gain the control of a vila by {{stealing}} {{a piece of the}} vila's skin. Once burned, though, she will disappear.|$|R

5|$|The man is now standing, {{his arms}} crossed, and watches with {{pleasure}} as Beyoncé continues the private dance. After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} imagined Darcy to be dark despite no such {{references in}} the novel and asked Firth to dye black his light-brown hair, eyebrows and lashes; they instructed all male actors to let <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> grow before filming and shave off their moustaches. Three brunette wigs were made to cover Ehle's short, blonde hair and one wig for Alison Steadman (Mrs. Bennet) because of her thick, heavy hair. Susannah Harker's (Jane) hair was slightly lightened to contrast with Elizabeth's and was arranged in a classic Greek style to highlight the character's beauty. Mary's plainness was achieved by painting spots on Lucy Briers's face; her hair was greased to suggest an unwashed appearance and was arranged to emphasise the actress's protruding ears. As Kitty and Lydia were too young and wild to have <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> done by the maids, the actresses' hair was not changed much. Makeup artist Caroline Noble had always considered Mr. Collins a sweaty character with a moist upper lip; she also greased David Bamber's hair {{and gave him a}} low parting to suggest baldness.|$|E
5|$|Their {{bodies are}} {{connected}} to the mansion where they live, which allows them to travel through time. Their bodies cease to age outside the mansion; even <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> stops growing. They jump five years into the future when traveling through time and always arrive in different places, except for a split-party scenario in which Mai and Mea are left behind.|$|E
5000|$|The Noise Next Door were {{famous for}} <b>their</b> red <b>hair.</b> However, during May 2005, the band {{opted for a}} more mature image and cut off <b>their</b> red <b>hair.</b> They then {{released}} two more singles, [...] "She Might", which made number 27 in the chart, and [...] "Miss U" [...] (originally [...] "Dirty Girls").|$|R

50|$|Cats use postures and {{movement}} to communicate {{a wide range}} of information. There are various responses such as when cats arch their backs, erect <b>their</b> <b>hairs</b> and adopt a sideward posture to communicate fear or aggression. Others may be only a single behavioural change (as perceived by humans) such as slowly blinking to signal relaxation.|$|R
5|$|Angkor Wat is {{decorated}} with depictions of apsaras and devata; {{there are more than}} 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (–) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately –) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to the tops of the high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of <b>their</b> <b>hair,</b> headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.|$|E
5|$|As oil {{production}} increased through {{the success of}} wells like the Frazier, Twin, Pool, Grant, and the two Homestead Wells, transportation of the oil {{to the outside world}} was still reliant on teamsters. The teamsters were notorious for mistreatment of their horses, most of which lost <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> due to a buildup of oil and only had a lifespan of a few months in Pithole. The high mortality rate caused a horse shortage, with more having to be brought in by rail from Ohio and New York. Teamsters often refused to work on days when the roads were impassable or gouged the oil producers.|$|E
5|$|In Southeast Asia and Indonesia, male {{long hair}} was valued in until the seventeenth century, when the area adopted outside {{influences}} including Islam and Christianity. Invading cultures enforced shorter hairstyles on men {{as a sign}} of servitude, as well. They were also confused at the short hairstyles among women in certain areas, such as Thailand, and struggled to explain why women in the area had such short hair. They came up with several mythical stories, one of which involved a king who found a long hair in his rice and, in a rage, demanded that all women keep <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> short.|$|E
5000|$|The larvae feed on Acacia, Calodendrum, Cassia, Cestrum, Clerodendrum, Cotyledon, Passiflora caerulea, Rhus, Senecio, and Tagetes species. Though {{they are}} heavily armed with {{irritant}} urticating hairs they are readily eaten by fiscal flycatchers and Cape robin-chats that scrub off <b>their</b> <b>hairs</b> {{against the ground}} and swallow the larvae whole. Some cuckoos eat the larvae too.|$|R
2500|$|Many men in Western {{cultures}} shave <b>their</b> facial <b>hair,</b> so only {{a minority}} of men have a beard, even though fast-growing facial hair must be shaved daily to achieve a clean-shaven or hairless look. Some men shave because they cannot grow a [...] "full" [...] beard (generally defined as an even density from cheeks to neck), because their beard color is different from <b>their</b> scalp <b>hair</b> color, or because <b>their</b> facial <b>hair</b> grows in many directions, making a groomed look difficult. Some men shave because their beards are very coarse, causing itchiness and irritation. Some men grow a beard or moustache {{from time to time to}} change their appearance.|$|R

5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Pentecostalism, female members of La Luz del Mundo do not wear jewelery or makeup and are instructed to wear full, long skirts. Women can have <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> as short as their shoulder blades. These restrictions {{do not apply to}} recreational activities, where wearing bathing suits is permitted. Women wear a head covering during religious meetings. According to an interview of one adherent, women in the Church are considered equal to men in social spheres and have equal capacities for obtaining higher education, social careers, and other goals that may interest them.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan {{had been}} superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict {{ordering}} all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid {{the rest of}} <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> into a queue identical {{to those of the}} Manchus. The punishment for non-compliance was death. This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe. For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one's body intact), whereas for common folk cutting <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> was the same as losing their virility. Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest. The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (李成東; d. 1649), respectively on August 24 and September 22. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze. A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style of country music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form of country. This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew <b>their</b> <b>hair</b> long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E
5000|$|Echinocactus platyacanthus, {{also known}} as the giant barrel cactus, giant viznaga, or biznaga de dulce, is a species of cactus (family Cactaceae).
