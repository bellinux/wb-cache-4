5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} estrogen, progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to <b>the</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer.

30|$|Heterotopic {{pregnancy}} {{is defined as}} the coexistence of an intrauterine and an ectopic <b>pregnancy.</b> <b>The</b> estimated incidence is one in 30, 000 spontaneous pregnancies, with a tenfold increase in women who underwent assisted reproductive technologies. Diagnosis of a heterotopic {{pregnancy is}} often delayed {{because of the presence of}} the intrauterine gestational sac. Treatment of a heterotopic pregnancy should consist of termination of <b>the</b> ectopic <b>pregnancy</b> without damaging <b>the</b> ongoing intrauterine <b>pregnancy.</b> <b>The</b> least invasive procedure should therefore be used. We present a case of a heterotopic pregnancy consisting of a viable intrauterine pregnancy and an ectopic cornual <b>pregnancy.</b> Because of <b>the</b> viable intrauterine <b>pregnancy,</b> we decided to treat <b>the</b> cornual <b>pregnancy</b> laparoscopically by <b>the</b> endoloop technique.
