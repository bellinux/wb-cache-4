25|$|Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract (from the trachea {{to the terminal}} bronchioles), or in the alveolar region. The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines {{the health effects of}} exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by aerodynamic diameter. The <b>thoracic</b> <b>fraction</b> is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region. To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal elutriators, and large pore membrane filters.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{so called}} fine PM, (often {{referred}} to as PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung (alveolus), and very small particles (< 100 nanometers) may pass through the lungs to affect other organs. Penetration of particles is not wholly dependent on their size; shape and chemical composition also play a part. To avoid this complication, simple nomenclature is used to indicate the different degrees of relative penetration of a PM particle into the cardiovascular system. Inhalable particles penetrate {{no further than the}} bronchi as they are filtered out by the cilia. Thoracic particles can penetrate right into terminal bronchioles whereas PM which can penetrate to alveoli, the gas exchange area, and hence the circulatory system are termed respirable particles.In analogy, the inhalable dust fraction is the fraction of dust entering nose and mouth which may be deposited anywhere in the respiratory tract.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare surface imaging, portal imaging, and skin marker set-up in {{radiotherapy}} of thoracic and pelvic regions, using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) data as the gold standard. Patients and methods: Twenty patients were included in this study. CBCT, surface acquisition (SA), and two orthogonal portal images (PI) were acquired during the first four treatment sessions. Patient set-up corrections, obtained by registering the planning CT with CBCT, were used as the gold standard. Registration results of the PI and SA were evaluated and compared with those obtained with CBCT. The advantage derived from using SA or PI verification systems over a skin marker set-up was also quantified. Results: A statistically significant difference between PI and SA (in favour of PI) was observed in seven patients undergoing treatment of the pelvic region and in two patients undergoing treatment of the thoracic region. The use of SA or PI, compared with a skin marker set-up, improved patient positioning in 50 % and 57 % of the <b>thoracic</b> <b>fractions,</b> respectively. For pelvic fractions, the use of PI was beneficial in 73 % of the cases, while the use of SA was beneficial in only 45 %. Patient positioning worsened with SA, particularly along longitudinal and vertical directions. Conclusion: PI yielded more accurate registration results than SA for both pelvic and <b>thoracic</b> <b>fractions.</b> Compared with the skin marker set-up, PI performances were superior to SA for pelvic fractions while comparable results were obtained for <b>thoracic</b> <b>fractions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Six {{types of}} aerosol {{samplers}} were evaluated experimentally {{in a test}} chamber with polydisperse fly ash. The Andersen sampler overestimates the mass of small particles due to particle bounce between stages and therefore provides a conservative estimate of respirable particulate mass and thoracic particulate mass. The TSP sampler provides an unbiased estimate of total particulate mass. TSP/CCM provides no information below ESD 2 ????m and therefore underestimates respirable particulate mass. The PM 10 sampler provides a reasonable estimate of the <b>thoracic</b> particulate <b>fraction.</b> The RespiCon sampler provides an unbiased estimate of respirable, <b>thoracic,</b> and inhalable <b>fractions.</b> DustTrak and SidePak monitors provide relative particle concentrations instead of absolute concentrations because {{it could not be}} calibrated for absolute particle concentrations with varying particle shape, composition, and density. Six sampler technologies were used to evaluate airborne dust concentrations released from oilfield pipe rattling operations. The task sampled was the removal of scale deposited on the inner wall of the pipe before it was removed from service in a producing well. The measured mass concentrations of the aerosol samplers show that a Gaussian plume model is applicable to the data of pipe rattling operations for finding an attainment area. It is estimated that workers who remain within 1 m of the machine centerline and directly downwind have an 8 -hour TWA exposure opportunity of (13. 3 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the Mud Lake pipe scale and (11. 4 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the Lake Sand pipe scale at 95 % confidence. At distances more than 4 m downwind from the machine centerline, dust concentrations are below the TWA-TLV of 10 mg/m 3 for the worker in both scales. At positions crosswind or upwind from the machine centerline there is no measurable exposure. Available data suggest that the attainment area for the public starts at about 9 m downwind from the machine centerline in both scales, as 24 hour average concentrations at these distances are smaller than the 0. 15 mg/m 3, the NAAQS for unrestricted public access.

40|$|Background: The article {{presents}} the results of the determination of the inhalable and <b>thoracic</b> <b>fraction</b> of sulfuric acid(VI) in 3 workplaces producing or processing this chemical. Material and Methods: To collect thoracic fractions of sulfuric acid(VI) Parallel Particle Impactor (PPI) was used. To isolate inhalable fraction of sulfuric acid(VI) from the air we used a sampler developed at the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM), United Kingdom. Parallel Particle Impactor and IOM samplers worked with pumps at a flow of 2 l/min. For the chromatographic determination of the inhalable and <b>thoracic</b> <b>fraction</b> of sulfuric acid(VI) in workplace the ion chromatography with conductometric detection was used. Results: Depending on the sampling place the concentration of <b>thoracic</b> <b>fraction</b> of sulfuric acid(VI) was: 0. 0015 – 0. 01 mg/m 3 in workplace A, 0. 0019 – 0. 25 mg/m 3 in workplace B, and 0. 002 – 0. 01 mg/m 3 in workplace C. Of 22 tested workstations in workplace B only 7 exceeded the threshold limit value (TLV) for the concentration of <b>thoracic</b> <b>fraction</b> of sulfuric acid(VI).

Elevated odds ratios for symptoms and airflow limitation (range 1. 2 - 2. 6 in the highest quartile), but not for chronic bronchitis, were found in the higher quartiles of exposure compared with the lowest quartile. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) showed an exposure-response relationship with a 270 -mL deficit of FEV(1) (95 % CI 190 - 300 mL) in the highest compared with the lowest exposure level.

40|$|In {{support of}} a {{feasibility}} study of reproductive and developmental health among females employed in the Monchegorsk (Russia) nickel refinery, personal exposure and biological monitoring assessments were conducted. The inhalable aerosol fraction was measured and characterised by chemical speciation and particle-size distribution measurements.

40|$|Aerosol {{sampling}} {{has evolved}} {{with changes in}} technology and {{our understanding of the}} importance of assessing the biologically relevant fractions of the total aerosol. During the past decade there has been international agreement on the definitions for the inhalable, <b>thoracic,</b> and respirable <b>fractions</b> and instruments have been developed to collect samples according to these conventions. These measurement techniques are now well established in the workplace and are increasingly being applied to assessments of non-occupational exposure, as the practical difficulties in obtaining samples over 24 hours have been solved. It is argued that multiple aerosol size fractions should be measured for hazardous substances [...] such as inorganic lead [...] in which inhaled material may either be absorbed in the alveoli (respirable) or cleared from the ciliated airways in the lung to the gut and then absorbed (thoracic and extrathoracic). Such measurements should improve the evaluation of the risk for inhaled lead, particularly for non-occupational exposure of children. Also, passive aerosol sampling techniques may enable measurements of non-occupational exposure to be made over several weeks and this would also help improve the reliability of the risk evaluation for aerosol toxicants with a long biological half life.

Airborne levels of inhalable dust, endotoxin and soluble protein, and the respirable, <b>thoracic</b> and inhalable <b>fractions</b> of fungal, bacterial and actinomycete contamination were measured in the personal breathing zone of exposed workers. Inhalable dust, endotoxin, fungal and bacterial contamination all exceeded levels found in similar vegetable fibre processing factor-ies, since inhalable dust levels ranged from 10. 4 to 79. 8 mg/m 3 and inhalable bacterial levels between 4. 7 and 190 xl 06 cfu/m 3. Soluble protein and endotoxin (r= 0. 99, P< 0. 0001), endotoxin and inhalable dust (r= 0. 94, P< 0. 005) and inhalable dust and protein (r= 0. 98, P< 0. 0001) were significantly correlated, suggesting that there was little variation in the composition of the dust from different sites or activities around the workplace. Andersen sampling gave an indication of background microbe levels, although no attempt was made to identify the spe-cific microorganisms as all plates were significantly overgrown.

40|$|When using light {{scattering}} (photometry) {{to monitor the}} aerosol mass concentration one has {{to take into account}} the fact that the scattering signal depends not only on the concentration but also on the size distribution and the optical properties of the aerosol material. The (photometric) sensitivity per aerosol mass is maximum for particles with sizes of the order of the wavelength of the incident light while showing a dhigh 3 subp-behavior to the left, respectively a dhighminus 1 subp-behavior to the right of the peak. By properly choosing the scattering angle and the wavelength it is possible to match the sensitivity curve approximately with the probability curve for particle deposition in the alveolar region of the lung. This makes aerosol photometry suitable for health related monitoring for the respirable fraction of the airborne particulate material (Armbruster et al., 1984). Excellent time resolution is combined with a low detection limit. There are several instrument commercially available using this measuring technique (TM digital, mini-RAM). In many cases the coarse fractions such as the <b>thoracic</b> and extrathoracic <b>fractions</b> are also of interest. To monitor these fractions as well, besides the fine dust, one has to take measures to compensate for the lower scattering efficiency per mass for the coarse particles.

Wollastonite is an anhydrous natural silicate and xonotlite is a hydrated synthetic calcium silicate. UICC crocidolite {{was used as}} a positive control with high durability. Using a dry-sizing technique, fractions from the stock materials were prepared according to the definition of "thoracic particulate mass" and "respirable particulate mass" of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. Fibers were instilled intratracheally into female Wistar rats, and the evenness of their distribution in the lung was checked by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After serial sacrifices at 2 and 14 days, 1, 3, and 6 months, and low temperature ashing of the lung, the fibers were analyzed by SEM. The number and size distribution of fibers were investigated. The total number of crocidolite fibers decreased with a half-time of 240 days, but the number of fibers > 5 microns in length was unchanged after 6 months. The elimination kinetics of wollastonite fibers from the lung were relatively fast, with half-times of 15 to 21 days. The coating of wollastonite in Wollastocoat had no effect on this elimination process. For the <b>thoracic</b> <b>fraction</b> of wollastonite, the elimination from the lung was as fast as for the respirable particulate fraction.

During the course of normal employee work activities, seven personal breathing zone and 62 area air samples were collected and analyzed using National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) fiber sampling and counting methods to determine dimensions, composition and airborne concentrations of fibers. Mixed models were used to identify relationships between potential determinants and airborne fiber concentrations. Results from transmission electron microscopy analyses indicated that airborne fibers with length > 0. 5 μm, diameter > 0. 01 μm and aspect ratios ≥ 3 : 1 were present on 35 of the 69 air samples collected. Overall, the airborne fibers detected had a geometric mean length ≈ 3 μm and diameter ≈ 0. 3 μm. Ninety-seven percent of the airborne fibers identified were in the <b>thoracic</b> <b>fraction</b> (i. e. aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm). Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry results indicated that airborne fibers prior to the carburization process consisted primarily of tungsten and oxygen, with other elements being detected in trace quantities. Based on NIOSH fiber counting ‘B’ rules (length > 5 μm, diameter < 3 μm and aspect ratio ≥ 5 : 1), airborne fiber concentrations ranged from below the limit of detection to 0. 085 fibers cm− 3, with calcining being associated with the highest airborne concentrations. The mixed model procedure indicated that process temperature had a marginally significant relationship to airborne fiber concentration. This finding was expected since heated processes such as calcining created the highest airborne fiber concentrations.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a novel personal bioaerosol sampler designed to collect the inhalable dust fraction and further subdivide the sample into <b>thoracic</b> and respirable <b>fractions.</b> The new sampler was tested to see whether it enhanced the survival of the collected microorganisms, and was assessed for ease of use in the field and in subsequent laboratory analyses. A number of occupation-related field sites were selected where large concentrations of bioaerosols were to be expected. The prototype sampler was found to be simple to use. Analysis could be carried out with similar eciency either with all three fractions together for a total count, or separately for size selective data. The sampler performed at least as well as the standard IOM filter method but with the added advantage of size fractionation. The field trials showed that for sampling periods lasting several hours, microorganism survival within the sampler was adequate for culture and identification of the organisms present.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature review}} of published metalworking fluid (MWF) aerosol measurement data {{was conducted to}} identify the major determinants that may affect exposure to aerosol fractions (total or inhalable, thoracic and respirable) and mass median diameters (MMDs). The identification of determinants was conducted through published studies and analysis of published measurement levels. For the latter, weighted arithmetic means (WAMs) by number of measurements were calculated and compared using analysis of variance and t-tests. The literature review found that the major factors affecting aerosol exposure levels were, primarily, decade, type of industry, operation and fluid and engineering control measures. Our analysis of total aerosol levels found a significant decline in measured levels {{from an average of}} 5. 36 mg m− 3 prior to the 1970 s and 2. 52 mg m− 3 in the 1970 s to 1. 21 mg m− 3 in the 1980 s, 0. 50 mg m− 3 in the 1990 s and 0. 55 mg m− 3 in the 2000 s. Significant declines from the 1990 s to the 2000 s also were found in <b>thoracic</b> <b>fraction</b> levels (0. 48 versus 0. 40 mg m− 3), but not for the respirable fraction. The WAMs for the auto (1. 47 mg m− 3) and auto parts manufacturing industry (1. 83 mg m− 3) were significantly higher than that for small-job machine shops (0. 68 mg m− 3). In addition, {{a significant difference in the}} thoracic WAM was found between the automotive industry (0. 46 mg m− 3) and small-job machine shops (0. 32 mg m− 3). Operation type, in particular, grinding, was a significant factor affecting the total aerosol fraction [grinding operations (1. 75 mg m− 3) versus other machining (0. 95 mg m− 3) ], but the levels associated with these operations were not statistically different for either the thoracic or the respirable fractions. Across all decades, the total aerosol fraction for straight oils (1. 49 mg m− 3) was higher than for other fluid types (soluble[*]=[*] 1. 08 mg m− 3, synthetic[*]=[*] 0. 52 mg m− 3 and semisynthetic[*]=[*] 0. 50 mg m− 3). Fluid type was also found to be partly associated with differences in the respirable fraction level. We found that the total aerosols were measured by a variety of sampling media, devices and analytical methods. This diversity of approaches makes interpretation of the study results difficult. In conclusion, both the literature review and the measurement data analyzed found that decade and type of industry, operation and fluid were important determinants of total aerosol exposure. Industry type and fluid type were associated with differences in exposure to the thoracic and respirable fraction levels, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Samples of {{wood dust}} were {{collected}} in the working environment of wood machining processes {{for the purpose of}} determining correction factors for measuring mass concentration of wood dust by photometric method. According to the NIOSH 0600 Norm and NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods for photometric measurement, correction factor must be determined before measuring mass concentration of different types of dust. The correction factor is defined as the ratio of mass concentration obtained by the gravimetric method and mass concentration obtained by the photometric method. The correction factor should be determined because of the influence of particle size distribution, density, particle shape and refractive index on values obtained by the photometric method. The aim of the research was to investigate the possibility of using photometric method for the determination of mass concentration of inhalable fraction of airborne wood dust. Sampling was conducted in several woodworking plants during the machining of wet and dry beech-wood, wet and dry oak-wood, wet fir-wood and particleboard. There is a significant correlation between the results obtained by the photometric method and values obtained by the gravimetric method (R 2 = 0. 88) and this is the base for using the photometric method in determining mass concentration of airborne wood dust. According to the results of this research, correction factors must be determined and used for measuring mass concentration of inhalable wood dust during the machining of different wood species and wood with different moisture content. The best corresponding results of photometric and gravimetric methods are obtained for the samples collected during machining of wet fir-wood (k= 1). The largest correction factor should be used in determining workers exposure to wood dust during machining of dry oak-wood (k= 4. 4) and particleboard (k= 4. 5). Only the results of 8 -hour measurements of mass concentration by gravimetric methods can be compared with limit values of aerosol mass concentration. However, the determination of mass concentration of wood dust by photometric method may be applied not only for short-term exposure measurements but also for additional measurements within the analysis of exposure time profile at workplaces during the working day. Additionally, photometric method is very useful for simultaneous collection of samples of the respirable, <b>thoracic</b> and inhalable <b>fractions</b> of airborne particulate matter...|$|R
40|$|Several {{epidemiological}} studies {{suggested that there}} is an association between incidence and exacerbation of adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health effects and air pollution. Accurate, high resolution maps of ground-level Particulate Matter (PM) are highly awaited for environmental policies and future monitoring stations design. Though the measurements made by the ground stations can ensure a high level of reliability, still they cannot provide full spatial coverage over an area, giving rise among other things to misclassified {{epidemiological studies}}. Fine particles are usually categorized by size distribution, known as fractions: PM 10 represents the particles with aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 µm and comprises the <b>thoracic</b> (or coarse) <b>fraction</b> – with diameter in the range 2. 5 - 10 µm – and the smaller inhalable (or fine) fraction. Although including the less dangerous thoracic particles, PM 10 measurements are usually far more available and hence lend themselves better for modelling. Spaceborne aerosols products like the ones offered by the polar-orbiting MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) are successfully finding practical applications for scientific research studies and, though not previously intended, the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT, or simply τ) from MODIS revealed to have {{a leading role in the}} evaluation of surface air quality due to its full spatial (clear-sky constrained) coverage and daily overpasses almost throughout the globe. Despite the “promised land” has not been reached yet, researchers have verified an existing correlation between aerosols and particulate concentrations, rising expectation of air quality models for high-scale environmental characterization. Air quality modelling is generally a challenging application, due to the wide range of sources affecting this variable and the high spatial and temporal variability of the particles, especially over high populated areas with rugged topography and complex meteorological profiles. In this thesis, different variogram-based geostatistical techniques are evaluated to predict the concentrations of PM 10, with a focus on the effective advantages brought by AOT from satellites. This work is meant as a guide for students and researchers who are taking their first steps in this specific application, as well as to experts of the field who want to overview geostatistical filling of PM concentrations, and weigh up the usefulness of MODIS imagery. Different areas of study and temporal resolutions will be considered, so as to propose directions and outline conclusions on how this task – still far from being definitively ruled out – should be approached. Aside from modelling, the interactive visualization, extraction and analysis of the model-based predicted maps are also covered, cutting-edge Web-based software architectures based on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard services are proposed, giving rise to increased capabilities in the spatio-temporal elaboration of the model results. The availability of spaceborne maps of AOT at an increased nominal resolution of 1 × 1 km 2 has been a unique occasion to experiment their role for air quality issues; the latest algorithmics from leading FOSS-like (Free and Open Source Software) modelling software where learned and used, resulting in several new testing results in a field where variogram-based geostatistics were lacking. Solutions for novel online analysis and visualization capabilities were explored, in order to approach an open and interconnected uncertainty-enabled Web...|$|R
40|$|Aim The {{aim of this}} {{longitudinal}} {{epidemiological study}} was to investigate possible associations between occupational exposure, respiratory symptoms and change in lung function among employees at a mineral fertiliser production plant. Material and methods Lung function indices (forced vital capacity (FVC), the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and lung diffusing capacity (DLCO)) were measured in 2007 and 2010 among employees at a fertiliser production plant. In 2007, 349 persons participated (86 % of those eligible). Of the 283 participants remaining at work three years later, 6 % did not participate in the second phase of lung function measurement. In addition to those participating in 2007, 34 additional employees participated in 2010, for a total of 383 participants. The employees consented to spirometry test and diffusing capacity test and answered a respiratory symptoms questionnaire during each testing session. In 2007, rhinometry was performed {{at the same time as}} the lung function testing. In 2010, the subjects at the plant answered a questionnaire on work history with an emphasis on the three-year follow-up period. The employees were classified in job groups by production department according to their principal affiliation during follow-up. Study participants tested only once were grouped in the department they served on the day of lung function testing. Employees in the administration or working in average less than 2 hours/week in the production were assigned to the job-group “Other”. The exposure assessment was performed in 2007 - 08 in all the departments at the plant; ammonia, nitric acid, compound fertiliser, and calcium nitrate departments, as well as a shipping area. A total of 178 inhalable and 179 thoracic personal aerosol mass fraction samples were collected from randomly chosen workers (N= 141), whereof 23 % of the workers participated more than once. Masses of inhalable and <b>thoracic</b> aerosol <b>fractions</b> were measured gravimetrically. Water-soluble and water-insoluble aerosol fractions were analysed for the major constituents, Ca, K, Mg, and P. Concentrations of F-, NO 2 -, NO 3 -, PO 43 -and SO 42 - in the water-soluble aerosol fraction and leachates from impregnated gas filter-pads were analysed. NH 3, CO, and NO 2 were measured using direct-reading electrochemical sensors. In addition, a sub study on exposure assessment using video exposure monitoring strategy was conducted during a week in May 2009 to identify short-term peak episodes. Results An adjusted, statistically significant decline in FEV 1 of 18 mL/year during the followup was found for the total group, but no significant decline in FVC. The workers in the nitric acid department had a statistically significant decline in FEV 1, but the absolute decline was of the same magnitude as for those in the Ammonia and Compound fertiliser A departments. DLCO showed a statistically significant decline of 0. 068 mmol/min/kPa/year for the total group. The prevalence of selected self-reported respiratory symptoms; morning cough, cough with phlegm, cough with phlegm > 3 months/yr, and wheezing, varied between 6. 5 to 26. 2 %, with only morning cough showing a statistical significant increase from 8. 0 % in 2007 to 13. 7 % in 2010. No association was found between respiratory symptoms and the decline in lung function indices, and borderline significant correlation was found between nasal patency and FEV 1 % predicted. The median inhalable and thoracic aerosol mass concentration exposure levels were 1. 1 mg/m 3 (min-max: < 0. 93 - 45) and 0. 21 mg/m 3 (min-max: < 0. 085 - 11), respectively. The highest median aerosol mass concentrations were found in the compound fertiliser departments with median inhalable mass air concentration of 3. 0 mg/m 3 in Compound fertiliser C and median thoracic mass air concentration of 0. 78 mg/m 3 in Compound fertiliser A. The median air concentrations of CO, NH 3, and NO 2 in all departments were predominantly below the limit of detection (2 ppm, 3 ppm, 0. 2 ppm, respectively). However, some short-term peak episodes of NH 3 and NO 2 were detected, e. g. when performing tasks like cleaning and sampling for quality control. Conclusion An observed adjusted decline in lung function indices was found in this three-year follow-up of workers at a nitrate fertiliser plant. The prevalence of morning cough increased in the follow-up period, but no association between respiratory symptoms and decline in lung function indices was found. A borderline correlation was found between nasal patency and FEV 1 % predicted. The exposure levels for aerosols and gases were generally low with many measurements below the limit of detection. No plausible exposure related explanation for the overall lung function decline during follow-up was found. List of papers. The papers are removed from the thesis due to publisher restrictions.
