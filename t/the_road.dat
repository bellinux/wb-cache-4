5|$|Just east of {{the railway}} bridge, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> crosses the {{boundary}} between the London boroughs of Southwark and Lewisham, where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> ahead becomes New Cross Road. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> appears on a map to form a boundary between Walworth, and Peckham to the south and Bermondsey to the north although the Bermondsey boundary runs along Rolls Road.|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was {{bypassed}} in 1933–34 by the three-lane Ridge Route Alternate, then U.S. Route99 (US99), {{to handle}} increased traffic and remove many curves. The four-lane US99 {{was completed in}} 1953 and replaced by a freeway, Interstate5 (I-5) around 1968. The portion of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> within the Angeles National Forest {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1997, following the efforts of Harrison Scott. Much of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> has been closed by the U.S. Forest Service; other remnants of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> are used by local traffic.|$|E
50|$|As Elmsdale expanded, more {{roads were}} built, {{creating}} a spider's web of routes. <b>Roads</b> include <b>the</b> Butcher <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> Wells <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> Warren <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> Murray <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> Old Tom <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> O'Brien <b>Road,</b> and others.|$|R
50|$|The type of {{existing}} <b>roads</b> in <b>the</b> municipality is <b>the</b> National <b>Roads,</b> Provincial <b>Roads</b> and <b>the</b> Municipal <b>Roads.</b> <b>The</b> National <b>Roads</b> are <b>the</b> San Enrique-San Rafael <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> San Enrique-Garita <b>Road</b> and <b>the</b> San Enrique-Dingle <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> San Enrique-Dueñas <b>Road</b> and <b>the</b> KABASAKA <b>Road.</b> <b>The</b> Municipal <b>Roads</b> consist of Municipal Streets and <b>the</b> Barangay <b>Roads.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> largest <b>roads,</b> {{constructed}} at <b>the</b> {{same time}} {{as many of the}} great house sites (between 1000 and 1125 AD), are: <b>the</b> Great North <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> South <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> Coyote Canyon <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> Chacra Face <b>Road,</b> Ahshislepah Road, Mexican Springs <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Road,</b> and <b>the</b> shorter Pintado-Chaco <b>Road.</b> Simple structures like berms and walls are found sometimes aligned along the courses of <b>the</b> <b>roads.</b> Also, some tracts of <b>the</b> <b>roads</b> lead to natural features such as springs, lakes, mountain tops, and pinnacles.|$|R
5|$|Past Phoenicia, the {{surrounding}} slopes become steeper as <b>the</b> <b>road</b> and creek curve around Panther Mountain, {{one of the}} Catskill High Peaks, to the south. At Allaben, the Shandaken Tunnel crosses under <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> bringing water from Schoharie Reservoir into the creek. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> and creek start bending to the south to the hamlet of Shandaken, where the town hall {{on the south side}} of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is followed by the southern terminus of NY42's northern segment. As NY28 continues trending southwest, the valley becomes less developed. Balsam Mountain, another High Peak, looms ahead.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> {{continues}} {{north into}} farm fields and woods {{with a few}} homes, curving more to the northeast. At the Aquetong Road intersection, PA 263 turns north {{and back to the}} northeast. The route reaches the community of Solebury, where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> intersects Sugan Road. Past this area, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> continues through wooded areas of homes, with the forests becoming denser as <b>the</b> <b>road</b> heads more to the northeast. In the village of Centre Bridge, PA 263 signage ends at PA 32 (River Road). The route officially continues to the Centre Bridge-Stockton Bridge over the Delaware River, at which point it ends. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> continues into Stockton, New Jersey as Bridge Street, which heads to an intersection with Route 29 near the southern terminus of County Route 523.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> leaves Chestertown {{and becomes}} Augustine Herman Highway, which {{is named for}} Bohemian {{surveyor}} Augustine Herman. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> heads into farmland with residences along {{the west side of}} <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> MD 213 intersects MD 297 (Worton Road) and heads past more farm fields. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> turns northeast and intersects MD 561 (Hassenger’s Corner Road). It continues through more rural areas, consisting mostly of farms with some wooded areas before reaching Kennedyville, where MD 213 passes residences. In Kennedyville, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> crosses over the Chestertown Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland & Delaware Railroad.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road</b> that {{currently}} carries the SR-202 designation has existed since 1937, when it connected US-40 and US-50 along the Garfield Cut-Off Road. The Utah State Legislature designated <b>the</b> <b>road</b> SR-202 in 1969, thus taking responsibility of maintaining <b>the</b> <b>road</b> from the county. No changes or alterations {{have been made}} to SR-202, except for the legal definition of <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> which has changed twice since it was formed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>road,</b> {{as well as}} {{all other}} state roads in Croatia, is managed and {{maintained}} by Hrvatske ceste, a state-owned company. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> carries an annual average daily traffic of about 2,000 vehicles, and the traffic volume increases by up to 1,000 vehicles in summer as <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is used by tourists in the region. The southernmost portion of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is significantly more congested as it carries Pula suburban traffic.|$|E
5|$|The valley narrows into {{a canyon}} as <b>the</b> <b>road</b> begins to climb again, closely hugging the north wall. Four miles (6.4km) {{east of the}} city, just past Targert Lake Road, it passes the gates where <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is closed in wintertime. Past this point {{development}} along <b>the</b> <b>road</b> abates {{as most of the}} land alongside <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is part of White River National Forest. On the north side of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> are some of Aspen's more popular climbing cliffs; on the south side are many small parking areas for trailheads, campgrounds and popular swimming holes along the Roaring Fork like Devil's Punchbowl.|$|E
50|$|Hartlepool {{is served}} by two primary routes which are <b>the</b> A179 <b>road</b> and <b>the</b> A689 <b>road,</b> both linking <b>the</b> town to <b>the</b> A19 <b>road.</b> <b>The</b> A179 <b>road</b> is <b>the</b> main <b>road</b> to <b>the</b> north-west which leads to <b>the</b> A19 <b>road,</b> Durham, Sunderland and Tyneside. <b>The</b> A689 <b>road</b> is <b>the</b> main <b>road</b> to <b>the</b> {{south-west}} towards the A19 & Billingham, Stockton, Middlesbrough and York. <b>The</b> A178 <b>road</b> leads south to Seaton Carew, Graythorp, Seal Sands, Port Clarence and Middlesbrough via the Transporter bridge. <b>The</b> A1086 <b>road</b> leads north to Crimdon, Blackhall, Horden, Peterlee and Easington.|$|R

5|$|Waterfall Gully Road is {{meandering}} and in {{some parts}} quite narrow. This has led to concerns regarding safety, as <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is frequented by both pedestrians and cyclists. After {{the death of a}} cyclist in 2007, calls for the repair and resurfacing of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> intensified, with two petitions being tabled in parliament. The accident also led to a safety audit being conducted by TransportSA, and although the results were not released to the public at the time, it called for an investigation of the entire length of <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> As of mid-2008, there has been no clear plan released for the future of <b>the</b> <b>road,</b> with <b>the</b> <b>road</b> missing out on funding in the 2008 state budget.|$|E

5|$|A {{road from}} the town of Potrero to Tecate existed by 1917. The Tecate border {{crossing}} originally opened in 1932. In 1938, the San Diego County board of supervisors proposed moving rerouting <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to be shorter and on more level ground, although there was opposition from local residents and businesses who favored the old road. However, the route of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to Tecate has remained the same since then.|$|E

5|$|A short {{distance}} past the Street Road intersection, PA 232 passes into Solebury Township and crosses the Pidcock Creek. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> continues through {{a mix of}} farms and woods with some residential areas. As the route approaches Aquetong Road, the surroundings become more forested and <b>the</b> <b>road</b> parallels Dark Hollow Run, briefly passing through farm fields. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> enters the borough of New Hope, where it terminates at a junction with Main Street (PA 32).|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Passaic River into Bergen County, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> is called Paterson Avenue and designated as County Route 120, in Wallington, {{in a residential}} and light-density commercial area. <b>The</b> <b>road</b> becomes the border between Wallington {{to the north and}} East Rutherford to the south. At the end of Wallington, Paterson Avenue is the border between Carlstadt and East Rutherford for a short distance but then <b>the</b> <b>road</b> dips into East Rutherford to avoid a hill (the bypass, which goes over the hill, is called Hoboken Road). <b>The</b> <b>road</b> returns to the Carlstadt/East Rutherford border at Route 17 which it crosses over via an overpass, and is then designated as Route 120 and Paterson Plank Road for a distance.|$|E

5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern extents of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> were paved soon afterward; however, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied to the entire highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E
