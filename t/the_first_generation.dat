As a deterrent against further Argentine invasion attempts, No. 1453 Flight RAF was deployed to the Falkland Islands from August 1983 to June 1985. However the second generation Harrier IIs saw action in Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>generation</b> Hawker Siddeley airframes were replaced by the improved Harrier II, which had been developed jointly between McDonnell Douglas and British Aerospace.|$|E

5|$|The {{fuselage}} bomb bay used four bomb racks, {{in later}} versions eight modular standard bomb racks designed to carry one SC 250kg (550lb) bomb or four SC 50kg (110lb) bombs each in nose up orientation.

5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, {{it is more than}} likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can be readily discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>generation</b> of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E

Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies.

5|$|Hawker Siddeley aggressively marketed the Harrier for export. At {{one point}} the company was holding talks with Australia, Brazil, Switzerland, India and Japan.

Following an overture by the UK in the early 1970s, when relations with the West were warming, China became interested in the aircraft as it sought to modernise its armed forces; British Prime Minister James Callaghan noted significant hostility from the USSR over the sales bid. The deal was later cancelled by the UK as part of a diplomatic backlash after China invaded Vietnam in 1979.|$|E
