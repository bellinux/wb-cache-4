500|$|By April 2013, filming was {{scheduled}} to begin in early 2014 at Shepperton Studios in England. At the Hollywood premiere of Iron Man 3, Whedon {{said that he had}} completed a draft of the script, started the storyboard process, and met with actors. Whedon also mentioned that he wrote with Downey in mind and included a [...] "brother/sister act" [...] from the comic books, later confirming that he was referring to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Whedon explained his rationale for including the characters in the film saying, [...] "their powers are very visually interesting. One of the problems I had on the first one was everybody basically had punchy powers … 's got super speed. [...] can weave spells and a little telekinesis, get inside your head. There's good stuff that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> will help sort of keep it fresh," [...] though cautioned he was not throwing in more characters for the sake of doing that. Whedon stated that the twins allowed him to add more conflict: [...] "They don't like America, and they don't like the Avengers… The Avengers are like a world power, and not everybody's on board with the Avengers coming in and starting fights, even in the name of justice. So you need that dissenting voice, and you need to understand it and sympathize with it." [...] Because Marvel Studios shares the film rights to Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch with 20th Century Fox and had to avoid conflict with Fox's X-Men films, Whedon introduced two important characters into the Marvel Cinematic Universe completely on his terms for the first time, which allowed him to connect their origin stories to the universe that they created and avoid the concept of mutants. Whedon relished at the storytelling opportunities by introducing a character with telepathic powers, explaining, [...] "it meant we could spend a little time inside the Avengers' heads—either their past or their impressions of what's going on, or their fears, or all of the above." [...] By May, Downey had entered negotiations to extend his contract with Marvel Studios and reprise his role as Iron Man in the film. A month later, Downey signed on to return for the then-untitled Avengers sequel, as well as a third Avengers film.|$|E

The project was {{initially}} formed to promote a joint 17-date national tour, where all singers would perform their solo material and several songs as a group. Young Divas released a cover version of Donna Summer's 1989 single [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real", through Sony BMG, to promote tickets for the tour. A music video was also shot to accompany the song's release. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Coulter stated [...] "We really want to get across that we're not a group. It's four big personalities and big voices getting on stage and showing what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>That</b> was the idea behind the single – kind of showing off all of our vocals, together." [...] Young Divas' version of [...] "This Time I Know It's for Real" [...] peaked at number two, remained in the top-ten for 14 consecutive weeks, and was certified platinum. Five months after the single's release, Young Divas released a second single in November 2006, a cover of Lonnie Gordon's 1990 single [...] "Happenin' All Over Again". The song peaked at number nine and was certified gold for shipments of 35,000 units. Young Divas' commercial success prompted the release of a self-titled debut album of classic disco and pop covers, on 27 November 2006, establishing themselves as an official group. The album debuted at number four and was certified double platinum for shipments of 140,000 units. A cover of Hazell Dean's 1983 hit [...] "Searchin'" [...] was released as the group's third single, and reached number 40.|$|E

60|$|It {{appears that}} we were paying {{fourteen}} millions a year interest on our national debt in the year 1796. I take this statement from an article in The Times, in which {{the question of the}} finances of the United States is handled. But our population in 1796 was only sixteen millions. I estimate the population of the Northern section of the United States, as the States will be after the war, at twenty-two millions. In the article alluded to, these Northern Americans are now stated to be twenty millions. If then we, in 1796, could pay fourteen millions a year with a population of sixteen millions, the United States, with a population of twenty or twenty-two millions, will be able to pay the sixteen or seventeen millions sterling of interest which will become due from them, if their circumstances of payment are as good as were ours. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and more than that, if they have the same means per man as we had.
