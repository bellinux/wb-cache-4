50|$|Mockernut hickory is a large, <b>true</b> <b>hickory</b> with a dense crown. This species {{occasionally}} {{grows to}} about 30 m tall and 91 cm in d.b.h., but heights and diameters usually {{range from about}} 15 and 46 to 61 cm, respectively.|$|E
50|$|The wood, which grows across {{tropical}} Africa from Sierra Leone to Uganda, {{has about}} the same density as <b>true</b> <b>hickory,</b> but {{is not quite as}} strong.The wood is extremely heavy.Log diameter is from 60 to 90 cm.The heartwood is golden yellow to orange yellow, and slightly shimmering.The sapwood has an interlocking grain.|$|E
50|$|Mockernut hickory, a <b>true</b> <b>hickory,</b> grows from Massachusetts and New York west to {{southern}} Ontario, southern Michigan, and northern Illinois; then to southeastern Iowa, Missouri, and eastern Kansas, south to eastern Texas and east to northern Florida. This species {{is not present}} in New Hampshire and Vermont as previously mapped by Little. Mockernut hickory is most abundant southward through Virginia, North Carolina and Florida where {{it is the most}} common of the hickories. It is also abundant in the lower Mississippi Valley and grows largest in the lower Ohio River Basin and in Missouri and Arkansas.|$|E
50|$|<b>True</b> <b>hickories</b> sprout prolifically from stumps after {{cutting and}} fire. As the stumps {{increase}} in size, {{the number of}} stumps that produce sprouts decreases; age is probably directly correlated to stump size and sprouting. Coppice management is a possibility with <b>true</b> <b>hickories.</b> <b>True</b> <b>hickories</b> are difficult to reproduce from cuttings. Madden discussed the techniques for selecting, packing, and storing hickory propagation wood. Reed indicated that the most tested hickory species for root stock for pecan hickory grafts were mockernut and water hickory (Carya aquatica).|$|R
50|$|The nuts of nutmeg hickory are relished by squirrels, which begin {{cutting them}} while they are still green. Other rodents and {{wildlife}} also eat the nuts. The species is too rare over most of its range to be of major economic importance. The wood of this pecan hickory is slightly inferior in strength and toughness {{to that of the}} <b>true</b> or upland <b>hickories,</b> but owing to the small volumes involved and difficulty of distinguishing it from the <b>true</b> <b>hickories,</b> nutmeg hickory is not separated from them during logging.|$|R
50|$|Carya cordiformis, the {{bitternut}} hickory, {{also called}} bitternut or swamp hickory, {{is a large}} pecan hickory with commercial stands located mostly north of the other pecan hickories. Bitternut hickory is cut and sold in mixture with the <b>true</b> <b>hickories.</b> It is the shortest-lived of the hickories, living to about 200 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>True</b> <b>hickories</b> {{provide a}} very {{large portion of the}} {{high-grade}} hickory used by industry. Mockernut is used for lumber, pulpwood, charcoal, and other fuelwood products. Hickory species are preferred species for fuelwood consumption. Mockernut has the second highest heating value among the species of hickories. It can be used for veneer, but the low supply of logs of veneer quality is a limiting factor.|$|R
50|$|Although the pecan hickories (which include nutmeg hickory) {{grow more}} rapidly than the <b>true</b> <b>hickories,</b> {{specific}} information on {{the growth rate of}} nutmeg hickory is lacking. The pecan hickories, in turn, grow more slowly than most other bottom-land hardwoods. The average 10-year diameter increase for hickories in natural, unmanaged stands in the northeast Louisiana delta was 4.3 cm (1.7 in) in the 15- to 30-cm (6- to 12-in) diameter class; 3.3 cm (1.3 in) in the 33- to 48-cm (13- to 19-in) diameter class; and 3.8 cm (1.5 in) in the 51- to 71-cm (20- to 28-in) diameter class.|$|R
50|$|<b>True</b> <b>hickories</b> such as mockernut {{develop a}} long taproot with few laterals. The species is windfirm. Early root growth is {{primarily}} into the taproot, which typically reaches {{a depth of}} 30 to 91 cm during the first year. Small laterals originate along the taproot, but many die back during the fall. During the second year, the taproot may reach a depth of 122 cm, and the laterals grow rapidly. After 5 years, the root system attains its maximum depth, and the horizontal spread of the roots is about double that of the crown. By age 10, the height is 4 times {{the depth of the}} taproot.|$|R
