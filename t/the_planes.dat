40|$|Vibrations of a {{circular}} plate with which two bars are perpendicularly connected are studied. The ends of two legs are clamped. The system is symmetric about <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> N of two bars and about <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> M, through <b>the</b> {{center of the}} circular plate, perpendicular to N. 　Accordingly, vibrations of the system are classified into four sorts of normal vibrations:　(1) Vibration symmetric about <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> M and <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> N　(2) Vibration antisymmetric about <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> M and symmetric about <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> N　(3) Vibration symmetric about <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> M and antisymmetric about <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> N　(4) Vibration antisymmetric about <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> M and <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> N　<b>The</b> frequency equations for cases (1) and (2) are obtained, and the nondimensional frequencies are calculated from these equations. 　The experiments are also carried out and these results are compared with the calculated values in figures...|$|R

5|$|The first {{seaplanes}} used in combat, {{supplied by}} French manufacturer Donnet-Lévêque, were operated from Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{and her two}} sisters during the blockade. However, the Austro-Hungarian Navy was {{not satisfied with the}} operation, as the ships lacked enough deck space for <b>the</b> <b>planes,</b> as well as a lack of cranes with which they could easily hoist <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> onto the decks. <b>The</b> <b>planes</b> were later moved to a hangar at the navy yard in Teodo. By 1913, the four new dreadnoughts of the —the only dreadnoughts built for the fleet—were coming into active service. With the commissioning of these dreadnoughts, the navy shifted Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and her sisters to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron.|$|E
5|$|As the Cold War progressed, so did {{the need}} for new {{aircraft}} and techniques. The first KC-97 Stratofreighter arrived at Loring with the activation of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron in January 1955.

Eventually, 21 tankers were based at Loring, along with 30 air crews.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{headed for}} Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Fearing the Japanese Navy, {{they sought to}} travel via the Lingga Islands hoping that the island group it sat in {{could be used as}} a hiding place. As they {{approached}} on 14 February, Judy indicated the approach of Japanese aircraft and the anti-aircraft gunners took up their positions in readiness. The Grasshopper was hit with a single bomb before <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> departed. Judy was below decks when <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> returned. The Dragonfly was hit by three bombs and sank quickly. The Grasshopper was hit by a further two bombs, and the order was given to abandon ship as a fire spread close to an ammunition compartment. Boats were lowered and the crew and evacuees were ferried just over a hundred yards to shore whilst the Japanese planes strafed the vessels. It was only when they were ashore that they realised Judy was not with them.|$|E

50|$|Captain Danilov then ordered First Officer Shcherbakov and Mechanic Shurpatov to {{look out}} {{from the window and}} see if they could find the Chamba River.

5|$|Various {{delays in}} the arrival of planes and {{equipment}} meant that Baker's squadron was unable {{to participate in the}} final major offensives of the war. In September, Baker became engaged to Scott. He asked Pyne to sell a bond to pay for an engagement ring, and the newspapers in the United States carried headlines that announced the engagement. Early in October, Baker was promoted again and given the rank of captain. <b>The</b> <b>planes</b> and equipment arrived for his squadron soon after. Baker had <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> painted in Princeton's black and orange and adopted a tiger for the squadron insignia. He recorded two more kills on October 28 and November 5, the last of his career (despite reports {{at the time of his}} death, Baker was not an ace, as that required five confirmed kills).|$|E

On the morning of 15 August 1939, during a mass-formation dive-bombing demonstration for high-ranking commanders of the Luftwaffe at Neuhammer training grounds near Sagan, 13 Ju 87s and 26 crew members were lost when they crashed into the ground almost simultaneously. <b>The</b> <b>planes</b> dived through cloud, expecting to release their practice bombs and pull out of the dive once below the cloud ceiling, unaware that on that particular day the ceiling was too low and unexpected ground mist formed, leaving them no time {{to pull out of the}} dive.|$|E
5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as <b>the</b> <b>planes</b> required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for <b>the</b> <b>planes,</b> Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E
50|$|On {{the return}} flight <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> {{was hit by}} Japanese fighter planes and caught fire. As <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> lost power and dropped {{downward}} toward the sea, Kelly told the four other crew members, including Levin, to bail out while {{he tried to keep}} <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> straight and level.

5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties.

Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1979, {{the number}} of Grønlandsfly {{passengers}} served annually exceeded 60,000, more than the population of Greenland.

5|$|Dolly {{weakened}} as it accelerated northeastward, {{although it}} still threatened to strike Bermuda with strong winds.

After continued weakening, Dolly passed over the island on September11, producing only gale-force winds, rains, and little to no damage. It deteriorated into a tropical storm on September12 and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The remnants of Dolly later turned eastward, dissipating just west of Portugal on September17.|$|E
