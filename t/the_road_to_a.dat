5|$|Philadelphia’s law {{libraries}} gave Blaine {{the chance}} to at last begin to study the law, but in 1853 he received a more tempting offer: to become editor and co-owner of the Kennebec Journal. Blaine had spent several vacations in his wife’s native state of Maine and had become friendly with the Journal’s editors. When the newspaper’s founder, Luther Severance, retired, Blaine was invited to purchase the publication along with co-editor Joseph Baker. He quickly accepted, borrowing the purchase price from his wife’s brothers. Baker soon sold his share to John L. Stevens, a local minister, in 1854. The Journal had been a staunchly Whig newspaper, which coincided with Blaine’s and Stevens’ political opinions. The decision to become a newspaperman, unexpected as it was, started Blaine on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lifelong career in politics. Blaine’s purchase of the Journal coincided with {{the demise of the}} Whig party and birth of the Republican party, and Blaine and Stevens actively promoted the new party in their newspaper. The newspaper was financially successful, and Blaine was soon able to invest his profits in coal mines in Pennsylvania and Virginia, forming the basis of his future wealth.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{highways}} along the US131 corridor were designated {{as early as}} 1919. When the US Highway System was formed on November 11, 1926, US131 was created along the route of M-13 in Michigan. Originally ending at Fife Lake on the north end, the highway was extended to Petoskey in the late 1930s. Further changes were made, starting in the 1950s, to convert segments of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> full freeway. The state started this conversion simultaneously at two locations: heading north from Three Rivers, and heading both north and south from a point in southern Kent County. A third segment was built south of Cadillac and over subsequent years Michigan filled the gaps in the freeway. Cadillac and Manton were bypassed {{in the early part}} of the 21st century, resulting in the current freeway configuration. Another large-scale construction project in 2000 rebuilt an unusual section of the freeway through Grand Rapids known as the S-Curve. Two bridges formerly used by US131 have been labeled by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as historic structures; one of them has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).|$|E

2500|$|Although Heim {{has said}} that the big butcher dogs, Metzgerhund, became extinct after foreign imports became more popular, there is {{speculation}} over whether farmers would get an expensive foreign dog. In 1889 an International Dog Show was held in Winterthur, northern Switzerland; various Sennenhunde were exhibited. Raber is sure the dogs were present in 1900 as draft dogs for peddlers and people going to market, watch dogs for farmers and drover’s dog for butchers; they were rarely tri-colored. Everywhere the dogs had short, rough coats; nearly all were brown, yellow or black with white and brown markings. Lons' description of the northern and central German butcher dog also fits the Sennenhunde at the beginning of pure breeding; this applies to the Austrian butcher dog of Linz, and the French and Belgian Matin. It is to their credit that Heim and Schertenleib selected one variation of the butcher dog [...] possible the most beautiful [...] and started it on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pure breed.|$|E

[...] He favorably compared Jackson's performance of [...] "Is It Scary" [...] to rock singer Marilyn Manson and noted the lyrics, [...] "If you want to see eccentric oddities, I'll be grotesque before your eyes". Strauss suggested that the predatory woman, [...] "Susie", from the title track, was a metaphor for AIDS. Finally, he described [...] "Morphine" [...] as [...] "chilling...

2500|$|During the 1960s, {{the republican}} {{movement}} {{under the leadership}} of Cathal Goulding radically re-assessed their ideology and tactics after the dismal failure of the IRA's Border Campaign in the years 1956–62. They were heavily influenced by popular front ideology and drew close to communist thinking. A key intermediary body was the Communist Party of Great Britain's organisation for Irish exiles, the Connolly Association. The Marxist analysis was that the conflict in Northern Ireland was a [...] "bourgeois nationalist" [...] one between the Ulster Protestant and Irish Catholic working classes, fomented and continued by the ruling class. Its effect was to depress wages, since worker could be set against worker. They concluded that the first step on <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 32-county socialist republic in Ireland was the [...] "democratisation" [...] of Northern Ireland (i.e., the removal of discrimination against Catholics) and radicalisation of the southern working class. This would allow [...] "class politics" [...] to develop, eventually resulting in a challenge to the hegemony of both what they termed [...] "British imperialism" [...] and the respective unionist and Irish nationalist establishments north and south of the Irish border.|$|E
