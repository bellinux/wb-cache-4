50|$|The festival gained wide {{publicity}} in the 1960s.

The food was arranged in slices on a wood trough made in the likeness of old troughs on display in the National Museum of Iceland. The restaurant advertised this platter as Þorramatur, thereby linking it with the tradition of the Þorrablót. The idea was well received and the serving of Þorramatur has since become a defining feature of Þorrablót.|$|R

In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.

50|$|The {{painting}} {{appears to}} be based on popular comparisons of current events to historical heroism, though too little is known of the paintings previously located in the old Amsterdam Town Hall before it burned down in 1652 {{to be able to say}} whether the subjects were painted before.

His dog approaches as if to see what the fuss is about, while a group of 12 figures seem surprised at the disinterest of Dentatus. The half-naked servant on the lower right holds <b>a</b> large <b>platter</b> above the Vianen ewer. The ewer was painted multiple times, but this is the largest painting that features it, and its position in the painting is at about eye-level, just above a poem relating the story told by the painting.

50|$|The {{direct-drive}} turntable {{was invented}} by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan.

In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their Technics series of turntables.

25|$|DJ turntablism has {{origins in}} the {{invention}} of direct-drive turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism and mixing, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed <b>a</b> motor <b>to</b> directly drive <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> on which <b>a</b> vinyl record rests.

50|$|In a {{direct-drive}} turntable {{the motor}} is located {{directly under the}} center of the platter and is connected to the platter directly.

A direct-drive turntable eliminates belts, and instead employs <b>a</b> motor <b>to</b> directly drive <b>a</b> <b>platter</b> on which <b>a</b> vinyl record rests. This makes scratching possible, as the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggles the record {{back and forth on the}} platter.|$|R

Open during summer only from early to mid June until late September, Cabana shuts down by 11pm on weekends due to the residents of the neighbouring Toronto Island complaining about the noise from the patio. The venue is closed to the general public during summer weekdays though it is available for corporate bookings and functions. Light food offerings and snacks at the venue are handled by Oliver & Bonacini Restaurants, a Toronto-based hospitality company.|$|R
