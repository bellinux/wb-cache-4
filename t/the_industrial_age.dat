5|$|Richelieu {{was laid}} down at Toulon in 1869 and {{launched}} on 3 December 1873. While the exact reason for such prolonged construction {{time is not}} known, it was probably due to financial pressures caused by slashing of French Navy's budget which was cut after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 coupled with the outdated work practices of the French dockyards at the time, which were not suitable for <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Age.</b> The ship began her sea trials on 12 April 1875, but did not begin her service with the Mediterranean Squadron, of which she became flagship, until 10 February 1876.

25|$|Due to the {{explosive}} increase in traffic {{at the height}} of <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>age,</b> the station was soon unable to cope with the growing demand. A separate marshalling yard was built in the 1880s, situated on the southern side of the passenger station. However, this did not provide real relief, and therefore the station area underwent major reconstruction starting in 1911 and finishing by 1929. The railway lines were laid on elevated embankments and the trackbed inside the station was raised, the old station building, originally built as an island platform, was torn down and replaced by the current building, the construction of which was finished by 1920.|$|E

25|$|The {{innovations}} in education raised tender social issues in Tunisia.

The balance between the teaching of traditional morality versus modern utilitarian skills, as well as exactly how and which morals to teach, became greatly contested {{in light of the}} wider French debate between religious versus secular values; it involved left-republican anticlerical politics. Similar issues arose later in Tunisia, including the views of the national movement.|$|E

PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons) and phenols degradation has been particularly investigated because they are considered persistent and recalcitrant.
