2500|$|In {{addition}} to the liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry devices, an LC-MS system contains an interface that efficiently transfers <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> <b>components</b> from the LC column into the MS ion source. The interface is necessary because the LC and MS devices are fundamentally incompatible. While the mobile phase in a LC system is a pressurized liquid, the MS analyzers commonly operate under vacuum (around 10−6 torr). Thus, {{it is not possible}} to directly pump the eluate from the LC column into the MS source. Overall, the interface is a mechanically simple part of the LC-MS system that [...] transfers the maximum amount of analyte, removes a significant portion of the mobile phase used in LC and preserves the chemical identity of the chromatography products (chemically inert). As a requirement, the interface should not interfere with the ionizing efficiency and vacuum conditions of the MS system. Nowadays, most extensively applied LC-MS interfaces are based on atmospheric pressure ionization (API) strategies like electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI).These interfaces became available in the 1990s after a two decade long research and development process.|$|E

50|$|In some {{contexts}} further {{stages of}} analysis of <b>the</b> <b>separated</b> <b>components</b> may be required. The active ingredients of a formulated chemical product that differentiate it from another similar material may include proprietary ingredients or specific functional additives.

Some examples of functional additives include surfactants, emulsifiers, dispersants, adhesion promotors, leveling agents, dyes and pigments, antioxidants, preservatives, and optical brighteners. Practically every type of chemically formulated product is associated with its own formulary of likely functional additive choices that can fulfill some critical role in performance. Deformulation may thus require both a breakdown of material composition and also identification of the functional role of key ingredients.|$|E
