500|$|The {{pavilion}} {{stood at}} an angle to the crease, so the members were not in an ideal position to see how accurate the decision was. The uproar continued as it became obvious that no batsman was coming out to replace Murdoch, so Harris walked towards the pavilion and met Gregory at the gate, at which point Gregory asked Harris to change his umpire. Harris refused, as the English team considered the decision <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> correct. Lord Harris later said that his two fielders in the point and cover positions, being side on to the crease, had {{a good view of the}} incident, and that they agreed with Coulthard's judgement. [...] Barton said that Coulthard's decision was correct, and that the Englishmen were justified in standing by their nominated umpire.|$|E
500|$|Lord Pitfour is {{described}} as being good humoured but of a [...] "somewhat awkward manner" [...] and small in stature. His voice was shrill and he had poor eyesight. He was shrewd, kind and sympathetic, which put him at odds {{with some of his}} colleagues on the bench. Serving {{at the same time as}} Lord Braxfield, who had a reputation for handing down severe sentences, Pitfour was viewed as indecisive and too lenient. His desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> reach compromise had stood him in good stead as an advocate, but as a judge, these characteristics drew criticism from his contemporaries. Lord Kames was critical of him, maintaining that Pitfour did not want anyone to be hanged. Writing in 2008, local historian Alex Buchan speculated that Pitfour's hard life travelling around Scotland took too much of a toll on him, leading to a rapid decline in his health and ability. At 64 years of age at his appointment as a judge, he was likely too old to be effective.|$|E
500|$|For {{months prior}} to the pay-per-view, Hulk Hogan and undisputed WWF Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage, two of the WWF's top crowd favorites, had feuded with André the Giant and Ted DiBiase, respectively. The two feuds first came {{together}} at WrestleMania IV, when—as the result of the vacating of the WWF Heavyweight Championship—a 14-man single-elimination tournament was set up to crown a new champion. Hogan and André had been disqualified in their quarterfinal match, while Savage and DiBiase reached the championship match; in that final match, Savage defeated DiBiase with help from Hogan. Savage and DiBiase feuded over the title throughout the spring and summer, but André did not become involved until mid-summer when he and DiBiase helped instigate a 2-on-1 attack against Savage as he was delivering a promo. Savage quickly recovered and challenged André and DiBiase to a tag team match against him and a partner to be named. That partner later was revealed to be Hogan; the team became known as [...] "The Mega Powers." [...] The André-DiBiase team—which dubbed itself [...] "The Mega Bucks"—retaliated by announcing the guest referee would be someone they declared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> neutral: Jesse Ventura, a color commentator on the WWF's programs who favored the villains, though according to the main storyline, Ventura was chosen by WWF President Jack Tunney as the only person capable of handling such a match.|$|E

500|$|The {{rollback}} device gained {{its name}} when President Richard Nixon sought to appoint Senator William Saxbe as Attorney General following the Saturday Night Massacre. Elliot Richardson resigned on October 20, 1973 and Nixon nominated Saxbe on November 1. Saxbe was chosen {{in large part}} because, despite the confrontations of the ongoing Watergate scandal, Nixon felt the Senate would want to confirm one of their own. Saxbe had been a senator in 1969 when the Congress passed a pay increase from $35,000 to $60,000 for Cabinet members. According to , [...] "After considering the report and recommendations of the Commission submitted under section 357 of this title, the President shall transmit to Congress his recommendations {{with respect to the}} exact rates of pay, for offices and positions within the purview of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of section 356 of this title, which the President considers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> reasonable…" [...] The President transmitted [...] "Salary Recommendations For 1969 Increases" [...] to Congress on January 15, 1969 following the first Commission Report submitted to him under [...] in December 1968. (34 F.R. 2241; [...] ). Saxbe had become a Senator on January 3, 1969 and on February 14 the legislation became law when Congress took no action to veto the proposal that raised the salary of top executive branch officials, the judicial branch and members of Congress.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{the actress}} playing Ian's mother Kathy (Gillian Taylforth) was fair-haired, they also wanted him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair,</b> <b>and</b> because of Taylforth's age {{he also had}} to look very young. Ian {{was meant to be}} 14 years old when the {{programme}} first aired, but because of licensing regulations, the actor cast was required to be a 16-year-old who could [...] "play down". Adam Woodyatt, born in East London, had worked as an actor in his youth, but had given it up and relocated with his family to Wales. He was recruited from his old agency and it was decided that he was perfect for the part and he was subsequently cast as Ian Beale. In 1990 Ian's age was increased and he celebrated his twenty-first birthday two years after his eighteenth. The producers felt Ian needed to be a bit older and more mature for storylines planned for him later that year.|$|E

While defending the legislation, Mukherji convened public hearings prior to ordering an overhaul of the One-Strike policy, telling Jersey City Independent that the policy had “served as a deterrent and important tool to reduce drug-related and violent criminal activity in public housing (…but) certain revisions may be appropriate to ensure an equitable policy and eviction process… We want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable to criminal defendants, as the presumption of innocence must be sacrosanct, while being mindful that our foremost responsibility is to do all that we can to keep our tenants safe.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Such was the {{popularity}} of Gordon that the first critical book by a British author was not published until 1908, when Baring [...] by this time raised to the peerage as Viscount Cromer [...] published his autobiography, which was notable as the first British book to portray Gordon in an unflattering manner, though Lord Cromer also tried <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> emphasised what he felt were Gordon's positive, {{as well as his}} negative, traits. About the charge that if only Gladstone had listened to Gordon the disaster would have been avoided, Cromer wrote that in the course of one month, he received five telegrams from Gordon offering his advice, each one of which completely contradicted the previous telegram, leading Cromer to charge that Gordon was too mercurial a figure to hold command. As a young man, Winston Churchill shared in the national consensus that Gordon was one of Britain's greatest heroes. During a meeting in 1898 in Cairo where Churchill interviewed Baring to gather material for his 1899 book The River War, Baring challenged Churchill about his belief that Gordon was a hero. After his conversation with Baring, Churchill wrote: [...] "Of course {{there is no doubt that}} Gordon as a political figure was absolutely hopeless. He was so erratic, capricious, utterly unreliable, his mood changed so often, his temper was abominable, he was frequently drunk, and yet with all that he had a tremendous sense of honour and great abilities".|$|E
