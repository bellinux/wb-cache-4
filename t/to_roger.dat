5|$|St. Lawrence's is a Palladian-style {{building}} {{by an unknown}} architect.

The second-generation Palladian architect Henry Flitcroft has been suggested; by 1746 he was the master carpenter at three London palaces, and his St Giles in the Fields at Holborn was London's first Palladian-style church. James Gibbs has also been suggested, as the spire of St Lawrence's {{is similar to that of}} St Martin-in-the-Fields in the City of Westminster, London. Sir Howard Colvin tentatively attributes the church <b>to</b> <b>Roger</b> Morris.|$|E
