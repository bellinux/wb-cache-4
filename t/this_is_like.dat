5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E
25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> gossip. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> fishwives. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, it means I don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E

25|$|If the p-value is {{not less}} than the {{required}} significance level (equivalently, if the observed test statistic is outside the critical region), then the test has no result. The evidence is insufficient to support a conclusion. (<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a jury that fails to reach a verdict.) The researcher typically gives extra consideration to those cases where the p-value is close to the significance level.|$|E
25|$|Linda Schele noted {{following}} the conference that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> {{saying that the}} inscriptions of ancient Egypt—or the writings of Greek philosophers or historians—do not reveal anything important about their cultures. Most written documents in most cultures {{tell us about the}} elite, because in most cultures in the past, {{they were the ones who}} could write (or could have things written down by scribes or inscribed on monuments).|$|E
25|$|Finally, if CKE {{is lowered}} {{at the same}} time as an auto-refresh command is sent to the SDRAM, the SDRAM enters self-refresh mode. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> power down, but the SDRAM uses an on-chip timer to {{generate}} internal refresh cycles as necessary. The clock may be stopped during this time. While self-refresh mode consumes slightly more power than power-down mode, it allows the memory controller to be disabled entirely, which commonly more than makes up the difference.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hai! Hai!" [...] {{continued}} Babalatchi, unmoved and dreamy. [...] "Many years ago.

25|$|An {{apostrophe}} {{is used in}} {{time and}} money references, among others, in constructions such as one hour’s respite, two weeks’ holiday, a dollar’s worth, five pounds’ worth, one mile’s drive from here. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> an ordinary possessive use. For example, one hour’s respite means a respite of one hour (exactly as the cat’s whiskers means the whiskers of the cat). Exceptions are accounted for in the same way: three months pregnant (in modern usage, one says neither pregnant of three months, nor one month(’)s pregnant).|$|E
25|$|Most purely {{functional}} programming languages (notably Miranda and its descendents, including Haskell), and the proof languages of theorem provers, use lazy evaluation, {{which is essentially}} the same as call by need. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> normal order reduction, but call by need manages to avoid the duplication of work inherent in normal order reduction using sharing. In the example given above, (λx.xx) ((λx.x)y) reduces to ((λx.x)y) ((λx.x)y), which has two redexes, but in call by need they are represented using the same object rather than copied, so when one is reduced the other is too.|$|E
25|$|The missing {{information}} needed to help explain how new features could pass from a parent to its offspring {{was provided by the}} pioneering genetics work of Gregor Mendel. Mendel’s experiments with several generations of pea plants demonstrated that inheritance works by separating and reshuffling hereditary information during the formation of sex cells and recombining that information during fertilisation. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> mixing different hands of playing cards, with an organism getting a random mix of half of the cards from one parent, and half of the cards from the other. Mendel called the information factors; however, they later became known as genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity in living organisms. They contain the information that directs the physical development and behavior of organisms.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there have}} been {{concerns}} regarding marriages and civil partnerships. Under the Gender Recognition Act 2004, transgender people who are married have been required to divorce or annul their marriage {{in order for them}} to be issued with a GRC. The government chose to retain this requirement in the Act as effectively it would have legalised a small category of same-sex marriages.The Civil Partnership Act 2004 allowed the creation of civil partnerships between same-sex couples, but a married couple that includes a transgender partner cannot simply re-register their new status. They must first have their marriage dissolved, gain legal recognition of the new gender and then register for a civil partnership. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> any divorce with the associated paperwork and costs.|$|E
500|$|The {{atmosphere}} of the hotel was meant {{to connect with the}} character of Charlie. As Joel explained: [...] "Our intention, moreover, was that the hotel function as an exteriorization of the character played by John Goodman. The sweat drips off his forehead like the paper peels off the walls. At the end, when Goodman says that he is a prisoner of his own mental state, that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> some kind of hell, it was necessary for the hotel to have already suggested something infernal." [...] The peeling wallpaper and the paste which seeps through it also mirror Charlie's chronic ear infection and the resultant pus.|$|E
500|$|On July 8, 2010, in some press {{materials}} for San Diego Comic-Con, {{the film was}} referred to as Saw 3D: The Traps Come Alive, which led to the media assuming it was the final name. The following day, Burg and Koules said that [...] "The Traps Come Alive" [...] was simply a tagline that had been misinterpreted as part of the title. Koules said that if they included the seventh Roman numeral followed by [...] "3D" [...] (Saw VII 3D), it would have been [...] "cumbersome" [...] and not made the impact they wanted.

500|$|U2's {{delivery}} of Zooropa in late May caught PolyGram somewhat off-guard, {{because they were}} not expecting a new album by the group for several years. With Achtung Baby, PolyGram had approximately six months to market the record and plan its release strategy, but the sudden completion of Zooropa necessitated a more hurried promotional plan. PolyGram president/CEO Rick Dobbis explained: [...] "For the last one, we prepared for six months. It was like a marathon. But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a sprint, and that is the spirit it was made in. The band was so excited about it, they sprinted to complete the album before the ... tour. We want to bring it to the street with that same spirit." [...] Island/PolyGram's and U2's marketing for Zooropa was intended to focus less on singles and more on the record as a whole, and ultimately, only three singles were released, compared to Achtung Babys five singles. The first single [...] "Numb" [...] was released in June 1993 exclusively on VHS as a [...] "video single". The music video was directed by Kevin Godley. The song peaked at number seven in Australia and number nine in Canada, while reaching number two on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, it failed to chart on the singles charts in the UK or US.|$|E
500|$|U2 and McGuinness {{thought that}} too much money had been {{invested}} to abort the concert, and they sympathised with the fans who had travelled to the venue in the poor weather. Accordingly, they decided {{to proceed with the}} concert as planned. However, according to Ezratty, many of the crew were not in agreement and wanted to walk off the set. He said, [...] "The guys from the American sound company were not at all enamored with being out with this band. I can remember them saying, [...] "Oh, we could be out with Asia right now!' So they decided to pull the plug on it. They said, 'It's a matter of safety. We're going to pull the system down and we're not doing to do it.'" [...] McGuinness dissuaded the crew with an impromptu speech, a moment on which Ezratty recollected: [...] "Paul called everybody down into the bowels of Red Rocks where they fed everybody. It was cold and raining and everybody was shivering, and Paul made a speech, saying in no uncertain terms {{that we were going to}} proceed as one, that the band's entire livelihood was riding on this, and that this was one of the most pivotal moments in their career. He said that if it were deemed that this show was in any way possible to happen, it was going to happen, and it was not going to be tolerated that anybody would do anything but add their effort to a successful and positive outcome I just stood there and went, [...] "This is so cool. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> a general rallying the troops.'" ...|$|E
