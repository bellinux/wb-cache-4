The danced prologue Terpischore HWV 8b performed there contains sumptuous scoring for alto recorders, violins, violas and pizzicato cellos with the bass and <b>treble</b> <b>lines</b> doubled by organs; Handel marked the score, [...] "Les orgues doucement, e la Teorbe".|$|E

[...] "We are sure to be greatly outnumbered, and, when we first spring on board, we must cut our way across the deck, and then form ourselves in a double or <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> across it, and, so fighting, gradually force them before us." ...|$|R
50|$|A few choirs {{elaborate}} further, e.g. {{by having}} some verses sung by soloists, trebles only, alto/tenor/bass only (with the <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> transferred {{into one of}} the other parts) or one part or soloists singing the melody {{while the rest of the}} choir hums. Occasionally some or all trebles may sing a descant; this usually happens only in the final verse of the psalm and/or the Gloria.|$|R
50|$|The {{style of}} worship at Holy Trinity Church {{falls within the}} liberal {{tradition}} of the Church of England. There are usually two services, a Sung Eucharist (Common Worship) and Evensong (Book of Common Prayer), on a Sunday. Morning Prayer is said every weekday. Sunday worship {{is led by the}} forty-strong choir, which is unusual in being a parish church choir which retains an all-boys <b>treble</b> <b>line.</b>|$|R
60|$|Now {{the company}} of wizards, leaving their medicine-pots upon the ground, formed {{themselves}} in a <b>treble</b> <b>line,</b> and marching to where the king stood, they saluted him. Then they sang the praises of their god, and in a song that had been prepared, heaped insult upon the God {{of the white man}} and upon the messenger who preached Him. To all of this Owen listened in silence.|$|R

The lower parts in the Choir are sung by senior pupils, many of whom have themselves been Quiristers, or choristers at cathedrals and other choral foundations.|$|R
50|$|The choir is now {{notable for}} {{being one of}} the last {{remaining}} English cathedral voluntary choirs to be made up of entirely male voices, and still routinely sings the 6:30pm Evensong on Sundays. The choir's <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> is composed of boys aged 6-14, whilst the lower parts are made up of men, some of whom previously sang as trebles. Today the choir numbers approximately 35 singers. The internationally renowned tenor John Mark Ainsley, {{was a member of the}} choir for some months.|$|R

50|$|St Mary's Cathedral is {{the only}} cathedral in Scotland to {{maintain}} a tradition of daily choral services with choristers drawn from its own choir school. It was the first cathedral in Britain to employ girls in the <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> as well as boys, in 1978 when Dennis Townhill was organist and choir master. In 2005 St Mary's Cathedral became the first cathedral in the Anglican tradition to have a female alto singing in daily services. The Father Henry Willis organ was built in 1879.|$|R

Its scenery is very picturesque, although not of so wild a character as the mountain region of Rawalpindi to the north, and is lighted up in places by smiling patches of cultivated valley. The backbone of the district is formed by the Salt Range, a <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> of parallel hills running in three long forks from east to west throughout its whole breadth.|$|R
5000|$|Bach himself rearranged many of {{his pieces}} to suit the {{performing}} situation. For example, the Prelude to his Partita for solo violin in E Major was transposed down to D Major with the solo violin part given to the organ, with oboes, trumpets, tympani, and strings added to provide the Sinfonia for his Cantata No.29. His Concerto for clavier and strings in F Minor was adapted with the <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> of the clavier arranged for solo violin. And, of course, Bach arranged many concertos by other composers (notably Vivaldi) for organ or harpsichord.|$|R

When they were about fifty yards away, running in a <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> with spears advanced, I called out [...] "Fire!" [...] in Zulu, and set the example by loosing off both barrels of my express rifle at men whom I had picked out as leaders, with results {{that must have been}} more satisfactory to me than to the two Amahagger whose troubles in this world came to an end.|$|R
50|$|The main choir {{consists}} of the boy choristers, girl choristers and the lay clerks. The provision of boy choristers was why King's School was founded in 604, {{at the same time}} as the cathedral itself. It still supplies boys from its preparatory school to sing the <b>treble</b> <b>line.</b> From 1995 a girls' choir was introduced to sing some of the services for which the boys were not available. Girls are drawn from any of the local schools. The lay clerks are professional singers who provide the lower three voices: alto, tenor and bass. For great services, all three parts of the choir may combine.|$|R
50|$|The first chapel choir {{was formed}} in 1866. For the next one hundred years the choir {{consisted}} of undergraduate lower voices and a <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> provided by boys from city schools. In 1966, the use of boys was discontinued and {{for a brief period}} there was no upper line. The current mixed-voice choir was established in 1971 by Peter Dennison, a music fellow of the college. He was succeeded by the college's first director of music, John Rutter. Rutter left in 1979 to focus on composing but retains a close connection with the college as an honorary fellow. Timothy Brown directed the choir for 31 years until he was succeeded by the choir's current director of music, Graham Ross.|$|R
50|$|My Lady Carey's Dompe is {{sometimes}} attributed to English innovative composer {{of the early}} Tudor period, Hugh Aston. It is in G Dorian mode and consists of an improvisatory <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> over a drone alternating between two bass notes, G and D. It may have been written {{for the death of}} William Carey, a courtier and favorite of Henry VIII, who died on 22 June 1528, and in this case, Lady Carey may refer to his wife Mary Boleyn, one of the mistresses of Henry VIII and the sister of Henry's second wife, Anne Boleyn, but also to Carey’s mother, sisters and sister-in-law. Dompe, which may come from Irish dump that means lament, can refer to a dance, a dirge, a lament or a melancholic love song.|$|R
2500|$|The {{music itself}} is also {{meant to be}} participatory. Most forms of choral {{composition}} place the melody on the top (<b>treble)</b> <b>line,</b> {{where it can be}} best heard by an audience, with the other parts written so as not to obscure the melody. In contrast, Sacred Harp composers have aimed to make each musical part singable and interesting in its own right, thus giving every singer in the group an absorbing task. [...] For this reason, [...] "bringing out the melody" [...] is not a high priority in Sacred Harp composition, and indeed it is customary to assign the melody not to the trebles but to the tenors. Fuging tunes, in which each section gets its moment to shine, also illustrate the importance in Sacred Harp of maintaining the independence of each vocal part.|$|R

50|$|The {{choir of}} All Saints' Church, Northampton {{was formed in}} the Middle Ages and {{consists}} of boys and men and more recently, girls. The boys choir, the last of its kind singing in Northamptonshire, range from 8 to 14 years old and the girls from 12 to 18. The men consist of choral scholars with an age range of 15 to 18, most of them having previously sung in the <b>treble</b> <b>line,</b> and lay clerks. These choirs sing at least three fully choral services a week: Mass on Sundays mornings, and evensong on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 6pm. At Mass the choir sings a full Mass Setting (Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, Benedictus, Agnus Dei), an offertory anthem and various other pieces of liturgical music, as well as leading the hymns. At Evensong the choirs sing an anthem, a canticle setting (Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis), responses, and a psalm.|$|R
60|$|With a cheer the men leapt {{over the}} embankment. There was room for ten abreast, {{and in a}} <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> with {{levelled}} spears they bore down upon the rebels. The charge was irresistible. A few {{of the leaders of}} the peasants threw themselves on to the spears and died there, the others strove, but in vain, to fly. Their comrades behind, ignorant of what was going on, still pressed up, and it was not until the screams and shouts of those in front, and the pressure downwards, brought the column to a stand and then bore it backward, that they learned that the defenders had taken the offensive, and were sweeping all before them. Then a panic arose, and the peasants rushed down the road, the tenants above saluting them as they passed with another volley of rocks. Halfway down the hill Hector halted his men, and led them up to the intrenchment again over a road encumbered with dead bodies.|$|R

Compiled by John Playford (1623 - 1687), a publisher of music books, the treatise is considered an important work on English country dances, a form of dance where couples perform a series of set patterns. In this tenth edition, Henry Playford notes {{that he has made}} corrections and added several new dances and tunes. The work utilizes a rudimentary dance notation and page one of the treatise is devoted to an explanation of the symbols. Part one contains 215 dances; part two has 46 dances and additional music for "A new spanish entry and saraband," as danced by Monsieur L'Abbe.

5000|$|The rise of {{instrumental}} monody {{did not have}} its roots exclusively in vocal music. In part, {{it was based on}} the extant sixteenth-century practice of performing polyphonic madrigals with one voice singing the <b>treble</b> <b>line,</b> while the others were played by instruments or by a single keyboard instrument. [...] Thus, while all voices were still theoretically equal in these polyphonic compositions, in practice the listener would have heard one voice as being a melody and the others as accompaniment. Furthermore, the new musical genres that appeared in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, especially the instrumental sonata, revealed a transition in ways of thinking about composition and performance, from a collaboration of equals to a soloist backed up by a relatively unimportant accompaniment. [...] In addition, even in the mid sixteenth century, most works for voice and lute were conceived specifically as such. In the realm of English ayres, for instance, this meant that composers such as John Dowland and Adrian LeRoy were already thinking of a dichotomous melody and bass, filled in not with counterpoint but with chords [...] "planned for harmonic effect." ...|$|R
50|$|Chronologically, {{the next}} {{composition}} {{to be finished}} was the Study No. 21, the canon X. It is an acceleration study where one voice progressively slows down while the other speeds up. The study starts with a bass line playing a 12-tone row at about 4 notes per second, immediately followed by the other voice, playing thirty-nine notes per second. Then the bass line starts to speed up and the <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> slows down progressively, reaching the same tempo halfway through the piece. The piece ends {{up with one of}} the lines playing 120 notes per second. It was presumably written in 1961 and was first performed in the Mexico City performance in 1962. The X alludes to the tempo acceleration and deceleration of both parts in the canon. It was also arranged for synthesizer, Marantz computer-piano, two disc-pianos and two voices. Following, Study No. 22, a canon with ratios of 1%/1½%/2¼%; this means that the lowest voice starts at a given tempo and accelerates 1% over time, the second voice does so at 1½% and the third voice at 2¼%. The three voices accelerate until the middle of the piece, where they decelerate at the same rate and {{get to the end of}} the piece at the same initial speeds. This canon was first performed in Kassel, Germany, in Summer 1982.|$|R
500|$|The {{sense of}} desolation returns, in what Hogwood calls the [...] "remote and barbarous" [...] key of B flat minor, for the tenor recitative [...] "All they that see him". The sombre {{sequence}} finally {{ends with the}} Ascension chorus [...] "Lift up your heads", which Handel initially divides between two choral groups, the altos serving both as the bass line to a soprano choir and the <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> to the tenors and basses. For the 1754 Foundling Hospital performance Handel added two horns, which join in when the chorus unites {{towards the end of}} the number. After the celebratory tone of Christ's reception into heaven, marked by the choir's D major acclamation [...] "Let all the angels of God worship him", the [...] "Whitsun" [...] section proceeds through a series of contrasting moods—serene and pastoral in [...] "How beautiful are the feet", theatrically operatic in [...] "Why do the nations so furiously rage"—towards the Part II culmination of [...] "Hallelujah". This, as Young points out, is not the climactic chorus of the work, although one cannot escape its [...] "contagious enthusiasm". It builds from a deceptively light orchestral opening, through a short, unison cantus firmus passage on the words [...] "For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth", to the reappearance of the long-silent trumpets at [...] "And He shall reign for ever and ever". Commentators have noted that the musical line for this third subject is based on Wachet auf, Philipp Nicolai's popular Lutheran chorale.|$|R
500|$|The {{development}} {{begins with}} the piano repeating its entry to the solo exposition, {{this time in the}} relative major of E-flat. The Concerto No. 20 is the only other of Mozart's concertos in which the solo exposition and the development commence with the same material. In the Concerto No. 24, the material unfolds in the development in a manner different from the solo exposition: the opening solo motif, with its half cadence, is repeated four times, with one intervention from the woodwinds, as if asking question after question. The final question is asked in C minor, and is answered by a descending scale from the piano that leads to an orchestral statement, in F minor, of the movement's principal theme. The orchestral theme is then developed: the motif of the theme's fourth and fifth measures descends through the circle of fifths, accompanied by an elaborate piano figuration. After this, the development proceeds to a stormy exchange between the piano and the orchestra, which the twentieth-century Mozart scholar Cuthbert Girdlestone describes as [...] "one of the few [...] in Mozart where passion seems really unchained", and which Tovey describes as a passage of [...] "fine, severe massiveness". The exchange resolves to a passage in which the piano plays a <b>treble</b> <b>line</b> of sixteenth notes, over which the winds add echoes of the main theme. This transitional passage ultimately modulates to the home key of C minor, bringing about the start of the recapitulation with the conventional re-statement, by the orchestra, of the movement's principal theme.|$|R
50|$|Leonardo Acosta is not {{convinced}} by Rodríguez's {{claim to have}} invented the mambo, if by mambo Rodríguez meant the big-band arrangements of Dámaso Pérez Prado. Rodríguez was not an arranger: his lyrics and musical ideas were worked over by the group's arranger. The compositions were published with just the minimal bass and <b>treble</b> piano <b>lines.</b> To achieve the big-band mambo such as by Pérez Prado, Machito, Tito Puente or Tito Rodríguez requires a full orchestration where the trumpets play counterpoint {{to the rhythm of}} the saxophones. This, a fusion of Cuban with big-band jazz ideas, is not found in Rodríguez, whose musical forms are set in the traditional categories of Cuban music.|$|R
5000|$|Honegger {{wrote in}} the preface of the score about his {{intention}} to [...] "envelop the drama with a tight symphonic construction without the movement seeming heavy. He was concerned about a clear rendition of the text, taking special care of the consonants, which he described as the [...] "locomotive" [...] of understanding. He later expressed that French composers [...] "show exclusive concern for the melodic design", neglecting diction. Antigone is cited by Robert Dearling as the first classical work {{to make use of}} the musical saw, though the term flexatone is used, and Geoffrey Spratt says that Act 2, Scene VIII, [...] "opens with a long <b>treble</b> melismatic <b>line</b> of quite astounding expression and profundity—qualities in no small way attributable to its scoring for saxophone and musical saw." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hull Docks {{has been}} an ongoing project to upgrade the Hull Docks Branch (Engineers' Line Reference HJS) to <b>treble</b> the <b>lines</b> {{capacity}} {{as the amount of}} rail traffic through ABP's Hull Docks site increases. The branch is part of the old Hull and Barnsley Railway and was originally built, primarily, for the export of coal via the docks in Hull. Much of the increased rail traffic is, ironically, imported coal. Work also saw many structures along the line upgraded to cater for heavier trains. Included {{in this part of the}} project is Hull Bridge, the former Hull and Barnsley swingbridge, known officially as HJS-22. The structure dates from 1885 when the line originally opened. Other work has included multiple earth works and a greatly improved and upgraded signalling system to cope with the increased traffic.|$|R
