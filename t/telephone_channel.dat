By late 1940, the Moscow Central Telegraph Office had 22 facsimile lines. In 1941, a 12-channel line between Moscow and Leningrad was put into operation that meant the concurrent transmission of 12 telephone calls over a single pair of wires.|$|E

40|$|It is {{important}} to detect {{a change in the}} echo path quickly but not confuse it with double talk, since the echo canceler should react differently for these two phenomena. In this chapter, a sequential detection scheme is presented and, based on model assumptions, the maximum a posteriori probabilities of the occurrence of double talk and abrupt changes in the echo path are derived. By utilizing the fact that the most active part of a typical impulse response of a <b>telephone</b> <b>channel</b> is short and by using a low complexity time-delay estimation algorithm to find these most active taps and not estimating the rest of the taps, low computational complexity of the proposed detection method is achieved.

In this paper we explore the use of other speaker verification systems on the <b>telephone</b> <b>channel</b> data and compare against the GMM baseline.

The mean auditory ratings obtained in these tests have been compared to estimations provided by the P. 563 model. Correlations between auditory and estimated quality scores vary considerably between experiments.
