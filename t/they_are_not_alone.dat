25|$|Women Under Siege's website {{includes}} blogs {{about current}} violent activity and also first-person accounts {{from those who}} have experienced violence. Wolfe has interviewed women from around the world about their experiences. Entries are not always about current events; Jamia Wilson wrote an article for the website about women and sexual violence during civil rights protests. Steinem emphasized that the website can also help women realize that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> and give them a voice.|$|E
25|$|Counselors serving ACOAs {{can also}} help by working on {{building}} coping mechanisms such as creating meaningful relationships with other non-alcoholic family members. Having other family members who are supportive can help the ACOA feel like <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> Counselors can also provide some psycho-education on alcoholism {{and its effects on}} family members of alcoholics. Research shows that ACOAs feel less like blaming their parents for their alcoholism after learning that alcoholism is a disease, rather than a behavior.|$|E

60|$|When {{the last}} haze had faded from the ordered paths, the open lawns, and the flaming flower-beds, the two realized, not without an abrupt {{re-examination}} of their position, that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in the garden.|$|R
60|$|For {{nearly a}} minute {{the three men}} stood in {{absolute}} silence, listening for a repetition of the mysterious sound, and, though it did <b>not</b> recur, there <b>was</b> an indescribable feeling {{in the heart of}} each that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in that cavern.|$|R
500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Whitney Pastorek {{called it}} [...] "a decent episode made much, much better by its {{absolutely}} bloodcurdling final moments." [...] Chris Carabott of IGN wrote in 2008 {{that while the}} episode was not {{the best of the}} first season, it was [...] "noteworthy for its memorable reveal of the show's first Other." [...] He praised the episode's suspenseful climax, with Ethan's revelation appearing alongside Sayid and Hurley warning them <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> De Ravin's performance was seen as another highlight. Zap2it columnist Ryan McGee, also writing in 2008, praised the [...] "stellar" [...] episode for showing the first real antagonist of the series. McGee felt that Ethan's reveal helped Lost turn [...] "sharply in introducing an on-Island, human threat for [...] survivors." [...] He concluded that it was among the top five best episodes of the first season.|$|E
2500|$|The show's writing {{team has}} {{an average age}} of 21, and {{includes}} several [...] "teenage consultants". Elsley said, [...] "It's all about the writing.

60|$|He strode off {{towards the}} distant trees {{with a new}} energy, his rags and ribbons {{fluttering}} in the wind. The others followed him in a more footsore and dubious manner. And almost {{at the same moment}} all six men realised that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in the little field.|$|R
60|$|The {{room door}} slipped off its hook and swung wide open as the vessel rolled, and Dick, {{who could not}} {{withdraw}} unnoticed, decided to light his cigarette in order that the others might see that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> As he struck the match the captain got up.|$|R
60|$|A little silence followed, {{broken only}} by the patter of the rain without, the crackle of the wood fire within, and the scratch of a busy pen from a curtained recess {{at the end of the}} long room. In the sudden hush the girls heard it and remembered that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Patriarch Irinej of Serbia {{asserted}} that the May 2014 flooding in the region was [...] "divine punishment" [...] from God for Wurst's victory. Patriarch Amfilohije of Montenegro also blamed Wurst's victory for the floods. Irish television presenter for the BBC and former Eurovision BBC commentator Terry Wogan described that year's performance as a [...] "freak show". Reacting to these critics, Wurst stated [...] "It's so ridiculous! For me a perfect world would be when we don't {{have to talk about}} sexuality, where you're from, what you believe. Is this the worst thing {{in the mind of the}} politicians?" [...] She stated her desire to perform in Russia for the country's LGBT community, [...] "To tell them that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> The whole community around the world is standing behind them. They have to trust that if they open their mouth, then we can change something." [...] To a reporter from The Observer, she commented: [...] "It's funny that these people think I'm so powerful. I've figured out over the years, you can only hurt me if I love you; if I don't know you, I really don't care. There are people who want to kill me and I'm always like, 'Well, get in line, darling.'" ...|$|E

60|$|HYPATIA'S VOICE OUTSIDE. No, no. [She {{breaks off}} in a stifled half laugh, half scream, and is seen darting across the garden with Percival in hot pursuit. Immediately {{afterwards}} she appears again, and runs into the pavilion. Finding it full of people, including a stranger, she stops; but Percival, flushed and reckless, rushes in and seizes her before he, too, realizes that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> He releases her in confusion].|$|E
60|$|Just {{then they}} heard a sound of laughter, and looking up, to their horror {{perceived}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> For there, seated upon stones {{at the end of}} the tiny valley, in composed and comfortable attitudes, which suggested that they had not arrived that moment, were two gentlemen, who appeared to be highly amused.|$|R
60|$|Both {{seemed to}} forget that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone,</b> {{and in a moment}} <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> for a sudden impulse carried Rose to the door of her sanctum, as if the south wind which seemed to have set in was wafting this little ship also toward the Islands of the Blessed, where the others were safely {{anchored}} now.|$|R

6000|$|... "Rest, Angela! {{that is the}} cry of us all, we {{strive for}} rest, and here we never find it. You suffer, but {{do not think that}} you are alone, {{everybody}} suffers in their degree, though perhaps such as you, with the nerves of your mind bared to the roughness of the world's weather, feel mental pain the more acutely. But, my dear, there are few really refined men and women of sensitive organization, who have not at times sent up that prayer for rest, any rest, even eternal sleep. It is the price they pay for their refinement. But <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> If the heart's cry of every being who endures in this great universe could be collected into a single prayer, that prayer would be, 'Thou who made us, in pity give us rest.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the lesser}} {{annoyances}} to which Thomson was subjected in Africa was {{the presence of}} rats in the night-time, which he had to brush away like flies. Until he was asked whether there was not danger in this, it never seems to have struck {{him that it was}} more than annoying. Yet though he and the two other travellers mentioned (doubtless <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in this) have put up cheerfully with almost every hardship known to man, this does not make them indifferent to the comforts of civilization when they return home. Du Chaillu was looking very comfortable in a house-boat the other day, where his hosts thought they were [...] "roughing it"--with a male attendant; and in Stanley's easy-chairs you sink to dream. The last time I saw Thomson in his rooms in London he was on his knees, gazing in silent rapture at a china saucer with a valuable crack in it.|$|E

50|$|After 1989, the Orthodox Church {{tried to}} explain their {{behaviour}} during the Communist-ruled era. Patriarch Teoctist said that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> collaborators, but rather <b>they</b> <b>were</b> trying to defend {{what was left of}} religion in Romania. In a contradictory statement, Teoctist argued that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone</b> in collaboration with the Communist authorities and that every Romanian adult collaborated, one way or the other, with them.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin and {{his niece}} were occupying {{the same table}} as on the {{previous}} night, only this time <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> Wolfenden <b>was</b> sitting there between the two.

60|$|On {{the way up}} to town {{he began}} to build castles. He was optimistic, {{sanguine}} in the extreme. The girl listened almost stolidly. Her companion had begun to depress her. He was badly dressed, his linen was soiled, his imitation jewelry was hideous. He sat opposite her in the train, and there were things in his face from which she shrank. She was more than thankful that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b>|$|R

500|$|Although far-right {{radicals}} {{were the}} bedrock of support for McCarthyism, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>alone.</b> A broad [...] "coalition of the aggrieved" [...] found McCarthyism attractive, or at least politically useful.
