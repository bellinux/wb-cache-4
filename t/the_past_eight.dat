500|$|The Stanley {{plan had}} two main aspects, the {{governor}} stated. [...] The {{first was the}} funds withholding provision. But {{he pointed out that}} his plan (which had now been modified even further since late August) would cut off funds only to portions of school districts. (For example, if an elementary school in a district integrated, the legislation would require funds to be cut off to all elementary schools in that district—but not to secondary schools.) He also noted that this portion of his legislative program would expire on June 30, 1958. Stanley said the second major provision of his program was the tuition grant plan, offered to parents in districts where schools closed. (Unpublicized by the governor was a provision in his tuition grant plan that would require school districts which lost state funds to provide tuition grants.) All legislators should get behind this legislative program for massive resistance, Stanley concluded, because all Virginians of all races had concluded over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>eight</b> months {{that there should be no}} mixing of the races anywhere in the state.|$|E

[...] The frontman also stated the mellower acoustic disc was an opportunity to use [...] "the acoustic tracks we wrote in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>eight</b> or nine years, but never put on albums because they never seemed to fit", particularly because Grohl felt that [...] "it's hard to put an acoustic song {{in the middle of a}} rock record, because sometimes it mucks up the sequence." [...] The tracks include Grohl's first composition [...] "Friend of a Friend" [...] – done in 1990, and previously recorded under the pseudonym 'Late!' on the cassette Pocketwatch; [...] "Razor", which Grohl wrote for a benefit concert at the Wiltern Theatre; and drummer Taylor Hawkins' composition [...] "Cold Day in the Sun", which after an attempt to do an electric version became an unplugged track, featuring Hawkins on vocals and tambourine and Grohl in the drums.|$|E
