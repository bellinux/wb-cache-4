500|$|Clarke had to {{deal with}} four natural {{disasters}} during his tenure. An outbreak of smallpox in 1894 was the result of labour migration and men returning from working in Witwatersrand. When it proved too costly for the people, he waived the charge for the vaccination. Locust swarms in 1894 and 1895 caused damage to crops and resulted in famine in 1896. The government response was to offer the chief of each tribe a reward of 3d for every muid of locusts collected as well as cattle to slaughter when a swarm was eradicated. At the same time, Clarke bought 1,090 muids of quick-growing mealies to be given on payment to families requiring immediate relief, a measure of which Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, approved: [...] "It is better <b>to</b> <b>err</b> <b>on</b> the side of unnecessary expenditure than to run the risk of exposing the people to starvation."

40|$|Conversely to behaviorist ideas, {{recent studies}} suggest that introspection can be {{accurate}} and reliable. However, an unresolved question is whether {{people are able to}} report specific aspects of their phenom- enal experience, or whether they report more general nonspecific experiences. To address this question, we investigated the sensitivity and validity of our introspection for different types of conflict. Taking advantage of the congruency sequence effect, we dissociated response conflict while keeping visual conflict unchanged in a Stroop and in a priming task. Participants were subsequently asked to report on either their experience of urge <b>to</b> <b>err</b> or <b>on</b> their feeling of visual conflict. Depending on the focus of the introspection, subjective reports specifically followed either the response conflict or the visual conflict. These results demonstrate that our introspective reports can be sensitive and that we are able to dissociate specific aspects of our phenomenal experiences in a valid manner...|$|R

40|$|Parent-reported and {{observed}} use of child restraints {{has increased in}} many countries in recent times and is high for children in Australia (> 90 %). However, many children are sub-optimally protected because the restraints they are using are too big for them. This study sought to explore possible reasons for this using a survey of parents and carers (N = 284) of children aged 6 years and under. Questions addressed parents’/carers’ knowledge about the "best size" ranges for restraints available on the Australian market, the types of restraints they were using with their children and frequency of use {{as well as their}} views on fitting restraints to vehicles. Results indicate that, though parents are well informed about the benefits of child restraints, they are less well informed about appropriate sizes for different restraints, especially those suitable for older children. In particular, more than 50 % of these parents gave minimum age/weights for booster seats that were too low. The majority of the parents in this sample were reportedly using a restraint appropriate for the child’s age. However, over 30 % {{of the children in the}} 4 - 6 year old group were arguably too small for the restraints they were using. These results suggest that interventions to improve children’s protection as passengers should target parents’ perceptions of when to move children into larger restraints. It seems particularly critical <b>to</b> emphasise <b>erring</b> <b>on</b> the side of caution in relation to the upper age/weight for both forward facing child seats and boosters in order to encourage parents to retain children in these until they have truly outgrown them...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{peri-operative}} {{fluid and}} electrolyte {{management in the}} UK may be suboptimal. We assessed the attitudes of consultant surgeons to fluid and electrolyte prescribing and gathered suggestions for improvement in education on the subject. METHODS: A postal questionnaire survey was sent to 1091 Fellows of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. Of the 730 (67 %) replies, 20 were invalid or incomplete, and 710 (65 %) questionnaires were analysed. Outcome measures included provision of guidelines and teaching to junior staff on fluid and electrolyte prescribing, appropriateness of fluid management and suggestions to improve standards. RESULTS: Junior staff were given written guidelines in 22 % of instances. Only 16 % of respondents felt that their preregistration house officers (PRHOs) were adequately trained in the subject before joining the firm; 15 % also stated that PRHOs did not receive much training on their firm. 65 % felt that fluid balance charts were accurately maintained, nursing shortages being the commonest reason for inaccuracies. Only 30 % felt that postoperative patients were receiving appropriate amounts of water, sodium and potassium. Respondents who had been consultants for > 5 years were more likely <b>to</b> prefer <b>erring</b> <b>on</b> the side of under-replacement of fluid {{than those who were}} consultants for 5 years (63 % versus 47 %, P < 0. 0005).

40|$|Events are {{frequently}} discussed in natural language, and their accurate identification {{is central to}} language understanding. Yet they are diverse and complex in ontology and reference; computational processing hence proves challenging. News provides a shared basis for communication by reporting events. We perform several studies into news event reference. One annotation study characterises each news report {{in terms of its}} update and topic events, but finds that topic is better consider through explicit references to background events. In this context, we propose the event linking task which—analogous to named entity linking or disambiguation—models the grounding of references to notable events. It defines the disambiguation of an event reference as a link to the archival article that first reports it. When two references are linked to the same article, they need not be references to the same event. Event linking hopes to provide an intuitive approximation <b>to</b> coreference, <b>erring</b> <b>on</b> the side of over-generation in contrast with the literature. The task is also distinguished in considering event references from multiple perspectives over time. We diagnostically evaluate the task by first linking references to past, newsworthy events in news and opinion pieces to an archive of the Sydney Morning Herald. The intensive annotation results in only a small corpus of 229 distinct links. However, we observe that a number of hyperlinks targeting online news correspond to event links. We thus acquire two large corpora of hyperlinks at very low cost. From these we learn weights for temporal and term overlap features in a retrieval system. These noisy data lead to significant performance gains over a bag-of-words baseline. While our initial system can accurately predict many event links, most will require deep linguistic processing for their disambiguation...|$|R
