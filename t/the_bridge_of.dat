5|$|American Indian lore {{contains}} numerous legends {{to explain}} the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other Cascade volcanoes. The most famous of these is <b>the</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> the Gods legend told by the Klickitat people.

5|$|At {{the hill}} of Puigpardines, Juigné was being already harassed by 80 armed peasants {{of the local}} somatent–a type of militia–, when the arrival of Sala's, Mas' and Baliart's miquelets {{convinced}} him to withdraw. When they tried to cross back the Fluvià, however, they found the way blocked. Juigné decided then attempting to escape to Olot across the wood of Malatosquera and through <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> Sant Roc, but the Catalans anticipated him. Sala divided his miquelets in two groups of 300 men each one, and while Josep Mas de Roda, leading the first one, pursued and attacked the French troops across the wood, he blocked <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> Sant Roc ahead the second group. During the running fight under the trees Juigné's force lost 25 men and abandoned part of its ammunitions.|$|E

McKeehan later elaborated in an interview that the song came from his relationship with fellow band members Michael Tait and Kevin Max.|$|E

5|$|There {{are other}} {{versions}} of the legend. In another telling, Wy'east (Hood) battles Pahto (Adams) for the fair La-wa-la-clough (St. Helens). Or again Wy'east, {{the chief of the}} Multnomah tribe, competed with the chief of the Klickitat tribe. Their great anger led to their transformation into volcanoes. Their battle is said to have destroyed <b>the</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> the Gods and thus created the great Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> <b>Of</b> the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{deployed}} his own forces {{along the}} whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and they broke Maxentius' cavalry. He then sent his infantry against Maxentius' infantry, pushing many into the Tiber {{where they were}} slaughtered and drowned. The battle was brief: Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge. Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under {{the force of a}} Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> boats, but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.|$|E
5|$|Fort Nieulay, {{located along}} the Avenue Roger Salengro {{originally}} dated to the 12th or 13th century. During the English invasion in 1346, sluices gates were added as water defences and a fort was built up around it in 1525 {{on the principle}} that the people of the fort could defend the town by flooding it. In April and May 1677, Louis XIV and Vauban visited Calais and ordered a complete rebuilding of Fort Nieulay. It was completed in 1679, with the purpose to protect <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> Nieulay crossing the Hames River. By 1815 the fort had fallen into a ruined state and it wasn't until 1903 that it was sold and improved by its farmer tenants. The fort was briefly the site of a low-key scuffle with Germans in May 1940.|$|E

5|$|In April 1942, he was {{promoted}} to the rank of rear admiral and was appointed as chief of staff to the Commander, South Pacific Area and South Pacific Force Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley. In November, as commander of Task Group 67.4, he led US forces in an engagement off Savo Island during the Guadalcanal Campaign. During this battle, he was on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> the USS San Francisco when incoming enemy fire killed him and most of his command staff on November 13, 1942. At that time, he became the third US Navy admiral killed in action during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor posthumously for his efforts in this battle.|$|E
5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather to retreat to the ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand on <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower {{than it had been}} earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Now {{commanded}} by Balinor, Callahorn's reformed Border Legion marches out of Tyrsis and engages the Northland army at the Mermiddon River, killing many Northlanders before {{being forced to}} pull back; the Border Legion retreats to Tyrsis and make preparations for defense. During the siege of Tyrsis, Hendel and Menion come upon Stenmin {{and some of his}} supporters. Hendel is killed, but Menion kills Stenmin. After three days, the Border Legion is beaten back from the Outer Wall of Tyrsis as a result of treachery—the wall falls when the traitors destroy the locks on the main gate, jamming it open. At the defenders' last stand on <b>the</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> Sendic, the Northlanders abruptly break and run.|$|E

5|$|Oral {{histories}} {{describe the}} formation and destruction of <b>the</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> the Gods, a land bridge that connected the Oregon and Washington sides of the river in the Columbia River Gorge. The bridge, which aligns with geological records of the Bonneville Slide, was described in some stories {{as the result of}} a battle between gods, represented by Mount Adams and Mount Hood, in their competition for the affection of a goddess, represented by Mount St.Helens. Native American stories about the bridge differ in their details but agree in general that the bridge permitted increased interaction between tribes on the north and south sides of the river.|$|E

Art historian Sarah Burnage believes Etty's choice of Venus and her Satellites may have been {{to draw attention to}} similarities with Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball and possibly to link the Williams-Wynn sisters' beauty with the legendary Venus.|$|E
5|$|The A82 runs {{towards the}} centre of Loch Oich, passes Invergarry Castle, and crosses the River Garry. Just after the bridge, the A87 heads west towards Skye, while the A82 {{continues}} along the western shore of the loch up to <b>the</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>of</b> Oich at its northern end. This bridge was constructed in 1932, bypassing the 1850s Bridge of Oich, a Taper Suspension Bridge built by James Dredge. The A82 continues along the general line of Wade's Military Road up to Fort Augustus, crossing the canal at a swing bridge next to the locks in the village.|$|E
