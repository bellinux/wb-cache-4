5|$|By {{this time}} the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 {{children}} in its religious school. Wax initiated {{some changes in the}} congregation's religious practices. One was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> ram's horn shofar blown on Rosh Hashanah starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} {{the look of}} the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, to have a very stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Other {{offering}} rituals {{took place}} at noon and at sunset, though the sanctuary was not reopened. Some ceremonies other than offerings also took place daily, including rituals specific to a particular god. In {{the cult of the}} sun god Ra, for instance, hymns were sung day and night for every hour of the god's journey across the sky. Many of the ceremonies acted out in ritual the battle against of the forces of chaos. They might, for instance, involve the destruction of models of inimical gods like Apep or Set, acts that were believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> effect through the principle of heka.|$|E

5|$|Two more combat {{versions}} of the PanzerI were designed and produced between 1939 and 1942. By this stage, the design concept had been superseded by medium and heavy tanks and neither variant was produced in sufficient numbers <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> impact {{on the progress of}} the war. These new tanks had nothing in common with either the Ausf.A or B except name. One of these, the Panzer I Ausf.C, was designed jointly between Krauss-Maffei and Daimler-Benz in 1939 to provide an amply armoured and armed reconnaissance light tank. The Ausf.C boasted a completely new chassis and turret, a modern torsion-bar suspension and five Schachtellaufwerk-style interleaved roadwheels. It also had a maximum armor thickness of 30millimeters (1.18in), over twice that of either the Ausf.A or B, and was armed with an EW 141 semi autocannon, with a 50-round drum, firing 7.92mm anti-tank shells. Forty of these tanks were produced, along with six prototypes. Two tanks were deployed to 1st Panzer Division in 1943, and the other thirty-eight were deployed to the LVIII Panzer Reserve Corps during the Normandy landings.|$|E

40|$|Invisible {{cloaking}} is one {{of major}} outcomes of the metamaterial research, but the practical potential, in particular for high frequencies (e. g., microwave to visible light), is fatally challenged by the complex material properties they usually demand. On the other hand, it will be advantageous and also technologically instrumental to design cloaking devices for applications at low frequencies where electromagnetic components are favorably uncoupled. In this work, we vastly develop the bilayer approach to create a three-dimensional magnetic cloak able to work in both static and dynamic fields. Under the quasi-static approximation, we demonstrate a perfect magnetic cloaking device with a large frequency band from zero to 250 kHz. The practical potential of our device is experimentally verified by using a commercial metal detector, which may lead us <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> cloaking application where the dynamic magnetic field can be manipulated in desired ways.

25|$|Crown Prince Gustav Adolf (1594–1632), elder son of Charles IX of Sweden, as heir {{apparent}} was made Duke of Finland in 1606, while Östergötland {{was assigned to}} his cousin Duke John the younger instead. Gustav Adolf then started to receive ducal revenues from Finland. When he ascended the throne of Sweden in 1611 he readopted Grand Duke of Finland among his titles. He was the last <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> feudal principality of Finland and revenues therefrom.|$|E
25|$|Though this broadside-attack tactic was effective, it {{came too}} late <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> effect on the war, and only small numbers of Me 262s were {{equipped}} with the rocket packs. Most of those so equipped were Me 262A-1as, members of Jagdgeschwader 7. This method of attacking bombers became the standard, and mass deployment of Ruhrstahl X-4 guided missiles was cancelled. Some nicknamed this tactic the Luftwaffe's Wolf Pack, as the fighters often made runs in groups of two or three, fired their rockets, then returned to base. On 1 September 1944, USAAF General Carl Spaatz expressed the fear that if greater numbers of German jets appeared, they could inflict losses heavy enough to force cancellation of the Allied bombing offensive by daylight.|$|E

Starting out at the team's youth ranks, he made his first-team debut in the 2000–01 season. After scoring 25 goals in two seasons, he became a first team regular. Pepe Acebal, Sporting's manager at the time, said that Villa initially lacked the stamina <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> impact and had to be given his chance bit by bit and that Villa's capacity for work was [...] "unrivalled".|$|E

It was originally planned that Jennifer would eat Buzzer, but The Mill decided only {{the shadows of}} the action would be shown on the wall. All of this was cut from the final episode, with the exception of Jennifer's elongated mouth as she advanced towards him. The pile of discarded Jennifer Gangers was originally intended to just be a pile of bodies, but it was decided that would be [...] "too grim". Instead, life-sized dolls were used and computer-generated Flesh was painted on it, giving it a more melted look. The monster Jennifer transforms into at the end was created with CGI and a photo of pop singer Madonna was used as reference, as in the image [...] "here arms were...really sinewy, white, veiny, and fleshy". Graham wanted the creature <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> face and an alien body; he was inspired by a drawing in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that depicted Alice with a long neck.
