Vissa förespråkar även tarmsköljningar och joniserande fotbad. Syftet med den här studien är att kartlägga floran av detoxprodukter i form av kosttillskott: vilka typer det finns, vilka ingredienser som ingår och vilka påståenden som görs. Påståendena har klassificerats efter testbarhet och trovärdigheten har bedömts genom sökningar i PubMed och Web of Science. Några av de testbara påståendena verkar helt sakna evidens, något påstående lutar sig mot studier behäftade med problematiska brister medan vissa påståenden förtjänar vidare studier, då de bygger på studier med preliminärt lovande resultat. Det går inte att utesluta en framtid för evidensbaserade detoxdieter, lika lite som det går att säga att detoxdieter av idag håller vad de lovar. Det krävs fler kliniska, placebokontrollerade studier och en tydligare skiljelinje mellan det som är ren bluff och det som är seriös forskning. Konsumenter bör vara medvetna om bristen på evidens och riskerna som finns, exempelvis i form av kontaminerade produkter och risk för interaktioner med läkemedel. Sellers of detox {{preparations}} {{argue that}} in our modern society, the body's purification mechanisms are no longer sufficient and need a little help, preferably {{in the form of}} alleged cleansing herbal formulas. Some also advocate colonic irrigation and ionizing foot baths. The {{purpose of this study is}} to survey the flora of detox products in the form of nutritional supplements: what types there are, what ingredients are included and which claims are made. The claims have been classified for testability and reliability was assessed through searches in PubMed and Web of Science. Some of the testable assertions seem to completely lack evidence, other claims lean on studies that suffer from problematic deficiencies, while some claims deserve further study since they find support from studies with promising preliminary results. You cannot rule out a future for evidence-based detox diets, no more <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> to <b>say</b> that detox diets today keep their promises. More clinical, placebo-controlled studies are required and a clearer dividing line between what is pure bluff and what is serious research. Consumers should be aware of the lack of evidence and the risks that exist, for example in the form of contaminated products and the potential risk of interactions with medicines. ...|$|R

6000|$|I am upper housemaid to {{the family}} that live at No. 27 Limehouse Road, Pultneyville. I have been {{requested}} by Mr. Wilkey Collings, which I takes the liberty of here stating is a gentleman born and bred, and has some consideration for the feelings of servants, and is not above rewarding them for their trouble, which is more <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> for some who ask questions and gets short answers enough, gracious knows, to tell what I know about them. I have been requested to tell my story in my own langwidge, though, being no schollard, mind cannot conceive. I think my master is a brute. Do not {{know that he has}} ever attempted to poison my missus,--which is too good for him, and how she ever came to marry him, heart only can tell,--but believe him to be capable of any such hatrosity. Have heard him swear dreadful because of not having his shaving-water at nine o'clock precisely. Do not know whether he ever forged a will or tried to get my missus' property, although, not having confidence in the man, should not be surprised if he had done so. Believe that there was always something mysterious in his conduct. Remember distinctly how the family left home to go abroad. Was putting up my back hair, last Saturday morning, when I heard a ring. Says cook, [...] "That's missus' bell, and mind you hurry or the master 'ill know why." [...] Says I, [...] "Humbly thanking you, mem, but taking advice of them as is competent to give it, I'll take my time." [...] Found missus dressing herself and master growling as usual. Says missus, quite calm and easy like, [...] "Mary, we begin to pack to-day." [...] "What for, mem?" [...] says I, taken aback. [...] "What's that hussy asking?" [...] says master from the bedclothes quite savage like. [...] "For the Continent--Italy," [...] says missus--"Can you go Mary?" [...] Her voice was quite gentle and saintlike, but I knew the struggle it cost, and says I, [...] "With YOU mem, to India's torrid clime, if required, but with African Gorillas," [...] says I, looking toward the bed, [...] "never." [...] "Leave the room," [...] says master, starting up and catching of his bootjack. [...] "Why Charles!" [...] says missus, [...] "how you talk!" [...] affecting surprise.

6000|$|In pure yellow flowers, as in pure white, human {{interest}} is wanting. It {{is true that}} yellow is a human colour, since in the hair we find yellows of different shades--it is a pity that we cannot find, or have not found, a better word than [...] "shades" [...] for the specific differences of a colour. There is the so-called tow, the tawny, the bronze, the simple yellow, and the golden, which includes many varieties, and the hair called carroty. But none of these has the flower yellow. Richard Jefferies tells us that when he placed a sovereign {{by the side of}} a dandelion he saw how unlike the two colours were--that, in fact, no two colours could seem more unlike than the yellow of gold and the yellow of the flower. It is not necessary to set a lock of hair and any yellow flower side by side to know how utterly different the hues are. The yellow of the hair is like that of metals, of clay, of stone, and of various earthy substances, and like the fur of some mammals, and like xanthophyll in leaf and stalk, and the yellow sometimes seen in clouds. When Ossian, in his famous address to the sun, speaks of his yellow hair floating on the eastern clouds, we instantly feel the truth as well as beauty of the simile. We admire the yellow flower for the purity and brilliance of its colour, just as we admire some bird notes solely for the purity and brightness of the sound, however unlike the human voice they may be. We also admire it in many instances for the exquisite beauty of its form, and the beauty of the contrast of pure yellow and deep green, as in the yellow flag, mimulus, and numerous other plants. But however much we may admire, we do not experience that intimate and tender feeling which the blues and reds inspire in us; in other words, the yellow flower has not the expression which distinguishes those of other colours. Thus, when Tennyson speaks of the [...] "speedwell's darling blue," [...] we know that he is right--that he expresses a feeling about this flower common to all of us; but no poet would make so great, so absurd a mistake as to describe the purest and loveliest yellow of the most prized and familiar wild flower--buttercup or kingcup, yellow flag, sea poppy, marsh marigold, or broom, or furze, or rock-rose, let us say--by such a word--the word that denotes an intimate and affectionate feeling--the feeling one cherishes for the loved ones of our kind. Nor could that word of Tennyson be properly used of any pure white flower--the stitchwort for instance; nor of any white and yellow flower like the Marguerite. But no sooner do you get a touch of rose or crimson in the whitest flower, as we see in the daisy and eyebright, <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> of it that it is a [...] "dear" [...] or a [...] "darling" [...] colour, and no one can find fault with the expression.|$|E
