Typically three CNG tanks will be used, and a vehicle will first be fueled from one of them, which will result an incomplete fill, perhaps to 2000 PSI for a 3000 PSI tank. The second and third tanks will bring the vehicle's tank closer to 3000 PSI. The station normally has a compressor, which refills the station's tanks, using natural gas from a utility line. This prevents accidentally overfilling the tank, which could happen with a system using a single fueling tank at a higher pressure than the <b>target</b> <b>pressure</b> for the vehicle.|$|E

The overall approach consists of the loose coupling of a flow solver, a transition prediction method and a design module using shell scripts, along with interface modules to prepare the input for each method. This approach allows the user to select the flow solver and transition prediction module, as well as run mode for each code, based on the fidelity most compatible with the problem and available resources. The design module can be any method that designs to a specified <b>target</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution.

40|$|An {{aerodynamic}} inverse shape design {{method is}} implemented into ANSYS-CFX using a User Defined Function. The implementation is validated first; {{the method is}} then assessed on a subsonic axial compressor stage and a turbine stage. The design method is based on specifying a <b>target</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution over the blade suction surface (or a <b>target</b> <b>pressure</b> loading) and a blade thickness distribution as the design variables. The blade wall moves with a fictitious velocity, which is derived from a balance of design and target momentum fluxes, {{in order to reach}} a blade shape that would produce the prescribed <b>target</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution.

In ANSYS-CFX, a cell-centered finite volume formulation is used for space discretization. The time accurate Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations are written in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) form so as to account for the wall and mesh movement.

It {{is based on}} B-spline functions to represent curves (in 2 D) and surfaces (in 3 D) and enables one to approximate an existing blade shape or to specify <b>target</b> <b>pressure</b> distributions (or pressure loading). The notable characteristics of B-splines including smoothness, flexibility and robustness have made them well-suited to accurately fit both the design variables and the geometry. The precision and stability of B-splines in representing the airfoil geometry has been illustrated by interpolating generic and actual 2 D airfoils. Care has been taken to enhance the representation especially in high curvature areas, e. g. LE and TE, by the proper choice of B-spline parameters. B-spline surface generation has been integrated in {{the extension of the}} present 2 D inverse design into a fully three-dimensional inverse shape design. On the other hand, a method based on B-splines has been developed for generating the <b>target</b> <b>pressure</b> and loading distributions in both streamwise and spanwise directions.

SETTING [...] Outpatient departments in 10 clinics and 10 private practices of general practitioners or internists. PATIENTS [...] 369 Hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure of 95 - 120 mm Hg during a placebo run in period of two weeks. INTERVENTIONS [...] Initial treatment consisted of 12. 5 mg hydrochlorothiazide (n = 187) or 120 mg sustained release verapamil (n = 182) once daily (regimen I). If the <b>target</b> diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> of less than 90 mm Hg was not achieved within four weeks doses were increased to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide or 240 mg verapamil once (regimen II) and twice daily (regimen III).
