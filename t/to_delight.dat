25|$|Over half {{a century}} since their last short film was released, the Three Stooges remain popular with audiences. Their films have never left American {{television}} since first appearing in 1958, and they continue <b>to</b> <b>delight</b> old fans while attracting new admirers. They were a hard-working group of comedians who were never the critics' darlings, a durable act who endured several personnel changes in their careers that would have permanently sidelined a less persistent act. The Stooges would not have lasted {{as long as they}} did as a unit without Moe Howard's guiding hand.|$|E

George served as the Principal of Lincoln Elementary School in Mount Vernon, New York and often brought Lou in <b>to</b> <b>delight</b> the school's students during their lunch hour.

25|$|Sacchi {{argued for}} few figures, since {{he felt it}} was not {{possible}} to grant meaningful individuality, a distinct role, to more than a few figures per scene. Cortona, on the other hand, lobbied for an art that could accommodate many subplots to a central concept. In addition, he also likely viewed the possibility of using many human figures in decorative detail or to represent a general concept. Sacchi's position would be reinforced in future years by Nicolas Poussin. Others have seen in this dichotomy, the long-standing debate whether visual art is about theoretical principles and meant to narrate a full story, or a painterly decorative endeavor, meant <b>to</b> <b>delight</b> the senses. Cortona was a director of the Accademia from 1634–1638.|$|E

25|$|Like Plato, Mazzoni {{was very}} {{concerned}} with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and delight {{in the perception of}} the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, {{this has to do with}} the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability <b>to</b> <b>delight,</b> carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.|$|E
25|$|Murphy used an {{existing}} {{provision of the}} Marriage Act 1961 (Section 39C) to establish the Civil Marriage Celebrant program. Using this provision he appointed about a hundred Civil Celebrants and urged them to provide marriage ceremonies of dignity, meaning and substance for non-church people. It was an initiative opposed by the Australian Labor Party, the public servants of his department and his personal staff. Although it was a radical move at the time, the program proved to be very successful. In 2015 74.9% of marrying couples in Australia chose a civil marriage celebrant to officiate. The program broadened into the challenge of secular funerals of substance, namings and other ceremonies which celebrated the landmarks in human existence. Murphy took an enthusiastic interest in this program - sending telegrams of congratulation to the first several hundred couples married by civil celebrants and would often unexpectedly turn up uninvited to weddings performed by celebrants <b>to</b> <b>delight</b> in his achievement.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} exactly how long the Native Americans who {{occupied}} the area that became northwest Arkansas were here before the westward expansion of European settlers arrived. But {{it is known that}} the Osage Indians were roaming on lands north of the Arkansas River. They were roving bands, very venturesome, and known <b>to</b> <b>delight</b> in making war on their neighbors. The Quapaw tribe also roamed northwest Arkansas. They were a fearless, happy people who were more settled than the Osage. They loved fishing, hunting and a more peaceful way of life, unlike the fighting Indians. From the makeup of the Pea Ridge area, it is thought that it fits the mold of the Quapaw Indian. It is known that the tribes of this area were more settled and were actually farmers in their way. The town's namesake wild peas are believed to be a product of this early farming, since it would have taken many years of preparation and cultivation to produce them.|$|E

However, Moody was critical that the substantial scenes in the episode were surrounded by [...] "countless minutes of poorly paced padding, filler, and manufactured conflict", and that [...] "the bulk of this two-hour finale was just painful to watch".

500|$|The letter serves {{one other}} purpose: <b>to</b> <b>delight</b> in the Drapier's lack of being {{captured}} and his victory over Whitshed. William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland, {{was the one}} who actually arrested Harding and sought to convict him of printing treasonous materials. A letter written anonymously by Swift, [...] "Seasonable Advice to the Grand-Jury", motivated the Irish jury to stand up against Whitshed and release the printer. The Drapier hints at the letter and the freeing of Harding when he lists many other works written by Jonathan Swift, and, in the process, nearly reveals his own identity. However, his tone may not be mocking, as he could just be flaunting his own position, and some have credited this idea to the incorporation of so many Biblical and Classical allusions beyond the three that begin the letter. Scholar Herbert Davis declared this letter is [...] "in some ways the best written of all the Letters".|$|E

[...] Onyett concluded his preview of the game by stating, [...] "it's a pleasure to experience, and never ceases <b>to</b> <b>delight</b> and surprise over its short run." [...] Anthony Burch from Destructoid gave a positive review, stating that it [...] "is so stylistically unified, so consistently cool and weird and imaginative, that it's damn near impossible not to fall in love with—even as the game ends and you're wondering what the hell happened, and why." [...] He also applauded several technical and design aspects of the game, expressing appreciation for the game's [...] "stylistic choices", as well as the [...] "nigh unbelievable" [...] bloom effects featured in the game. Burch concluded that Gravity Bone is [...] "a great ride", and that the [...] "atmosphere and style alone will barrel you through to the journey's end, which comes all too soon." ...|$|E
