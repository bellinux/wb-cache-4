40|$|Chamber A is {{the largest}} thermal vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center {{and is one of}} the largest space {{environment}} chambers in the world. The chamber is 19. 8 m (65 ft) in diameter and 36. 6 m (120 ft) tall and is equipped with cryogenic liquid nitrogen panels (shrouds) and gaseous helium shrouds to create a simulated space environment. The chamber was originally built to support testing of the Apollo Service and Command Module for lunar missions, but underwent major modifications to be able to test the James Webb Space Telescope in a simulated deep space environment. To date seven tests have been performed in preparation of testing the flight optics for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Each test has had a uniquie thermal profile and set of thermal requirements for cooling down and warming up, controlling contamination, and releasing condensed air. These range from temperatures from 335 K to 15 K, with tight uniformity and controllability for maintining thermal stability and pressure control. One unique requirement for two test was structurally proof loading hardware by creating thermal gradients at specific temperatures. This paper will discuss the thermal requirements and goals of the tests, the original requirements of the chamber thermal systems for planned operation, and how the new requirements were met by the team using the hardware, system flexiblilty, and engineering creativity. It will also discuss the mistakes and successes to meet the unique goals, especially when meeting the <b>thermal</b> <b>proof</b> load...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a new switch to reduce dissipation from artificial resistivity in Smoothed Particle Magnetohydrodynamics simulations. The switch utilises the gradient {{of the magnetic}} field to detect shocks, setting αB = h|∇B|/|B|. This measures the relative degree of discontinuity, and the switch is not dependent on the absolute field strength. We present results comparing the new resistivity switch to the switch of Price & Monaghan (2005), showing {{that it is more}} robust in capturing shocks (especially in weak fields), while leading to less overall dissipation. The design of this switch is generalised to create similar switches for artificial viscosity and <b>thermal</b> conduction, with <b>proof</b> of concept tests conducted on a Sod shock tube and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.

40|$|Asbestos is {{a generic}} name given to six fibrous {{minerals}} (chrysotile, crocidolite, amosite, anthophyllite, tremolite and actinolite asbestos), {{widely used in}} commercial products. Asbestos fibers are characterized by high tensile strength, flexibility, resistance to chemical attack and thermal degradation, large surface area and ability to be woven. These properties made the asbestos {{one of the most}} important material for cement, <b>thermal</b> insulation, sound <b>proofing</b> and anti-fire products. It has been produced also for use in textiles, gaskets, ropes, laminates with resins. The fibrous nature of asbestos minerals is dangerous: the light and thin fibers can spread in air and be respired, causing cancer, due to their chemical and physical properties. The use of asbestos fibers in coupling with complex materials make difficult its recognition. In airborne analysis, asbestos fibers can be confused with organic fibers such as cotton and wool. The aim of this work is to characterize asbestos fibers using image analysis as in previous work (Inoue et al., 1999), it is carried out in four steps: (i) image acquisition from airborne fibers samples; (ii) fibers identification by image segmentation; (iii) fibers analysis and features extraction, by dimension, shape, color and texture measurements; (iv) fibers classification...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{increased}} awareness of climate change and higher energy costs, well‐insulated buildings have become more common. Furthermore, the interests of using wood in building to produce more carbon dioxide‐efficient houses have increased. However, thicker thermal insulation in walls {{increases the risk of}} high relative humidity levels and the risk of mould‐related damage in Wood frame houses. In order to predict moisture damage {{it is important to have}} a properly verified, userfriendly and reliable calculation tool that can be used in the design phase. The first part of the thesis presents a blind method that can be used in order to verify heat and moisture calculation tools in a reliable manner. General results and findings from blind validations using a one‐dimensional transient heat and moisture calculation tool are summarized and presented. The comparisons include measurements and calculations of temperature and relative humidity and were carried out in Northern European climates. The thesis also presents important factors affecting the risk of mould growth in well‐insulated Wood frame walls. A parametric study is presented in which moisture‐critical positions in traditional Swedish wood frame designs in Northern European climates are investigated by using hygrothermal modeling. Traditional Swedish walls with insulation thicknesses of 220 mm are then compared to walls with thicker thermal insulation and alternative designs. In general the comparisons of measured and blindly calculated values show a good correlation. The results show that the studied tool can be used during the design phase to predict moisture risks. However, factors such as the influence of impaired temperature affecting the calculated RH have to be taken into account. There is also a need for developing outdoor climate boundary conditions that take into account critical periods and variations between different years. It has been found that there is a higher risk of moisture‐related damage in thicker insulated walls. However, this risk can be reduced by choosing more suitable designs in which well‐ventilated air gaps behind the claddings and exterior vapour‐permeable moisture <b>proof</b> <b>thermal</b> insulation boards are of great importance...|$|R
40|$|India’s {{geographical}} location renders it with ample solar-energy potential ranging from 4 - 7 kWh/m 2 daily and 2, 300 – 3, 200 sunshine hours annually. The diverse {{nature of human}} settlements (scattered low-rise to dense high-rise) in India {{is one of the}} unexplored avenues of harnessing solar energy through electricity generation using photovoltaic (PV) technology. Solar energy is a promising alternative that carries adequate potential to support the growing energy demands of India’s burgeoning population. A previous study estimates, by the year 2070, with 425 million households (of which utilizing only 20 %), about 90 TWh of electrical energy can be generated utilizing solar energy. PV is viable for onsite distributed (decentralized) power generation offering advantages of size and scale variability, modularity, relatively low maintenance and integration into buildings (no additional demand land). The application of solar PV technology as the building envelope viz., walls, façade, fenestration, roof and skylights is termed Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV). Apart from generating electricity, PV has to also function as a building envelope, which makes BIPV systems unique. Even with a gradual {{rise in the number of}} BIPV installations across the world over the years, a common consensus on their evaluation has not yet been developed. Unlike PV in a ground mounted system, its application in buildings as an envelope has huge implications on both PV and building performance. The functions of PV as a building material translates well beyond electricity generation alone and would also have to look into various aspects like the <b>thermal</b> comfort, weather <b>proofing,</b> structural rigidity, natural lighting, thermal insulation, shading, noise protection safety and aesthetics. To integrate PV into a residential building successfully serving the purpose (given the low energy densities of PV and initial cost), would also mean considering factors like the buildings electricity requirement and economic viability. As many studies have revealed, 40 % of electricity consumed in a building is utilized for maintaining indoor thermal comfort. Tropical regions, such as India, are generally characterized by high temperatures and humidity attributed to good sunlight, therefore, the externality considered for this study has been the impact of BIPV on the thermal comfort. Passive designs need to regulate the buildings solar exposure by integrating a combination of appropriate thermal massing, material selection, space orientation and natural ventilation. On the other hand, PV design primarily aims to maximize solar to generate maximum energy. The design requirements for climate-responsive building design may thus infringe upon those required for optimal PV performance. Regulating indoor thermal comfort in tropical regions poses a particular challenge under such conditions, as the indoor temperature is likely to be sensitive to external temperature variations. In addition, given current performance efficiencies for various PVs, high initial cost and space requirement, it is also crucial to ascertain PV’s ability to efficiently support buildings energy requirement. Thus, BIPV would require addressing, concurrently, design requirements for energy-efficient building performance, effective PV integration, and societal feasibility. A real time roof integrated BIPV system (5. 25 kW) installed at the Center for Sustainable Technologies at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore has been studied for its PV and building thermal performance. The study aims at understanding a BIPV system (based on crystalline silicon) from the technical (climate-responsiveness and PV performance), social (energy requirement and energy efficiency) and economical (costs and benefits) grounds and identifies relevant factors to quantify performance of any BIPV system. A methodology for BIPV evaluation has been proposed (Integrability Methodology), especially for urban localities, which can also be adopted for various PV configurations, building typologies and climatic zones. In the process, a novel parameter (thermal comfort energy) to evaluate the thermal performance of naturally ventilated buildings combining climate-responsiveness and thermal comfort aspects has also been developed. An Integrability Index has also been devised, integrating various building performance factors, to evaluate and compare the performance of BIPV structures. The methodology has been applied to the 5. 25 kW BIPV system and the index has been computed to be 0. 17 (on a scale of 0 – 1). An insulated BIPV system (building applied photovoltaic system) has been found to be favorable for the climate of Bangalore than BIPV. BIPV systems have also been compared across three different climates (Bangalore, Shillong and Delhi) and given the consideration of the same system for comparison, the system in Delhi is predicted to have a higher Integrability than the other two systems. The current research work is a maiden effort, that aims at developing and testing a framework to evaluate BIPV systems comprising technical, social and economic factors...|$|R
