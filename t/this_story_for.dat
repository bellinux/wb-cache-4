25|$|L. Frank Baum {{revisited}} <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> {{the plot}} of his 1913 musical The Tik-Tok Man of Oz, starring James C. Morton and Fred Woodward. Aside from Tik-Tok, a princess named Ozma, and {{a visit to the}} Nome King's domain, the similarities between the book and the finished play were minimal, allowing Baum to re-adapt the latter as the eighth Oz book, Tik-Tok of Oz, in 1914.|$|E

500|$|When {{shooting}} on Series One of Thunderbirds wrapped in late 1965, Gerry Anderson and his ITC financier, Lew Grade, agreed that {{a feature film}} adaptation, to be shot {{at the same time}} as the prospective Series Two, would be the next logical step in the expansion of the AP Films Thunderbirds franchise. With United Artists contracted to distribute the film and the Rank Organisation to exhibit, a budget of £250,000 was set and Anderson and his wife, Sylvia, commenced work on the script at a Portuguese villa rented to them by Grade.

500|$|In March 2013, the Goathouse Refuge was a {{cover story}} in the Indy Week paper.

[...] The author, Lisa Sorg, says that according to former volunteers at the Goathouse Refuge, there are twice as many cats on the premises as recommended by a veterinarian, and that Scarpa makes volunteers sign an anti-defamation agreement and instructs them to lie to state inspectors, among other allegations that Scarpa denied or justified.

500|$|Ross Bonaime of Paste {{magazine}} {{gave the}} episode a complimentary review. He started {{by claiming that}} Awake was [...] "the best drama to come out the 2011–12 season on television, {{and one of the}} finest NBC dramas in years". He also wondered [...] "what Awake would be like in a Michael Britten-like alternate reality where the show lasted five seasons, or 10, or even just one more year", Could Awake maintain <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>for</b> long and still be compelling?" [...] Bonaime wrote that it was [...] "better to have one great season and be remembered fondly". Bonaime claimed that the [...] "ending is quite smart, given that it never truly clarifies if Michael was dreaming the whole time, or if Dr. Lee was right and that he {{was on the verge of}} completely snapping, which makes much more sense". He was also grateful that [...] "Awake decided to just go completely nuts with the last half of this episode". He claimed that the episode and series was [...] "different, a rare move, especially on network television". He claimed that [...] "Once Awake arrives on Netflix and DVD, people will rush through in a matter of days and will say they enjoyed their experience with this short yet sweet treasure". He claimed that works with Awake should be [...] "rewarded" [...] and [...] "praised". Bonaime concluded his review by giving the episode a [...] "9.0 out of 10".|$|E

2500|$|Arthur Conan Doyle {{lived on}} Tennison Road in South Norwood, from 1891 to 1894, but, {{contrary}} to popular belief, {{did not use the}} area as the setting for the Sherlock Holmes story [...] "The Adventure of the Norwood Builder" [...] (1903). <b>This</b> <b>story,</b> <b>for</b> the most part, takes place in Lower Norwood (today known as West Norwood). The only connection between this story and South Norwood is that South Norwood's railway station Norwood Junction is used by the character Jonas Oldacre. The NatWest Bank on South Norwood High Street was, in Victorian times and until the mid-1980s, the local police station and is the most likely candidate for the police station mentioned in the second Sherlock Holmes story The Sign of the Four.|$|E
2500|$|Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper wrote [...] "Wuthering Heights is {{a strange}} sort of book,—baffling all regular criticism; yet, it is {{impossible}} to begin and not finish it; and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about. In Wuthering Heights the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love– even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself. Yet, towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty, soft picture, which comes like the rainbow after a storm... We strongly recommend all our readers who love novelty to get <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> <b>for</b> we can promise them that they never have read anything like it before. It is very puzzling and very interesting, and if we had space we would willingly devote a little more time to the analysis of this remarkable story, but we must leave it to our readers to decide what sort of book it is." ...|$|E
