5000|$|Electron {{counting}} {{rules are}} {{the tools to}} predict the preferred electron count for molecules. Octet rule, 18-electron rule and Hückel’s 4n+2 π-electron rule are proved to be very useful in predicting the stability of molecules. Wade’s rules were formulated to explain the electronic requirement of monopolyhedral borane clusters. Jemmis mno rule {{is an extension of}} Wade’s rule, generalized to include condensed polyhedral boranes as well. The first condensed polyhedral borane B20H16, is formed by the sharing of 4 vertices between two icosahedra. According to Wade’s n+1 rule for closo structures, B20H16 should have a charge of +2 (n+1 = 20+1 = 21 pairs required; 16 BH units provide 16 pairs; four shared boron atoms provide 6 pairs; thus 22 pairs are available). To account for the existence of B20H16 as a neutral species, and to understand the electronic requirement of condensed polyhedral clusters, a new variable, “m”, corresponding to the number of polyhedra (sub-clusters) was introduced. [...] In Wade’s n+1 rule, “1” corresponds to the core bonding molecular orbital (BMO) and “n” corresponds to the number of vertices, which in turn is equal to the number of <b>tangential</b> <b>surface</b> BMOs. If m polyhedra condense to form a macropolyhedron, m core BMOs will be formed. Thus the SEP requirement of closo-condensed polyhedral clusters is m+n. Single-vertex sharing is a special case, where each sub-cluster needs to satisfy Wade’s rule separately. Let a and b be the number of vertices in the sub-clusters including the shared atom. The first cage requires a+1 and second cage requires b+1 skeletal electron pairs (SEPs). Thus a total of a+b+2 or a+b+m SEPs are required; but a+b = n+1, as the shared atom is counted twice. Thus the rule can be modified to m+n+1or generally, m+n+o, where “o” corresponds to the number of single-vertex sharing condensations. The rule can be made more general by introducing a variable, “p”, corresponding to the number of missing vertices, and “q”, the number of caps. Thus the generalized Jemmis rule can be stated as follows: ...|$|E
