5|$|Although the {{doctrine}} of karma is central to all Indian religions, {{it is difficult to}} say when and where in India the concept of karma originated. In Jainism, it is assumed its development took place in an era from which the literary documents are not available, since the basics of <b>this</b> <b>doctrine</b> were present and concluded even in the earliest documents of Jains. Acaranga Sutra and Sutrakritanga, contain a general outline of {{the doctrine}}s of karma and reincarnation. The roots of <b>this</b> <b>doctrine</b> in Jainism might be in the teachings of Parsva, who is said to have lived about two hundred fifty years before Mahavira. The Jain conception of karma—as something material that encumbers the soul—has an archaic nature which justifies the hypothesis that it goes back to 8th or 9th century BCE.|$|E
5|$|There is no retribution, {{judgment}} or reward involved but {{a natural}} {{consequences of the}} choices in life made either knowingly or unknowingly. Hence, whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing in its present life is on account of choices that it has made in the past. As a result of <b>this</b> <b>doctrine,</b> Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943 the Army {{developed}} a jungle warfare doctrine by adapting the pre-war field service regulations {{to meet the}} conditions in the South-West Pacific. The Army's front-line combat formations were reorganised and trained in accordance with <b>this</b> <b>doctrine</b> during the year. A jungle warfare school was opened at Canungra, Queensland, in November 1942, and all reinforcements for combat units subsequently passed through the school before joining their unit. Canungra consisted of a reinforcement training centre, an Independent Company training centre, and a tactical school. With the establishment of Canungra the Independent Company training centre on Wilsons Promontory was closed.|$|E

50|$|The Soviet government's {{desire to}} link {{its foreign policy}} to the Brezhnev Doctrine was evoked again when it ordered a {{military}} intervention in Afghanistan in 1979. This was perhaps, the last chapter of <b>this</b> <b>doctrine's</b> saga. The political uneasiness in Afghanistan at the time, made it the perfect target for intervention. Strategically, {{it was in the}} Soviets’ best interests to make their way to Afghanistan if they wanted to expand their communist influence even further.|$|R

5|$|Ljotić {{finished}} {{primary school}} in Smederevo. He attended gymnasium in Salonika, where {{his family had}} relocated in 1907. Ljotić was religiously devoted in his youth and even contemplated {{a career in the}} Serbian Orthodox Church. He was greatly influenced by Leo Tolstoy's doctrine of Christian non-violence, but later rejected <b>this</b> <b>doctrine</b> during World War I. Following his father's advice, he went on to study law and graduated from the Law School of the University of Belgrade. With the outbreak of the Balkan Wars, Ljotić joined the Serbian Army.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but <b>this</b> <b>doctrine</b> has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional protections for parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} of legitimate expectation originates from common law principles of fairness. English courts developed <b>this</b> <b>doctrine</b> largely to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision-makers. Generally, the courts will grant {{judicial review of}} an administrative decision based on an individual's legitimate expectation if a public authority has made a representation to the individual within its powers. The individual has {{to show that the}} representation was a clear and unambiguous promise, an established practice or a public announcement. This is largely a factual inquiry.|$|E

5|$|The {{mission of}} the Swiss Air Force {{historically}} has been to support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory, with a secondary mission of defending the sovereignty of Swiss airspace. During World War II <b>this</b> <b>doctrine</b> was severely tested when Switzerland was literally {{caught in the middle}} of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period to a complete cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{began his}} {{studies of the}} subject in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, in which {{he argued that the}} {{redefinition}} of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in ascetic Protestant denominations, particularly Calvinism, shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain. In Protestant religion, Christian piety towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of calling). The rational roots of <b>this</b> <b>doctrine,</b> he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to <b>this</b> <b>doctrine,</b> crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to power, but it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. <b>This</b> <b>doctrine</b> was the basis of his appeals to the public for the next year and a half.|$|E
5|$|Fellows {{is among}} the {{earliest}} cases where the Supreme Court applied treaties, including treaties between the United States and Native American tribes, as binding law. Fellows has been cited as authority for the enrolled treaty doctrine; analogous to the enrolled bill rule for statutes, the enrolled treaty doctrine prevents inquiry into {{the legitimacy of the}} formation of treaties once ratified by the Senate. <b>This</b> <b>doctrine</b> was later used to deny relief (or, to deny more relief) to Native American tribes who claimed that treaties were entered into fraudulently or signed by persons without authority to bind the tribe. Fellows was also decided before the Supreme Court began distinguishing between self-executing and non-self executing treaties. Regardless, treaties between the United States and Native Americans continued to be regarded as self-executing.|$|E
5|$|Journal The Library Quarterly {{published}} an article by Eliza T. Dresang which classed Not in Front of the Children as an effective treatise on the harmful to minors doctrine. Dresang wrote that Heins had successfully shown that <b>this</b> <b>doctrine,</b> which served as the core basis for legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), was demonstrably impossible to prove. She concluded that Heins concisely argued censorship of works from the reach of children can have negative impacts on their level of innovation, healthy mental growth, and adaptive abilities. Writing in English Journal, Tonya Perry discussed the work and emphasized that if the motivation behind children's education was to produce independent critical thinkers, {{it was necessary to}} extend the limits of censorship.|$|E

5|$|More generally, the Report {{made the}} {{argument}} in favor of the sovereignty of the individual states, for which it is best known. The basic message was that the states were the ultimate parties constituting the federal compact, and that therefore the individual states were ultimate arbiters of whether the compact had been broken by the usurpation of power. <b>This</b> <b>doctrine</b> is known as the compact theory. It was the presence of this argument in the Resolutions that had allowed the Federalists to paint the Democratic-Republicans as leaning toward secession; in the amended Report the line is moderated, with an emphasis that it is the states as political societies of the people (and therefore, one reads in, not the state legislatures alone) which possess this power. Either formulation would help the Democratic-Republican cause by refuting the finality of any constitutional interpretation advanced by the Congress and federal judiciary, both of which were dominated by Federalists.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army's pre-war {{doctrine}} {{was focused}} on conventional warfare in a European environment. <b>This</b> <b>doctrine</b> and the supporting training manuals were common to those of all Commonwealth countries. Following the outbreak of war the Army continued to focus on preparing its units to fight in Europe and North Africa. By far the single greatest difficulty in training in the early war years was the shortage of equipment. However, there were also critical shortages of instructors. The decision to form the 1st Armoured Division created a requirement for large numbers of highly skilled personnel, but there were few officers and men with the required skills in the small pre-war Army {{and many of them}} were already serving in the AIF's divisional mechanised cavalry regiments. An Armoured Fighting Vehicles School was created at Puckapunyal, Victoria, in 1941, and in March 1943, the Armoured Corps Training Centre was moved there.|$|E
5|$|The army group's {{previous}} commander, Georg von Küchler, had {{pleaded for}} permission to withdraw to the Panther Line in Estonia, which was still only half-completed at that stage. Model immediately cracked down on such talk, instituting a new policy he called Shield and Sword (Schild und Schwert). Under <b>this</b> <b>doctrine,</b> ground would only temporarily be ceded, to gather reserves for an immediate counter-attack that would drive the Red Army back and relieve pressure on {{other areas of the}} front. These statements of aggressive intent won over Hitler and OKH, who had no substantial reserves to send him, but were still unwilling to lose territory. Historians have since debated their significance, some claiming that Shield and Sword was Hitler's invention, while others say they were a calculated ploy by Model to disguise his true intent—to pull back to the Panther Line.|$|E

5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled for whatever reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes {{as close as possible}} to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. <b>This</b> <b>doctrine</b> originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E
5|$|The term anekāntavāda is {{not found}} in early texts {{considered}} canonical by Shwetambara tradition of Jainism (denied by Digambara tradition as canonical). However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Shwetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine {{is found in the}} Tattvarthasutra of Umasvati, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of <b>this</b> <b>doctrine.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>doctrine</b> {{was useful}} in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims {{encountered}} environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia. One example of isthisan is cited as follows: If a well is contaminated {{it may not be}} used for ritual purification. Istihsan suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from the well will remove the impurities. Analogical reason, however, dictates that despite removing some of the water, a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well (or the well walls) rendering the well impure. The application of analogy means the public may not use the well, and therefore causes hardship. Thus the principle of justistic preference is applied, and the public may use the well for ritual purification.|$|E
