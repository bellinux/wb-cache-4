5000|$|In 1982, ABC aired a {{new version}} of the series, {{entitled}} <b>The</b> New <b>Odd</b> <b>Couple.</b> Produced by Garry Marshall, the premise of the new version has two black actors, Ron Glass as Felix and Demond Wilson as Oscar. The New York Times reviewer noted: [...] "What may be surprising is how little the spine of the show has changed. The dialogue has been updated a little, but the plots are essentially the same. <b>The</b> New <b>Odd</b> <b>Couple</b> bounces along nicely. It adds nothing new to the craft of situation comedy, but it does provide employment and a good showcase for talented black actors, who generally don't have an easy time of it on television these days". This new version was not successful and was canceled after just 13 episodes.|$|R

500|$|Spielberg wanted [...] "some levity" [...] in Jaws, {{humor that}} would avoid making it [...] "a dark sea hunt", {{so he turned}} to his friend Carl Gottlieb, a comedy writer-actor then working on the sitcom <b>The</b> <b>Odd</b> <b>Couple.</b> Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script, asking what the writer would change and if there was a role he would be {{interested}} in performing.

5000|$|Bromance on {{television}} {{has also become}} more commonplace. It appeared early-on in the partnership of two CIA/KGB spies in the 1960s' Man from U.N.C.L.E., and in the 1970s' buddy-cop show Starsky & Hutch, which producer Aaron Spelling called TV’s first heterosexual love affair.

I know that if we ever did anything romantically the press would be so mean and nasty and call us <b>the</b> <b>Odd</b> <b>Couple.</b> It would turn into a circus and that's the pain of it all." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{review by}} [...] "Herc" [...] for the website Ain't It Cool News, praised {{the story about}} how Porthos was named and the {{elements}} of sexual tension between Archer and T'Pol. However, he didn't think <b>the</b> <b>Odd</b> <b>Couple</b> type relationship between Archer and Phlox worked {{all the time with}} some misfires amongst the comedic elements. He gave the episode a rating of three out of five, describing it as [...] "actually worth your valuable time". Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for TrekNation, saying that she enjoyed the episode on the whole and enjoyed the characterisation. However, she criticised the non-moving Beagle prop as it made her son think the dog was dead, which was then followed by [...] "what looks like a drowned dog in formaldehyde". Jamahl Epsicokhan reviewed the episode for his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", giving it a score of one out of four. He called it [...] "easily the dumbest concept for an episode of Star Trek since Voyager holodeck was hijacked by the residents of [...] ". He felt that the episode made a mockery out of the characters and that some of the situations they were placed in were just ridiculous.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the football references, the episode parodies the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. Homer tells Moe, who keeps his wallet in his shoe, [...] "I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory," [...] a play on {{a line from the}} film. In a commercial for his new television show, celebrity Troy McClure says that he plays [...] "Jack Handle, a retired cop who shares an apartment with a retired criminal. We're the original Odd Couple!", referencing the television show <b>The</b> <b>Odd</b> <b>Couple.</b> With his gambling winnings Homer buys Marge a bottle of perfume by Meryl Streep. The perfume is called Versatility and the bottle is shaped like an Academy Award. The Globe and Mails Liam Lacey commented on the similarities between the 2009 film Imagine That and this episode in a review of the film. He said the [...] "message in each case is about the dangerous confusion of love and money. Naturally there's a turning point [...] where the child begins to wonder whether her father really loves her or just her profitable talent." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s {{he was a}} regular member of Henry Mancinis studio {{orchestra}} and in 1963 he recorded the Pink Panther theme, written by Mancini with Johnson in mind. Johnson said of the recording: [...] "We only did two takes, I think... When we finished, everyone applauded -- even the string players. And thats saying something... They never applaud for anything." [...] Another solo for a well-known television series was on <b>The</b> <b>Odd</b> <b>Couples</b> theme music. Johnson was also used by Motown, and played on hits by Marvin Gaye, the Supremes and others. Johnson also played on sessions for Nancy Sinatra, and can be heard on the 1963 album Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Jerome Kern Songbook, recorded with the esteemed arranger Nelson Riddle.
