5|$|Upon {{arriving}} at Will's (Eric McCormack) apartment, Grace and Leo reveal <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends,</b> Will, Jack (Sean Hayes), and Karen (Megan Mullally), {{that they have}} gotten married. The friends' reactions to the news are not positive; in particular, Grace's gay best friend Will is uneasy about the whole idea. Leo and Grace, however, assure Will {{that they will have}} a wedding reception in honor of him, which improves Will's relationship with both Grace and Leo.|$|E
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends.</b> They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} offline friendship in three specific areas of Twitter networking behaviors: (a) network structure, (b) Twitter content and (c) interaction on Twitter. We observe some interesting findings through the empirical analysis of 2193 pairs of users who are online friends. When these pairs of users know each other offline, {{they are more likely}} to (1) respond to the online gesture of friendship from <b>their</b> <b>friend,</b> (2) share mutual online friends, (3) distribute and gather information in <b>their</b> <b>friend’s</b> Twitter network, (4) pay attention <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friend’s</b> tweets, (5) post tweets that might be of interest <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friend,</b> (6) post tweets similar <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friend’s,</b> (7) respond <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friend’s</b> tweet, (8) mention <b>their</b> <b>friend</b> in tweets, and (9) distribute <b>their</b> <b>friend’s</b> tweets. Overall, offline friendship drives social networking activities on Twitter...|$|R

However, the couple {{mutually}} agrees to end their long-running relationship after realizing that Richard does not want children, while Monica aspires to eventually raise a family of her own one day. While in England attending Ross' second wedding, to Emily (Helen Baxendale), Monica sleeps with Chandler. Initially supposed to have been a casual, one-time thing which grew more recurrent, Monica and Chandler eventually develop feelings for each other, but attempt to conceal it from their friends for as long as possible. After finally revealing their relationship <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends,</b> who are delighted by the news, Monica proposes to Chandler, and they marry.|$|E
5|$|Some {{say that}} {{nothing could be more}} desperate than the measure, but I answer that the state of the Province {{admitted}} of nothing but desperate remedies. I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends.</b> Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, Simon Bates {{presented}} {{a week of}} programmes from South Australia {{as part of a}} promotion in which the station gave away a holiday to the state. In December 2011, Bates travelled to Afghanistan to present a series of shows with British troops at Camp Bastion, which featured Christmas messages from British soldiers serving there <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends</b> and relatives. Bates discussed the possible future of Afghanistan as coalition forces prepared to hand over control to the Afghan National Army. On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, the forces broadcaster BFBS simulcast a two-hour show presented jointly by Bates and BFBS's Rachel Cochrane, with Smooth, allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with their loved ones. On 27 May 2012, Bates {{presented a}} special programme ahead of the Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant, previewing Elizabeth II's journey along the River Thames on the royal barge, Spirit of Chartwell. He was given special access to the vessel and spoke to the boat's owner, Philip Morrell and to composer Debbie Wiseman who was commissioned to write the music for the event. To commemorate the 30th anniversary {{of the end of the}} 1982 Falklands War, Bates broadcast the breakfast show from the Falkland Islands for a week; he explored the lives and experiences of Islanders and reflected on the conflict.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends.</b> After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E

25|$|Governor Phillip showed great {{reluctance}} to grant {{large amounts of}} land to his colonists, restricting land grants to the towns and people actively planning to farm the land. After his return to England in 1792, acting governor Major Francis Grose and his successor Captain William Paterson pursued the opposite policy granting large swathes of land <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends</b> prior {{to the arrival of}} the second official governor John Hunter in 1795.|$|E

25|$|In many societies, {{men who do}} not act in this {{traditional}} masculine way are ostracized by their peers and considered effeminate. In studies, young males from Cambodia, Mexico, Peru and South Africa, reported that they have participated in incidents where girls were coerced into sex (such as gang rapes) and that they did so {{as a way to}} prove their masculinity <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends,</b> or under peer pressure and fear that they would be rejected if they didn't participate in the assault.|$|E

25|$|While {{there had}} been several Swedish {{immigrant}} colonies earlier in American history, notably the short-lived colony at New Sweden in Delaware, the Janssonist emigrants were an early group of Swedish immigrants that triggered a larger wave of immigration {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century. Letters home from Janssonists <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>friends</b> and family, telling of the fertile agricultural land in the interior of North America, stimulated substantial migration for several decades and the formation of a distinct Swedish-American ethnic community of the American Midwest.|$|E
