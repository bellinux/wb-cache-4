5|$|According to Hesler and Smith's 1979 {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Lactarius, L.torminosus belongs to subgenus Piperites, section Piperites (in which it is the type species), subsection Piperites. Species in this subsection are characterized by having latex that does not turn yellow after exposure to air, and/or that does not stain the cut surface of the mushroom surface yellow. A 2004 phylogenetic analysis of European Lactarius species concluded that L.torminosus falls into a group that includes L.torminosulus, and <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> species {{are closely related to}} a group that includes L.tesquorum, L.scoticus, and L.pubescens.|$|E
5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|Historically, migratory whales such as blue, fin, sei {{were very}} {{abundant}} in the island waters, but were severely reduced in numbers to near-extinction by commercial and illegal hunts including the mass illegal hunts by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 1970s. Southern right and sperm were most severely hunted among these, hence the area was called the Middle Ground by whalers. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> were once seasonal residents around the island where right whales prefer sheltered, very shallow bays while sperm whales mainly inhabit deep waters.|$|E

5|$|In 1843, German {{botanist}} Carl Adolf Terscheck named {{a specimen}} of cactus collected in Mexico Echinocactus reichenbachii, but his description was incomplete and proved unhelpful to later scholars. During the years 1848 to 1856, George Engelmann made extensive studies {{of a plant}} he named Echinocereus caespitosus. Prior to this Joseph zu Salm-Reifferscheidt-Dyck referred to plants in European collections as Echinopsis pectinate var. reichenbachiana, and he later discussed the possibility with Engelmann <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> plants were one in the same.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} wrote <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> teeth {{resemble}} multituberculate deciduous anterior upper premolars, particularly {{second and third}} premolars (P2 and P3), and used this {{as one of their}} arguments for identifying Ferugliotherium as a multituberculate. However, as with the dentary MACN Pv-RN 975, the two upper premolars were excluded from Ferugliotherium and identified as multituberculates by Kielan-Jaworowska and colleagues after the discovery of the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich continues to identify them as Ferugliotherium {{on the basis of their}} size and provenance and other similarities between Ferugliotherium and multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|Martial {{reports a}} contest between an {{elephant}} and a bull, and the elephant, having won, knelt before Titus.

M87 may have encountered M84 in the past, as evidenced by the truncation of the outer halo of the former from tidal effects. However, another possible cause of this truncation is a contraction due to an unseen mass falling into M87 {{from the rest of the}} cluster, which, in particular, may be the hypothesized dark matter. A third possibility is that the halo formation was truncated as a result of early feedback from the active galactic nucleus at the core of M87.|$|E

5|$|The Indo-Parthian Kingdom, {{located in}} modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan made an {{alliance}} with the Parthian Empire in the 1st century BC.

After the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana visited the court of Vardanes I of Parthia (r. c.40–47AD) in 42AD, Vardanes provided him with the protection of a caravan as he traveled to Indo-Parthia. When Apollonius reached Indo-Parthia's capital Taxila, his caravan leader read Vardanes' official letter, perhaps written in Parthian, to an Indian official who treated Apollonius with great hospitality.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational encapsulation and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|In 972 Oswald {{was made}} Archbishop of York and journeyed to Rome {{to receive a}} pallium from Pope John XIII. It is {{possible}} that he also traveled on Edgar's behalf {{to the court of}} the Emperor Otto I, and <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> journeys had been combined. He continued to hold the see of Worcester in addition to York. The holding of Worcester in addition to York became traditional for almost the next fifty years. Although it was uncanonical, it had many advantages for York in that it added a much richer diocese to their holdings, and one which was more peaceful as well. When Edgar died in 975, Ælfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia, broke up many monastic communities, some of which were Oswald's foundations. Ramsey, however, was not disturbed, probably due to the patronage of Æthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia, son of Æthelstan Half-King. Ælfhere was a supporter of Ethelred the Unready, the son of Edgar's third marriage, while Oswald supported the son of Edgar's first marriage, Edward the Martyr, in the dispute over who would succeed King Edgar.|$|E

5|$|In his 1905 paper naming Albertosaurus, Osborn {{described}} {{two additional}} tyrannosaur specimens {{that had been}} collected from in Montana and Wyoming during a 1902 expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led by Barnum Brown. Initially, Osborn considered these to be distinct species. The first, he named Dynamosaurus imperiosus ("emperor power lizard"), and the second, Tyrannosaurus rex ("king tyrant lizard"). A year later, Osborn recognized <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> specimens actually {{came from the same}} species. Despite the fact that Dynamosaurus had been found first, the name Tyrannosaurus had appeared one page earlier in his original article describing both specimens. Therefore, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the name Tyrannosaurus was used.|$|E
5|$|In late antiquity, {{historic}} accounts {{become much}} more diffuse, and the Iazyges generally cease to be mentioned as a tribe. In the late 4thcentury, two Sarmatian peoples were mentioned, the Argaragantes and the Limigantes, who lived {{on opposite sides of}} the Tisza river. One theory is <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> tribes were formed when the Iazyges were conquered by the Roxolani, with the Iazyges becoming the Limigantes, and the Roxolani becoming the Argaragantes. Another theory is that a group of Slavic tribesmen gradually migrated into the area, subservient to the Iazyges, and the Iazyges became known as the Argaragantes, and the Slavs were the Limigantes. Regardless of which is true, in the 5th century both of them were conquered by the Goths, and, by the time of Attila, they were absorbed into the Huns.|$|E
5|$|One {{particular}} set of observations is related to eminently useful practical applications, namely to satellite navigation systems such as the Global Positioning System that are used both for precise positioning and timekeeping. Such systems rely on two sets of atomic clocks: clocks aboard satellites orbiting the Earth, and reference clocks stationed on the Earth's surface. General relativity predicts <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> sets of clocks should tick at slightly different rates, due to their different motions (an effect already predicted by special relativity) and their different positions within the Earth's gravitational field. In order to ensure the system's accuracy, the satellite clocks are either slowed down by a relativistic factor, or that same factor is made part of the evaluation algorithm. In turn, tests of the system's accuracy (especially the very thorough measurements {{that are part of}} the definition of universal coordinated time) are testament to the validity of the relativistic predictions.|$|E

5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{has been}} {{attributed}} to the influences of Nordic settlers in the region. Dogs of similar dimensions exist in modern Scandinavia, called the Swedish Vallhund, and it is claimed by some historians <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> breeds share a common ancestor. Farmers in Cardiganshire began to switch from cattle to sheep in the late 19th century, but the existing breed was unsuited to working the sheep flocks. The dog began to be crossed with the Welsh Sheepdog, and this {{is the source of the}} merle colour pattern in the breed. The subsequent similarities between the two types of Welsh corgis have {{been attributed to}} cross-breeding between the two, or simply selected breeding from farmers who wished to have the Cardigan variety appear closer in nature to the Pembroke breed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mentioning}} of Buddhism in China {{occurred in}} 65 CE. This was {{in regards to}} Liu Ying (d. 71 CE), a half-brother of Emperor Ming, who allegedly paid homage to the Buddha. At this point, the Chinese heavily associated Buddhism with Huang-Lao Daoism. Emperor Ming also had the first known Buddhist temple constructed in China, the White Horse Temple of Luoyang. It was allegedly built {{in honor of the}} foreign monks Jiashemoteng (迦葉摩騰) (Kāśyapa Mātanga) and Zhu Falan (竺法蘭) (Dharmaratna the Indian). A popular myth asserted <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> monks were the first to translate the Sutra of Forty-two Chapters into Chinese, although it is now known that this work was not translated into Chinese until the 2nd century CE. The Parthian monk An Shigao from the Parthian Empire came to Han China in 148 CE. He translated Buddhist works on the Hinayana into Chinese, as well as works on yoga that Han-era Chinese associated with Daoist exercises. Another foreign monk, Lokaksema from Kushan-era Gandhara, India, traveled and stayed in Han China from around 178198 CE. He translated the Perfection of Wisdom, Shurangama Sutra, and Pratyutpanna Sutra, and introduced to China the concepts of Akshobhya Buddha, Amitābha Buddha (of Pure Land Buddhism), and teachings about Manjusri.|$|E
5|$|Ælfgar's Irish confederate of 1055 is not {{identified}} in any source, {{and it is}} not clear that Diarmait had a part to play in the aforesaid events of that year. In fact, it is possible that Ælfgar received aid not from Diarmait, but from DonnchadDiarmait's enemy and Echmarcach's associatea man who then controlled the Norse-Gaelic enclaves of Limerick and possibly Waterford. Furthermore, although Diarmait appears to have gained overlordship of Mann by 1061, Echmarcach presumably enjoyed overlordship of at least part of the Hebrides in 1058. Since Magnús utilised Islesmen during his English campaign of that year, it is conceivable that Echmarcach may have played a prominent part in these operations. If Echmarcach was indeed involved in the campaign, the enmity between him and Diarmait could indicate <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>two</b> were unlikely to have cooperated as allies.|$|E
