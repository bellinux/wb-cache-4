500|$|Takei {{declared}} {{it was not}} a decrease on the series profitability that was the reason for its cancellation, but a [...] "fatigue" [...] he had been through because he was no more able to follow his fans' wishes. In the author's opinion, Shaman King was being [...] "normalized" [...] by the desire of his readers with the introduction of typical shōnen aspects and losing its originality. In 2007 he revealed he was planning to end the series with the final he initially envisioned to be published in another Shueisha magazine in {{the end of the year}} or in the beginning of 2008. Eventually the entire series was reprinted in 27 kanzenban volumes with the title Shaman King Kanzen-Ban (or [...] "Perfect Edition"), concluding with the [...] "true ending" [...] to the series. The new series finale was also posted on the official Kanzen-Ban website, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>print</b> editions. The first volume of the Perfect Edition was released on March 4, 2008, with the last (volume 27) being published on April 3, 2009. Five years after the end of the series, when the Shaman King Kanzen-Ban was finished, Takei said, [...] "After making the readers [...] so much for this, the last thing I wanted to do was to disappoint them". He thought the ending was a [...] "huge responsibility". This edition served to make corrections and adjustments and, for Takei, it was something [...] "fun," [...] as it was different from scratch.|$|E
