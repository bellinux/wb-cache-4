5|$|Liver {{transplantation}} is {{an effective}} cure for Wilson's disease but is used only in particular scenarios because of the risks and complications associated with the procedure. It is used mainly in people with fulminant liver failure who fail to respond to medical <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> in those with advanced chronic liver disease. Liver transplantation is avoided in severe neuropsychiatric illness, in which its benefit has not been demonstrated.|$|E

5|$|The {{definitive}} {{treatment for}} cholangitis is relief {{of the underlying}} biliary obstruction.

5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care.

5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion. In most cases these symptoms {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> adding antipsychotic medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E

Bamber and two prisoners, Douglas Vinter and Peter Moore, appealed that decision too, and in 2013 the European Court's Grand Chamber ruled that keeping the prisoners in jail with no prospect of release or review may not be compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> punishment.|$|E
5|$|Kirchner's health {{first became}} {{a topic of}} public concern in 2005 when Noticias {{magazine}} reported that she might suffer from bipolar disorder. Journalist Franco Lindner interviewed the psychiatrist who treated her without revealing his name. Journalist Nelson Castro investigated further and discovered that the psychiatrist was Alejandro Lagomarsino, who died in 2011. Lagomarsino was the leading specialist {{in the treatment of}} bipolar disorder in Argentina. Castro's investigation revealed that Kirchner was treated by Lagomarsino for a short period. He could not determine the length of her <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> the medicine she received, or whether another psychiatrist continued treating her or not. Castro considers that some of her outlandish phrases or projects, and her frequent periods of hiding from public view, may be explained by the disorder's periods of mania and depression, as well as being a regular political strategy. Eduardo Duhalde said that Néstor Kirchner once confided in him that she had a bipolar disorder, while she was having a violent outburst. During the United States diplomatic cables leak it was revealed that Hillary Clinton questioned Kirchner's mental health and asked the US embassy whether she was receiving <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> not; she later apologized to Kirchner for those leaks. Kirchner said in her book La Presidenta that it was all a misunderstanding; it is her sister who suffers from bipolar disorder.|$|E

5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} {{may arise from}} a tumor {{compressing}} or infiltrating nearby body parts; from treatments and diagnostic procedures; or from skin, nerve and other changes caused by a hormone imbalance or immune response.

However, radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy may produce painful conditions that persist long after treatment has ended.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{exist to}} measure how much {{sensation}} a person has retained in the genitals after an injury, which are used to tailor <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> rehabilitation. Sensory testing helps people learn to recognize the sensations associated with arousal and orgasm. Injured people {{who are able to}} achieve orgasms from stimulation to the genitals may need stimulation for a longer time or at a greater intensity. Sex toys such as vibrators are available, e.g. to enhance sensation in areas of reduced sensitivity, and these can be modified to accommodate disabilities. For example, a hand strap can be added to a vibrator or dildo to assist someone with poor hand function.|$|E
5|$|The few {{contraindications}} {{to surgery}} include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or {{a desire to}} preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to <b>treatment</b> <b>or</b> until childbearing is done. Uterine perforation may occur during a D or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and lymphedema, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including constipation.|$|E
