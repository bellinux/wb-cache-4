5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as <b>to</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was <b>to</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet.

5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from the brutality of the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends <b>to</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> most disturbing aspects of each work.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians {{consider}} this highly implausible however, noting that malicious rumours {{such as those}} concerning Domitia's alleged infidelity were eagerly repeated by post-Domitianic authors, and used <b>to</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals, while privately indulging in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court.

5|$|The five Gefion {{passages}} seem <b>to</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>the</b> championing of a {{new order}} antagonistic to goddess worship.

Further the hall which is the object of struggle between Beowulf and the first two monsters may symbolize the consolidation of new hierarchical social organization among the northern Germanic peoples.|$|E
