500|$|In May 1977 Genesis {{released}} Spot the Pigeon, {{an extended}} play of three tracks left off Wind & Wuthering. It peaked at No. 14 on the UK singles chart. It {{was the final}} Genesis release before Hackett left the group. He had been writing more material {{on his own and}} found it increasingly difficult to contribute more of his ideas within a group context. He wished to embark on a solo career and [...] "take the risk in order <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> how good I was on my own". News of Hackett's departure coincided with the band's double live album Seconds Out, recorded in Paris on the A Trick of the Tail and Wind & Wuthering tours and released in October 1977. It reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US.|$|E
2500|$|No {{knowledge}} of electronics {{was needed to}} assemble a Heathkit. The assembly process did not teach much about electronics, but provided {{a great deal of}} what could have been called [...] "electronics literacy," [...] such as the ability to identify tube pin numbers or read a resistor color code. [...] Many hobbyists began by assembling Heathkits, became familiar with the appearance of components like capacitors, transformers, resistors, and tubes, and were motivated <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> what these components actually did. For those builders who had a deeper {{knowledge of}} electronics (or for those who {{wanted to be able to}} troubleshoot/repair the product in the future), the assembly manuals usually included a detailed [...] "Theory of Operation" [...] chapter, which explained the functioning of the kit's circuitry, section by section. Heath developed a relationship with electronics correspondence schools (e.g., NRI). Heath supplied electronic kits to be assembled as part of courses, with the school basing its texts and lessons around the kit.|$|E

5000|$|... "I usually {{start with}} a corpse. I then ask myself how the corpse got {{to be that way}} and I try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> - <b>just</b> as the cops would. I plot, loosely, usually a chapter or two ahead, going back to make sure that {{everything}} fits - all the clues are in the right places, all the bodies are accounted for...(I) believe strongly in the long arm of coincidence because I know cops well, I know how much it contributes to the solving of real police cases." ...|$|R
60|$|Some {{that have}} been very forward to have us proceed The Shortest Way with the Scots, {{may be said to}} stand in great need of this Chair of Reflection, <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> a <b>just</b> Cause for such a War, and to make a Neighbour-Nation making {{themselves}} secure, a sufficient Reason for another Neighbour-Nation to fall upon them: Our Engine would presently show it them in a clear sight, by way of Paralel, that 'tis just with the fame Right as a Man may break open a House, because the People bar and bolt the Windows.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{going to}} talk anyway," [...] said Dick with a {{recklessness}} which was unusual to him. [...] "I want <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> {{what they are doing}} with him." ...|$|E
60|$|The ladies waited, with an {{exchange}} of glances, for her reply, {{as if they had}} talked the matter over beforehand, and had agreed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> how Annie Kilburn felt about it.|$|E
50|$|After {{they are}} chosen as {{candidates}} for transcendence, they meet the Transcendents around a white dwarf and {{learn of the}} history and motivations of their actions; their (and others) apprehension on the 'Embrace of Tides'; and a master plan executed at the moments of fracture, one which may just happen to fling a bottle into the expanses between galaxies for ancient friends <b>to</b> <b>find.</b> Flung <b>out</b> <b>just</b> before destruction, the Streaker returns to Earth with one trick left to play and end both Earth's siege and their journey in the void.|$|R
50|$|On Day 80, Estelle and Michael {{seem to be}} snogging together. Estelle finally {{leaves his}} bed and returns to her own. Housemates awaken for fifteen minutes of hot water. Zoe admits she woke up in fits of rage when trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Estelle and where she was sleeping. Benjamin then tells the girls {{that this is not}} the first time Estelle has been in his bed. The {{incident}} continues to be the talk of the morning. Benjamin is later shocked <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> he's <b>just</b> revealed privileged information given to him by Michael. Ben also wins the final captains challenge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Sir," [...] said Reddy to himself, [...] "I {{would go}} a long, long {{distance}} {{to get a good}} plump hen. I wish I knew just where that farm is that that black rascal talked about. I wonder if he has gone that way now. If I were sure that he has, I would make a little journey in that direction myself. But I'm not sure. That black rascal flies all over the country. That farm may lie in the direction he has gone now, and it may be in quite the opposite direction. Somehow I've got <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> in <b>just</b> which direction it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{want to be}} on the watch," [...] remarked Randy. [...] "Old Lemon will {{be going}} to bed pretty soon, and we want <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> how {{comfortable}} he finds his bed," [...] and he grinned.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. I {{refuse to}} live on her charity, that's all, and I want you <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> how much I owe her--how much you owe her--for I intend to pay her back every dollar with interest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not putting}} on any airs. But it's true. Miss Reade and I {{are the only}} people in Carlisle who really know the Awkward Man. Nobody else ever got behind his shyness <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> what sort of a man he is." ...|$|E
50|$|In the pilot, Steve {{is upset}} about {{his lack of}} popularity. He notices that girls seem {{attracted}} to guys with dogs, so he asks his parents for one. Stan gets Steve a 19-year-old dog, because it was alive during the Reagan administration. One night, Roger the Alien makes a noise and Stan goes downstairs, thinking it is an intruder. Stan shoots the intruder, only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that he <b>just</b> accidentally killed Steve's dog.|$|R
5000|$|Some critics reacted {{against the}} {{paperwork}} gameplay. Stephanie Bendixsen from the ABC's game review show Good Game found the game [...] "tedious", commenting [...] "while I found {{the issues that}} arose from the decisions you are forced to make quite interesting, I was just so bored that I just struggled to go {{from one day to}} the next.

5000|$|Worried about similar circumstances, Virginia writer Kevin Beekman urges {{residents}} in areas planned for BRT development {{to use the}} ITDP scoring worksheet (BRT Standard) as an assessment tool. Another Washington-area writer, Dan Reed, furthers this sentiment, writing that if BRT creep is allowed to reach its full conclusion, it's [...] "bad for commuters, but it's also bad for taxpayers who were sold a high-end service only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that we <b>just</b> painted the buses a different color".|$|R
6000|$|... "Then you're to {{find out}} exactly what's needed, an' after the brig is in deep water agin we can lay here a day or two to get things ship-shape. Perhaps some craft will come in sight, an' we'll be able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> where we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure of it, my boy," [...] said Compton heartily. [...] "Don't {{think that}} I have been finding fault with {{anything}} you have done.

6000|$|... "Come back?" [...] said Hilary, whose civic {{morality}} flew {{much lower}} than this. [...] "Nonsense! And stir the whole filthy mess up in the courts? I mean, make use of this fellow to find him, and enable us <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> {{how much money he}} has left, and how much we have got to supply, in order to make up his shortage." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{you know}} it always {{is the thing that}} you try and try <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> and can't <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that you most want <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out.</b> It was <b>just</b> so with Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk. The more they talked about it, the more they wanted to know. Why was it that Unc' Billy Possum played dead instead of trying to run away when he was {{surprised}} by his enemies? They always tried to run away. So did everybody else of their acquaintance excepting Unc' Billy Possum.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes I just can't believe she's my daughter," [...] Hannah said dejectedly to Janet {{when they}} were alone {{together}} in the kitchen after Lise had gone out. [...] "I'm fond of her because she's my own flesh and blood--I'm ashamed of it, but I can't help it. I guess it's what the minister in Dolton used to call a visitation. I suppose I deserve it, but sometimes I think maybe if your father had been different {{he might have been}} able to put a stop to the way she's going on. She ain't like any of the Wenches, nor any of the Bumpuses, so far's I'm able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out.</b> She <b>just</b> don't seem to have any notion about right and wrong. Well, the world has got all jumbled up--it beats me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that is one}} of {{the things}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> sometime. Isn't it splendid to think of all the things there are <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> about? It <b>just</b> makes me feel glad to be alive--it's such an {{interesting}} world. It wouldn't be half so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There'd be no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I talking too much? People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I didn't talk? If you say so I'll stop. I can STOP when I make up my mind to it, although it's difficult." ...|$|R
60|$|So we {{continued}} to talk at the bar, and to drink beer ordered and paid for by Nelson. I think, now, when I look back upon it, that Nelson was curious. He wanted <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> {{what kind of a}} gink I was. He wanted to see how many times I'd let him treat without offering to treat in return.|$|E
6000|$|... "After all," [...] {{she said}} to herself, [...] "I do not believe much in the {{thousand}} other men. Not {{one of them is}} here, and none may ever come, and if Ralph really did intend to come to me at the seashore, I wish we had stayed there. It is such a good place <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> how people feel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, we're {{getting to}} that too. Now answer me this carefully. We {{want to find out}} what {{interest}} you might have, supposing a will were forged, on either side, in arranging its terms. We want <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> who would benefit by it. Please reply to this question, yes or no, without prevarication. Are you or are you not conditionally engaged to Mr. Harold Tillington?' ...|$|E
50|$|While driving Karen to the hospital, Susan {{runs into}} Jackson {{who wants to}} talk to her over dinner. At dinner, Jackson tells Susan that he wants her to marry him and she runs to the {{bathroom}} and confesses that she has been very lonely and hasn't stopped thinking about him and truly loves him only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> that Jackson <b>just</b> wants to get married because his student visa has expired and will be deported back to Canada not because he loves her. The next day, Jackson apologizes and Susan decides to marry him.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{than these}} few performances, no concerts or tours were {{arranged}} to promote Medúlla. Björk said in numerous interviews {{that this was}} because she wished to immediately continue writing and recording yet another new album. She spoke to Rolling Stone in June 2004: [...] "Every album I've done, the minute that it's done, I feel really lubricated and, like, 'Wow, now I can write an album in five minutes'... And I <b>just</b> want <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> if that's <b>just</b> a fantasy or if it's true." [...] Also, Björk {{thought it would be}} too difficult to play the songs live.|$|R
50|$|On {{the eve of}} a big US-Japan trade summit, a {{reporter}} gets a hot tip that the Japanese-American head of a big aerospace firm will be selling trade secrets to a Japanese contact.

In the course of snooping, the pair are discovered, but not before they learn that the Japanese contact {{is a member of the}} Yakuza. When the aerospace executive turns up dead after an apparent suicide, the investigators realise that some very big secrets are being kept by some very important people.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{not exactly}} that, lad, but close to it. That Lapham {{is my brother}} Oscar. He is younger than I and daffy {{on the subject of}} investigations. As soon as I heard he had started for the {{mountains}} of Norway I came over <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> what he was doing. I don't want him to investigate some high mountain in a snowstorm, fall over some precipice, and kill himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} are so prompt," [...] said she. [...] "Promptness {{is one of the}} most {{important}} things in life. Now I am very, very busy these days, as you know, so we will begin school at once. Before either of you ask any questions, I am going to ask some myself. Peter, what do you look like? Where do you live? What do you eat? I want <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>just</b> how much you really know about yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh. I {{may have}} spent my whole natural life in denouncing him as demoralization incarnate, and a curse to the community, but I always liked him, Ellen. Yes, I loved J.

I've no doubt but if we could have him among us again, in the attractive garb of the State's-prison inmates, I should be hand and glove with brother Northwick." ...|$|E
50|$|Delisle {{had already}} been to China in Nanjing. He is {{deployed}} to Shenzhen {{as part of an}} outsourcing project, where he will spend three months in the Great Wall Hotel. Unlike in Hong Kong, there are not many bilingual Chinese so he has language problems during his stay, including with the interpreters at work. Often he has to recourse to drawing or pointing to communicate. Among his experiences of life in Shenzhen include a visit to a Chinese dentist to cure a toothache, but after seeing the unhygienic conditions of the clinic, he is relieved <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> it is <b>just</b> a case of mesialization.|$|R
50|$|Lockhart takes refuge with a rival rancher, Kate Canady (Aline MacMahon), {{who wishes}} she and Waggoman could declare a truce. Alec goes over some old bills {{and finds a}} bill for wire fence that is very overpriced. He {{suspects}} that it conceals a rifle purchase and sets out to discover for himself whether {{it was true that}} his son Dave was involved in selling rifles to the Apaches. Vic attempts {{to talk him out of}} it, but the old man is determined <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> the truth. <b>Just</b> before he reaches the wagon, Vic and he scuffle and he is accidentally pushed off his horse and down a hill. Assuming the old man is dead, Vic rides away.|$|R
40|$|To {{the human}} vision, there exists in color images {{a certain amount}} of perceptual {{redundancy}} since the human visual system (HVS) has limited sensitivity in discriminating color signals of small differences. Such colors of small differences are called Just Noticeable different colors. A test has been designed to check for such near wavelength colors that does not seem different to a normal human eye. The test is solely based upon the perception of human eye towards different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The test consists of a central color of certain wavelength which was surrounded equidistantly by colors having wavelengths, not differing much from the central color. In the test the subjects had to choose the colors that looked similar to the central color. As the color perception varies from individual to individual, this test when conducted over a large population having a healthy vision varying in age, gender and ethnicity can yield a generalized color perception by a normal human eye. The objectives of test were <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>out</b> the <b>just</b> noticeable different colors among a given set of colors having wavelengths that are just few nanometers different from each other and to get a generalized color perception for a human eye. When data of a very large sample space is statistically analyzed, we get reliable information {{that can be used to}} diagnose defects in the color vision...|$|R
