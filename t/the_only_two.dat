5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, it seems {{unlikely}} to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E

The 12th Battalion had suffered 125 casualties during the engagement, with 66 killed or missing. Whittle and Newland were both subsequently awarded a Victoria Cross for their actions that day; the pair were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> permanent members of the Australian military to receive the decoration during the war.|$|E

5|$|In 1849, {{the club}} used a venue outside Brighton {{for the first}} time, when they played a {{first-class}} match at Petworth Park New Ground; the match against Surrey is notable for being one of Sussex's lowest aggregate scoring matches of all time, with only 287 runs scored. It was also {{the only time that}} Petworth Park hosted a Sussex match. Sussex have frequently used out grounds to host some of their matches, typically as part of cricket festivals. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, their main out grounds were the Central Recreation Ground in Hastings, The Saffrons in Eastbourne, the Cricket Field Road Ground in Horsham, and the Arundel Castle Cricket Ground (from 1972). After the Central Recreation Ground was demolished in 1996, Sussex also played two List A matches at Horntye Park, Hastings' other cricket ground. Eastbourne cancelled its proposed fixture in 2001 and did not host another county match until 2017, whilst Horsham was not awarded any matches for the 2016 season, due to financial difficulties. The County Ground and Arundel Castle are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> grounds to have hosted Sussex Twenty20 matches, and were also <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>two</b> grounds which host Sussex matches in the 2016 season.|$|E
