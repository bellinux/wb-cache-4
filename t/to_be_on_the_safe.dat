25|$|<b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side, a pill-activated {{inflation}} {{device is}} preferred. A small pill that dissolves on water contact {{is the safest}} option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is {{more sensitive to the}} presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system have all but eliminated accidental firing.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day of}} the accident, two Harriers flew on {{missions}} from Tromsø, named Red 1 and Red 2. The {{first was}} the two-seat Harrier serial number XW925 with Wing Commander Peter Squire as pilot and Norwegian Major Bjørnar Vollstad. The aircraft left Tromsø at 14:27, nearly an hour after the crash. They flew to a gunnery range near Setermoen, followed by Red 2, a Harrier GR.3. The shooting range was enveloped in a blizzard, but Squire chose to carry out the practice. Red 1 was subject to an air burst; Squire did not register any damage, but chose to return to Tromsø and asked for a priority landing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side. The pilot of Red 2 believed his weapons were not secured and chose to carry out a priority landing at Bardufoss Air Station, located nearby.|$|E

At this point, the presentation seen on satellite imagery had indicated that a tropical cyclone was beginning to form in the Gulf. After a reconnaissance aircraft went into the system, the cyclone was upgraded into the first tropical depression of the season that afternoon while [...] south of Brownsville, Texas. When it formed, it was moving north-northwest at , which was thought at the time to inhibit further strengthening due to the depression moving onto land. Several hours later, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Amelia, a decision that one forecaster said was made <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side. Amelia peaked at [...] in wind speed when it was upgraded, with the system beginning to skirt the Texas coast. At peak intensity, the storm had gale-force winds along a diameter of [...]|$|E

Once Sharon was convinced that Jews had free access to the Temple Mount, there would be little the Israeli religious and nationalist Right could do to stall the peace process. When Sharon expressed interest in visiting the Temple Mount, Barak ordered GSS chief Ami Ayalon to approach Jibril Rajoub with a special request to facilitate a smooth and friendly visit. [...] Rajoub promised it would be smooth as long as Sharon would refrain from entering any of the mosques or praying publicly. [...] Just <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side, Barak personally approached Arafat and once again got assurances that Sharon's visit would be smooth as long as he did not attempt to enter the Holy Mosques.|$|E
2500|$|Archduke Charles {{wished to}} prevent the army of Moreau from joining with his {{colleague}} Jean-Baptiste Jourdan and the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse. The Austrian commander hoped to withdraw to the south bank of the Danube but the Army of Rhin-et-Moselle was following too closely. By attacking Moreau, the archduke hoped to push the French back in order {{to prevent the}}ir two armies from merging and to give his own troops enough room to cross the Danube safely. Also, he wanted to lure Moreau into crossing the Danube and separating himself from Jourdan. Moreau's army was extended across a front [...] wide. Charles drew up plans to attack on 11 August. He sent one column to cross to the north bank of the Danube at Günzburg to get behind the French right flank. His troops were ready to move at midnight, but heavy rains slowed several of his assault columns. On the 10th Saint-Cyr with Taponier's division, drove the Austrians in his front out of the village of Eglingen. Urged on by Moreau, Saint-Cyr balked because he believed that the enemy were in strength nearby. Before anything more could be done, the heavy rain began and made it impossible to fire the cannons on both sides. Moreau refused to let his subordinate withdraw to a more defensible position or to order Duhesme's division to move closer. The only concession Moreau would make was to send up one regiment of Carabiniers to patrol in front of Taponier. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> side, Saint-Cyr stationed Lecourbe and one demi brigade at Dischingen where there was a bridge over the Egau River. Meanwhile, Duhesme stayed well to the south at Medlingen in the Danube valley.|$|E
