It was here that he started to develop a passion for helping people understand science. He believed that science was the key to the future of society, and that if people could be taught to <b>think</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> reasoned, thoughtful, unbiased critical perspective of science, that much suffering in the world could be alleviated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{publication}} of his book Neuronal Man: The Biology of The Mind in 1985 brought Changeux celebrity status among the wider public. Since then, he authored or co-authored several other books inspired by his teaching at the College de France: notably, Conversations on Mind Matter and Mathematics with the mathematician Alain Connes (1998), What Makes Us <b>Think</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> philosopher Paul Ricoeur (2002) and the Physiology of truth (2002) that are acknowledged as having initiated an instructive dialogue between the two often-hostile disciplines of neuroscience and philosophy. He has also been concerned by the relationships between aesthetic experience and the brain in Raison & Plaisir (1994), The true the good the beautiful: a neurobiological approach (2012) and recently Les neurones enchantés. (2014) where he debates the issue of artistic creation with the music composers Pierre Boulez and Philippe Manoury. [...] Changeux received the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science, Rockefeller University, New-York, 2005.|$|E
2500|$|In early January 2013, {{the band}} {{announced}} that their fifth album {{would be released}} later in the year, and labelled the album The Chase. Fans assumed their fifth album would be titled this, however, the band later {{announced that it was}} only a [...] "working title" [...] and the new album does not have a name. Healy said: [...] That's the working title, it's not the actual one. I <b>think</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> whole Chasing The Saturdays and chasing success, we'll call it that for now. But it's not the definite title. We'll have another single and then the album. We've finished it though. The official artwork for the album was released on 4 September 2013, as well as the official title, Living for the Weekend. The album artwork features all five members of the band, before Rochelle Humes and Frankie Sandford's pregnancies. Healy explained that the title of the album came from the band's name The Saturdays. She explained by saying everybody [...] "lives for the weekend" [...] and the band's name is in the weekend, which made the title even more relevant.|$|E
