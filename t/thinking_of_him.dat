25|$|I {{had watched}} Ken Barrington – a great Test batsman – {{as a boy}} and when I broke into the England side in the late Seventies he became a father figure. In fact, he was a mentor {{to a lot of}} us then – myself, David Gower, Ian Botham, Mike Gatting. Ken was an England {{selector}} and assistant manager on the West Indies tour of 1981. There were no official coach in those days but it was to Ken that most of us turned. Unlike many retired pros, he never used the words, 'In my day...' On the first night of the Test, he suffered a heart attack in our hotel. I was woken the next morning at around 8am by tour manager Alan Smith and captain Ian Botham. I knew something was wrong, because Both was never up before then. They told me the news. I had tears in my eyes when we went out on to the pitch for the minute's silence and again when I was batting in the second innings. We needed over 500 to win and it soon became apparent that we weren't going to get them. But I kept <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and managed to make a hundred. Kenny was a counsellor, a friend and an inspiration.|$|E

The story ends with Cowley telling himself, [...] " [...] 'I showed him...I guess I showed him. I guess I showed him I ain't so queer", a proclamation obviously laced with dramatic irony.|$|E

500|$|On 15 June 1910, Bogdan Žerajić {{attempted}} {{to kill the}} iron-fisted Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, General Marijan Varešanin. Žerajić was a 22-year-old Orthodox Serb from Nevesinje, Herzegovina, who {{was a student at}} the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb and made frequent trips to Belgrade. (General Verešanin went on to crush the last Bosnian peasant uprising {{in the second half of}} 1910.) The five bullets Žerajić fired at Varešanin and the fatal bullet he put in his own brain made Žerajić an inspiration to future assassins, including Princip and Princip's accomplice Čabrinović. Princip said that Žerajić [...] "was my first model. When I was seventeen I passed whole nights at his grave, reflecting on our wretched condition and <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> It is there that I made up my mind sooner or later to perpetrate an outrage." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for the Savannah Film Festival, Carlos Serrano of District wrote that though {{the subject matter}} covered a lot of ground, it {{utilized}} an efficient presentation: [...] "Sounds like a lot to put in to one movie, but the film manages to {{make good use of}} its 85 minute running time." [...] Serrano commented on the presentation of Jimmy Wales during the film, [...] "In the end, I came out of the theater <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a three-dimensional figure, very much a man with passion but neither completely good or evil. To be honest, this is very important in a film like this and is a definite plus for the movie." [...] Serrano recommended the documentary, and concluded, [...] "This is definitely a solid film. ... This film is definitely worth a viewing. It’s interesting, well made, and presents varied perspectives on Wikipedia that help the narrative stay interesting." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{he broke}} from Samway, {{crossed the room}} to Bathsheba, and kissed her hand. He put on his hat, opened the door, {{and went into the}} darkness, nobody <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> {{preventing}} <b>him.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} this type of experience: ‘My husband died in June 1945, and 26 years afterwards when I was at Church, I felt him standing beside me during the singing of a hymn. I felt I would see him if I turned my head. The feeling was so strong I was reduced to tears. I had not been <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> before I felt his presence. I had not had this feeling before that day, neither has it happened since then.’ ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, aged 62, Bardsley married 45-year-old Gertrude Cope, {{his wife}} {{until his death}} in 1954. [...] The last time they met, leaving the funeral of Dr. Rowley Pope, Jack Fingleton asked Bardsley his thoughts: [...] "I was just thinking," [...] said the old cricketer, [...] "what a great bloke old Doc was. [...] I was <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and then I just {{happened}} to see So-And-So across there, and I thought, Poor old So-And-So. [...] By cripes, he's looking old.

2500|$|Scarponi died on 22 April 2017, {{after being}} hit by a van, while riding his bicycle, close to his home in Filottrano. He had competed in the 2017 Tour of the Alps only the day before. He was riding along the SP 362 provincial road (Via dell'Industria), [...] from the town centre. Following on from the Tour of the Alps, Scarponi was {{training}} for the 2017 Giro d'Italia, where he was due to lead the [...] team, after Fabio Aru withdrew due to injury. The crash occurred around 08:00 local time; he was hit at a junction (Via Schiavoni) by an Iveco Daily driven by a 57-year-old local craftsman, who – according to statements made to the carabinieri (Italian police) – did not see Scarponi. He was known to Scarponi's father Giacomo, who said: [...] "We know each other well. I've lost a son, but I'm <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> too." ...|$|E

Vedder donated proceeds from a 2006 Pearl Jam concert in San Diego toward {{the construction of}} a theater for the school in the name of his former drama teacher, Clayton E. Liggett. Liggett was Vedder's mentor in high school. Vedder wrote the song [...] "Long Road" [...] (from Merkin Ball) upon hearing of Liggett's death in 1995. Vedder was a friend of Alice in Chains's lead singer Layne Staley, and wrote the song [...] "4/20/02" [...] in the night that he found out about Staley's death on April 20, 2002. Vedder also paid tribute to Staley during a Pearl Jam show in Chicago on August 22, 2016, which would be Staley's 49th birthday; “It’s the birthday of a guy called Layne Staley tonight, and we’re <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> tonight too. 49 years old”, Vedder told the crowd before dedicating the song Man of the Hour to his late friend.|$|E

25|$|He {{had also}} little trust in Lord Gort, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, whom Brooke thought too much {{interested}} in details and incapable of taking a broad strategic view.

She looked back over her life much as if she were glancing with a chill interest at a series of pictures which in no way concerned her. Scene after scene, face after face, flashed out on the background of the darkness.|$|R
