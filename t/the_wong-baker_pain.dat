40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{distress}} behaviors and perceptions of distress in 4 - to 6 -year-old children who received two immunization injections simultaneously with those in children who received their immunizations sequentially. METHOD: This experimental study used a convenience sample of 46 children scheduled for pre-kindergarten examinations. The children were randomly assigned to either a sequential injection or a simultaneous injection group. Direct observation and videotapes were made of the children 2 ̆ 7 s behaviors before and after injection. Distress behaviors were analyzed with the Observation Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised, and perceptions of distress were obtained from both children (with <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> <b>Pain</b> Rating Scale [FACES]) and parents (with the Visual Analog Scale). RESULTS: Results of the Observation Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised showed no significant differences in children 2 ̆ 7 s distress behaviors between the two groups either before or after injection. The children 2 ̆ 7 s self-reports of distress also showed no group differences. Parents 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the children 2 ̆ 7 s distress before and after injection were lower for the sequential group but were judged to be unrelated to the intervention. Given the opportunity to state a preference, however, parents preferred the simultaneous method. DISCUSSION: The simultaneous procedure was not found to be associated with reduced distress behaviors; however, parents preferred the simultaneous method...|$|E
40|$|Buruli ulcer (BU) is a necrotizing {{skin disease}} caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. People living {{in remote areas}} in {{tropical}} Sub Saharan Africa are mostly affected. Wound care {{is an important component}} of BU management; this often needs to be extended for months after the initial antibiotic treatment. BU is reported in the literature as being painless, however clinical observations revealed that some patients experienced pain during wound care. This was the first study on pain intensity during and after wound care in BU patients and factors associated with pain. In Ghana and Benin, 52 BU patients above 5 years of age and their relatives were included between December 2012 and May 2014. Information on pain intensity during and after wound care was obtained during two consecutive weeks using <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> <b>Pain</b> Scale. Median pain intensity during wound care was in the lower range (Mdn = 2, CV = 1), but severe pain (score > 6) was reported in nearly 30 % of the patients. Nevertheless, only one patient received pain medication. Pain declined over time to low scores 2 hours after treatment. Factors associated with higher self-reported pain scores were; male gender, fear prior to treatment, pain during the night prior to treatment, and pain caused by cleaning the wound. The general idea that BU is painless is incorrect for the wound care procedure. This procedural pain deserves attention and appropriate intervention...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of cryotherapy in managing the pain at the puncture site of Arterio-Venous Fistula (AVF) among children undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Methods: A one-group pre-post quasi-experiment was performed in two HD centers affiliated with Cairo University. The experiment involved 40 children with AVF undergoing HD. Before puncturing, cryotherapy was applied using 2 cm– 3 cm pieces of frozen distilled water in a plastic bag. Pain was assessed subjectively and objectively in two dialysis sessions before and after cryotherapy. A part from a physiological assessment of vital signs, pain was assessed using <b>the</b> <b>Wong–Baker</b> Faces <b>Pain</b> and <b>the</b> Observed Pain Behavior rating scales. All research ethics were applied. Results: HD had a median duration of four years, while cryotherapy had a median application time of 8. 8  min. <b>The</b> <b>Wong–Baker</b> Faces <b>Pain</b> score and almost all observed pain behaviors significantly decreased after cryotherapy. Significant improvements were observed in respiratory rate before and after needle puncture and in oxygen saturation after needle puncture. A lower skin dryness was observed after cryotherapy (12. 5 %) than before cryotherapy (52. 5 %; p <  0. 001). Conclusions: Cryotherapy can effectively reduce the venipuncture pain among children with AVF undergoing maintenance HD. However, the confounding effects of distraction and the non-randomized design used must be both considered when interpreting the findings. This study recommends the use of cryotherapy in managing needle puncture pain. Further research must adopt a randomized trial design with a placebo to support further the benefits of this procedure...|$|R
30|$|After the operation, blinded {{research}} assistants administered questionnaires {{related to the}} patient’s pain from three domains: abdominal (incisional) pain, urethral catheter-related pain, and bladder spasm-related discomfort. The questionnaires were based on <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> FACES <b>Pain</b> Rating visual analog scale (VAS), which rates pain on a 0 – 10 scale (Price et al. 1983). The questionnaires were administered once the patients arrived in the post-operative recovery unit at 30  minutes, 90  minutes, 6  hours, 12  hours, 18  hours, and 24  hours post-operatively.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} was tested {{that the level}} of pain experienced by children during conventional restorative treatment is higher than during atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) or an ultraconservative treatment. The sample consisted of 244 children, 6 - to 7 yr of age, who had at least two teeth with dentine carious lesions. Before the first treatment session (Tx- 1), in which one of the carious teeth was treated using one of the treatments, the level of dental anxiety was assessed using the Facial Image Scale (FIS). The child reported the intensity of pain experienced during the procedure using <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> FACES <b>Pain</b> Rating Scale. When conventional restorative treatment was used, more children needed local anaesthesia. Analyses excluding the data of children who had received local anaesthesia showed no treatment group effect on <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> score, a FIS Tx- 1 effect on <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> score, and a statistically significant correlation between FIS Tx- 1 and Wong-Baker scores.

If the pain is compared to a prior event, the nature of that event may be a follow-up question. The clinician must decide whether a score given is realistic within their experience - for instance, a pain score 10 for a stubbed toe is likely to be exaggerated. This may also be assessed for pain now, compared to pain at time of onset, or pain on movement.

Background Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing is an inexpensive, non-pharmacological intervention that has successfully been used to treat chronic pain. It holds promise {{in the treatment of}} acute, postsurgical pain based on its purported effects on the brain and nervous system. Design A randomized controlled trial was used. Methods Fifty-six adolescent surgical patients aged between 12 - 18 years were allocated to gender-balanced Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (treatment) or non-Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (control) groups. Pain was measured using <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> FACES® <b>Pain</b> Rating Scale (WBFS) before and after the intervention (or non-intervention for the control group). Findings A Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrated that the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing group experienced a significant reduction in pain intensity after treatment intervention, whereas the control group did not. Additionally, a Mann–Whitney U-test showed that, while {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups at time 1, there was a significant difference in pain intensity between the two groups at time 2, with the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing group experiencing lower levels of pain.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effects of {{partially}} hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) diet supplement in pediatric chronic abdominal pain (CAP) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind pilot study was performed in sixty children (8 - 16 years) with functional bowel disorders, such as CAP or IBS, diagnosed according to Rome III criteria. All patients underwent ultrasound, blood and stool examinations to rule out any organic disease. Patients were allocated to receive PHGG at dosage of 5 g/d (n = 30) or placebo (fruit-juice n = 30) for 4 wk. The evaluation of the efficacy of fiber supplement included IBS symptom severity score (Birmingham IBS Questionnaire), severity of abdominal <b>pain</b> (<b>Wong-Baker</b> Face <b>Pain</b> Rating Score) and bowel habit (Bristol Stool Scale). Symptom scores were completed at 2, 4, and 8 wk. The change from baseline in the symptom severity scale {{at the end of}} treatment and at 4 wk follow-up after treatment was the primary endpoint. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate compliance to supplementation with the PHGG in the pediatric population. Differences within groups during the treatment period and follow-up were evaluated by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: The results of the study were assessed considering some variables, such as frequency and intensity of symptoms with modifications of the bowel habit. Both groups were balanced for baseline characteristics and all patients completed the study. Group A (PHGG group) presented a higher level of efficacy compared to group B (control group), (43 % vs 5 %, P = 0. 025) in reducing clinical symptoms with modification of Birmingham IBS score (median 0 1; 1 vs 4 1; 1, P = 0. 025), in intensity of CAP assessed with <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> Face <b>Pain</b> Rating Score and in normalization of bowel habit evaluated with the Bristol Stool Scale (40 % vs 13. 3 %, P = 0. 025). In IBS subgroups, statistical analysis shown a tendency toward normalization of bowel movements, but {{there was no difference in}} the prevalence of improvement in two bowel habit subsets. PHGG was therefore better tolerated without any adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Although the cause of pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders is not known, the results show that complementary therapy with PHGG may have beneficial effects on symptom control...|$|R

Methods of pain control such as use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), narcotics, and local anesthetics have been used, but each have their own particular side effects. In this study we investigated the effect of ketamine on post-operative sedation and pain relief.   Materials and Methods: A total of 50 children aged between 5 and 12 years who were candidates for tonsillectomy were divided into two groups. The study group received ketamine-midazolam (ketamine 1 mg/kg, midazolam 0. 1 mg/kg) and the control group received midazolam (0. 1 mg/kg) in the pre-operative period. The same methods of anesthesia induction and maintenance were used in all patients. Pain score was assessed using <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> Faces <b>Pain</b> Rating scale and sedation was evaluated using the Riker Sedation-Agitation scale at the time of extubation as well as 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes and 1, 2, and 6 hours after surgery.   Results: The two groups were similar in terms of age, weight, gender and duration of surgery. Pain after 15 and 30 minutes and agitation after 10 and 15 minutes following extubation were lower in the study group (ketamine-midazolam). Mean consumption and time of first request for analgesia after surgery as well as incidence of post-operative vomiting were similar in the two groups.   Conclusion:  Adding ketamine to midazolam in pre-operative of tonsillectomy reduces agitation and post-operative pain in the first 30 minutes after surgery...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Pain is a {{subjective}} sensation and {{is difficult to}} measure. It is important to quantify pain as benefits are obtained from its quantification. The validity and reliability of pain outcome measures have been extensively researched in Europe, America and Asia. In Africa on the other hand, very {{few studies have been}} done. This study was a cross-sectional study to validate and test the reliability of pain scales. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the validity and reliability of the Tswana translations of three pain scales, namely, the Visual Analogue scale (two versions), the Verbal Rating Scale and <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> Faces <b>Pain</b> Measure. <b>The</b> validity of the study was determined by the face validity,criterion validity and construct validity. The statistical analysis of the results showed several significant p values (p< 0. 05). However, none of the correlations illustrated a strong relationship as there were no r values in excess of 0. 5 indicating a moderate correlation or greater than 0. 7 indicating a good correlation. The statistical significance only indicated that the observed values were not due to chance. From the statistical analysis of the results, it became apparent that the subjects tested did not have an understanding of any of the three scales. This was seen in all the age groups and education levels selected for the purpose of this study. It is our recommendation therefore, that suitable, new scales be developed for our local population. The scales which have been used up until now are not being understood and hence are not being interpreted or used correctly in the South African context amongst Tswana speaking individuals. Future research needs to be done in developing entirely different scales for the South African scenario. More relevant and better understood scales should be developed for our local population to include persons of different languages and different education levels. This will assist in a better understanding of the health care process and will by so doing, improve their health care and management...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of <b>the</b> subjective <b>Wong–Baker</b> faces <b>pain</b> rating scale (WBFS) and of the objective skin conductance fluctuation (SCF) test in assessing pain in children undergoing venipuncture. One-hundred and fifty children (aged 5 – 16 years) entered the study. All underwent venipuncture at the antecubital fossa to collect blood specimens for routine testing in the same environmental conditions. After venipuncture, the children indicated their pain intensity using the WBFS, whereas the number of SCFs was recorded before, during and after venipuncture. So, pain level was measured in each child with WBFS and SCF. We found that the level of WBFS-assessed pain was lower in all children, particularly those above 8 years of age, than SCF-assessed pain (p <  0. 0001). Moreover, the number of SCFs was significantly higher during venipuncture than before or after venipuncture (p <  0. 0001). At multivariate regression analysis, age and previous experience of venipuncture influenced the WBFS (β = − 1. 81, p <  0. 001, and β = − 0. 86, p <  0. 001, respectively) but not SCFs. In conclusion, although both procedures can be useful for research and clinical practice, our findings show that WBFS was affected by age and previous venipuncture, whereas SCF produced uniform data. If verified in other studies, our results should be taken into account when using these tools to evaluate pain in children...|$|R

It is a challenge for the treating surgeon to manage pain and maintain adequate hydration with minimal adverse effects. The goal {{of this study is}} to compare the efficacy and adverse effect of oral enzyme preparation over Diclofenac sodium (NSAID) in treating post operative pain. Materials and methods: The study was done on 60 patients who underwent tonsillectomy in the age group 18 - 45 in Department of ENT. 30 patients were put on oral Diclofenac for 2 weeks and other 30 patients were put on oral enzymatic preparation for 2 weeks. Patients were reviewed on 3 rd, 7 th, 14 th post op day. Their symptoms were recorded according to <b>the</b> <b>WONG-BAKER</b> FACIAL GRIMACE <b>pain</b> scale. Results: At the end of two weeks 28 out of 30 patients (93 %) on enzymatic preparations were on zero pain scale and 30 out of 30 (100 %) on NSAIDS had zero pain scale but adverse drug reactions were seen in 22 out 30 patients (73. 3 %) with NSAIDS where as only 4 out of 30 (13. 3 %) with oral enzyme preparations had adverse effects. Conclusion: Post tonsillectomy pain is one of the difficult things to manage as it interferes with intake of food and hydration. Oral enzyme preparations play a significant role in reducing the pain with very minimal gastrointestinal side effects and can be used as a very effective alternative mode of treatment in such patients...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThis study {{investigated}} the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the intramuscular injection of CD 34 + cells isolated from {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PB-MNCs) mobilized by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for the management of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI) who were considered unlikely to have successful long-term revascularization with open bypass or endovascular methods. Cell therapy represents a new treatment modality for this subgroup of patients with CLI. To date, bone marrow or PB-MNCs have usually been used for transplantation. The current pilot {{study investigated}} whether the transplantation of purified CD 34 + cells only would be competent in ischemia relief and limb salvage. MethodsFrom May 2009 to July 2011, 25 patients (mean age, 44  ± 12 years) were enrolled, and 25 lower extremities and three upper extremities were treated. After subcutaneous administration of G-CSF for 5 days at a dose of 5 to 10 μg/kg, apheresis and immunomagnetic separation were performed to acquire the isolated CD 34 + cells, which were then intramuscularly injected into the ischemic sites. The patients were divided into three groups: low-dose, 105 /kg; medium-dose, 5  × 105 /kg; and high-dose, 106 /kg. The overall outcomes among all patients and the comparison among the groups were evaluated. ResultsDuring the follow-up of 6 to 33 months, the overall outcomes showed that <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> FACES <b>pain</b> rating scale score (WFPRSS) decreased from 7  ± 2 to 3  ± 3 (P <. 001) and 1  ± 2 (P <. 001) at 1 and 2 months, respectively; at 3 and 6 months, respectively, the peak pain-free walking time increased from 4  ± 3 to 13  ± 7 (P <. 001) and 18  ± 6 minutes (P <. 001), the ankle-brachial index increased from 0. 46  ± 0. 21 to 0. 60  ± 0. 17 (P =. 003) and 0. 67  ± 0. 15 (P =. 001), and the transcutaneous partial oxygen pressure increased from 27  ± 10 to 41  ± 11 (P <. 001) and 55  ± 12 mm Hg (P <. 001). Ulcers were healed in 10 of the 14 patients; four patients required above-knee or below-knee amputation ≤ 3 months. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the rate of freedom from major amputation at 6 months was 84 % (95 % confidence interval, 63 %- 94 %). The comparison among the three groups (low-dose, 5; medium-dose, 11; high-dose, 9) revealed no significant difference, except that the WFPRSS improvement at 1 month from baseline in the high-dose group (6. 3  ± 1. 7) was significantly superior to that in the low-dose (3. 2  ± 3. 3; P =. 0487) and medium-dose (3. 7  ± 2. 8; P =. 0352) groups. ConclusionsTransplantation of CD 34 + cells isolated from G-CSF-mobilized PB-MNCs appears to be feasible and safe, showing encouraging outcomes in the treatment of CLI patients who appear to have compromised options for long-term revascularization...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that pharyngalgia is very common after tonsillectomy. It should be {{emphasized}} that the intensity of pain after adenoidectomy in children is not less important than after adenotonsillectomy. Despite the availability of standardized pain assessment scales and existing postoperative analgesia recommendations, unresolved postoperative pain still occurs in children. The research included 117 children {{with an average age}} of 7. 5 ± 0. 4 years, who underwent adenoidectomy at the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care of "Regional Children’s Clinical Hospital" of Kharkov city in 2014. Depending on the method of general anesthesia, patients were divided into 3 groups: group I (n = 41) those who received propofol in combination with fentanyl; group II (n = 40) those who received sevoflurane in combination with fentanyl; group III (n = 36) those who received thiopental sodium combined with fentanyl. We monitored the heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, BIS-index, heart rate variability, respiration rate, and SpO 2. We determined the levels of cortisol and insulin in the blood serum, glucose level, the ratio of cortisol/insulin was calculated. Assessment of the efficiency of postoperative analgesia was performed using <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> FACES <b>Pain</b> Scale («Faces») and the Oucher Scale. The result of analysis of the intensity of postoperative pain determined that at the 1 st hour after the operation by the «Faces» and Oucher scales, it was significantly higher in patients of group II compared with the patients of group I and group III. The morning after the operation {{there was no significant difference}} in the pain scales, and the number of scale points showed that children from all groups did not have pain. According to the data of ANOVA it was determined that only the patients in group I with indicator ΔBIS-index «intubation – traumatic moment of operation» experienced postoperative pain intensity on the «Faces» scale. A very strong correlation between «cortisol – BIS index» was observed during the traumatic moment of operation and unidirectional positive correlations were seen both between ΔBIS-index «intubation-the traumatic moment of operation» and between the level of cortisolemia (Δcortisol before surgery – the traumatic moment of operation, Δcortisol extubation – the 1 st day after the surgery and Δcortisol before surgery – the 1 st day after the surgery) and the intensity of postoperative pain by the «Faces» and Oucher scales. The around-the-clock prescribed administration of ibuprofen at dose 10 mg/kg after adenoidectomy provided effective postoperative analgesia. At the 1 st hour after the operation lower pain intensity was revealed in patients using propofol in combination with fentanyl by both pain scales. We believe that propofol is able to influence the level of cortisol and assume that due to minimal changes in the level of cortisol during the perioperative period, propofol can reduce the intensity of postoperative pain...|$|R

30|$|Outcome {{measures}} were 10  cm visual analogue scale (<b>Wong-Baker)</b> <b>pain</b> scores recorded routinely and prospectively by the nursing staff caring for each patient at 4, 12 and 24  hours post-operatively. We recorded analgesic requirements {{in the first}} 24  hours by reviewing drug charts and prescribed/received medication, {{and the type of}} suture and method for closure of the vaginal skin and fascial plication were also recorded. Sutures were classed as non-absorbable (Nylon, Polypropylene) absorbable (polyglactin) and rapidly absorbable (polyglactin-Vicryl Rapide); closure technique was classed as continuous, continuous locking or interrupted. These definitions were made before data collection began, and the analysis was planned accordingly. We did not collect data on operating surgeon, since this was a pilot exercise aimed at obtaining an estimate of pain scores and distribution by the planned primary variable (suture method). There would have been insufficient power to reliably explore surgeon expertise, although this was planned for the main study.|$|R
40|$|Pain during {{arteriovenous}} fistula (AVF) cannulation {{remains a}} common problem in hemodialysis (HD) patients that leads to noncompliance to lifetime maintenance HD. This study was performed {{to determine the effect}} of cryotherapy on reducing pain during AVF cannulation among HD patients in the King Khalid Hospital, Tabuk, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is an experimental study which included 62 patients undergoing HD through an AVF. Randomization was used to assign the patients into the experimental (received cryotherapy) and control (no cryotherapy) groups. The Arabic version of <b>Wong-Baker</b> <b>pain</b> rating scale was used to determine the pain score. There was {{a significant difference in the}} pre-and post-intervention pain scores among the experimental group, while there was no such difference in the control group. The null hypothesis was rejected based on a P < 0. 05. Our study suggests that cryotherapy intervention to relieve AVF cannulation-related pain among adult patients undergoing HD is effective. Therefore, it is recommended that cryotherapy should be considered as a complementary intervention to reduce pain related to AVF cannulation...|$|R
40|$|Because {{discomfort}} {{caused by}} different approximal caries detection methods can influence their performance, {{the assessment of}} this discomfort is important. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the discomfort reported by children after the use of different diagnostic methods to detect approximal caries lesions in primary teeth: visual inspection, bitewing radiography, laser fluorescence (DIAGNOdent pen - LFpen) and temporary separation with orthodontic rubbers. Seventy-six children aged 4 to 12 years were examined using these methods. Their discomfort was assessed using <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> scale and compared among the methods. Visual inspection caused less discomfort than did other methods. Radiography and the LFpen presented similar levels of discomfort. Older children reported higher discomfort using temporary separation, whereas younger children reported less discomfort with the LFpen. In conclusion, radiographic, temporary separation and LFpen methods provoke higher discomfort than visual inspection...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{tunnelled}} scleral {{intravitreal injection}} with straight scleral intravitreal injection concerning short-term intraocular pressure (IOP) changes, occurrence {{and amount of}} vitreous reflux, and patient discomfort. METHODS: Sixty patients were randomly allocated to two groups (tunnelled intravitreal injection and straight intravitreal injection). IOP was measured before and directly (< 1 minute) after the injection of 0. 05 mL of an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent and then every 5 minutes until IOP was < 30 mmHg. Occurrence and amount of vitreous reflux were recorded. Patient discomfort during injection was assessed with a <b>Wong-Baker</b> faces <b>pain</b> rating scale. RESULTS: IOP (mmHg +/- SD) increased significantly directly after injection to 35. 97 +/- 8. 13 (tunnelled intravitreal injection) and 30. 19 +/- 12. 14 (straight intravitreal injection). These pressure spikes differed significantly between both groups (P = 0. 01, mean difference: - 7. 11). Five minutes after injection, {{there was no significant}} difference in IOP increase between the groups. All IOP measurements were < 30 mmHg after 15 minutes. Occurrence and amount of vitreous reflux were significantly higher with straight intravitreal injection. There was no significant difference in <b>Wong-Baker</b> faces <b>pain</b> rating scale score between both groups. CONCLUSION: Tunnelled intravitreal injection seems to be the technique of choice for low-volume intravitreal injection (0. 05 mL). There is neither a difference in patient discomfort nor a difference in IOP increase 5 minutes after injection between both groups. Significantly less vitreous reflux with tunnelled intravitreal injection should lead to less postinjectional drug loss...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Depression and {{cognitive}} functioning {{have a negative}} impact on functional recovery after hip fracture surgery in older people, and the same has been suggested for pain and fear of falling. These variables, however, have never been studied together, nor has the timing of psychiatric assessment been taken into account. METHOD: Two parallel, randomized controlled trials were undertaken aiming to prevent and treat depression after hip fracture surgery in older people. Multiple logistic regression analyses corrected for age and pre-morbid level of functioning were performed to evaluate the effect of depressive symptoms (15 -item Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS), <b>pain</b> (<b>Wong-Baker</b> <b>pain</b> scale), cognitive functioning (Mini-mental State Examination, MMSE) and fear of falling (Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, MFES) within 2 weeks after surgery and 6 weeks later on functional recovery at 6 months. Main outcome measures were performance-based measures (up-and-go test, gait test, functional reach) and the self-report Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) questionnaire to assess the impact of the hip fracture on activities of daily living (ADL). RESULTS: Two hundred and ninety-one patients participated and outcome measures for 187 (64 %) patients were available at 6 months. All mental health variables interfered with functional recovery. However, in the final multivariate model, cognitive functioning and fear of falling assessed 6 weeks after surgery consistently predicted functional recovery, whereas pain and depressive symptoms were no longer significant. CONCLUSION: Fear of falling {{and cognitive}} functioning may be more important than pain and depression to predict functional recovery after hip fracture surgery. Rehabilitation strategies should take this into account...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe present {{randomized}} {{clinical trial}} evaluated {{the efficacy of}} a topical lidocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) to relief pain during spinal puncture in pediatric oncology patients. Materials and MethodsSixty patients with malignancy candidate for spinal puncture were selected for this study. The patients were randomly allocated to two groups. Group A had topical EMLA cream and group B had placebo, which they received 60 to 90 minutes before spinal puncture. Pain score was rated using <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> Faces rating score (0 : no pain to 10 : worst pain). ResultsPain score does not reduce significantly in the topical EMLA cream in compared with placebo (p-value= 0. 126). No signs of infection were noted at the spinal puncture sites 24 or 48 hours after the procedure. ConclusionResults obtained from this study represents that the EMLA cream has not more analgesic effect than placebo in reducing the pain for spinal puncture...|$|R
40|$|Background: Propofol {{emulsion}} {{in medium}} and long-chain triglycerides (MCT/LCT) {{has been reported}} to cause less injection pain than other propofol solutions in adult studies. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the injection pain of two different propofol emulsions using two different pain scales on the pediatric population. Materials and Methods: 100 children scheduled for general anesthesia were divided into two groups. Patients were randomly assigned to receive propofol LCT or propofol MCT/LCT. Assessment and evaluation of the Ontario Children′s Hospital Pain Scale (mCHEOPS) and <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> Faces Scale (WBFS) were performed at the start of the injection until the patients lose consciousness. Results: There were no significant differences between groups in terms of demographic data. According to the mCHEOPS scale, the pain incidence of propofol LCT was 5 %, whereas for propofol MCT/LCT it was 15 % (P 0. 05). Conclusions: Propofol MCT/LCT does not decrease injection pain; contrary to the general assumption, it causes more pain than propofol LCT in children...|$|R

40|$|Background. The {{aim of this}} {{retrospective}} study was to compare immediate postoperative pain scores and need for rescue analgesia in children who underwent pulpotomies and restorative treatment and those who underwent restorative treatment only, all under general anaesthesia. Methods. Ninety patients aged {{between 3 and 7}} years who underwent full mouth dental rehabilitation under general anaesthesia were enrolled in the study and reviewed. The experimental group included patients who were treated with at least one pulpotomy, and the control group was treated with dental fillings only. <b>The</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> FACES scale was used to evaluate self-reported pain and need for rescue analgesia. The data were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis test, two sample t-tests, chi-square tests, and Pearson’s correlation analysis. Results. Ninety percent of the children experienced postoperative pain in varying degrees of severity. Immediate postoperative pain scores in experimental group were found to be significantly higher than in control group (x 2 = 24. 82, p< 0. 01). In the experimental group, 48 % of the children needed rescue analgesia, compared with only 13 % {{of the children in the}} control group (x 2 = 13. 27, p< 0. 05). Conclusion.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Today no {{method of}} topical {{anesthesia}} for intravitreal injection {{administration has been}} proven to make the patient comfortable yet. We compared the efficacy of topical levobupivacaine 0. 75 % and proparacaine 0. 5 % in patients undergoing intravitreal injections. Materials and Methods: A prospective, randomized study comparing two agents for topical anesthesia in intravitreal injections. Ninety-six consecutive patients were enrolled into two groups to receive either topical levobupivacaine 0. 75 % (n= 48) or proparacaine 0. 5 % (n= 48). Patients were asked to score their pain using a visual analog scale (VAS) immediately following the injection. The average of these scores {{was used as the}} primary outcome. The surgeon performing the procedure scored his perception of the patients′ <b>pain</b> using <b>the</b> <b>Wong-Baker</b> FACES scale. Results: Mean VAS pain scores for two groups were found to be 44. 77 ± 16. 42 and 34. 18 ± 14. 83, respectively. Mean VAS pain score in the proparacaine group was significantly lower than that in the levobupivacaine group (P= 0. 003). Mean Wong-Baker FACES scores for the two groups were 1. 08 ± 0. 49 and 1. 10 ± 0. 30, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between levobupivacaine and proparacaine groups (P= 0. 824).

40|$|Postoperative pain is {{less intense}} after laparoscopic than after open surgery. However, {{minimally}} invasive surgery is not a a pain-free procedure. Many trials {{have been done in}} adults using intraperitoneal and/or incisional local anesthetic, but similar studies have not yet been reported in the literature in children. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the analgesic effect of periportal infiltration and intraperitoneal instillation of ropivacaine in children undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Materials and Methods: Thirty patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery were randomly allocated to one of three groups. Group A (n 10) received local infiltration of port sites with 10 mL of ropivacaine. Group B (n 10) received both an infiltration of port sites with 10 mL of ropivacaine and an intraperitoneal instillation of 10 mL of ropivacaine. Group C did not receive any analgesic treatment. The local anesthetic was always administered at the end of surgery. The degree of postoperative abdominal parietal pain, abdominal visceral pain, and shoulder pain was assessed by using a <b>Wong-Baker</b> <b>pain</b> scale and a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 3, 6 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. The following parameters were also evaluated: rescue analgesic treatment, length of hospital stay, and time of return to normal activities. Results: Three hours after operation, patients had low pain scores. Six and 12 hours postoperatively, the abdominal parietal pain was significantly higher (P 0. 0005) in group C than in the other two groups, both treated with an infiltration at the trocar sites; mean intensity of abdominal visceral pain was significantly lower (P 0. 0005) in group B than in groups A and C; the overall incidence of shoulder pain was significantly lower (P 0. 0005) in group B patients than in patients of groups A and C. At 20 hours postoperatively, pain scores were significantly reduced of intensity in all groups. Rescue analgesic treatment was significantly higher in group C, if compared to groups A and B 12 hours after the operation. No statistically significant difference was found in length of hospital stay, but children who received analgesic treatment had a more rapid return to normal activities than untreated patients (P 0. 0005). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the combination of local infiltration and intraperitoneal instillation of ropivacaine is more effective for pain relief in children after laparoscopic surgery than the administration of ropivacaine only at the trocar sites...|$|R
