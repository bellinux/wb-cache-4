5|$|Portuguese sappers built a {{pontoon bridge}} over the Guadiana river which united two Portuguese {{quarters}} in Vado del Moro and allowed Mendes de Vasconcelos' troops to cross the river. Having reinforced Santa Engracia, north of San Critsóbal, and fortified a {{bridge over the}} Gévora river, they built, unmolested, an arc of the circumvallation from Gévora to Vado del Moro. Fort del Mayordomo, located near the Guadiana river, had been abandoned by its Spanish garrison shortly after being built. The Portuguese used it to cover {{the construction of the}} circumvallation line to the Guadiana. They also tried to occupy Cerro del Viento, a hill near Vado del Moro, but were repelled by the Spanish garrison <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> and had to build the circumvallation line behind it. Given the strategic importance of Cerro del Viento, the nearby hill of Cerro de las Mayas had been earmarked for an improvised star fortification by the Italian general Ventura de Tarragona, but it had not been built, leaving the Fort of San Miguel vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{examples}} of friction between Americans and Navajo groups between 1846 and 1863. Manuelito and Barboncito reminded the Navajo that the Army was bringing in troops to wage war, it had flogged a Navajo messenger, and opened fire on tribal headsman Agua Chiquito, during talks for peace. They argued that the army had refused to bring in feed for their many animals at Ft. Defiance, took over the prime grazing land, and killed Manuelito's livestock <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> On April 30, 1860, Manuelito and Barboncito with 1,000 Navajo warriors attacked the fort and almost took control.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{when he was}} 13, whilst {{still at}} school, McCoy began playing as lead guitarist with a working beat group, The Drovers. In 1966 he responded to an {{advertisement}} in the Yorkshire Post newspaper for a guitarist to join a band called Mamas Little Children who were about to begin touring Germany. McCoy went to audition only to find they had just given someone else the position, but still needed a bass player. He auditioned on a spare bass <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> and was given the job. In 1968 {{he was forced to}} resign from the band because he was working illegally under age. On his return to Britain he went to London where he found work as a session musician with former Drifters member Clyde McPhatter touring the UK.|$|E
500|$|Gray {{flew into}} Baltimore to Nothingface's home studio {{to discuss the}} project further. The song [...] "Waging War" [...] was written in two days, {{followed}} by Maxwell tracking it the next day, and Gray completing vocals. During the summer of 2006, schedules were clear, which allowed members {{to take the time}} to record a studio album. The album was recorded at Paul's backyard studio, Chasin' Jason in Arlington, Texas. Filled with photos of his late brother Dimebag, Paul found it tough entering the studio where the last albums by Damageplan and Pantera, and the collaboration Rebel Meets Rebel were recorded, but felt [...] "the dark cloud <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> went away", due to everyone's positive energy. Maxwell and Tribbett were the primary writers of the album, and Paul was there to [...] "steer them in the right direction", with Gray adding his opinion on musical arrangements.|$|E
500|$|Casino Royale {{had been}} {{produced}} as a 1954 television episode and a 1967 satirical film. [...] Eon Productions gained {{the rights to}} Casino Royale in 1999 after Sony Pictures Entertainment exchanged them for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's rights to Spider-Man. In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming {{to bring back the}} flavour of Ian Fleming's original Bond novels. Paul Haggis' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, [...] "the draft <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house.

500|$|Turner interviewed flautist John Payne for the book, who had {{sat in on}} {{sessions}} with Van Morrison and later collaborated with him. Payne comments on their work together on the album Astral Weeks, which also included musicians Connie Kay, Warren Smith, Jay Berliner, and Richard Davis: [...] "Ironically, the image you have {{when you listen to}} the album now is of these guys who are all together, and they realise they are creating a monumental work of art. The fact is that it was just another session for them." [...] Payne states of his observations of Van Morrison's performance style: [...] "When (Van) was on stage, he would look like a space cadet, but then he'd open his mouth and you would realize that he had channeled everything into the sound of his voice. The rest of it was just a shell <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for the purpose of producing this noise." ...|$|E
500|$|Casino Royale reboots the series, {{establishing}} a new timeline and narrative framework {{not meant to}} precede or succeed any previous Bond film. Barbara Broccoli stated that [...] "For years, my father wanted to make Casino Royale—it's the Holy Grail... We {{wanted to make a}} tougher film, the way it should have been made years ago". Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed, commenting [...] "We felt the last film was too fantastical, so we {{decided to go back to}} the basics and update". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond. Paul Haggis was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that [...] "the draft <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper [...] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her". In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be Casino Royale, although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig.|$|E
500|$|Johnston {{was entered}} as a {{competitor}} {{in the second}} series of Britain's Got Talent by his mother. He passed the first public audition, singing [...] "Pie Jesu" [...] from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Requiem. Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that [...] "it was scary singing in front of 2,500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers". He won his semi-final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final. He sang [...] "Tears in Heaven" [...] by Eric Clapton; judge Holden {{told him he had}} [...] "a gift from God in [...] voice". At the final on 30 May, he again sang [...] "Pie Jesu". He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners-up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he [...] "was upset. But when you see the talent <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> it was an honour just to be in the final". The day after the final, Cowell's publicist Max Clifford said that it was [...] "quite possible" [...] that Cowell would be offering record contracts to some of the finalists, including Johnston. Johnston and other contestants then embarked on a national arena tour.|$|E

2500|$|After {{completing}} {{one last}} film in Sweden and appearing in three moderately successful films (Adam Had Four Sons, Rage in Heaven and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, all 1941) in the United States, Bergman co-starred with Humphrey Bogart {{in the classic}} film Casablanca (1942), which remains her best-known role. In this film, she {{played the role of}} Ilsa, the beautiful Norwegian wife of Victor Laszlo, played by Paul Henreid, an [...] "anti-Nazi underground hero" [...] who is in Casablanca, a haven from the Nazis. Bergman did not consider Casablanca to be one of her favorite performances. [...] "I made so many films which were more important, but the only one people ever want to talk about is that one with Bogart." [...] In later years, she stated, [...] "I feel about Casablanca that it has a life of its own. There is something mystical about it.

2500|$|East Wansdyke in Wiltshire, on {{the south}} of the Marlborough Downs, has been less {{disturbed}} by later agriculture and building. It is more clearly traceable on the ground than the western part. In places the bank is up to [...] high and the ditch as much as [...] deep. Since at least the tenth century there have been gaps, [...] "gates", in the work. Fowler suggests that its plan is consistent with those of Roman border fortifications such as Hadrian's Wall, not just a military defence but intended to control locals and travelers along the Wessex Ridgeway. He suggests further that the works were never finished, abandoned {{in the face of a}} political change which removed their rationale. Wansdyke's origins are unclear, but the eastern part was probably built during the 5th or 6th century. That is, after the withdrawal of the Romans, and before the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons. The earthwork is named after Woden, indicating that the incoming Anglo-Saxons had no information about the origins of a structure <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> when they arrived, and which was of no significance to locals at that time.|$|E
2500|$|Instead, it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the New Forest coven had been founded {{in the early twentieth}} century by various occultists who wished to resurrect the Witch-Cult as described in Murray's works. Philip Heselton (2003), who performed the most exhaustive research into the group, speculated that the coven had been formed by a woman named Rosamund Sabine, who prior to moving to the New Forest in 1924 had been involved in various esoteric groups like the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He thought that she, after reading The Witch-Cult in Western Europe, became interested in witches, and believed herself to be the reincarnation of one. It was for this reason, he believed, that she gathered together some of her friends who also had an interest in the occult, and founded the coven. However, researcher Vikki Bramshaw suggests [...] that Gardner may well have had some, albeit brief, meeting with local traditions in operation at that time. She writes that whilst a number of the members were from masonic or academic backgrounds of high society, others were working class people outside of those class-bound organisations. They included blacksmiths, manual labourers, and some with gypsy connections in the Forest. Davis Stanton writes, 'In other words, Wicca was only 'new' in the sense the New Forest was new - a re-designation of something <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> before, under another name.' ...|$|E
2500|$|Avatar: The Last Airbender co-creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko voiced {{their opinion}} within an {{interview}} regarding Shyamalan writing, directing, and producing the film. The two displayed much enthusiasm over Shyamalan's {{decision for the}} adaptation, stating that they admire his work and, in turn, he respects their material. Producer Frank Marshall explained that they have high hopes to stick to a PG rating. [...] "I'm not even sure {{we want to get}} in the PG-13 realm. Furthermore, Shyamalan said, [...] "A lot of the inspiration for the direction we took comes from a friend of mine. A Nathan Blackmer helped shape this Idea into the film it became. I took away {{a little bit of the}} slapsticky stuff <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for the little little kids, the fart jokes and things like that...We grounded Katara's brother...and that really did wonderful things for the whole theme of the movie." [...] Paramount's president Brad Grey said that despite the director's career being inconsistent, he [...] "believed in [...] vision and that he could execute it," [...] adding that [...] "It's a bold step because he had to create a potential new franchise." [...] The studio was willing to spend $250 million in a trilogy of films, one for each season. The Last Airbenders budget wound up being $150 million, with later over $130 million being spent on marketing costs, making it Shyamalan's most expensive film. During production, the name Avatar was removed from the title to avoid confusion with the highly-successful 2009 film Avatar.|$|E
