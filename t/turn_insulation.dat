40|$|The {{development}} of an online method for the early detection of a stator <b>turn</b> <b>insulation</b> deterioration is {{the objective of the}} research at hand. A high percentage of motor breakdowns is related to the failure of the stator insulation system. Since most of the stator insulation failures originate in the breakdown of the turn-to-turn insulation, the research in this realm is of great significance. Despite the progress that has been made in the field of stator turn fault detection methods, the most popular and the best known ones are still limited to the detection of solid turn faults. The time span between a solid turn fault and the breakdown of the primary insulation system can be as short as a few seconds. Therefore, it is desirable to develop a method capable of detecting the deterioration of the <b>turn</b> <b>insulation</b> as early as possible and prior to the {{development of}} a solid turn fault. The different stresses that cause the aging of the insulation and eventually lead to failure are described as well as the various patterns of an insulation failure. A comprehensive literature survey shows the methods presently used for the monitoring of the <b>turn</b> <b>insulation.</b> Up to now no well-tested and reliable online method that can find the deterioration of the <b>turn</b> <b>insulation</b> is available. The most commonly used <b>turn</b> <b>insulation</b> test is the surge test, which, however, is performed only when the motor is out of service and disconnected from the supply. So far no research at all has been conducted on the application of an online surge test. The research at hand examines the applicability of the surge test to an operating machine. Various topologies of online surge testing are examined with regard to their practicability and their limitations. The most practical configuration is chosen for further analysis, implementation and development. Moreover, practical challenges are presented by the non-idealities of the induction machine like the eccentricity of the rotor and the rotor slotting, and have to be taken into account. Two solutions to eliminate the influence of the rotor position on the surge waveform are presented. Even though the basic concepts of online surge testing can be validated experimentally by a machine with a solid turn fault, it is preferable to use a machine with a deteriorated <b>turn</b> <b>insulation.</b> Therefore, a method, which does not require complex and expensive hardware, to experimentally emulate the <b>turn</b> <b>insulation</b> breakdown is implemented. The concepts at any stage of the work are supported by simulations and experimental results. In addition, the theory of surge testing is further developed by giving new definitions of the test's sensitivity, i. e., the frequency sensitivity and the error area ratio (EAR) sensitivity. Ph. D.

40|$|Converter fed {{medium voltage}} motors are {{increasingly}} being employed in industrial processes due to their higher efficiency and greater flexibility with respect to speed control. The increased use of motor adjustable speed drives has raised concerns about the adverse effects of the distorted voltage waveform of the converter on the insulation of the machine. Recent designs include {{a higher level of}} insulation than that are used in conventional AC-fed motors {{because of the presence of}} fast transients and harmonics in the voltage waveforms at the motor terminals. Many studies have focused on this problem, with most emphasizing on the stress-grading system and relatively a few investigating the form-wound <b>turn</b> <b>insulation,</b> with some contradictory reported results. Hence, the focus of the present research is to study the <b>turn</b> <b>insulation</b> of form-wound machines subjected to distorted voltage waveforms from converter pulses. The effect of pulse parameters such as rise time, pulse duty cycle, and switching frequency on the times-to-failure of <b>turn</b> <b>insulation</b> under unipolar and bipolar square pulses are investigated. Back-to-back <b>turn</b> <b>insulation</b> samples, with enamel insulation, were prepared based on IEC 60034 - 18 - 42 with improved insulation in the crotch region of the samples to prevent failures in this region. A high voltage pulse generator, and an antenna based PD measurement system, were implemented in order to investigate significant factors affecting insulation system using PD activity measurements and times-to-failure experiments. The experimental results were used to identify the significant parameters of aging as well as suggesting the aging mechanism involved. A point-to-plane setup having an insulation film representing a single defect in <b>turn</b> <b>insulation</b> system, was also implemented to investigate the PD features and their relationship to the times-to-failure of back-to-back samples in depth. Using this setup, a series of measurements were carried out to investigate the significance of charge accumulation on the times-to-failure of insulation samples. By conducting surface charge measurements, surface potential measurements, and COMSOL® simulations on the point-to-plane setup with different insulation films, the influence of accumulated charge in modifying the electric field and therefore the times-to-failure of insulation systems was studied for different pulse types and switching frequencies in order to explain the results of aging experiments and to validate the presented aging mechanism...|$|E

40|$|International audienceInter-turn faults in the {{stator winding}} of PMSM {{is one of}} the major cause of motor failure. Therefore {{prevention}} and early detection of fault occurrence are crucial in the industrial field. End winding turns can suffer from mechanical vibration due to electromagnetic efforts. With aging, end winding blocking systems become weaker and <b>turns</b> <b>insulation</b> degrades until its breakdown. In this paper, a modeling and a detection method for intermittent inter-turn fault in PMSM stator end winding is presented. The given fault model is an intermittent inter-turn short circuit in the stator winding. In steady state operation, stator currents and reference voltages under fault condition contain fault information, and will be used for its detection. The method is based on the use of a wavelet transform for the detection of the fault. Simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ...|$|R
40|$|Faults in the stator {{windings}} of three-phase induction machines are recognized {{to play a}} major role in the failures that occur during the machines life span. The machines (or motors) which were fed by inverters tend to worsen its condition, due to the fast switching of the power semiconductors used by the inverters in which promotes voltage stresses. After a period of time the machines will be affected by the degradation of the stator <b>turns</b> <b>insulation</b> which will eventually lead to winding short circuits. By diagnosing the stator faults in DTC induction motor drives, we can then determine the failures which the information could be used to construct an artificial intelligence system that can help monitor and pin-point the source of motor failure.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{present the}} {{investigation}} on transient over voltage that appears across the motor terminals when motor is supplied with a sinusoidal supply {{and with a}} PWM converter. When motor is operated on sinusoidal supply, then during switching period voltage across motor phase becomes equal to supply line voltage and the maximum voltage across any of the coil obtained is 30 % more than the rated value. Unexpected behaviour was observed in variation of coil voltage (harmonic voltage after few cycle from starting) with sinusoidal supply during starting, however this is not producing large over voltages or high dv/dt. Voltage rise time when motor is supplied with converter is very small and is {{of the order of}} micro second. In some cases the peak voltage at motor terminals reaches to value which more than twice the value of dc link voltage and rated line to line voltage of the motor. The distribution of voltage during switching condition is not even among the coils of a winding and hence turns. The voltage drop in coils near the terminal is more than that of in other coils. The measured voltage drop across first coil from terminal of winding of four coils in series is varying 30 to 65. 8 % of the phase voltage against 25 % of the phase voltage. Comparison of wave forms for sinusoidal supply and inverter supply shows that distortions were very large with inverter supply which increases the losses and produces more stresses on the insulations. This paper highlights the factors which affects the magnitude of over voltage its propagation in motor winding.

40|$|Much {{focus has}} been {{recently}} placed on improving the energy efficiency of buildings through improved insulation in order to lower both energy consumption and carbon emissions worldwide. A new type of building insulation, smart insulation, shows great potential for lowering the heating and cooling energy usage of buildings by <b>turning</b> off the <b>insulation</b> whenever certain outside environmental conditions exist {{where it would be}} beneficial to remove the insulation. The specific type of smart insulation proposed is a thermal semiconductor that can be actuated to switch between a thermal conductor and a thermal insulator depending on the temperature gradient across the insulation. After careful examination of many different potential concepts thermal semiconductors, two main concepts involving contacting/non-contacting aluminum fins which allow or break a thermal conduction path and an inflatable honeycomb-like structure were chosen for fabrication and testing. Within these two main concepts, several different designs were developed and tested using an insulation test chamber constructed to reproduce the conditions the smart insulation prototypes would encounter in an real-world building setting. Once the experiment testing was completed, the different smart insulation devices were compared against each other and to a benchmark insulation test piece composed of conventional building insulation to evaluate their performance. Finally, a theoretical, finite element model was formulated for the testing of one of simplest smart insulation prototypes to better understand the results of the experimental testing and to examine other designs for smart insulation that were not experimentally tested...|$|R
