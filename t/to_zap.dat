25|$|Governor William Guy {{called in}} 500 {{troops from the}} North Dakota National Guard to quell the riot. Over 1,000 partiers were still in Zap when the guard {{arrived on the scene}} at 6:30 am, {{although}} just 200 of them were still awake. The guardsmen with fixed bayonets roused the hungover students. There was little resistance to the dispersal. This all took place in front of national media outlets that had gathered at Zap to document the occasion. In fact, the Zip <b>to</b> <b>Zap</b> was the lead item on the CBS Evening News that day. It was also covered by Pravda, the news outlet of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the Stars and Stripes of the United State Armed Forces. Damage from the riot was estimated to be greater than $25,000. These bills were ultimately paid by the student governments of North Dakota State University and the University of North Dakota.|$|E
500|$|The player fishes {{in pursuit}} of fame as a {{fisherman}} named Billy. The game mechanics are [...] "three tightly-woven minigames in one": casting the fishing line, catching fish, and shooting {{the fish in the}} air. The player casts the line and tilts the device to avoid the fish as the hook sinks. Upon hooking a fish, the hook ascends and the player tilts the device to catch as many fish as possible en route to the surface. Above water, the fish are launched into the air, and the player taps the screen to shoot the fish out of the sky to earn money before they fall into the water. The fish differ in characteristics including swim pattern and the number of shots required to cash in. The jellyfish shot detract from the total income. There are four stages, each with its own visual and audio theme and rare fish, and an endless mode where players can work towards the highest score. Earnings can be spent in a store towards persistent upgrades such as longer fishing line length, invulnerable drills, frivolous hats, bigger guns, chainsaw lures, a hair dryer and toaster (<b>to</b> <b>zap</b> inadvertent catches), fuel for the chainsaw, and a necktie for greater income. There is also a Fish-o-pedia in Billy's smartphone that gives gameplay hints and tracks stats such as fish caught, which is the progress for unlocking new levels. There are no in-app purchases.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe fate of {{developing}} CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes {{is determined by}} signals transduced through surface TCR complexes. Here, we report that cross-linking of TCR on CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes fails <b>to</b> activate <b>ZAP</b> 70 protein tyrosine kinase and fails to initiate downstream signaling events, unless the TCR are coaggregated with surface coreceptor molecules. TCR signaling in CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes is impaired {{because the number of}} available p 56 lck molecules is diminished by intrathymic CD 4 –Ia interactions that initially activate p 56 lck molecules, which are subsequently degraded. As a consequence of intrathymic CD 4 –Ia interactions, TCR ζ chains are initially phosphorylated <b>to</b> recruit <b>ZAP</b> 70 molecules, but the recruited ZAP 70 molecules are not subsequently phosphorylated, resulting in TCR complexes that are stably associated with inactive ZAP 70 molecules. Thus, intrathymic interactions that diminish p 56 lck regulate TCR signaling thresholds and affect TCR structure in developing CD 4 +CD 8 + thymocytes...|$|R
