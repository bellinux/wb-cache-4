5|$|Călinescu viewed such {{intellectual}} traits as {{shared by}} Creangă with his Wallachian counterpart Anton Pann, in turn linking both writers to the satirical component of Renaissance literature, and specifically to François Rabelais. Within local tradition, the literary historian saw a symbolic connection between Creangă {{and the early}} 18th century figure, Ion Neculce, one of Moldavia's leading chroniclers. While he made his own comparison between Creangă and Pann, Tudor Vianu concluded that the Moldavian writer was in fact superior, {{as well as being}} more relevant <b>to</b> <b>literature</b> than Petre Ispirescu, the prime collector of tales in 19th-century Wallachia. Also making use of the Rabelais analogy, literary chronicler Gabriela Ursachi found another analogy in local letters: Ion Budai-Deleanu, an early 19th-century representative of the Transylvanian School, whose style mixes erudite playfulness with popular tastes. These contextual traits, researchers assess, did not prevent Creangă's overall work from acquiring a universal aspect, particularly since various of his writings use narrative sequences common throughout world literature.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, Prescott {{abandoned}} {{the idea of}} a legal career because of the continued deterioration of his eyesight, and resolved to devote himself <b>to</b> <b>literature.</b> Although he initially studied a wide range of subjects, including Italian, French, English and Spanish literature, American history, classics and political philosophy, Prescott came to focus on Italian poetry. Among the works he studied during this period were such classics as Dante's Divine Comedy and Boccacio's Decameron. His first published works were two essays in the North American Review—both discussing Italian poetry. The first of these, published in 1824, was titled Italian Narrative Poetry, and became somewhat controversial after it was heavily criticized in an Italian review by Lorenzo Da Ponte, the librettist of Mozart's Don Giovanni. Prescott wrote a succinct reply to Da Ponte's fifty-page argument in the North American Review of July 1825. Da Ponte published the criticisms as an appendix to his translation of Dodley's Economy of Human life, which resulted in Prescott noticing them rather late.|$|E

5|$|Shrewsbury {{has also}} been home to {{contributors}} <b>to</b> <b>literature.</b> In {{the early years of}} the 18th century, the Irish dramatist George Farquhar resided in the town while acting as a recruiting officer for the Army. He drew on this experience in writing the comedy The Recruiting Officer. Prior to the First World War, the poet Wilfred Owen lived in the town. The romantic novelist Mary Webb is buried there. Michael Palin, the writer, actor and comedian attended Shrewsbury School. Other actors with associations with the town include Nick Hancock, presenter of They Think It's All Over, who, like Palin, was educated at Shrewsbury School. Nick Conway is another actor connected to the town, and was born in it in 1962. Actor Jason Bateman's mother was born in Shrewsbury. Comedian George Robey lived in the town, near Lord Hill's Column, before and during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Sociology of literature, film, and art is {{a subset}} of the {{sociology}} of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire, translated by Susan Emanuel as Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied <b>to</b> <b>literature</b> by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of two methods of instruction on secondary school students’ critical response <b>to</b> Prose <b>Literature</b> text. The study adopted a pretest, posttest, control group quasi experimental design. The {{participants in the study}} were 84 Senior Secondary II students of Literature-in-English purposively selected from four Schools in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of Edo State. Two intact classes were randomly assigned to each of the treatment and control groups. Three hypotheses were tested at 0. 05 alpha level. The instruments used were: Critical Response <b>to</b> Prose <b>Literature</b> Test (r =. 75), Questionnaire on Home Background of Students (r =. 82), and Critical Response <b>to</b> Prose <b>Literature</b> Test Marking Guide. Data obtained were subjected to Analysis of Covariance and graph. The results showed significant main effect of treatment on students’ critical response <b>to</b> Prose <b>Literature</b> (F (1, 77) = 44. 731; p <. 05). Students exposed to Engagement Strategies Method performed better than those exposed to the Conventional Method of instruction. Further, home background of students had no significant effect on students’ critical response <b>to</b> Prose <b>Literature</b> text (F (2, 77) = 4. 902; p <. 05). There was significant interaction effect of treatment and home background of students on students’ critical response <b>to</b> Prose <b>Literature</b> text (F (2, 77) = 3. 508; p <. 05). It was concluded that Engagement Strategies Method is effective in promoting students’ critical response <b>to</b> Prose <b>Literature</b> text. Teachers of Literature-in-English should employ Engagement Strategies Method in teaching Prose <b>Literature</b> <b>to</b> students in Senior Secondary Schools...|$|R

5|$|We {{shall not}} feel that the generalization, {{unqualified}} and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context {{to compete with the}} scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' has precisely the same status, and the same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair to the complexity of the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant <b>to</b> <b>literature.</b>|$|E
