However, Fëanor's son Amrod died at Losgar, having been accidentally burnt with the Telerin ships. The remaining Noldor saw the flames, and perceived that if they were to go to Middle-earth, they {{had no choice but to}} cross the Helcaraxë.

25|$|The modern {{convention}} {{of moving the}} Olympic flame via a relay system from Greece to the Olympic venue began in 1936 in Germany.

The Krupp armaments company produced the torches in wood and metal, inspired by an olive leaf. The Olympic flame was lit by a concave mirror in Olympia, Greece and transported over 3,187 kilometres by 3,331 runners in twelve days and eleven nights from Greece to Berlin. Leni Riefenstahl later staged the torch relay for the 1938 film Olympia. Adolf Hitler saw the link with the ancient Games as the perfect way to illustrate his belief that classical Greece was an Aryan forerunner of the modern German Reich.

A year earlier, in 1260, Niccolò and Maffeo Polo (the father and uncle of Marco Polo) were residing in Constantinople, then the capital of the Latin Empire. They foresaw a political change, liquidated their assets into jewels and moved away. Their decision proved wise, as Constantinople was recaptured in 1261 by Michael VIII Palaiologos, the ruler of the Empire of Nicaea, who promptly burned the Venetian quarter in the city and reestablished the Byzantine Empire. Captured Venetian citizens in Constantinople were blinded, while many of those who managed to escape perished aboard overloaded refugee ships fleeing to other Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea.|$|E

While Arthur goes to pieces in prison, Pauline is heavily embroiled in the storyline pertaining to his eventual release.

A critic for the Sunday Mirror commented, [...] "Pauline Fowler deserves a Golden Cardie Award for her performance in EastEnders. <b>The</b> <b>way</b> <b>which</b> she extracted a confession from Willy Roper over the money he stole {{was nothing short of}} brilliant." [...] Arthur is exonerated, but his joyful reunion with Pauline is brief, as an injury he sustained in prison leads to a brain haemorrhage and he dies shortly after his release.

500|$|The {{minimum flow}} through the {{pipeline}} is not as clearly defined as its maximum. Operating at lower flows will {{extend the life of}} the pipeline as well as increasing profit for its owners. The 2012 flow of 600,000 bbd is significantly less than what the pipeline was designed for. Low flowrates require that the oil move slower through the line, meaning that its temperature drops more than in high-flow situations. A freeze in the line would block a pig in the line, which would force a shutdown and repairs. A 2011 engineering report by Alyeska stated that, to avoid freezing, heaters would need to be installed at several pump stations. This report noted that these improvements could bring flow as low as 350,000 bbd, but it did not attempt to determine the absolute minimum. Other studies have suggested that the minimum is 70,000 100,000 bbd with the current pipeline. Alyeska could also replace the 48" [...] pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Fairbanks with a 20" [...] pipeline and use rail the rest of <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>which</b> would allow as little as 45,000 bbd.|$|E

500|$|Wish You Were Here {{is also a}} {{critique}} of the music business. [...] "Shine On" [...] crosses seamlessly into [...] "Welcome to the Machine", a song that begins with an opening door (described by Waters as a symbol of musical discovery and progress betrayed by a music industry more interested in greed and success) and ends with a party, the latter epitomising [...] "the lack of contact and real feelings between people". [...] Similarly, [...] "Have a Cigar" [...] scorns record industry [...] "fat-cats" [...] with the lyrics repeating a stream of cliches heard by rising new-comers in the industry, and including the question [...] "by <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>which</b> one's Pink?" [...] asked of the band on at least one occasion.

After few months of uncertainty and rumors of break-up went around among their fans, they all decided to remain together and to keep the band only as a studio project. They quickly signed licensing deals with two record labels to release The Habit of Fire in 2007. The album was received very well and was named CD of the Month by UK's music technology magazine Sound on Sound, as well as being nominated as The Best Avantgarde Metal Album in 2007 by Metal Storm. In 2007, Jeff leaked another cover tune, [...] "Redemption", that originally was planned as part of a Johnny Cash tribute album by Open Grave Records, a project that was ultimately shelved.
