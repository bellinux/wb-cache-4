5|$|Biblical Hebrew from {{after the}} Babylonian exile in 587BCE {{is known as}} 'Late Biblical Hebrew'. Late Biblical Hebrew shows Aramaic {{influence}} in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and <b>this</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> also evident in the later-developed Tiberian vocalization system.|$|E
5|$|Production {{processes}} for {{primary and secondary}} lead are similar. Some primary production plants now supplement their operations with scrap lead, and <b>this</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> likely to increase in the future. Given adequate techniques, secondary lead is indistinguishable from primary lead. Scrap lead from the building trade is usually fairly clean and is re-melted {{without the need for}} smelting, though refining is sometimes needed. Secondary lead production is therefore cheaper, in terms of energy requirements, than is primary production, often by 50% or more.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{intermediate}} in reactivity between fluorine and bromine, {{and is one}} of {{the most}} reactive elements. Chlorine is a weaker oxidising agent than fluorine but a stronger one than bromine or iodine. This can be seen from the standard electrode potentials of the X2/X− couples (F, +2.866V; Cl, +1.395V; Br, +1.087V; I, +0.615V; At, approximately +0.3V). However, <b>this</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> not shown in the bond energies because fluorine is singular due to its small size, low polarisability, and lack of low-lying d-orbitals available for bonding (which chlorine has). As another difference, chlorine has a significant chemistry in positive oxidation states while fluorine does not. Chlorination often leads to higher oxidation states than bromination or iodination but lower oxidation states to fluorination. Chlorine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Cl bonds.|$|E

5|$|Analysis {{indicates}} that Kuiper belt objects {{are composed of}} a mixture of rock {{and a variety of}} ices such as water, methane, and ammonia. The temperature of the belt is only about 50 K, so many compounds that would be gaseous closer to the Sun remain solid. The densities and rock–ice fractions are known for {{only a small number of}} objects for which the diameters and the masses have been determined. The diameter can be determined by imaging with a high-resolution telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope, by the timing of an occultation when an object passes in front of a star or, most commonly, by using the albedo of an object calculated from its infrared emissions. The masses are determined using the semi-major axes and periods of satellites, which are therefore known only for a few binary objects. The densities range from less than 0.4 to 2.6 g/cm3. The least dense objects are thought to be largely composed of ice and have significant porosity. The densest objects are likely composed of rock with a thin crust of ice. There is a trend of low densities for small objects and high densities for the largest objects. One possible explanation for <b>this</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> that ice was lost from the surface layers when differentiated objects collided to form the largest objects.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Showalter, {{writing in}} 1975, defended Starship Troopers, {{stating that the}} society {{depicted}} in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument {{is based on a}} literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, Starship Troopers being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that <b>this</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966). This period of Heinlein's writing has received more critical attention than any other, though he continued to write into the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In the gas phase, the {{alkaline}} earth metals do not usually form covalently bonded diatomic molecules like the alkali metals do, since such molecules {{would have the}} same number of electrons in the bonding and antibonding orbitals and would have very low dissociation energies. Thus, the M–M bonding in these molecules is predominantly through van der Waals forces. The metal–metal bond lengths in these M2 molecules increase down the group from Ca2 to Ubn2. On the other hand, their metal–metal bond-dissociation energies generally increase from Ca2 to Ba2 and then drop precipitously to Ubn2, which should be the most weakly bound of all the group 2 homodiatomic molecules. The cause of <b>this</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> the increasing participation of the p3/2 and d electrons as well as the relativistically contracted s orbital. From these M2 dissociation energies, the enthalpy of sublimation (ΔHsub) of unbinilium is predicted to be 150kJ·mol−1.|$|E

25|$|Other cases {{indicate}} increased tobacco dependency with heightened {{levels of}} financial security. Male physicians in Syria {{are likely to}} become nicotine dependent earlier in their careers, whereas female physicians tend to habitually smoke later on in their careers. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> likely to be due to delayed financial independence for women.|$|E
25|$|Women {{have better}} access to {{healthcare}} in the United States {{than they do in}} many other places in the world. In one population study conducted in Harlem, New York, 86% of women reported having privatized or publicly assisted health insurance, while only 74% of men reported having any health insurance. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> representative of the general population of the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Southeast Asian heroin entering into China, Southwest Asian heroin enters northwestern China from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. Chinese authorities state that Southwest Asian heroin (mainly originating from Afghanistan) represents {{as much as}} 20 percent of the heroin that enters the northwest Xinjiang. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> increasing, and is attributed to the continuing development of the infrastructure and economy in the western parts of China.|$|E

25|$|In aqueous media, the cation–π {{interaction}} {{is comparable to}} (and potentially stronger than) ammonium-carboxylate salt bridges. Computed values below show that as solvent polarity increases, {{the strength of the}} cation–π complex decreases less dramatically. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> can be rationalized by desolvation effects: salt bridge formation has a high desolvation penalty for both charged species whereas the cation–π complex would only pay a significant penalty for the cation.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the split}} {{with most of}} the Yorkshire and Lancashire clubs, rugby union {{remained}} more popular in the South and the Midlands than the North of England, although <b>this</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> now nowhere near as prevalent, with many teams in the North able to field four or five senior sides per week.

25|$|Income {{inequality}} in the United States has increased significantly since the 1970s after several decades of stability, meaning {{the share of}} the nation's income received by higher income households has increased. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> evident with income measured both before taxes (market income) as well as after taxes and transfer payments. Income inequality has fluctuated considerably since measurements began around 1915, moving in an arc between peaks in the 1920s and 2000s, with a 30-year period of relatively lower inequality between 1950–1980.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants {{differ on}} their {{political}} views; however, the Democratic Party {{is considered to}} be in a far stronger position among immigrants overall. Research shows that religious affiliation can also significantly impact both their social values and voting patterns of immigrants, as well as the broader American population. Hispanic evangelicals, for example, are more strongly conservative than non-Hispanic evangelicals. <b>This</b> <b>trend</b> <b>is</b> often similar for Hispanics or others strongly identifying with the Catholic Church, a religion that strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage.|$|E
