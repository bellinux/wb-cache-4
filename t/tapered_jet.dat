40|$|Multifrequency {{observations}} are presented of three BL Lac objects, {{including the first}} UV measurements of 0912 + 297 and 1219 + 285. An eight day optical flare was measured from 0422 = 004 in which a doubling in visual flux density was noted; other sources displayed smaller daily fluctuations. The 5 - 15 GHz radio flux from these three objects remained constant for two months, although the 15 - 20 GHz emission from 0912 + 297 varied slightly {{over a period of}} a month. Constraints which are provided by these and other Bl Lac data are discussed for inhomogeneous relativistically beamed jet models. It is concluded that a <b>tapered</b> <b>jet</b> model is in good agreement with the data for each source and that additional emission regions are not required...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, {{and radio}} {{monitoring}} data {{were used to}} test and constrain models of continuum emission from the BL Lacertae object PKS 2155 - 304. Intensively sampled ultraviolet and soft X-ray light curves showed a clear temporal correlation with the X-rays leading the ultraviolet by 2 - 3 hr. This lag {{was found to be}} significantly different from zero after an exhaustive comparison of four different techniques for measuring temporal correlations. Variations in the ultraviolet trough optical wave bands were also strongly correlated, with no measurable lag down to limiting timescales of approximately less than 1 - 2 hr. This strong correlation extends to the near-infrared, but the less intensive sampling precludes measurement of any lag beyomnd an upper limit of approximately less than 1 day. These lags and limits of the order of hours are much shorter than most rapid observed single-band variations. Because of the very sparse radio sampling, {{it was not possible to}} measure quantitatively the correlation and lag with shorter wavelengths, but the data do suggest that the radio may lag the optical/ultraviolet by approximately 1 week, with longer delays and weaker variations to longer radio wavelengths. The epoch-folding Q(exp 2) statistic was used to test for periodicity, and no evidence for strict or quasi-periodicity was found in any of the light curves. Because they lead the lower frequencies, the soft X-rays (approximately less than 1 keV) cannot arise from synchrotron self-Compton scattering. These results also rule out the accretion disk model, which predicts a measurable lag between ultraviolet/optical wavelength bands and a correlation between hardness and brightness, neither of which were seen. They are consistent with the entire radio through X-ray continuum arising from direct synchrotron emission from a relativistic jet. However, the <b>tapered</b> <b>jet</b> model, in which the X-ray emission is produced closer in, has problems explaining the magnitude of the ultraviolet/X-ray lag, because the X-ray-emitting electrons have very short lifetimes (t(sub 1 / 2) much less than 1 s). The result that the lag is much smaller than the variability timescale suggests instead that the radiation may be produced in a flattened region such as a shock front...|$|E
40|$|A {{three phase}} {{experimental}} study of mixing downstream of swirling and nonswirling confined coaxial jets was conducted to obtain data for the evaluation and improvement of turbulent transport models currently employed {{in a variety of}} computational procedures. The present effort was directed toward the acquisition of length scale and dissipation rate data that provide more accurate inlet boundary conditions for the computational procedures and a data base to evaluate the turbulent transport models in the near jet region where recirculation does not occur, and the acquisition of mass and momentum turbulent transport data for a nonswirling flow condition with a blunt inner jet inlet configuration rather than the <b>tapered</b> inner <b>jet</b> inlet. A measurement technique, generally used to obtain approximate integral length and microscales of turbulence and dissipation rates, was computerized. Results showed the dissipation rate varied by 2 1 / 2 orders of magnitude across the inlet plane, by 2 orders of magnitude 51 mm from the inlet plane, and by 1 order of magnitude at 102 mm from the inlet plane for a nonswirling flow test conditions...|$|R
5000|$|A {{sensitive}} flame is a {{gas flame}} which under suitable adjustment of pressure resonates readily with sounds or air vibrations in the vicinity. Noticed {{by both the}} American scientist John LeConte and the English physicist William Fletcher Barrett, they recorded the effect that a shrill note had upon a gas flame issuing from a <b>tapering</b> <b>jet.</b> The phenomenon {{caught the attention of}} the Irish physicist John Tyndall who gave a lecture on the process to the Royal Institution in January 1867. In 1857 Prof. John LeConte discovered that an ordinary naked gas-flame, from a fish-tail or bat-wing burner, becomes an indicator of sound by vibrating in unison with an external source, provided the pressure be such that the flame is just ready to flare. This can be easily shown by blowing a shrill whistle or bowing a tuning-fork of high pitch in the immediate neighborhood of the flame, which at once becomes forked (Fig. 3) into several long, vibrating tongues. The effect soon ceases if the pressure be gradually diminished. This result is due to the disturbance produced by sound-waves on the outflowing jet of gas at the nozzle. The high temperature of flame is therefore not necessary for the production of such co-vibration, but serves to make it more easily manifest. Nine years elapsed after Dr. Le Conte's discovery before the subject was taken up again and independently by Mr. W. F. Barrett, in London, who used small cylindrical jets, which were found to flare under similar conditions, and could be rendered far more sensitive. A [...] "pin-hole lava-tip" [...] may be fitted into the end of a metal tube and connected by means of India-rubber tubing to a cylinder of compressed illuminating gas. In connection with this, also, there should be a water manometer gauge for regulating the pressure of the outflowing gas. If the pin-hole is very smoothly cylindrical, the flame mounts up to the height of nearly eighteen inches (Fig. 4, x), with an apparent thickness scarcely more than that of the little finger, and burning quietly. When the pressure approaches ten inches, as indicated by the water-gauge, the flame flares, becoming much shorter and broader, like a little Indian club (Fig. 4, y), and producing a low roaring sound, due to the escape of unburned gas. Let the pressure now be diminished until this flaring barely ceases. The flame is now in its most sensitive condition. Sounds of low or even medium pitch have no effect upon it; but on blowing a shrill whistle, or rattling a bunch of keys anywhere within thirty or forty feet, it flares. Perhaps the most beautiful illustration of its sensitiveness is given by placing an open watch near the nozzle but not touching it; every tick causes a momentary sinking and spreading of the flame, so that the effect may be seen across an audience-room. If the audience applauds with clapping of hands, the flame shrinks in acknowledgment. [...] "Popular Science Monthly/Volume 36/November 1889" ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the effect of}} some cutting {{variables}} {{on the quality of}} the surface produced during abrasive water jet machining of aluminum has been investigated. The type of abrasive used was garnet of mesh size 80. The machining was done on the abrasive water jet machine WJ 4080. The cutting variables were stand-off distance of the nozzle from the work surface, work feed rate and jet pressure. The evaluating criteria of the surface produced were width of cut, taper of the cut slot and work surface roughness. It was found experimentally that in order to minimize the width of cut; the nozzle should be placed close to the work surface. Increase in jet pressure results in widening of the cut slot both at the top and the at exit of the jet from the work. However, the width of cut at the bottom (exit) was always found to be larger than that at the top (at a stand-off distance of 3 mm and the work feed rate of 15 mm min- 1). It was found that the taper of cut gradually reduces with increase in stand-off distance and was close to zero at the stand-off distance of 4 mm (at a jet pressure of 30 ksi and a work feed rate of 15 mm min- 1). The feed rate of the work should be kept within 40 mm min- 1 (at the jet pressure of 30 ksi and the stand-off distance of 3 mm), because a feed rate beyond 40 mm min- 1 results in sharp increase in <b>taper</b> angle. The <b>jet</b> pressure does not show significant influence on the taper angle within the range of work feed and the stand-off distance considered. Both stand-off distance and the work feed rate show strong influence on the roughness of the machined surface. It was concluded that stand-off distance should be kept within 3 mm (at a jet pressure of 30 ksi and a work feed rate of 15 mm min- 1) and the work feed rate should be kept within 30 mm min- 1 (at a jet pressure of 30 ksi and a stand-off distance of 3 mm) in order to have a good surface finish, since beyond those values of the parameters the roughness of the machined surface rises sharply. Increase in jet pressure shows positive effect in terms of smoothness of the machined surface. With increase in jet pressure, the surface roughness decreases (at a stand-off distance of 3 mm and work feed of 15 mm min- 1). This is due to fragmentation of the abrasive particles into smaller sizes at a higher pressure and due to the fact that smaller particles produce smoother surface. It was also found that within the jet pressure considered, the work surface is smoother near the top surface and gradually it becomes rougher at higher depths...|$|R
