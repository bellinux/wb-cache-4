40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, we {{developed}} an idea about the teaching of chemistry by determining the links between theory and the real world. The principles, concepts, and experimental procedures of chemistry were illustrated through an original approach based on useful substances obtained from plants. The starting point was substances that have always been obtained from trees and vegetables. The approach was implemented during many refresher courses for secondary school teachers of chemistry. The courses were divided into sections, each called "Plants and [...] . ", dedicated to colors, odors, tastes, medicines and drugs, fibers, soaps, and alcoholic beverages. Each section consisted of a <b>theoretical</b> <b>lesson</b> followed by a laboratory session...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundEach year new {{undergraduate}} {{courses are}} emerging in Mozambique, {{and with them}} {{the number of students}} has been increasing exponentially. In higher education institutions, particularly in the health sciences, knowledge retention becomes essential for learning and for efficient and effective training of capable health professionals. MethodologyThis is a prospective cohort study, conducted at the Lurio University, Mozambique. To evaluate the assimilation and retention of knowledge, a <b>theoretical</b> <b>lesson</b> was taught. The class time was 90 minutes divided into a theoretical stageand the other was a discussion stage (30 minutes) for clarification of doubts. Questionnaire was administered in the pretest, post-test and after six months. ResultsOf all students (n= 241), enrolled in the second semester of {{the first year of the}} course, 190 students did the pretest, 187 did the post-test and 183 students did the test after six months. Before the lecture none of the course managed to achieve the satisfactory percentage of 75 % of correct answers (p< 0, 001). Assimilation of knowledge in the post-test performance there has been a significant increase in knowledge, in all questions the students reached the recommended percentage as “satisfactory knowledge” (p< 0. 001). The post-test suggests that participants in this study had a significant capacity of memorization which is essential in the retention of knowledge. ConclusionIt can be concluded that the assimilative and retention capacity improve the student knowledge immediately after a <b>theoretical</b> <b>lesson</b> with addition audiovisual resources, and the acquired knowledge remains even though there is a deterioration with passage of the time...|$|E

40|$|In this article, I {{argue that}} Antonio Gramsci’s concept of passive {{revolution}} makes a foundational contribution to International Relations (IR), yet {{has been relatively}} under appreciated by the broader discipline. Within the Historical Sociology of International Relations, uneven and combined development has recently been postulated as a key trans-historical law that provides a social theory of the ‘international’. Drawing from, but moving beyond these debates, I will argue that passive revolution is a key conditioning factor of capitalist modernity. I will demonstrate how the concept of passive revolution is the element that explains {{the connection between the}} universal process of uneven development {{and the manner in which}} specific combinations occur within the capitalist era as geo-political pressures, in tandem with domestic social forces become internalised into geographically specific state forms. It therefore offers a corrective to the frequently aspatial view that is found in much of the literature in IR regarding uneven and combined development. Additionally, passive revolution provides a more politicised understanding of the present as well as an important <b>theoretical</b> <b>lesson</b> in relation to what needs to be done to affect alternative trajectories of development...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{as well as}} {{classical}} {{teaching aids}} greatly support and strengthen the teaching practice while encouraging students {{to take an active}} part in the learning activity within the classroom, thus contributing to a higher degree of mastering the subject matter. Integration of teaching aids in teaching vocational subjects not only enables effective and precise teaching, but it also allows the students to acquire their knowledge and practical skills. The theoretical part of this thesis presents an overview, description and comparison of various teaching materials suitable for teaching technical subjects, which are currently the most integrated teaching methods in vocational studies. In addition, the review of literature discusses the history of education and formation of teaching aids. The practical part, which has been conducted in a participating educational institution, elaborates on the questionnaire survey conducted amongst students who are currently in their 1 st, 2 nd and 3 rd year of the three-year program. The questionnaire is focused on obtaining relevant information from the students on how they evaluate the benefits and effectiveness of the teaching aids during the <b>theoretical</b> <b>lesson</b> which takes place prior to the practical training. The results of this thesis can be beneficial in terms of streamlining the theoretical teaching of vocational subjects that are important for students before the start of their practical training...|$|E
40|$|The fast {{development}} of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and their progressive implementation in the educational field have led to significant changes {{in teaching and learning}} methodologies and have made the use of new teaching resources in the classroom a top priority. ICT offer a huge amount of educational resources. In this context Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is available at all levels (from global to local) and presents different possibilities to be used as ICT teaching resources. However, the use of SDI in Spanish Compulsory Secondary Education (‘Educación Secundaria Obligatoria’ – ESO) requires teachers to be trained and acquainted with the features and applications of this technological tool. In order to provide the adequate teacher training, both theoretical and practical, three e-learning courses have been designed, developed and implemented for three different areas of Spanish ESO (Social Sciences, Sciences of Nature and Technology). In these courses we propose the use of SDI as ICT teaching resources. The courses present a <b>theoretical</b> <b>lesson</b> which includes: (a) an overview and the most important concepts in SDI and (b) methodological proposals which approach ESO curricula using SDI as a teaching resource. In this paper we present the implementation and evaluation stages, showing the results of the first edition of the courses in which teachers from several Latin American countries took part. These results have enabled us to obtain information about the opinion of secondary teachers regarding the possibility of using SDI to teach Social Sciences, Sciences of Nature and Technology curricul...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{calculated}} that, on average, 20 % {{of the population}} should be trained to provide first aid, if a significant reduction of mortality is to be achieved. However, wide dissemination {{of the principles of}} emergency care poses a series of difficulties. As a partial solution, we have designed a first aid training course for children aged 8 - 11 years in their last three courses at primary school. According to the Italian school system, classes in primary school are indicated as I through V, from start to ending. The course addresses three issues: the broken tooth, nose bleeding and paediatric basic life support (PBLS). The course is divided into 17 didactic modules: each module contains a theoretical lecture, a practical demonstration by the trainer and a session for the trainees to practice under super-vision. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the benefit of teaching emergency procedures including practical sessions for pupils in primary schools. Four hundred and sixty-nine children were enrolled: the evaluation consisted of a 13 question multiple-choice written test taken at the end of the theoretical session and a semi-structured test at one month. Two hundred and seventy-one children attended to the <b>theoretical</b> <b>lesson</b> only, without going through the practical session (Group A), while the remaining 189 children completed the practical training (Group B). The outcome of the evaluation demonstrates that older children (in their V school class) score better than those in their IV and III class (p < 0. 001). However, when comparing Group A and Group B in each class, the children that had also been exposed to the practical training (Group B) scored significantly better (V-B versus V-A p < 0. 001; IVB versus IVA p < 0. 001; IIIB versus IIIA p < 0. 01). In conclusion, this proposed method of teaching emergency first aid could be successful in training primary school children. The permanent integration of the subject into the core curriculum of primary schools, and extended to higher school levels, could help in disseminating the culture of emergency care in the general population.

40|$|This {{research}} uses a transactions costs {{approach to}} examine {{recent developments in}} the public sector organisational arrangements. It explores the extent to which transactions costs or other factors drive the institutional choices that legislators make about policy implementation. The area of application is the adoption of 'new public management' (NPM) reforms in Catalonia for the governance of the public health care sector in the period from the early 1980 s to the mid- 1990 s. The methodology used combines qualitative and quantitative approaches in the analysis of data from both primary and secondary sources. The primary sources used here include thirty-eight in-depth and semi-structured interviews with key informants, non-published internal reports from major organisations and an annual survey of all health providers carried out by the Department of Health and Social Security of the Catalan government. The secondary sources include official publications and relevant academic journals and books on the subject. The study analyses both the policy formulation process leading up to a particular institutional design {{and the nature of the}} further implementation process in the Catalan health sector. First, policy precedents are identified and the resources and interests of the policy elites analysed as a basis for understanding the output of the reform formulation in 1990. Second, the analysis shows how transactions costs considerations shaped the stances taken by legislators and influenced the final institutional design. Third, a number of subsequent implementation short-falls are traced to some efforts at minimising transactions costs which turned out to be incompatible with NPM postulates. The analysis shows that the impact of politics, that is, the repeated interactions among policy elites controlling complementary resources, shape the way in which transactions costs and other considerations are approached in both policy formulation and implementation processes. A central <b>theoretical</b> <b>lesson</b> drawn from this research is that although transactions costs are difficult to measure, they are useful heuristic tools for analysing the rationale driving decision-making processes on institutional design. However, both the theoretical definition of transactions costs and their actual impact on decision making are mediated by power relations, that is, by politics...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find out whether there is any {{difference}} to be found in the attention ability before and after physical activity. The method used in this study was made of an experimental design. The participants were chosen through a cluster sampling and thereafter divided into a control group and an experimental group. A total of 64 pupils from upper secondary school participated in the study, 25 of them in the experimental group and 39 of them in the control group. Since the measure was repeated, both in respect of time and the comparison between the groups, a mixed design was used. The attention ability was measured on both occasions with a revised 7 -series-test that measures vigilance and selective attention. On the first occasion the participants were supposed to subtract 7 from 1000 and on the second occasion to subtract 7 from 995. The more subtractions the participant had time for within the given five minute time range, the higher attention ability the participant were considered to have. The attention ability was for the experimental group measured before and after a gym lesson, while for the control group their attention ability was measured before and after a <b>theoretical</b> <b>lesson.</b> The results showed that there were a significant difference between the two test occasions, and there were also a significant difference in between the test groups. While both of the groups improved their results in the second test occasion, the experimental group performed better than the control group did on both test occasions. The results did not indicate any interactional effect, which means that the test score achieved by the individual test person on test 1 and 2 did not depend on whether the person was a member of the control group or the experimental group. On the second occasion, which was the test conducted after the physical activity, the experimental group improved their results slightly more than the control group did. However, the results did not improve as much for it to be considered a significant difference.
