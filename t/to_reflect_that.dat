5|$|Gabrielle Giffords was {{reported}} to be the target of the shootings. Some news organizations initially reported that she had been killed, but these statements were quickly revised <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that</b> she had survived with a gunshot wound to the head. Daniel Hernandez Jr., one of Giffords's interns, assisted her after she was wounded and is credited with saving her life.|$|E
5|$|Quantification of the {{proportion}} of barbarian-born troops in the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has undertaken the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of the}} sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that {{the proportion}} of barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise {{the proportion of}} barbarian officers would have increased over time <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that.</b> Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E

5|$|The {{authors and}} Barry Cunningham {{also decided to}} retitle the book Tunnels, <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that</b> it had been changed by some limited editing. With the {{announcement}} of the publication date, and press coverage in the UK, the price of the original self-published books jumped dramatically, with one copy selling for £950. Tunnels was released in the UK as a softcover on 2 July 2007, and in the United States as a hardcover on 10 December 2007, and as a paperback on 1 February 2009. In Canada, the book was released as a paperback on 7 July 2007, as a hardcover on 1 January 2008, and a mass market paperback on 1 February 2009. In the United States, Tunnels had an initial printing of 100,000 copies. In February and March 2008 it appeared on The New York Times Children's Chapter Books Best Seller List.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} goal of {{the neural}} network approach was to solve problems {{in the same way}} that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that</b> information.|$|E
25|$|The RASB is {{the only}} Campaign Service badge awarded post-World War II.

The novels' attitude toward war is shaped by Martin's experiences with the controversies of the Vietnam War. As Martin was against the Vietnam War, the books reflect some of his views on war and violence and their costs, though he endeavors to avoid using his characters as mouthpieces for his own personal diatribes.|$|E
25|$|As the BBS {{phenomenon}} grew, so did {{the popularity}} of special interest boards. Bulletin Board Systems could be found for almost every hobby and interest. Popular interests included politics, religion, music, dating, and alternative lifestyles. Many SysOps also adopted a theme in which they customized their entire BBS (welcome screens, prompts, menus, and so on) <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that</b> theme. Common themes were based on fantasy, or were intended to give the user the illusion of being somewhere else, such as in a sanatorium, wizard's castle, or on a pirate ship.|$|E
25|$|For the 2011 season, the car's {{splitter}} {{and nose}} configuration were redesigned: the splitter's braces were removed, and the splitter was made nonadjustable. The nose {{as a whole}} was given a cleaner, rounder look that resembled that of NASCAR's previous model (now dubbed the fourth-generation car) and manufacturers were given free rein to construct the lower grille area <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that</b> of their NASCAR models' production-car counterparts. In the past, all cars were required to run the same exact grille arrangement, allowing for very little, if any, real differentiation between them.|$|E

The name was changed to Palm Beach Community College in 1988. In 2010, it was changed to Palm Beach State College <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that</b> the school was offering four-year degrees.|$|E
25|$|He {{is thought}} to have left Germany during 1722. During the 1720s he lived mostly in Naples, {{dwelling}} there for six or seven years. In 1725 his serenata Antonio e Cleopatra, was performed at Naples; the principal roles were sung by Carlo Broschi, better known as Farinelli, and Vittoria Tesi. The success of this work not only earned Hasse many commissions from Naples's opera houses, but also, according to Johann Joachim Quantz, brought him into contact with Alessandro Scarlatti, who became his teacher and friend; Hasse also altered his style in several respects <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that</b> of Scarlatti.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to incorporate stochastic (random) behaviour into the system. Stochastic behaviour destroys {{information contained in}} the ensemble. While this is technically inaccurate (aside from hypothetical situations involving black holes, a system cannot in itself cause loss of information), the randomness is added <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that</b> information of interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the system, or to correlations between the system and environment. These correlations appear as chaotic or pseudorandom influences on the variables of interest. By replacing these correlations with randomness proper, the calculations can be made much easier.|$|E

25|$|Since its {{foundation}} in 1912, the international governing body for athletics {{has been the}} International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). It was initially known as the International Amateur Athletics Federation but changed later its name <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that</b> the sport had moved away from amateurism towards professionalism in the late 1970s. The IAAF has 215 member nations and territories, which are divided into six continental areas (or area associations). The six association areas are for Asia, Africa, Europe, Oceania, North America and South America. The sports within athletics do not have their own independent governing bodies at either international or continental level, instead, all fall under the athletics authorities.|$|E
25|$|While {{in prison}} he was {{transferred}} to the Bridgewater State Hospital. On March 22, 1984, he changed his name to Nathaniel Benjamin Levi Bar-Jonah. He gave several reasons for changing his name. Bar-Jonah told friends and relatives that he changed his name because he wanted to {{know what it was like}} to be discriminated against and persecuted as a Jew. During a later interview with Dr. Michael Stone for the television show Most Evil, he claimed he was Jewish and wanted his name <b>to</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>that.</b> Later in the same year, Superior Court Judge Walter E. Steele ruled that Massachusetts had failed to prove that Bar-Jonah was dangerous and he was released before moving to Great Falls, Montana. During this time, Bar-Jonah confided in his psychiatrists that he had a deep fascination and curiosity with the taste of human flesh, and had innumerable murderous fantasies.|$|E
