The make-up team <b>took</b> <b>four</b> hours to apply Angel's wing tattoo on Kravitz, and the visual effects team had to erase the tattoo in case the scene required Angel with the computer-generated wings. To depict flight, Kravitz stood on elevated platforms and was dangled on wires, at times from a helicopter to allow for varied camera angles.|$|E

5|$|Davidson was {{selected}} for the 1954–55 tour of the West Indies, where he injured his right ankle in a tour match against Jamaica and missed the First Test against the West Indies. Upon his recovery, he could not break into the XI and did not play {{in any of the}} Tests, which Australia won 3–0. He scored 70 runs at 35.00 and <b>took</b> <b>four</b> wickets at 51.75 in three first-class outings.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the second}} Test; after both teams' first innings were low-scoring, Peel, {{appearing}} at number six, batted for 150 {{minutes in the}} second innings to score 53 without hitting any fours. Stoddart's 173 set Australia a big target, and Peel <b>took</b> <b>four</b> for 77 to bowl England to a 94-run win. Australia won the third Test by 382 runs; Peel <b>took</b> <b>four</b> wickets in the game, but was dismissed in both innings without scoring. It is possible that around this time, Peel was threatened by Stoddart with expulsion from the tour owing to his drinking. Australia won the fourth Test to level the series at 2–2. In very favourable bowling conditions, Peel took three for 74 but Australia totalled 284. England were bowled out twice to give Australia an innings victory, and Peel suffered his second consecutive pair (i.e. failing to score in either innings). He was {{the first player to}} score four successive ducks in Test cricket, a succession of failures not repeated until 1936, and this remained the record number of successive ducks until 1985.|$|E

5|$|Willis {{continued}} to enjoy some form with the bat with 33* against Nottinghamshire in {{the interval between}} the fifth and final Tests, though he went wicketless. On 27 August, Australia and England met for the sixth Test at the Oval. The tourists reached 352 thanks to a century from Border, while Willis <b>took</b> <b>four</b> wickets and Botham six. A century from Boycott then defied Lillee's seven wicket haul to take England to 314, and in reply Hendrick and Botham <b>took</b> <b>four</b> wickets each to set their team a target of 383 runs to win while Willis went without a wicket in the second innings. With half-centuries from Gatting and Brearley, England reached 261 before the match ended as a draw. England were victorious in the series 3:1, and Botham's efforts led to it being unofficially referred to as 'Botham's Ashes'.|$|E
