WiMedia devices communicate during Superframe which is a commu-nication unit in WiMedia MAC. Each superframe which consist of 256 MASs {{is divided into two}} periods, beacon period and data period. In data period, devices communicate with each other using the received channel access information during the beacon period. Due to only 12 sμ <b>timing</b> <b>allowance</b> between beacon period and data period, the process of the MAS information management cannot be completed in time if entire process handle by software. Therefore, we propose a novel MAS information management method using hardware module. With our proposed method, a WiMedia device is satisfied with the processing time that is required in WiMedia MAC protocol...|$|E

A Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) is a commonly used circuit to de-skew any variations due to process, voltage, or temperature (PVT). While a DLL will effectively align an input reference clock to an outgoing data clock, the DLL will not adjust the reference duty cycle {{if it is}} non-ideal. For this purpose a Duty Cycle Corrector (DCC) {{can be used in}} tandem with the DLL. Through the combined use of a DLL and a DCC, a high-speed system can be provided with a clock that has been both de-skewed across PVT and has a good duty cycle. Three DCC designs are compared: the Half-Cycle Delay Line (HCDL), Open Loop (OL), and the Integrated Half-Cycle Delay Line (IHCDL). The HCDL DCC features a stable closed loop duty cycle detection and wide duty cycle range at the cost of larger layout area. The OL DCC features less stable open loop detection with the benefit of minimal forward path delay again at the cost of larger layout area. The IHCDL DCC is a hybrid design that, through the use of only a single delay line for both 0 ̊ and 180 ̊ phase generation, provides the advantages of the HCDL DCC with a substantial improvement to the required layout area. The design of a generic DLL and the IHCDL DCC are detailed in this thesis. The performance of the IHCDL is verified through simulation. Across a range of 3 - 10 ns the IHCDL DCC corrects duty cycle to within +/- 5 % of 50 %. The additional lock time and power consumption of the IHCDL DCC (compared to the DLL only) are evaluated. Finally, the jitter induced by the IHCDL DCC across PVT and voltage supply variations is evaluated. Suggestions are made for the improvement of duty cycle correction...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{tape was}} first used to record {{computer}} data in 1951 on the Eckert-Mauchly UNIVAC I. The UNISERVO drive recording medium was a thin metal strip of 0.5 in wide nickel-plated phosphor bronze. Recording density was 128 characters per inch (198 micrometre/character) on eight tracks at a linear speed of 100 in/s m/s, yielding a data rate of 12,800 characters per second. Of the eight tracks, six were data, one was a parity track, and one was a clock, or <b>timing</b> track. Making <b>allowance</b> for the empty space between tape blocks, the actual transfer rate was around 7,200 characters per second. A small reel of mylar tape provided separation from the metal tape and the read/write head.|$|R
5000|$|Intersection Capacity Utilization (ICU) {{method is}} a tool for {{measuring}} a roadway intersection's capacity. It is ideal for transportation planning applications such as roadway design, congestion management programs and traffic impact studies. It is not intended for traffic operations or signal timing design. ICU is also defined as [...] "the sum of the ratios of approach volume divided by approach capacity for each leg of intersection which controls overall traffic signal <b>timing</b> plus an <b>allowance</b> for clearance times." [...] The ICU tells how much reserve capacity is available or how much the intersection is overcapacity. The ICU does not predict delay, {{but it can be}} used to predict how often an intersection will experience congestion.|$|R

If the market for technology licenses is efficient, the timing of licensing is independent of whether the patent has already been granted, and productive efficiency considerations will determine license timing (which likely will be as early as possible after invention). In contrast, the need for disclosure of unprotected knowledge {{on the part of the}} inventor, asymmetric information between the licensor and potential licensees, or search costs may retard efficient technology transfer. In these cases, reductions in uncertainty surrounding the scope and extent of IP rights may facilitate trade in the market for ideas. Employing a dataset which combines information about cooperative licensing and the <b>timing</b> of patent <b>allowances</b> (the administrative event when patent rights are clarified), we find that pre-allowance licensing is quite common, occurring in about 27 % of our sample. Furthermore, the administrative resolution of uncertainty over patent rights significantly increases the hazard rate for achieving a cooperative licensing agreement, and this effec...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} the intellectual property (IP) system on the timing of cooperation/licensing by start-up technology entrepreneurs. If the market for technology licenses is efficient, the timing of licensing is independent of whether IP has already been granted. In contrast, the need to disclose complementary (yet unprotected) knowledge, asymmetric information or search costs may retard efficient technology transfer. In these cases, reductions in uncertainty surrounding the scope and extent of IP rights may facilitate trade in the market for ideas. We employ a data set combining information about cooperative licensing and the <b>timing</b> of patent <b>allowances</b> (the administrative event when patent rights are clarified). Although preallowance licensing does occur, the hazard rate for achieving a cooperative licensing agreement significantly increases after patent allowance. Moreover, {{the impact of the}} patent system depends on the strategic and institutional environment in which firms operate. Patent allowance plays a particularly important role for technologies with longer technology life cycles or that lack alternative appropriation mechanisms such as copyright, reputation, or brokers. The findings suggest that imperfections in the market for ideas may be important, and that formal IP rights may facilitate gains from technological trade. patents, licensing, commercialization, innovation, entrepreneurship...|$|R
