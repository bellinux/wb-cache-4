Using the gluon propagator that we previously calculated, we obtain small corrections to the quark propagator, which keeps a pole at the origin in the chiral phase...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a real-time USB 2 subsystem for the Quest operating system. Quest {{is designed for}} real-time embedded systems. Such systems need to interact with their environment using sensors and actuators. On many embedded platforms today there is support for basic serial, USB 2. 0 and 100 Mbps Ethernet. Of these, USB 2. 0 supports the highest throughput, while also supporting real-time communication. We show how the Quest USB 2. 0 sub-system improves upon some of the deficiencies in USB software stacks in systems such as Linux through experimental evaluation. We demonstrate that the Quest USB sub-system is capable of predictable bandwidth allocation and increased overall performance. By dynamically reordering transaction requests, Quest’s USB sub-system is able to avoid unnecessary admission control rejections. Additionally, {{we are able to}} provide real-time guarantees for asynchronous USB transactions such as bulk transfers, which are typically treated in a best-effort manner. Real-time guarantees for bulk transactions are necessary for any system interacting with devices that implement bulk endpoints such as in a real-time file system. The paper also introduces an algorithm for USB scheduling that accepts more requests and provides bulk <b>transfer</b> <b>guarantees,</b> for cases where Linux fails. I...|$|R
