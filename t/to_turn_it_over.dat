5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton and wool mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E

The work planned {{included}} {{the completion of}} the brickwork {{at the top of the}} tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> and place the windshaft into position.|$|E

25|$|As Supreme Court judge, Stuart {{found in}} favour of the Alberta {{government}} in a 1912 suit against the Royal Bank of Canada. In {{the aftermath of the}} Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal, the government had attempted to take control of money that had been raised from a bond issue in support of the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway, which had defaulted on its obligations. The Royal Bank, where the money was deposited, refused <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the government, which sued. Stuart found that the government was entitled to the money, but his ruling was overturned by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, a {{scientist}} at the Tower named Dr. Imran Zere (Roger Aaron Brown), who was attempting to develop a cure for the virus, is kidnapped by Rais, prompting Crane to attempt a rescue mission. Crane is also captured by Rais, who reveals that the file he stole contains proof that the GRE intends to weaponize the virus rather than develop a cure and releases the file to the public. Crane manages to escape before being executed, and, in the process, cuts off Rais' hand. Dr. Zere is killed in the rescue attempt, but manages to tell Crane that he had entrusted his research to Jade, who is tasked with delivering it to another scientist named Dr. Allen Camden (Dan Gilvezan). As Crane goes to look for Jade, he finds out that the Defence Ministry is planning to bomb Harran {{in an effort to}} completely eradicate the outbreak, claiming that there are no survivors left in the city. He manages to reactivate a radio tower and broadcasts a message to the outside world, thwarting the Ministry's plan. Jade is captured by Rais, who also steals Dr. Zere's research. Crane manages to rescue Jade and recover a part of Dr. Zere's research, but Jade admits that she has been bitten, and pleads with Crane to stop Rais. Jade then succumbs to the wound, forcing Crane to mercifully kill her, also by snapping her neck. After killing Rais' second-in-command, Tahir (Michael Benyaer) with his own machete, Crane delivers the tissue samples to Dr. Camden, who believes that he is very close to the cure, but needs the rest of Dr. Zere's data. Crane then finds out that Rais has cut a deal with the GRE, in which he will hand over Dr. Zere's research data to them in return for extraction from Harran. Crane then assaults Rais' headquarters (filled with infected) and battles him atop a skyscraper, just as a GRE helicopter shows up, eventually stabbing Rais in the neck and throwing him off the building. He narrowly recovers the research data and decides <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to Dr. Camden instead of the GRE, intending to stay in Harran to help the remaining survivors.|$|E

500|$|Restoration of the Everglades, however, briefly {{became a}} {{bipartisan}} cause in national politics. A controversial penny-a-pound (2 cent/kg) tax on sugar was proposed to fund {{some of the}} necessary changes {{to be made to}} help decrease phosphorus and make other improvements to water. State voters were asked to support the tax, and environmentalists paid $15million to encourage the issue. Sugar lobbyists responded with $24million in advertising to discourage it and succeeded; it became the most expensive ballot issue in state history. How restoration might be funded became a political battleground and seemed to stall without resolution. However, in the 1996 election year, Republican senator Bob Dole proposed that Congress give the State of Florida $200million to acquire land for the Everglades. Democratic Vice President Al Gore promised the federal government would purchase [...] of land in the EAA <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> for restoration.

50|$|Before {{performing}} the trick, the magician secretly notes the bottom card of the deck. Then, {{he puts the}} cards {{behind his back and}} turns the top card face up.

When the magician desires to stop, he will move the face up top card <b>to</b> the bottom (<b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over)</b> and leave the top card face down, and make one last announcement of the bottom card's value. All of the cards are now facing the same direction and there is nothing for the audience to find if the cards are examined.|$|R

2500|$|Brennan, however, {{found no}} {{provision}} in Section 1461 supporting {{the establishment of}} an administrative procedure to censor the mails. Brennan provided a lengthy analysis (including extensive quotations) of the section's legislative history.

The first construction was constitutionally infirm, Brennan argued. [...] The Post Office Department had not acted in accordance with the second construction. [...] Thus, either way, the Post Office Department's seizure of the magazines, its subsequent investigation of the advertisers, its discover of allegedly obscene materials at each advertiser's place of business, and additional outcomes of its investigation did not withstand constitutional or statutory scrutiny.|$|E
