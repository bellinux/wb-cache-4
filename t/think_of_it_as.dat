5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|Some poetry {{types are}} {{specific}} to particular cultures and genres and respond to characteristics of the language in which the poet writes. Readers accustomed to identifying poetry with Dante, Goethe, Mickiewicz and Rumi may <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> written in lines based on rhyme and regular meter; there are, however, traditions, such as Biblical poetry, that use other means to create rhythm and euphony. Much modern poetry reflects a critique of poetic tradition, playing with and testing, among other things, the principle of euphony itself, sometimes altogether forgoing rhyme or set rhythm. In today's increasingly globalized world, poets often adapt forms, styles and techniques from diverse cultures and languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept that}} would become Nier was first {{proposed}} following the release of Drakengard 2 and the reveal of seventh generation consoles. The original concept was for a third entry in the Drakengard series. It {{was intended to be}} for PlayStation 3 due to the lessening importance of the PlayStation 2, which Drakengard 2 had been made for. However, as the project evolved, the original ideas were reworked and the game eventually became a spin-off from the main series. Despite this, the game's director Yoko Taro continues to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the third Drakengard game. Including concept planning, the total development time lasted three years, with two years spent actually developing the game. It was initially a small-scale project, but during planning it grew into a full-fledged role-playing game. Development was handled by Cavia with help from Square Enix, who had previously provided development support for the Drakengard games. Square Enix had minimal input on Yoko's vision for the game's atmosphere and story, allowing him high creative control.|$|E

5000|$|However, Innocent {{has been}} lured into a romance with a modern-day Amadis Jocelyn, {{descendant}} of her [...] "Sieur Amadis"' brother.

25|$|If the hundreds-row {{does have}} a thousands-digit, then add to it the carry-digit from the {{previous}} row (if there is no carry-digit then <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a 0) and write the single-digit sum in the hundred-thousands-column under the second line.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{discovery}} of the quarks led to reinterpretation of the rho meson as a vector bound state of a quark and an antiquark, it is sometimes still useful to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the gauge boson of a hidden local symmetry.|$|E

25|$|This means, essentially, that {{substance}} is just whatever {{can be thought}} <b>of</b> without relating <b>it</b> to any other idea or thing. For example, if one <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> a particular object, one <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a kind <b>of</b> thing, e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a particular kind <b>of</b> thing (because <b>it</b> isn't a particular thing at all).|$|R
40|$|The Internet's {{next big}} success will occur when society <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a service {{rather than a}} technology. To make that success happen, we are facing a grand {{engineering}} challenge involving researchers, operators, and vendors. We {{need to focus on}} the ultimate consumer experience as we instrument, measure, model, predict, reengineer, and manage a ubiquitous digital communications infrastructure. It will be complex, dynamic, and more than our current operational theories and practice can handle...|$|R
25|$|I must, however, {{make clear}} what I mean by Judaism; I mean neither a race nor a people nor a {{recognised}} creed. I <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a {{tendency of the}} mind, as a psychological constitution which is a possibility for all mankind, but which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion only amongst the Jews. Antisemitism itself will confirm my point of view.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{language of}} the Inuit is a system of closely interrelated dialects that are not readily comprehensible {{from one end of}} the Inuit world to the other, and some people do not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a single language but rather as a group of languages. However, there are no clear criteria for breaking the Inuit language into specific member languages since it forms a dialect continuum. Each band of Inuit understands its neighbours, and most likely its neighbours' neighbours; but at some remove, comprehensibility drops to a very low level.|$|E
25|$|Gramsci {{stated that}} bourgeois {{cultural}} values {{were tied to}} folklore, popular culture and religion, and therefore much of his analysis of hegemonic culture is aimed at these. He was also impressed by the influence Roman Catholicism had and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between {{the religion of the}} learned and that of the less educated. Gramsci saw Marxism as a marriage of the purely intellectual critique of religion found in Renaissance humanism and the elements of the Reformation that had appealed to the masses. For Gramsci, Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people's spiritual needs, and to do so people would have to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an expression of their own experience.|$|E

5000|$|The piece {{begins in}} the key of C-sharp minor, then moves to D-flat major, and returns to C-sharp minor, {{concluding}} with a Picardy third. The composition opens with an almost Lisztian introduction, leading to a subject in octaves of pent-up energy. The key changes to D-flat major, with a chorale-like subject, interspersed with delicate falling arpeggios. Louis Kentner <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> [...] "a Wagnerian melody of astonishing beauty, recalling the sound of tubas, harps and all the apocalyptic orchestra of Valhalla." ...|$|R

Rara is worried that she may be pregnant after having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend. Yanti suffers from cervical cancer. Lili has been sexually abused by her husband, but <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> an indication <b>of</b> his love. Lastri is newly married and trying to get pregnant. Kartini herself has had bad experiences in her former relationships, making her afraid of commitment.|$|R
25|$|Between {{the first}} and second lines, the ten-thousands-column will contain either one or two digits: the hundreds-digit of the hundreds-column and (possibly) the thousands-digit of the tens-column. Find the sum of these digits (if the one in the tens-row is missing <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a 0), {{and if there is a}} carry-digit from the thousands-column (written in {{superscript}} under the second line in the ten-thousands-column) then add this carry-digit as well. If the resulting sum has one digit then write it down under the second line in the ten-thousands-column; if it has two digits then write the last digit down under the line in the ten-thousands-column, and carry the first digit over to the hundred-thousands-column, writing it as a superscript to the yet-unwritten hundred-thousands digit under the line. However, if the hundreds-row has no thousands-digit then do not write this carry-digit as a superscript, but in normal size, in the position of the hundred-thousands-digit under the second line, and the multiplication algorithm is over.|$|E
25|$|Elderspeak can in fact {{contribute}} to decreased comprehension, and can increase confusion. Early social scientists first identified elderspeak and estimated that 20% {{of the communication}} occurring in nursing homes is actually elderspeak (Caporael, 1981). Caretakers of nursing home residents must be particularly careful when using elderspeak. Although elderspeak {{has been shown to}} help older adults with dementia and Alzheimer’s in language comprehension, they are not immune to feeling disrespected when it is used. Resisting care is an ongoing problem with dementia patients, as well as violent behaviour, and residents of nursing homes are more likely to resist care when their nurse uses elderspeak. Care givers may assume that the elder prefers the nurturing of elderspeak but older adults <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> demeaning. Older adults in both institutional settings and those receiving home care services report that as many as 40% of their caregivers use speech they perceive as demeaning, and 75% of the interactions that elderly people have are with the staff of the nursing homes.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E
40|$|This paper treats of {{the complex}} {{relationship}} between life (in Jpn., “inochi”) and I (“watashi”) by examining the thought of Paul Ricoeur, especially his early book, The Voluntary and the Involuntary. In this book, Ricoeur seems to regard life only as “resolved problem” (e. g., blood circulation). But he also <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> “task to be resolved”. And, for life, the latter aspect is important. So, the life as Total (Transcendence), discussed in the last section, is not accepted directly because it sets us thinking {{that the problem of}} life is already resolved in the transcendental level...|$|R
50|$|The McGarveys soon {{experience}} strange things. Both Travis Potter {{and attorney}} Paul Youngblood hint that something unusual {{may have occurred}} just before Eduardo's death. All three McGarveys have similar recurring dreams of an entity offering promises of happiness if they would let it into their minds, but each senses the promises are false and vehemently refuses the offer. Heather <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the Giver. The Giver hypnotizes Toby through electronic devices and attempts to communicate with Jack through Toby. The family eventually reveals to one another the similarity of their dreams and different baffling events.|$|R
