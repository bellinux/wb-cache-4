This article reported {{a difference in}} average size between the third Interstitial Nucleus of the Anterior Hypothalamus (INAH3) in the brains of heterosexual men and homosexual men: INAH3 was {{more than twice as}} large in heterosexual men as in homosexual men. The INAH3 size of homosexual men was {{the same as that of}} women. LeVay wrote that [...] "This finding indicates that INAH is dimorphic with sexual orientation, at least in men, and suggests that sexual orientation has a biological substrate." [...] LeVay added, [...] "The existence of 'exceptions' in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>sample</b> (that is, presumed heterosexual men with small INAH 3 nuclei, and homosexual men with large ones), hints at the possibility that sexual orientation, although an important variable, may not be the sole determinant of INAH 3 size.

40|$|The {{portability}} of the Standard Shiftwork Index (SSI) and {{the impact}} of shiftwork was assessed on a sample of television production employees in Auckland, New Zealand. Sixty three respondents completed the SSI and reported a moderate impact of shiftwork on physical and psychological health and moderately high sleep disturbance. Social and domestic life yielded the greatest detrimental impact. Gender related coping strategies was the only significant difference within the sample. Chronic fatigue, somatic anxiety, general job satisfaction and disengagement were significantly related to intention to leave the organisation. Statistical analysis of effect size indicated equivalent levels of power in both the U.

Bulk nanocrystalline samples of these alloy was successfully prepared by mechanical alloying (MA) followed by cold compaction, sintering, and hot extrusion process.

30|$|The {{internal}} consistency of the DBVS was assessed using Cronbach α and Composite Reliability (CR). Cronbach α for the 19 items composing the scale was 0.829 and no significant improvements were found excluding any item. Following the indications of Fornell and Larcker (1981), the {{internal consistency}} of the scale was also examined using CR, which in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>sample</b> was 0.90. Finally, the item/domain discriminating power was assessed through the corrected item-total correlations. All the items were significantly (p[*]≤[*] 0.001) and positively related with the total score, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.20 and 0.52, although more than 2 / 3 of the items presented coefficients ≥ 0.40. These results strongly support the adequacy and reliability of the single-factor solution of the DBVS in <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>sample.</b>|$|E
