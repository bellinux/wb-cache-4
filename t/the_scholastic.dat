5|$|During the Early Middle Ages, Greek {{classical}} {{learning was}} all but lost to the West. However, contact with the Islamic world, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and expanded, soon led to a massive spate of Latin translations in the 12th century. Europeans were re-introduced to the works of Plato and Aristotle, {{as well as to}} Islamic thought. Christian thinkers of <b>the</b> <b>scholastic</b> school, in particular Peter Abelard (1079 – 1142) and Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274), combined Aristotelian classification with Plato's ideas of the goodness of God, and of all potential life forms being present in a perfect creation, to organize all inanimate, animate, and spiritual beings into a huge interconnected system: the scala naturae, or great chain of being.|$|E

5000|$|Questions remained, {{and again}} {{came to the}} fore when {{scientists}} such as Copernicus made discoveries which seemed to contradict scripture. The doctrine of [...] "double truth" [...] was revived by <b>the</b> <b>scholastics</b> under <b>the</b> rubric [...] "two truths". Thus, according to <b>the</b> <b>scholastics,</b> there was a lesser truth, that the Earth circled the Sun, as Copernicus said, and a greater truth, that when Joshua fought at Jericho it was the Sun, not the Earth, which stood still. <b>The</b> <b>scholastics</b> held that both [...] "truths" [...] were true in their own sphere.|$|R

Kilroy was one of four candidates to receive the endorsement of the Franklin County Democratic Party. On November 5, 1991, she placed behind incumbent Columbus School Board President, Sharlene Morgan, natural resources expert Robert Teater, past board member Bill Moss, which made her the fourth among the eighteen candidates and the final elected member.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Hepburn {{gained a}} place at Bryn Mawr College. She {{attended}} the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, who had studied there, and recalled disliking the experience. It {{was the first time}} she had been in school for several years, and she was self-conscious and uncomfortable with her classmates. She struggled with <b>the</b> <b>scholastic</b> demands of university, and once was suspended for smoking in her room. Hepburn was drawn to acting, but roles in college plays were conditional on good grades. Once her marks had improved, she began performing regularly. She performed the lead role in a production of The Woman in the Moon in her senior year, and the positive response it received cemented Hepburn's plans to pursue a theatrical career. She graduated with a degree in history and philosophy in June 1928.|$|E
5|$|The USAD {{requires}} {{a diversity of}} achievement within each team; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by GPA. The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. <b>The</b> <b>Scholastic</b> category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value {{regardless of whether it}} is from an advanced placement, honors, regular or remedial class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.|$|E

5|$|The {{format of}} the Super Quiz {{differs from that of}} the other subject areas. Added in 1969, it offers a {{culminating}} championship event. The Super Quiz consisted of a forty-question multiple choice test as well as a relay round until 2013. In 2013, the multiple-choice portion was eliminated and the relay portion expanded to include six of the objective subjects. Generally referred to as the Super Quiz Relay, it is the only event viewable by the general public. The relay starts with the Varsity students, followed by <b>the</b> <b>Scholastic</b> and the Honors students. Each group is given 10 or 15 questions, depending on the format decided by the state coordinator. These questions are read aloud to the audience and are printed or projected for the competitors. After the questions and answers are read, the students are allowed seven seconds to select the correct answer. The answer is checked on the spot by a judge and scores are immediately displayed to the audience.|$|E
5|$|When the Christian Alfonso VI of Castile retook the Kingdom of Toledo {{from the}} Moors in 1085, an Arabic {{translation}} of Aristotle's works, with commentaries by Avicenna and Averroes emerged into European medieval scholarship. Michael Scot translated much of Aristotle's biology into Latin, c. 1225, {{along with many}} of Averroes's commentaries. Albert of Cologne commented extensively on Aristotle, but added his own zoological observations and an encyclopedia of animals based on Thomas of Cantimpré. Later in the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas merged Aristotle's metaphysics with Christian theology. Whereas Albert had treated Aristotle's biology as science, writing that experiment was the only safe guide and joining in with the types of observation that Aristotle had made, Aquinas saw Aristotle purely as theory, and Aristotelian thought became associated with pointless scholasticism. <b>The</b> <b>scholastic</b> natural philosophy curriculum omitted most of Aristotle's biology, but included On the Soul.|$|E
