5|$|As a {{video game}} company with {{different}} production teams, Square had wished for its employees to efficiently share their know-how and technology even before the merger with its competitor Enix. The desire for a common development infrastructure and engine {{dates back to the}} 1997 role-playing video game Final Fantasy Tactics, which was created in the transitional period from 2D to 3D game production. Back then, the artists working on the game asked programmer Taku Murata for a fast way to check how their work would look in the final game. As the development was carried out on personal computers, the graphics were displayed on computer monitors. This looked very different from the PlayStation console's actual graphics displayed on a television screen. Initially, a faithful preview of the game's visuals was too time-consuming because all data had to be transferred from PC to console first. To evade this step, Murata created an instant preview tool. With this, he soon witnessed a boost in the artists' productivity and in the quality of their work. For 2000's Vagrant Story, the developers opted to reuse <b>this</b> <b>instant</b> preview tool rather than programming a new one from scratch. Murata and his colleagues added new functions to create a unified preview and cutscene tool tailored to the game's fully polygonal 3D graphics. With 2001's PlayOnline service, the company then made its first foray into introducing a common software for all its divisions.|$|E

Many {{of his early}} motorsport experiences were {{across the border in}} Italy, Switzerland having banned motor racing following the horrific accident at the 1955 24 Hours of Le Mans race. His first outings were in his own Austin-Healey Sprite, with which he took two podium finishes from only his first three races. <b>This</b> <b>instant</b> success encouraged Regazzoni to move up to a Mini Cooper for the 1964 club racing season.|$|E

25|$|Adding {{a second}} serial {{line to the}} device, and adding another {{latching}} region would allow for the latching of two input values at the two different outputs. To perform computation, a gate that takes as inputs both serial lines at their respective outputs is added. The gate is placed over a new latching region configured to process data only when both latching regions {{at the end of}} the serial lines hold the values of interest at the same instant. Figure 10 shows such an arrangement. If correctly configured, latching regions 5 and 6 will each hold input values of interest to latching region 7. At <b>this</b> <b>instant,</b> latching region 7 will let the values latched on regions 5 and 6 through the AND gate, thus the output could be configured to be the AND result of any two inputs (i.e. R and Q) by merely configuring the latching regions 5, 6 and 7.|$|E
25|$|Fekner's Warning Signs project {{focused on}} accentuating deteriorating {{conditions}} that dominated New York City {{and its environs}} in the 1970s. In 1976, Fekner began to create site-specific temporary ‘word-signs’ using hand-cut cardboard stencils and spray paint on a relentless crusade concerned with social and environmental issues. First seen on the industrial streets and highways of Queens, the East River bridges, {{and later in the}} South Bronx, his ‘messages’ were spray painted in areas that were in need of construction, demolition or reconstruction. By labeling the structures, Fekner's objective was {{to draw attention to the}} accumulated squalor by urging city officials, agencies and local communities to be more responsible and take action. His first stencil projects, Industrial Fossil, Urban Decay, Decay/Abandoned, Instant <b>This</b> <b>Instant</b> That, and The Remains of Industry were not intended to remain for long periods of time. The projects succeeded when the existing condition was removed or remedied. In 1979, Fekner began experimenting with video and audio, working with Fred Baca on Environmental Stencils 77–79, a grainy, grim black & white 8mm film/video that not only documents Fekner's stencil projects, but is also a bleak portrait of New York City in ruins.|$|E
500|$|Moments {{before being}} {{propelled}} off the table, the athlete undergoes a sudden increase in g-force {{due to the}} curvature – or 'compression' – of {{the bottom of the}} inrun. They then initiate a very powerful, explosive jump that requires great leg strength. At <b>this</b> <b>instant,</b> the skis are opened up into a horizontal [...] "V" [...] angle, the legs are straightened and spread apart, and the athlete adopts their own unique aerodynamic flying position in what is called the 'transition'; all of this taking place in only a tenth of a second. Timing is crucial and there is next to no margin for error at this phase: a jump that begins too early or late off the table {{can mean the difference between}} an excellent, average or poor effort. Each athlete has their own method of generating as much inrun speed as possible, depending on such intricacies as crouch depth, hip and knee angle, arm placement, or how far the torso is positioned over the knees. Body weight is also a factor (see power-to-weight ratio), which has led to some athletes' health becoming a concern over the years.|$|E

500|$|With {{the arrival}} of more {{favourable}} conditions, including {{the end of the}} war, a proposal for a canal to link the towns of Manchester, Bolton and Bury was mooted. [...] Matthew Fletcher had in 1789 been employed as a technical advisor and had surveyed the route of the proposed canal, but the first public notice came from Manchester on 4September 1790. [...] The initial proposal probably came from a group in Bolton, {{with the support of the}} Mersey and Irwell Navigation Company. [...] A meeting was [...] "intended to be holden at the House of Mr Shawe, the Bull's Head in Manchester aforesaid, on Monday, the twentieth day of <b>this</b> <b>instant,</b> September, at eleven o'clock in the forenoon", where [...] "Surveys, Plans, Levels, Estimates and Proposals" [...] would be presented. [...] A further meeting on 16September, held in Bolton, appointed a committee of six Boltonians chaired by Lord Grey de Wilton to attend at Manchester. [...] A series of resolutions at this meeting followed a discussion of the route, and authorised the necessary actions to bring the plan into fruition, which included the petitioning of Parliament for the required bill. [...] Hugh Henshall was asked to survey the proposed route of the canal.|$|E

2500|$|To re-shoot {{the first}} scene the rally car must be {{returned}} to outside the jewellery store. Without thinking, Dave sends Marty to do it again. A few moments later, vision from inside the rally car shows Marty's panicked state when he loses control of the car. At <b>this</b> <b>instant,</b> the rally car comes out onto the arena and begins driving wildly around the arena before taking the far left exit of the arena, labelled [...] "Parking". After some security camera vision shown on the big screen, the rally car appears on the rooftop before crashing into a building, flying over more rooftops before landing in a second building. At this point some rocket-style fireworks and a large fireball explode out of the building. Once the fire has cleared, the rally car drives {{out of the first}} floor door of one of the shops. To conclude the show, all of the Hell Drivers come out including the specially designed reverse car, which features a modified outer-shell.|$|E
2500|$|These {{inalienable}} possessions are a form {{of property}} that is inalienable, yet they can be exchanged. Property {{can be thought of}} as a bundle of rights – the right to use something, the right to collect rent from someone, the right to extract something (as in oil drilling), the right to hunt within a particular territory. [...] That ownership may be a bundle of rights held in common by groups of individuals or lineages. The property thus becomes impossible to separate from the group owning it. [...] "To give in <b>this</b> <b>instant</b> means to transfer without alienating, or to use the language of the West, to give means to cede the right of use without ceding actual ownership". [...] In other words, Weiner is contending that an economy built around the moral code of gift giving provides the giver rights over what he/she has given and in turn [...] "subsequently benefits from a series of advantages." [...] Thus, when one accepts a gift one also accepts that the giver now has rights over the receiver.|$|E
2500|$|Further to this {{evidence}} that the UK stock market is weak-form efficient, other studies of capital markets have pointed toward their being semi-strong-form efficient. [...] A study by Khan of the grain futures market indicated semi-strong form efficiency following the release of large trader position information (Khan, 1986). Studies by Firth (1976, 1979, and 1980) in the United Kingdom have compared the share prices existing after a takeover announcement with the bid offer. [...] Firth found that the share prices were fully and instantaneously adjusted to their correct levels, thus concluding that the UK stock market was semi-strong-form efficient. [...] However, the market's ability to efficiently respond to a short term, widely publicized event such as a takeover announcement does not necessarily prove market efficiency related to other more long term, amorphous factors. David Dreman has criticized the evidence provided by <b>this</b> <b>instant</b> [...] "efficient" [...] response, pointing out that an immediate response is not necessarily efficient, and that the long-term performance of the stock in response to certain movements are better indications.|$|E
