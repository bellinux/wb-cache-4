5|$|A {{debate on}} whether the {{military}} photos {{should or should not}} be released to the public has taken place. Those supporting the release argued that the photos should be considered public records, that the photos are necessary to complete <b>the</b> <b>journalistic</b> record, and that the photos would prove bin Laden's death and therefore prevent conspiracy theories that bin Laden is still alive. Those in opposition to a release of the photos expressed concern that the photos would inflame anti-American sentiment in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 Sienkiewicz wrote a {{historical}} novella, Niewola tatarska (Tartar Captivity). In late 1881 he became editor-in-chief {{of a new}} Warsaw newspaper, Słowo (The Word). This substantially improved his finances. The year 1882 saw him heavily engaged in {{the running of the}} newspaper, in which he published a number of columns and short stories. Soon, however, he lost interest in <b>the</b> <b>journalistic</b> aspect and decided to focus more on his literary work. He paid less and less attention to his post of editor-in-chief, resigning it in 1887 but remaining editor of the paper's literary section until 1892.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} the characteristics of <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog. To achieve this we have used the following questions: Which themes are included in <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog? How much text does <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog content? How often is multimediality incorporated in <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog? Which references occur in <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog? How many hyperlinks occur in <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog? How many of the hyperlinks is internal respective external? How often does <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog offers possibilities to interaction between the journalist and the reader? How often does interaction between the journalist and the reader occur? The theories we have used is both online publishing and Jan Schmidt’s analytical framework on blogs. Online publishing describes an important part in our paper, online journalism, which in turn describes three important definitions for this paper; hypertextuality, multimediality and interactivity. Jan Schmidt’s theory is central to understand the phenomena, and functions as a starting point in the analyze part. The method that we have used is a quantitative content analysis with a descriptive approach. This paper consists mostly of reliable sources, with only a few exceptions which we have constrained in our work. This means almost all sources are science material. The conclusion {{of this paper is}} as follows: The most appeared theme in <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog is athlete, followed by the official fact theme, and from then on the private life theme. The general conclusion about the first question is that the most common theme is the athlete theme. Text is counted as words, and <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog contents 177 words (related to its mean value). But note that the variation in words is quite large in different weblogs. Multimediality is almost exclusively excluded in the material, only pictures appear in some degree in the weblogs. The most common reference in <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog is <b>the</b> journalist’s personal experience and references of complete or parts of quotes and interviews. 227 hyperlinks appeared in <b>the</b> sport <b>journalistic</b> weblog, where 215 was internal and 12 external. Another conclusion in this paper is that there’s always an opportunity for interaction between the journalist and the reader. Indeed this possibility creates chances of interaction, but its importance is quite insignificant because it’s not being used. It is, however, more regular with interaction from the reader than the journalist. Therefore we can conclude that the interaction is more like a one-way communication, rather than dialogical...|$|R

5|$|As {{part of its}} {{emancipation}} agenda, Seara expressed {{sympathy for}} the Romanian Jews, and, {{in contrast to the}} antisemitism of more traditionalist reviews, accepted works sent in by Jewish writers. In October 1913, Seara obtained and published a confidential order which gave Romanian Land Forces officers a free hand to discriminate against Jewish recruits. In September 1914, it hosted <b>the</b> <b>journalistic</b> debut of Jewish avant-garde author Jacques G. Costin, who was, with Vinea, caretaker of the cultural pages. Like Arghezi and Vinea, Costin experimented with satirical genres, his sketch story techniques borrowed from 19th century classic Ion Luca Caragiale (Mateiu's father). Some of the poems published in Seara were authored by Arghezi's Jewish wife, Constanța Zissu. Seara was also receiving contributions from Grigore Goilav, the Armenian Romanian ethnographer and art historian.|$|E
5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into <b>the</b> <b>journalistic</b> field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

Although his poems went unpublished, his Iași-themed article A doua capitală ("The Second Capital"), signed Al. Vilara, was featured in an April 1916 issue. A follower of Arghezi, he was personally involved in raising awareness about Arghezi's unpublished verse, the Agate negre ("Black Diamonds") cycle.|$|E
