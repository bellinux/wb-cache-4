5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, {{so that it would}} also be activated automatically {{in the case of a}} catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E
5|$|Decorative sword {{mountings}} of the kazari-tachi type {{carried on}} the tradition of ancient straight Chinese style tachi and were used by nobles at court ceremonies until the Muromachi period. They contained a very narrow crude unsharpened blade. Two mountain-shaped metal fittings were provided <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> the straps; the scabbard between was covered by a (tube) fitting. The hilt was covered with ray skin and the scabbard typically decorated in maki-e or mother of pearl.|$|E
5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power {{by means of}} a {{submarine}} would at least be a blow to British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. The plan was to have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> an explosive to the shipâ€™s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water and make his getaway.|$|E

5|$|Goods-only trains were a rarity, and {{the usual}} {{practice}} was <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> goods wagons to any scheduled passenger services.

5|$|In {{order to}} build their vocabularies, infants must learn about the {{meanings}} that words carry. The mapping problem asks how infants correctly learn <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> words to referents.

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
5|$|Many viruses, {{including}} HIV {{which needs}} CD4 and CXCR4, need a receptor <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> to and enter into host cells.

5|$|The {{bacteria}} that cause urinary tract infections typically enter the bladder via the urethra. However, infection may also occur via the blood or lymph. It {{is believed that}} the bacteria are usually transmitted to the urethra from the bowel, with females at greater risk due to their anatomy. After gaining entry to the bladder, E. Coli are able <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> to the bladder wall and form a biofilm that resists the body's immune response.|$|E
5|$|The {{title of}} the album was drawn from the book Brooklyn Follies by Paul Auster, which Fanning had read during the recording. He stated {{the concept of the}} title related to escapism, and that he felt it an {{appropriate}} sentiment <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> to the music of the album.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{breakout}} crew in {{the weapons}} storage began {{to inspect the}} missiles, an early-arriving transport crew hooked up the pylons and towed them away without inspecting or ensuring that the missiles had been inspected or cleared for removal. The munitions control center failed to verify that the pylon had received proper clearance and inspection and approved the pylon for loading on the B-52 at 0925. After taking eight hours <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> the pylons, the aircraft with the missiles loaded then remained parked overnight at Minot for 15 hours without the special guard required for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Another {{alternative}} landing {{concept was}} the US Air Force's proposal <b>to</b> <b>attach</b> wings to the spacecraft. This proposal arose {{soon after the}} cancellation of the X-20 Dyna-Soar, and would have seen a Gemini spacecraft attached {{to a set of}} wings developed during the ASSET program. This would have been launched by a Titan II rocket, and would have been unable to maneuver in orbit. Another proposal saw the spacecraft being launched by a Titan IIIA or IIIC, using the Transtage for maneuvering. Once the mission was complete, the spacecraft would have been deorbited by means of five solid rocket motors.|$|E
