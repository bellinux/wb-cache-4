5|$|On 2 October 2014, Modi {{launched}} the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan ("Clean India") campaign. The stated {{goals of the}} campaign included eliminating open defecation and manual scavenging. The plan was to achieve these aims in five years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of <b>toilets</b> in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million <b>toilets</b> by 2019. The construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the <b>toilets</b> constructed for them.|$|E

5|$|The {{apartment}} {{on the second floor}} consisted of six residential rooms in addition to a foyer, kitchen, buffet, three servant's rooms, a bathroom, two <b>toilets,</b> and two storage rooms. There were also four wine cellars on the same level. The cellars belonged to the apartments on the upper levels. On the third floor, the apartment consisted of eight residential rooms, a foyer, a kitchen, dish washing room, two rooms for servants, a bathroom, and two <b>toilets.</b> This apartment was placed slightly lower than the level of Bankova Street, from the front entrance.|$|E

In recent times, automatic <b>toilet</b> bowl cleaners that clip onto the rim of the <b>toilet</b> and clean with every flush, have become more prevalent.|$|R
5|$|A £3million {{refurbishment}} of {{the crypt}} {{was completed in}} 2009 and was officially re-opened on 1 May that year by the Duke of Gloucester. The refurbishment included new east and west approaches, archive provision, rewiring and new lighting, catering facilities, a new chancel, new <b>toilets</b> and revamped exhibitions.|$|E
5|$|Astrid had two deckhouses: one at {{the stern}} with navigational {{equipment}} and maps, and another forward containing a bar. The lower deck had twelve 2-person cabins (of which three {{could be used as}} 3-person cabins) as well as showers, <b>toilets</b> and a galley.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had <b>toilets</b> upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs <b>toilets</b> were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E

50|$|Generally the <b>toilet</b> brush is {{used with}} <b>toilet</b> cleaner or bleach. The <b>toilet</b> brush {{can be used}} to clean the upper area of the <b>toilet,</b> around the bowl. However, it cannot be used to clean very far into the <b>toilet's</b> U-bend and should not be used to clean the <b>toilet</b> seat.|$|R
50|$|A <b>toilet</b> used to {{facilitate}} the separation of human waste products is called a urine diversion <b>toilet</b> or UDT. The bowl usually has two separate receptacles {{which may or may}} not be flushed with water. If flushed, the <b>toilet</b> is usually referred to as a urine-diversion flush <b>toilet</b> or UDFT. If not flushed, it is a dry <b>toilet</b> with either drying or composting for the feces. If the collected feces are dried, it is called a urine-diverting dry <b>toilet</b> or UDDT (also called urine-diversion dehydration <b>toilet).</b> If the collected feces are composted, it is called a urine-diverting composting <b>toilet.</b>|$|R
5|$|On {{the main}} street, {{opposite}} the church, is a recreation ground and playground, both {{maintained by the}} Meander Valley Council. The recreation ground was upgraded with <b>toilets</b> c.1949 that were replaced with newer ones in 1966. Playground equipment was installed in 1964.|$|E

25|$|A {{combination}} squat/Western <b>toilet</b> also exists, where a seat can be flipped {{down over}} a squat <b>toilet,</b> and the <b>toilet</b> {{can be used}} essentially {{the same way as}} the Western style. This hybrid seems to be common only in rural areas for the benefit of resident foreigners. Adapters that sit on top of the Japanese <b>toilet</b> to convert it to a functional sit-down <b>toilet</b> are much more common. There are also permanently installed extensions available to convert a squat <b>toilet</b> into a Western-style washlet. Inversely, there also exists a conversion platform available, that allows someone who prefers a squat <b>toilet</b> to raise himself up to the level of a Western <b>toilet.</b>|$|R
5|$|The tunnel is {{open for}} public access every day from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Two sets of public <b>toilets,</b> remodeled in 2016, are placed near two of the tunnel exits. Parts of the {{original}} signage remain, {{but they were not}} fully restored in the 2016 remodeling.|$|E
5|$|As Norway gained full {{independence}} in 1905, {{the national government}} determined to establish institutions consistent with the newly formed state's ambitions as a modern society. The first prime minister made it a priority to modernize the Royal Palace in Oslo, building among other things, some of the country's first water <b>toilets,</b> providing hot and cold water, and granting the Royal Family's wish of providing a common apartment for the king, queen, and their son.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{transfer}} to local authority control, {{much of the}} property on the estate {{was found to be}} in poor condition. In 1971 a report by the London Borough of Haringey found that half the properties on the estate were still lacking basic facilities such as baths, internal <b>toilets</b> and hot water. Houses were systematically extended to the rear to accommodate modern bathrooms.|$|E
50|$|The Sanisette {{contains}} a <b>toilet</b> behind {{a door that}} opens when a button is pressed or, {{in the case of}} a pay <b>toilet,</b> a coin inserted into a control panel on the outside of the <b>toilet.</b> A washbasin is provided as well (the style varies with the model of Sanisette). When a user enters the <b>toilet,</b> the door closes to provide privacy. After the user has finished using the <b>toilet,</b> they exit and the door closes again. A wash cycle then begins inside the <b>toilet,</b> and the <b>toilet</b> fixture itself is scrubbed and disinfected automatically. After about sixty seconds, the <b>toilet</b> is again ready for use.|$|R
50|$|The <b>toilet</b> seat {{functions}} as a comic standby for sight gags relating to <b>toilet</b> humor. The most common is someone staggering out of a <b>toilet</b> room after an explosion with a <b>toilet</b> seat around his neck. In the television show Dead Like Me, George Lass, the main character, is killed when a zero-G <b>toilet</b> seat from space station Mir re-enters the atmosphere.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} much debate among those who use <b>toilet</b> covers, {{regarding}} the orientation of said <b>toilet</b> seat cover. The proper way to place a cover on a <b>toilet</b> seat is to place the side with the flap {{toward the front of}} the <b>toilet,</b> with the flap going in the <b>toilet</b> to prevent [...] "splashing" [...] forward. Most public <b>toilet</b> seats are [...] "U" [...] shaped with an exposed rim in the front; the flap prevents particles and germs from collecting there.|$|R
5|$|Gardner Lake State Park {{is located}} off Connecticut Route 354 and {{features}} accessible parking, chemical <b>toilets</b> and a paved boat launch area. This state park designated area is primarily to provide boating and recreational {{access to the}} lake, though {{there is also a}} small beach for visitors to use. As of 2014, the park does not have a parking fee.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the State of Connecticut paid $550,000 {{to acquire}} the parcel of land which became Lake Gardner State Park. The land was {{acquired}} from the estate of Carmine Belardo and returned a beach to public service {{that had been a}} private resort for 60 years. The Town of Salem had sought {{to acquire the}} land, but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state. In 2008, the state spent about $1million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles. In 2012, the State of Connecticut was looking to institute parking fees for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and incidents in the park limits. Concerns included littering, unkempt <b>toilets,</b> swimmers going outside the designated zone and police arresting almost three times as many visitors from 2011. In response to the issues, patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers. The problems with trash problems and portable <b>toilets</b> ending up in the lake caused concerns for a local advocacy group, Friends of Gardner Lake, and the Gardner Lake Authority which has staff to attend the lake during peak hours.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 {{the cinema}} {{was awarded a}} £2.4 million National Lottery grant. The money {{will be used to}} restore the building, {{including}} the terrazzo foyer floor; build a cafe/bar so that customers no longer have to queue outside; install disabled <b>toilets</b> and improve accessibility; add a second screen in the basement; and make the cinema's archives available to the public.|$|E

50|$|A vault <b>toilet</b> is a non-flush <b>toilet</b> with {{a sealed}} {{container}} {{buried in the}} ground to receive the waste, {{all of which is}} contained underground until it is purposely removed by pumping. A vault <b>toilet</b> is distinguished from a pit <b>toilet</b> because the waste accumulates in the vault instead of seeping into the underlying soil. A vault <b>toilet</b> has similarities to a septic tank.|$|R
5|$|In {{the city}} of Rome, most people lived in {{multistory}} apartment buildings (insulae) that were often squalid firetraps. Public facilities—such as baths (thermae), <b>toilets</b> that were flushed with running water (latrinae), conveniently located basins or elaborate fountains (nymphea) delivering fresh water, and large-scale entertainments such as chariot races and gladiator combat—were aimed primarily at the common {{people who lived in}} the insulae. Similar facilities were constructed in cities throughout the Empire, and some of the best-preserved Roman structures are in Spain, southern France, and northern Africa.|$|E
5|$|In {{this highly}} sexualized {{environment}} a look or nod is frequently enough to express interest. In darkened {{areas of the}} establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, <b>toilets,</b> hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed. A shake of the head, or pushing away the other's hand, means that the attention is not welcomed.|$|E
5|$|Kings Cross {{came into}} the {{ownership}} of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) following the Railways Act 1921.

The lines through the Gas Works tunnels were remodelled between 1922 and 1924 and improved signalling {{made it easier to}} manage the increasing number of local trains.|$|E
50|$|A <b>toilet</b> seat is a hinged unit {{consisting}} of a round or oval open seat, and usually a lid, which is bolted onto {{the bowl of a}} <b>toilet</b> used in a sitting position (as opposed to a squat <b>toilet).</b> The seat can be either for a flush <b>toilet</b> or a dry <b>toilet.</b> A <b>toilet</b> seat consists of the seat itself, which may be contoured for the user to sit on, and the lid, which covers the <b>toilet</b> when it is not in use - the lid may be absent in some cases, particularly in public restrooms. When the lid is down, it {{can be used as a}} seat.|$|R
