50|$|The {{standard}} practice when flying with a gyro-stabilized compass (or heading indicator) is to read <b>the</b> magnetic <b>compass</b> only while in straight and level unaccelerated flight.

Thus the pilot will always ignore <b>the</b> magnetic <b>compass</b> while turning, but periodically check it in straight and level unaccelerated flight.|$|R

5|$|Prince of Wales fired unopposed {{until she}} began a port turn at 05:57, when Prinz Eugen took her under fire. After Hood {{exploded}} at 06:01, the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on Prince of Wales, with 15-inch, 8-inch and 5.9-inch guns. A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as Prince of Wales manoeuvred through {{the wreckage of}} Hood. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck the starboard side of <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> platform and killed {{the majority of the}} personnel there. The navigating officer was wounded, but Captain Leach was unhurt. Casualties were caused by the fragments from the shell's ballistic cap and the material it dislodged in its diagonal path through <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> platform. A 15-inch diving shell penetrated the ship's side below the armour belt amidships, failed to explode and came to rest in the wing compartments on the starboard side of the after boiler rooms. The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hues (1553 – 24 May 1632) was an English {{mathematician}} and geographer. He attended St. Mary Hall at Oxford, {{and graduated}} in 1578. Hues {{became interested in}} geography and mathematics, and studied navigation at a school set up by Walter Raleigh. During a trip to Newfoundland, he made observations which caused him to doubt the accepted published values for variations of <b>the</b> <b>compass.</b> Between 1586 and 1588, Hues travelled with Thomas Cavendish on a circumnavigation of the globe, performing astronomical observations and taking the latitudes of places they visited. Beginning in August 1591, Hues and Cavendish again set out on another circumnavigation of the globe. During the voyage, Hues made astronomical observations in the South Atlantic, and continued his observations of the variation of <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> at various latitudes and at the Equator. Cavendish died on the journey in 1592, and Hues returned to England the following year.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo {{wrote that}} it was {{preferable}} to use the twenty-four-point rose instead of the old eight compass cardinal points — and the former was recorded in use for navigation shortly after Shen's death. The preference of use for the twenty-four-point-rose compass may have arisen from Shen's finding of a more accurate astronomical meridian, determined by his measurement between the pole star and true north; however, it could also {{have been inspired by}} geomantic beliefs and practices. The book of the author Zhu Yu, the Pingzhou Table Talks published in 1119 (written from 1111 to 1117), was the first record of use of a compass for seafaring navigation. However, Zhu Yu's book recounts events back to 1086, when Shen Kuo was writing the Dream Pool Essays; this meant that in Shen's time <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> might have already been in navigational use. In any case, Shen Kuo's writing on magnetic compasses has proved invaluable for understanding China's earliest use of <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> for seafaring navigation.|$|E

5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) about <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased <b>the</b> <b>compass,</b> and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E

5|$|Later {{on in the}} Song dynasty <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> {{was used}} with {{maritime}} navigation. Several decades after the Wujing Zongyao was written, the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095 AD) wrote of the first truly magnetized compass needle in his book Dream Pool Essays (1088 AD). With a more efficient compass magnetized by lodestone, the thermoremanence compass fell out of use.

5|$|The {{sculptured}} mounds {{sometimes have}} elaborate and distinctive forms, {{such as those}} of <b>the</b> <b>compass</b> termite (Amitermes meridionalis and A. laurensis), which builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north–south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north-south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun.

40|$|International audienceIn single-streamer acquisition, {{the use of}} {{acoustic}} transducers {{to constrain}} the receiver positions is not possible, thus implying <b>the</b> use of <b>compass</b> birds to gather information on the streamer location. <b>The</b> <b>compasses</b> are, however, sensitive to the declination of the local magnetic field of the earth, and local fluctuations not accounted for can degrade the accuracy of reconstructed positions. In order to correct these small-scale fluctuations, we propose a simple deterministic method to calculate a spatial correction to apply to <b>the</b> <b>compasses</b> that enhances <b>the</b> positioning accuracy. <b>The</b> local <b>compass</b> declination is calculated after a first reconstruction on the whole survey area. This method was applied with success to navigation data from a 3 D survey offshore Japan, and the positioning accuracy was improved {{to the level of}} the DGPS accuracy...|$|R

40|$|While {{integrating}} their foraging and homing paths, desert ants, Cataglyphis fortis, {{depend on}} external compass cues.

In this study, we show that of <b>the</b> two visual <b>compass</b> systems, it is only <b>the</b> polarization <b>compass</b> that invariably outcompetes <b>the</b> wind <b>compass,</b> while <b>the</b> sun <b>compass</b> does so only under certain conditions. If the ants are experimentally deprived of their polarization compass system, but have access simultaneously to both their sun compass and their wind compass, they steer intermediate courses.
