40|$|The {{influence}} of dimethyl sulphoxide on hydrogen permeation and corrosion inhibition of mild steel in 1 N HCl and 1 N H 2 SO 4 {{has been studied}} using weight loss measurements, gasometric studies, galvanostatic polarisation studies and hydrogen permeation measurements. The performance of this compound as an inhibitor of corrosion is not very much encouraging.

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Gangers have regrouped, led by Ganger Cleaves. She realizes {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from the same terminal illness that the human Cleaves is suffering, and questions their need to kill their counterparts. The group is spurred on by Ganger Jennifer who insists the humans must die. As Ganger Cleaves orders her group to stay {{one step ahead of}} the humans, the Ganger Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another Ganger Jennifer to fool Rory that she is the human version. Ganger Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it will restore power when instead it disables the cooling system for <b>the</b> <b>acid,</b> making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into <b>the</b> <b>acid</b> storage chamber and traps them inside; crewman Jimmy is killed trying to stall <b>the</b> <b>acid</b> release.|$|E

30|$|In fact, the {{chemical}} reactions between <b>the</b> <b>acids</b> and minerals are very complex {{if they were}} to be considered independently in a model. This is because there is a large number of mineral components present in a sandstone matrix. Therefore, it is rare to represent these entire chemical reactions separately. Commonly, the reacting minerals in the sandstone were being classified and lumped into several groups according to their reactivity with <b>the</b> <b>acids.</b> In other words, minerals having the similar reaction rate while reacting with <b>the</b> <b>acids</b> would be lumped together.|$|R

5|$|The base is most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to <b>the</b> <b>acid</b> residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as <b>the</b> <b>acid</b> to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E
5|$|The triad of {{cytomegalovirus}} protease uses histidine as both <b>the</b> <b>acid</b> {{and base}} triad members. Removing <b>the</b> <b>acid</b> histidine results {{in only a}} 10-fold activity loss (compared to >10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.|$|E

50|$|The product species H3O+ (or D3O+) is a {{stronger}} <b>acid</b> than <b>the</b> solute <b>acid,</b> {{so that it}} dissociates more easily and its H-O (or D-O) bond is weaker than the H-A (or D-A) bond of <b>the</b> solute <b>acid.</b> <b>The</b> decrease in zero-point energy due to isotopic substitution is therefore less important in D3O+ than in DA so that KD < KH, and <b>the</b> deuterated <b>acid</b> in D2O is weaker than <b>the</b> non-deuterated <b>acid</b> in H2O. In many cases the difference of logarithmic constants pKD - pKH is about 0.6, so that the pD corresponding to 50% dissociation of <b>the</b> deuterated <b>acid</b> is about 0.6 units higher than the pH for 50% disssociation of <b>the</b> non-deuterated <b>acid.</b>|$|R
