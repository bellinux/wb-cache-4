5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome.

The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, Goebbels met the Czech actress Lída Baarová and by {{the winter}} of 1937 began an intense affair with her. Magda had a long {{conversation}} with Hitler about it on 15 August 1938.

Thereafter, Joseph and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September. The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together. Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be <b>taken</b> <b>of</b> himself with the reconciled couple in October.

5|$|In December 1817, Edwards, {{responding}} to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended to the legislature that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be <b>taken</b> <b>of</b> the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.|$|E

Tolkien writes that as Prince of Ithilien, Faramir's duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul (an old Gondorian city, once named Minas Ithil, that Sauron had <b>taken)</b> <b>of</b> evil remnants. Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role of Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor and ruling Gondor in his absence.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leofric, as his cathedral town was not a centre of {{historical}} writing, and he took little part in events outside his diocese.

5|$|Many early {{reports of}} the riots, {{starting}} with one from Reuters, used a picture purporting to show the previous day's riots.

The same picture was mistakenly used by other agencies; {{it was on the}} website of The Daily Telegraph, but was removed a day later.

5|$|News of the {{encounter}} was conveyed back to France, but the country was {{at this time in}} one of the most turbulent eras of the ongoing Revolution and little notice was <b>taken</b> <b>of</b> events in India. Historian William James notes that under normal political circumstances the action would have had more significant ramifications, while Edward Pelham Brenton claims that the French deliberately ignored the report out of fear of antagonising Britain. In Britain, the Admiralty approved of Cornwallis' actions, suggesting that the French were deliberately using the guise of trade to support Mysore against Britain. The action had no effect on the ongoing war in India, which was now centred on the inland city of Seringapatam. As British forces closed on the city in February 1792, the Tipu Sultan initiated peace talks which brought the war to an end in exchange for concessions to the Company and its Indian allies.|$|E
