50|$|Lenticular bedding {{occurs when}} sand ripples are {{deposited}} in mud {{in an isolated}} distribution pattern. Ripples in lenticular bedding are both laterally and horizontally discontinuous. Lenticular bedding can be subdivided according {{to whether or not}} they have connected lenses and the type of lenses they feature. Lenticular bedding with connected lenses can have up to 75% of discontinuous lenses. Lenticular bedding with single lenses has to have more than 75% discontinuous lenses. Lens thickness is based on a length to height ratio. <b>Thick</b> <b>lenses</b> have a length/height ratio that is <20 and flat lens ratio is >20. So the possible types of lenticular bedding are lenticular bedding with connected flat or <b>thick</b> <b>lenses</b> and lenticular bedding with single flat or <b>thick</b> <b>lenses.</b>|$|R
50|$|In optics, a thin lens is a lens with a {{thickness}} (distance {{along the}} optical axis {{between the two}} surfaces of the lens) that is negligible compared to the radii of curvature of the lens surfaces.

50|$|A Coddington {{magnifier}} is {{a magnifying}} glass consisting of a single very <b>thick</b> <b>lens</b> with a central deep groove diaphragm at the equator, thus limiting the rays to those close to the axis, which again minimizes spherical aberration. This allows for greater magnification than a conventional magnifying glass, typically 10× up to 20×. Most single lens magnifiers are limited to 5× or so before significant distortion occurs. The drawback is that the diaphragm groove reduces the area seen through the magnifier.|$|E
40|$|Distance {{and near}} visual acuity of 13 low astigmats were {{determined}} in a double-masked experiment {{through thick and thin}} (centre thickness 0. 12 mm and 0. 06 mm, respectively) spherical lathe-cut soft lenses. For each lens type, distance and near LogMAR VA and over-refraction were assessed with different logMAR VA charts. For 70 % of the subjects, the residual astigmatism was significantly lower than the refractive astigmatism with <b>thicker</b> <b>lenses.</b> No statistically significant differences in the distance and near logMAR VA was found between the two lens types using any of the charts used, though, in general, logMAR VA obtained through the <b>thicker</b> <b>lens</b> was better than logMAR VA through the thinner lens. The variabilities in distance and near logMAR VA between the two lens types increased with decreased contrast. The variabilities in distance logMAR VA were greater with Chinese charts than with English charts, and LogMAR VA with Chinese charts were significantly worse for both lens types. Based on the results of this study, we concluded that thicker spherical lathe-cut soft lenses provide better vision in low astigmats. The Snellen acuity test is inadequate for vision assessment of soft contact lens wearers. When a patient wearing thin soft contact lenses complains of poor vision in spite of 6 / 6 or 6 / 5 Snellen acuity, changing to <b>thicker</b> <b>lenses</b> may be considered.

50|$|At maximum {{lowering}} of the snow-line (in the Altai and the Sayan its depression gave about 1200 m in late pleistocene) {{some of the}} lakes (Chuya, Kuray, Uymon and others) began functioning in an under-ice regime because they never got free from ice for thousands of years. Such lakes turned into ice bodies of the “aufeis” type. They consisted of a <b>thick</b> <b>lens</b> of lake water, which was covered by lake ice, aufeis and glacier ice, and by snow-firn sequence, too. “Aufeis” ledoyoms became independent centers of glaciation with subradial ice outlets.

50|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of a}} lens is its principal focal length, or its inverse which is called the lens strength or lens power. The principal focal length of a lens {{is determined by the}} index of refraction of the glass, the radii of curvature of the surfaces, and the medium in which the lens resides. For a thin double convex lens, all parallel rays will be focused to a point referred to as the principal focal point. The distance from the lens to that point is the principal focal length of the lens. For a double concave lens where the rays are diverged, the principal focal length is the distance at which the back-projected rays would come together and it is given a negative sign. For a <b>thick</b> <b>lens</b> made from spherical surfaces, the focal distance will differ for different rays, and this change is called spherical aberration. The focal length for different wavelengths will also differ slightly, and this is called chromatic aberration.|$|E
5000|$|If, in {{the first}} place, {{monochromatic}} aberrations be neglected — in other words, the Gaussian theory be accepted — then every reproduction {{is determined by the}} positions of the focal planes, and the magnitude of the focal lengths, or if the focal lengths, as ordinarily happens, be equal, by three constants of reproduction. These constants are determined by the data of the system (radii, thicknesses, distances, indices, etc., of the lenses); therefore their dependence on the refractive index, and consequently on the color, are calculable. [...] The refractive indices for different wavelengths must be known for each kind of glass made use of. In this manner the conditions are maintained that any one constant of reproduction is equal for two different colors, i.e. this constant is achromatized. For example, it is possible, with one <b>thick</b> <b>lens</b> in air, to achromatize the position of a focal plane of the magnitude of the focal length. If all three constants of reproduction be achromatized, then the Gaussian image for all distances of objects is the same for the two colors, and the system is said to be in stable achromatism.|$|E

40|$|A procedure, for {{application}} in gravitational lensing using the geodesic deviation equation, is developed {{and used to}} determine the magnification of a source when the lens or deflector is modeled by a "thick" Weyl and "thick" Ricci tensor. This {{is referred to as the}} <b>Thick</b> <b>Lens</b> Model. These results are then compared with the, almost universally used, Thin Lens Model of the same deflector. We restrict ourselves to spherically symmetric lenses or, in the case of a thin lens, the projection of a spherically symmetric thin lens into the lens plane. Considering null rays that travel backward from the observer to the source, the null geodesic deviation equation is applied to neighboring rays as they pass through a region of space-time curvature in the vicinity of a lens. The <b>thick</b> <b>lens</b> model determines the magnification of a source for both transparent and opaque lenses. The null rays passing outside either the transparent or opaque lens are affected by the vacuum space-time curvature described by a Schwarzschild metric and transmitted via a component of the Weyl tensor with a finite extent. Rays passing through the transparent lens encounter the mass density of the lens, chosen to be uniform. Its influence on the null geodesics is determined by both the Weyl and Ricci tensor with the use of the Einstein equations. The curvature in the matter region is modeled by a constant Weyl and constant Ricci tensor. We apply the <b>thick</b> <b>lens</b> model to several theoretical cases. For most rays outside the matter region, the <b>thick</b> <b>lens</b> model shows no significant difference in magnification from that of the thin lens model; however large differences often appear for rays near the Einstein radius, both in the magnification and in the size of the Einstein radius. A small but potentially measurable discrepancy between the models arises in microlensing of a star. Larger discrepancies are found for rays traversing the interior of a transparent lens. This case could be used to model a galactic cluster...|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} {{anterior}} segment morphology evaluated using ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) {{in patients with}} clinical pseudoexfoliation syndrome (XFS) in one eye and no clinical XFS in the fellow eye. METHODS: Thirty patients with unilateral XFS {{were included in the}} study. All patients underwent evaluation of their anterior segment using UBM with and without dilatation with 1 % cyclopentolate. The anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), anterior chamber angle (ACA), ciliary body thickness (CBT), scleral thickness (ST), trabeculae -ciliary processes distance (T-CPD), and iris-ciliary processes distance (I-CPD) were measured using UBM scans.
