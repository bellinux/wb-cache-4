But we do prove it a posteriori, i.e., from {{the things that have}} been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from the production of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a separated intellect which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.|$|E
25|$|In {{internal}} politics, Magnus {{carried out}} a great effort to modernise the law-code, which gave him his epithet law-mender. These were adopted at <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> <b>in</b> the years 1274 (Landslov) and 1276 (Byloven). In 1274 he promulgated the new national law, a unified code of laws {{to apply for the}} whole country, including the Faroe Islands and Shetland. This replaced the different regional laws which had existed before. It was supplemented by a new municipal law (a law for the cities) in 1276, and a slightly modified version was also drawn up for Iceland. A unified code of laws for a whole country was at this time something quite new, which had until then only been introduced in Sicily and Castile. His code introduced the concept that crime is an offense against the state rather than against the individual and thus narrowed the possibilities of personal vengeance. It increased the formal power of the king, making the throne the source of justice. The municipal law gave the cities increased freedom from rural control. A specific section fixed the law of succession to the throne, in accordance with the arrangements laid down by King Håkon Håkonsson in 1260.|$|E

Based on this principle, the Supreme Court of India subsequently formulated a two-stage test {{to determine}} if a classification made by a law was constitutional. The relevant stages were (1) whether the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia; and (2) whether the differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question.|$|E

She stated, [...] "I have a macabre sense of humor. A lot of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the movie that are horrifying are funny to me." [...] Feeling that [...] "comedy films and horror films are kind of similar" [...] due to being films where you can significantly gauge intense reactions from the audience, Cody stated, [...] "They're laughing, they're screaming, it's not a passive experience. So, I actually think comedy and horror are kind of similar in that way." ...|$|E

During {{a series of meetings}} early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign en masse, and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, [...] "I meant to make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of what we were doing, which was the reason we put <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros says of this moment: So to me {{it began}} there, and that's when I {{intentionally}} started writing about all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> my culture that were different from them—the poems that are these city voices—the first part of Wicked Wicked Ways—and the stories in House on Mango Street. I think it's ironic {{that at the moment}} when I was practically leaving an institution of learning, I began realizing in which ways institutions had failed me. Drawing on Mexican and Southwestern popular culture and conversations in the city streets, Cisneros wrote to convey the lives of people she identified with. Literary critic Jacqueline Doyle has described Cisneros's passion for hearing the personal stories that people tell and her commitment to expressing the voices of marginalized people through her work, such as the [...] "thousands of silent women" [...] whose struggles are portrayed in The House on Mango Street.|$|E

500|$|In the {{literature}} concerning artificial intelligence, Searle's essay has been {{second only to}} Turing's in the volume of debate it has generated. [...] Searle himself was vague about what extra ingredients {{it would take to}} make a machine conscious: all he proposed was that what was needed was [...] "causal powers" [...] of the sort that the brain has and that computers lack. But other thinkers sympathetic to his basic argument have suggested that the necessary (though perhaps still not sufficient) extra conditions may include the ability to pass not just the verbal version of the Turing test, but the robotic version, which requires grounding the robot's words in the robot's sensorimotor capacity to categorize and interact with <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> the world that its words are about, Turing-indistinguishably from a real person. Turing-scale robotics is an empirical branch of research on embodied cognition and situated cognition.|$|E

500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures {{off the wall and}} picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches <b>the</b> <b>Things</b> <b>in</b> a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, [...] "What would you do if your mother asked you?" ...|$|E

40|$|In 1797, {{subsequent}} to Jacobi’s (1787) and Schulze’s (1792) objections against Kantian criticism, Fichte intends to “save” critical philosophy by evacuating <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> itself of theoretical discourse. By doing this, Fichte {{sets out to}} develop a coherent – and definitive – version of critical philosophy, which amounts to a radicalised account of transcendental idealism. Yet, two years later (1799), Kant publicly dismisses Fichte’s project, refusing to characterise it as “critical. ” What Fichte’s Wissenschaftslehre is missing, is precisely a foundation grounded on a “real object”. As we shall see, it is the status of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> itself which is highly problematic. This paper intends to show that Kantian criticism can coherently claim, thanks to a specific use of philosophical analogy, that <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> itself transcendentally grounds phenomena...|$|R

500|$|Every {{aspect of}} the film was {{constantly}} analyzed, with storylines, jokes, and characters regularly being rewritten. Although most animated films do not make extensive changes to the film during active production due to budget restrictions, The Simpsons Movie crew continued to edit their film into 2007, with some edits taking place as late as May, {{two months before the}} film was released. James L. Brooks noted, [...] "70 percent of <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>in</b> —based on where we were eight weeks ago—are no longer in the movie." [...] Groening said that enough material for two more movies was cut. Various new characters were created, and then cut because they did not contribute enough. Originally Marge was the character who had the prophetic vision in church. The writers however considered this to be too dark and it was changed to Grampa. The role of Lisa's love interest Colin was frequently revised. He was previously named Dexter and Adrien, and his appearance was completely altered. One idea was to have Milhouse act as Lisa's love interest, but the writers realized [...] "the audience was not as familiar with [...] long-standing crush on [...] as [...] thought". A car chase in which Homer throws flaming mummies out of a truck at the EPA was replaced with [...] "more emotional and realistic" [...] scenes at the motel and carnival that allowed for a change of pace.|$|E
