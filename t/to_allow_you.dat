500|$|A {{message from}} the IRA Army Council was issued calling for [...] "the British {{establishment}} to seize the opportunity and to take the steps needed for ending its futile and costly war in Ireland. We again emphasise that they should pursue the path of peace or resign themselves to the path of war". The IRA also attempted to apply indirect pressure to the British government with a statement sent to non-United States foreign-owned businesses in the City, warning that [...] "no one should be misled into underestimating the IRA's intention to mount future planned attacks into the political and financial heart of the British state ... In the context of present political realities, further attacks on the City of London and elsewhere are inevitable. This we feel we are bound to convey to you directly, <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> to make fully informed decisions".|$|E
500|$|John Doyle of The Globe and Mail {{called the}} pilot [...] "splendidly made". However, Doyle {{considered}} the instance of Torv stripping to a bikini [...] "indulgent", and questioned {{the wisdom of}} making [...] "her body an object of scrutiny" [...] in the first episode. Matthew Gilbert of Boston Globe wrote that [...] "after the electrifying start, Fringe unfolds as an uneven, unwieldy piece of work that provides very few chills and thrills". LA Weeklys Robert Abele found Fringe is [...] "a smorgasbord of a show, but one a little too synthetically engineered <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> the chance to discover what it is". John Leonard of New York was skeptical of the premise and storyline, but found Torv [...] "wonderfully played" [...] her character. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com felt the plot was too over-the-top, and described Abrams as [...] "the ultimate boyish idiot-savant imaginator... He can't exercise a little self-restraint".|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} {{members of the group}} attended the Escuela Elemental and the Escuela Secundaria of the University of Puerto Rico, an institution noted for its progressive and experimental teaching approaches. Vocalist/bassist Willy Rodriguez commented, [...] "It is a school in which you are allowed to decide a few things on your own, you have free time between classes [...] you can do your own things, {{and there is a lot}} of musical culture in the school. It tends <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> to explore your artistic interests... There was always an air of liberation, of thinking on your own. I think that influenced a lot in what we do today musically and ideologically." [...] Group members Boris Bilbraut, Willy Rodríguez, Eliut González, Juan Costa, and Ivan Gutiérres began jamming together in 1996, bonding over a shared interest in reggae music, particularly Bob Marley. [...] These rehearsal sessions took place in El Hoyo, a neighborhood in the San Juan metropolitan area.|$|E

500|$|In the Americas, Native American {{nations were}} {{severely}} damaged by European settlers, specifically {{because of the}} Europeans' advanced military technology. Favreau compared the film to the historical confrontation [...] "in the frustration of not having the technology <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>you</b> to prevail. It's always the low-tech culture that feels powerless when faced with an enemy that has technology on their side." [...] In the film, the cowboys are the low-tech culture, and the aliens with advanced technology possess the belief of Manifest Destiny. Favreau also said of the premise, [...] "It allows the cowboys and Native Americans to come together, which would be impossible had there not been a greater common enemy. It sets the Western {{up in a very}} classic way and then turns it on its ear." [...] When the aliens appear, the film becomes a road movie in which the main characters try to track the aliens, team up with different groups, and ultimately confront the aliens. Favreau compared the gathering to The Magnificent Seven in facing seemingly insurmountable odds in their confrontation.|$|E
2500|$|Kyle Orland of Ars Technica {{noted that}} the various ways of {{achieving}} a high score gave the game an aspect similar to puzzle games. Garrett Martin of the Boston Herald give high marks for the game's cutscenes and stated they were [...] "good enough to warrant a Cartoon Network TV show."

We refuse to be party to these wars and we repudiate any inference {{that they are being}} waged in our name or for our welfare..." [...] It indicates as inspiration [...] "...Israeli reservists who, at great personal risk, declare 'there IS a limit' and refuse to serve in the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza", the abolitionists, and [...] "those who defied the Vietnam war" [...] and concludes, [...] "we will resist the machinery of war and repression and rally others {{to do everything possible to}} stop it." ...|$|E
