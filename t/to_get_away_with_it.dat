At that time, the Middle East accounted for 80–90 percent of Western Europe's oil supply. If Nasser were seen <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> then other Middle East countries might be encouraged to nationalise their oil. The invasion, he contended at the time, and again in a 1967 interview, was aimed at maintaining the sanctity of international agreements and at preventing future unilateral denunciation of treaties. Eden was energetic during the crisis in using the media, including the BBC, to incite public opinion to support his views of the need to overthrow Nasser. In September 1956 a plan was drawn up to reduce the flow of water in the Nile by using dams in an attempt to damage Nasser's position. However, the plan was abandoned because it would take months to implement, and due to fears that it could affect other countries such as Uganda and Kenya.|$|E
500|$|With {{over twenty}} years of {{parliamentary}} majorities, Liberal ministers did as they wished {{with little regard for}} the opposition parties. The Mackenzie King and St. Laurent governments laid the groundwork for the welfare state, a development initially opposed by many Tories. C.D. Howe, considered one of the leading forces of the St. Laurent government, told his Tory opponents when they alleged that the Liberals would abolish tariffs if the people would let them, [...] "Who would stop us?... Don't take yourselves too seriously. If we wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> who would stop us?" ...|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s saw {{an era of}} {{prosperity}} in Canada; in most years there was a government surplus. In 1951, the Government introduced an old age pension for Canadians to receive {{from the age of}} 70. With little unemployment and thus a surplus in the unemployment insurance fund, coverage was extended to seasonal workers, such as fishermen. St. Laurent's supervision of his ministers was minimal at the start of his tenure, and decreased as the years passed. With the Opposition few in numbers, ministers did as they wanted, and when Howe was accused by British Columbia Tory MP Howard Green in 1951 of being willing to end tariffs if the people would let him, Howe replied, [...] "Who would stop us?

500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film a four-out-of-five rating {{and called it}} a madcap comedy which dared to [...] "push the {{envelope}} in its own way": [...] "Dostana is a winner all the way. In terms of content, it might just {{prove to be a}} trendsetter." [...] The Times of India also rated it four out of five: [...] "It introduces the most outrageous scenes in popular Hindi cinema and manages <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> because it's all done with an infectious zest and effervescence that keeps the ribs tickling." [...] Pratim D. Gupta of The Telegraph rated the film 7.2 out of 10, writing that Dostana [...] "can make you laugh out loud and also strike an emotional chord." [...] Raam Tarat of Future Movies rated the film 3.5 out of 5, praising its performances ("The lead actors share a great chemistry, are easy on the eye and oh so charming that they, along with beautiful Miami make for a visual treat") and calling it [...] "a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music." [...] For Hindustan Times, film critic Khalid Mohamed gave Dostana a three-out-of-five rating: [...] "Good taste, pop colour Miami locations, high-end costumes, make-up styling and the A-grade Dharma Productions values add up to a zingy entertainer".|$|E
500|$|To mark Chrissie's {{departure}} from the show, BBC Three aired a special episode of EastEnders Revealed on 22 September 2005. Entitled [...] "Chrissie Watts: Victim or Villain?" [...] the episode featured comments from Oberman, Grantham (Den), Dean (Sharon), Medcalf (Sam), Beckett (Jake), and Windsor (Peggy) profiling Chrissie and exploring the nuanced nature of the character. [...] "A lot of viewers, and myself," [...] Oberman later remarked, [...] "really wanted Chrissie <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> especially as Den was such a monster. But soap and film noir {{have a lot in}} common – the bad girls have to be punished." [...] However, critics considered Chrissie to be a [...] "three-dimensional soap bitch", rather than a flat pantomime figure. Despite having killed her father, Chrissie highly valued her friendship with Sharon, declaring at one point: [...] "my friendship with you is the only good thing to come out of my relationship with Den, and I mean that!" [...] Oberman characterised Chrissie as [...] "part victim part villain", declaring [...] "I think of her as a villain with a heart". She felt that, although [...] "no excuse" [...] for murder, Chrissie was driven to what she did: [...] "She's not a cold blooded murderer, it was all done in a fit of pique", and that [...] "these characters are made, not born." [...] Chrissie was haunted by the alcoholic fate of Den's first wife, which she vowed at Angie's grave to avoid. But in spite of her efforts, and indeed because of them, she failed, as she came to recognise: [...] "You know it's funny; when Den used to talk about Ange he used to describe her as this weak sad, cow. And I used to think 'not like me, oh no, not like me'. Who's having the last laugh now, Ange?" ...|$|E

60|$|His {{first impulse}} {{had been to}} take to the woods, {{carrying}} a couple of muskets and a store of provisions sufficient for a day or two, and to hunt the Peruvian down. In this case each would be ignorant of the other’s position and movements, and neither would have any advantage over the other; but, on the other hand, while he was hunting Jacopo, the latter might be putting a sufficient store of melons and perhaps the carcase of a pig on board the boat, and making off with it. The gold was there, and the assassin would be ready to run any risk <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> He would doubtless prefer to silence the only voice that could give evidence against him, but he would know that the chance of Stephen’s ever making his escape by himself would be so small that it might be disregarded. Stephen thought that, at any rate, the risk of the Peruvian’s attempting to set sail that day was small. He would be suffering intense pain from the wound, and would probably be incapable of making any great exertion; but most of all he trusted to Jacopo’s thirst for vengeance to keep him for a while on the island. Eager as he might be to sail away with the gold, he might well postpone his departure for a few days, until he had avenged himself for the wound that had been inflicted on him.|$|E
