5|$|Phocas's rule lacked {{legitimacy}} and quickly {{came to be}} resented by the populace and the elites of the Byzantine Empire. What prestige he had further eroded when the Persian shah Khosrau II (r. 590–628) declared war, and when the Byzantine forces began to suffer their first defeats. According to a later tradition, Priscus {{sent a letter to}} the Exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, urging him to revolt. This is probably a later invention, but if true, it would indicate the level of dissent even within Constantinople. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> in 608 Africa rose in revolt, and the Exarch's son, Heraclius the Younger, was dispatched against Constantinople at the head of a fleet. Unopposed by Phocas's forces, he landed at the suburb of Hebdomon on October 3 and marched to the capital, where pro-Heraclian riots had broken out. At this juncture, Priscus pretended to be ill, and withdrew to his mansion at the Boraïdou quarter, where he assembled the excubitores and his own retainers (bucellarii), thus depriving Phocas of his main source of armed support. He is also recorded by John of Nikiu to have safeguarded the women of Heraclius's family from retribution by Phocas.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, if a {{statement}} is being offered for its truth—meaning that its relevance {{depends upon the}} jury believing {{the substance of the}} statement—then it is being offered to prove <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> asserted therein. If {{a statement}} is relevant for any other purpose other than proving <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> asserted therein, then the statement will not be considered hearsay under the Federal Rules of Evidence.|$|E
25|$|In this example, simple logic tells {{that there}} is a difference: while the first {{statement}} may be true, it does not assert anything about <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> stated. The witness may have told the officer that the truck was blue, but that {{may not have been the}} truth; he might have been mistaken or lying.|$|E
25|$|Sun Lutang {{states in}} his {{autobiography}} that the legendary fight between Guo Yunshen and Dong Hai Chuan never happened. The book states that <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> is that Guo Yunshen actually fought one of his older xingyi brothers and lost. Sun Lutang was a student of both Guo Yunshen and Cheng Tinghua so this stance on the subject {{seems to be one}} of the most accurate.|$|E

40|$|An {{inductive}} {{logic is}} a system for reasoning that derives conclusions which are plausible or credible, but are nonetheless not certain. Thus, inductive logic goes beyond the more familiar systems of deductive logic, in which <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> premises requires <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conclusions.

25|$|At the end {{of season}} one, the demon Tony tells Sam that he {{believes}} Sam's parents were paid by the Devil to carry his (the Devil's) baby, though Sam's mother denied this, and the Devil admits that he would probably not answer Sam honestly if asked about it. Later, the Devil indicates that Sam is his son, although the father who raised Sam, Mr. Oliver, tells Sam that the deal with the Devil will not allow him to tell Sam <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> All other characters who know about the claim assume that Sam, though kindhearted, is indeed the Devil's son.|$|E
25|$|The {{discipline}} of surgery {{was put on}} a sound, scientific footing during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe. An important figure in this regard was the English surgical scientist, John Hunter, generally regarded {{as the father of}} modern scientific surgery. He brought an empirical and experimental approach to the science and was renowned around Europe for the quality of his research and his written works. Hunter reconstructed surgical knowledge from scratch; refusing to rely on the testimonies of others, he conducted his own surgical experiments to determine <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> To aid comparative analysis, he built up a collection of over 13,000 specimens of separate organ systems, from the simplest plants and animals to humans.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though both}} Junker Ove and Hilda suspect {{that they are}} in the wrong place in their lives as the story begins, they are not able to act on their own initiative. The dream gives Hilda an inkling of this other life, and the dream by the hill gives Junker Ove an idea about the ideal woman, but it is the {{crucifix}} and the golden goblet, two Christian symbols, which reveal <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> Christianity is to be thanked for the restoration of harmony. Junker Ove gets his Hilda, and the promise of gold persuades Sir Mogens to be united with Birthe who, in a modern interpretation, represents the young woman with the unruly disposition unable to conform to society's norms. She is handed over - troll for gold - to Sir Mogens in order to continue her life somewhere else completely.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{recommended}} Kiggell as {{his successor}} and thought {{the appointment of}} William Robertson “a tremendous gamble”, writing “my heart sinks when I think what it all may mean to the College & this house”. He may have felt that Robertson’s lack of private means did not suit him for a position which required entertaining. Robertson visited Camberley with Lord Kitchener (28 July 1910), who criticised Wilson; {{this may have been}} one of the causes of the poor relations between Wilson and Kitchener in August 1914. Edmonds later told a story of how Wilson had, perhaps as a joke or wanting to draw attention to Robertson’s shortage of money, left a bill for £250 for furniture and improvements to the Commandant’s residence, and that Wilson’s predecessor Rawlinson, when approached by Robertson for advice, had been amused and had commented that many of these improvements had been made by his own wife or by previous Commandants. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> relations between Wilson and Robertson deteriorated thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Whitlam remains well {{remembered for}} the {{circumstances}} of his dismissal. It is a legacy he did little to efface; he wrote a 1979 book, <b>The</b> <b>Truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Matter</b> (the title is a play on that of Kerr's 1978 memoir, Matters for Judgment) and devoted part of his subsequent book, Abiding Interests, to {{the circumstances of}} his removal. According to journalist and author Paul Kelly, who penned two books on the crisis, Whitlam [...] "achieved a paradoxical triumph: the shadow of the dismissal has obscured the sins of his government".|$|E
500|$|John Kerr died in 1991. He and Whitlam never reconciled; indeed, Whitlam always saw his {{dismissal}} {{from office}} as a [...] "constitutional coup d'état". Whitlam and Fraser put aside their differences and became friends during the 1980s, though they never discussed the events of 1975. The two subsequently campaigned together {{in support of the}} 1999 Australian republic referendum. In March 2010, Fraser visited Whitlam at his Sydney office while on a book tour to promote his memoirs. Whitlam accepted an autographed copy of the book and presented Fraser with a copy of his 1979 book about the dismissal, <b>The</b> <b>Truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Matter.</b>|$|E

500|$|One {{exception}} {{established at}} the founding is if the witness is [...] "unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination." [...] Another such exception is [...] "forfeiture by wrongdoing," [...] i.e. where the defendant intends to obtain and obtains {{the absence of the}} witness by wrongdoing. Still another exception is [...] "the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> asserted." [...] Another possible exception is for dying declarations, i.e. statements made by a speaker on the brink of death while aware {{that he or she is}} dying.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{idealization}} of the [...] {{as presented}} in the film. In all but one case, the dead are either young or already made-up, such that [...] "the viewer can easily tolerate these images on the screen". The one corpse {{that had not been}} found for several days is never shown on screen. No bodies show the gaunt figure of one who has died after a long illness, or the cuts and bruises of an accident victim. Japanologist Mark R. Mullins writes that the gratitude shown in Departures would probably not have occurred in real life; according to Coffinman, there [...] "is nothing lower on the social scale than the mortician, and <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> is that [...] fear the coffinman and the cremator just as much as death and the corpse".|$|E
500|$|For the PlayStation version, IGN's David Zdyrko cited that [...] "Many of {{the games}} are quite enjoyable, but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> is that it never quite matches {{the thrill of the}} real thing" [...] and criticized on how [...] "the visuals are very bland on the whole. It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel {{of one of the most}} successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E

2500|$|Another event {{damaging}} to the administration's case was a letter authored by Chief Justice Hughes to Senator Burton Wheeler, which directly contradicted Roosevelt's claim of an overworked Supreme Court turning down over 85 percent of certiorari petitions {{in an attempt to}} keep up with their docket.

2500|$|The Federal Rules of Evidence (See Article VIII) {{provide a}} general {{definition}} of hearsay as a [...] "statement, other than one {{made by the}} declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> asserted". Subject to two classes of [...] "exemptions", this definition classifies a statement as hearsay if the statement meets two requirements: (1) the statement must be extrajudicial (i.e. not made by this witness in this proceeding). (2) The statement must be offered to prove {{the truth of what}} the statement asserts if anything.|$|E
