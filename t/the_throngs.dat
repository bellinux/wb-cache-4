Admirer and renowned journalist Stephen O'Malley (Spencer Tracy) returns from Europe to write a biography of the great man. Among <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> covering the funeral, he finds his old friends and fellow reporters, Jane Harding (Audrey Christie) and Freddie Ridges (Stephen McNally).

5|$|Prokofiev {{died at the}} age of 61 on 5 March 1953, {{the same}} day as Joseph Stalin. He had lived near Red Square, and for three days <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> {{gathered}} to mourn Stalin, making it impossible to carry Prokofiev's body out for the funeral service at the headquarters of the Soviet Composers' Union. He is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. He was an atheist.|$|E
5|$|The {{morning after}} her death, while Evita's body was being {{moved to the}} Ministry of Labour Building, eight people were crushed to death in <b>the</b> <b>throngs.</b> In the {{following}} 24 hours, over 2000 people were treated in city hospitals for injuries sustained {{in the rush to}} be near Evita as her body was being transported, and thousands more would be treated on the spot. For the following two weeks, lines would stretch for many city blocks with mourners waiting hours to see Evita's body lie at the Ministry of Labour.|$|E

25|$|The {{sport of}} rowing became a popular sport in central Pennsylvania, and in 1888 a National Association of Amateur Oarsmen Championship {{was held on}} the Lake Augusta. Rowers {{traveled}} {{from as far away}} as Canada and the Midwest to compete, and reportedly, thousands of spectators lined the banks of the river. The number of spectators was so great, the railroad companies rerouted trains to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of people.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Elbe {{regularly}} {{presented as}} a woman, attending various festivities and entertaining guests in her house. One {{of the things she}} liked to do was disappear into the streets of Paris in <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of revelers during the Carnival, wearing her modeling fashions. Elbe was sometimes introduced by Gottlieb as her own sister when she was dressed in female attire. Only her closest friends knew once she had transitioned.|$|E
25|$|On June 17, 2009, the Coliseum was the {{terminus}} for the Los Angeles Lakers 2009 NBA Championship victory parade. A {{crowd of}} over 90,000 attended the festivities, {{in addition to}} <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of supporters who lined the 2-mile parade route. The Coliseum peristyle was redesigned in purple and gold regalia to commemorate the team and the Lakers' court was transported from Staples Center to the Coliseum field to act as the stage. Past parades had ended at Staples Center, but due to the newly constructed L.A. Live complex, space was limited around the arena.|$|E

[...] The continued noises strengthened the resolve of the ghost's supporters, while the press's ceaseless reporting of the case continued. [...] Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford, announced that with the Duke of York, Lady Northumberland, Lady Mary Coke and Lord Hertford, he was to visit Cock Lane on 30January. [...] After struggling through <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of interested visitors though, he was ultimately disappointed; the Public Advertiser observed that [...] "the noise is now generally deferred till seven in the morning, it being necessary to vary the time, that the imposition may be the better carried on".|$|E

500|$|Following {{the death}} during {{childbirth}} of Kent's wife, Elizabeth Lynes, he became romantically involved with her sister, Fanny. [...] Canon law prevented the couple from marrying, but they nevertheless moved to London and lodged at {{the property in}} Cock Lane, then owned by Parsons. [...] Several accounts of strange knocking sounds and ghostly apparitions were reported, although {{for the most part}} they stopped after the couple moved out, but following Fanny's death from smallpox and Kent's successful legal action against Parsons over an outstanding debt, they resumed. [...] Parsons claimed that Fanny's ghost haunted his property and later his daughter. [...] Regular séances were held to determine [...] "Scratching Fanny's" [...] motives; Cock Lane was often made impassable by <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of interested bystanders.|$|E
500|$|Crowds {{of people}} went to see these travel movies of the 1840's and 1850's and thus toured the great river vicariously. [...] <b>The</b> <b>throngs</b> that wished to view Banvard's {{panorama}} were so great when it was displayed in Boston and New York that railroads ran special excursions to accommodate them. In these two cities alone more than four hundred thousand people saw the exhibition. [...] "The river comes to me instead of my going to the river," [...] wrote Longfellow. Whittier, after seeing a panorama, sang of the [...] "new Canaan of our Israel," [...] and Thoreau, who not only viewed a panorama but also made the tour itself, envisaged a coming heroic age in which simple and obscure men, the real heroes of history, would build the foundations of new castles n the West and throw bridges across a [...] "Rhine stream of a different kind." ...|$|E
500|$|Bellerophon {{anchored}} off Brixham on {{the morning}} of 24 July, and there Maitland received orders from Admiral Lord Keith to [...] "prevent every person whatever from coming on board the ship you command, except the officers and men who compose her crew." [...] Despite turning away the shore boats which approached the anchored warship bringing fresh bread and fruit to sell, word eventually leaked out that Napoleon was aboard the ship. The news created a sensation, and large numbers of boats filled with sightseers soon surrounded the ship. Occasionally Napoleon would come out to look at them, but despite entreaties from some people to be allowed on board, Maitland refused to allow any contact between ship and shore. On 26 July Bellerophon received orders to proceed to Plymouth harbour where Lord Keith was anchored aboard his flagship [...] Napoleon remained on board Bellerophon and the ship was kept isolated from <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of curious sightseers by two guardships, [...] and , anchored close at hand.|$|E

500|$|Born in {{the town}} of Xi'e in Nanyang Commandery (north of the modern Nanyang City in Henan province), Zhang Heng came from a {{distinguished}} but not very affluent family. His grandfather Zhang Kan had been governor of a commandery and one of the leaders who supported the restoration of the Han by Emperor Guangwu (r.25–57), following the death of the usurping Wang Mang of the Xin (AD9–23). At age ten, Zhang's father died, leaving him in the care of his mother and grandmother. An accomplished writer in his youth, Zhang left home in the year 95 to pursue his studies in the capitals of Chang'an and Luoyang. While traveling to Luoyang, Zhang passed by a hot spring near Mount Li and dedicated one of his earliest fu poems to it. This work, entitled [...] "Fu on the Hot Springs" [...] (Wēnquán fù 溫泉賦), describes <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of people attending the hot springs, which later became famous as the [...] "Huaqing Hot Springs", a favorite retreat of imperial concubine Yang Guifei during the Tang dynasty. After studying for some years at Luoyang's Taixue, he was well-versed in the classics and friends with several notable persons, including the mathematician and calligrapher Cui Yuan (78–143), the official and philosophical commentator Ma Rong (79–166), and the philosopher Wang Fu (78–163). Government authorities offered Zhang appointments to several offices, including a position as one of the Imperial Secretaries, yet he acted modestly and declined. At age twenty-three, he returned home with the title [...] "Officer of Merit in Nanyang", serving as the master of documents under the administration of Governor Bao De (in office from 103–111). As he was charged with composing inscriptions and dirges for the governor, he gained experience in writing official documents. As Officer of Merit in the commandery, he was also responsible for local appointments to office and recommendations to the capital of nominees for higher office. He spent much of his time composing rhapsodies on the capital cities. When Bao De was recalled to the capital in 111 to serve as a minister of finance, Zhang continued his literary work at home in Xi'e. Zhang Heng began his studies in astronomy at the age of thirty and began publishing his works on astronomy and mathematics.|$|E

"So {{from the}} battlements as though {{on the walls}} of a citadel, the archers kept up with a continual {{discharge}} of well aimed shafts, so dense that the Persians had the sensation of a cloud descending upon them, especially when the Ethiopians made their enemies; eyes the targets.. SO unerring was their aim that those who they pierced with their shafts rushed about wildly in <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> with the arrows projecting from their eyes like double flutes." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the parade, {{members of}} Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla {{and dozens of}} other krewes throw beads, coins, and other {{souvenir}} trinkets to <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> along the parade route. In the past, members of YMKG would also fire [...]38 six-shooters loaded with blanks into the air and toss the empty shells into the crowd. This tradition was restricted in 1992 and ended entirely several years later. However, trained members of YMKG still fire loud mini-cannons mounted atop several of their parade floats. The main parade is broadcast every year on WFLA-TV, and has been since 1955; station WTVT-TV also covered the parade from 1955 to 1980.|$|E

Without leaders, without discipline, without tactics, without means of getting food, they soon became a scourge of the country through which they passed.|$|R

2500|$|Concerning {{the form}} and plan of the first monastery built near the chapel we have no information, nor is the exact form of the loggia or {{platforms}} built round the chapel itself, or of the choir for the brothers built behind it, known. Shortly after 1290, the chapel, which measured only about 5.5 by 3.2m, became entirely inadequate to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of pilgrims. The altar piece, an Annunciation, was painted by the priest Hilarius of Viterbo in 1393. The monastery was at most the residence, only for a short time, of the ministers-general of the order after St. Francis. In 1415 it first became associated with the Regular Observance, {{in the care of}} which it remains to the present day.|$|E
2500|$|A {{real estate}} {{boom in the}} spring of 1887 brought {{thousands}} of people to Southern California, many of them traveling on [...] "The Santa Fé Route" [...] to San Diego. The California Southern constructed a new Victorian-style depot to handle <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of people coming to the Southland. The structure sported dark red paint with dark green trim. Recurring washouts in the Temecula Canyon, however, often disrupted service; in response, the Santa Fe began construction of its -long [...] "Surf Line" [...] between Los Angeles' La Grande Station and the National City depot. From 1886 to 1888, the Riverside, Santa Ana and Los Angeles Railway built a branch line from Highgrove southwest via Riverside, to Santa Ana and from Orange northwest to Los Angeles. Also in 1888, the San Bernardino and San Diego Railway completed its line from Oceanside north to Santa Ana, completing what was originally called the [...] "Los Angeles-San Diego Short Line." [...] The inland route was finally abandoned in 1891, leaving the newer, coastal route as the only line to San Diego from the north.|$|E
2500|$|The Relief Project Workers' Union (RCPU) was the {{successor}} to the Relief Camp Workers' Union, which had led the 1935 strike that culminated in the On-to-Ottawa Trek and Regina Riot. After the earlier strike, the maligned federal relief camps run by the Department of National Defence were replaced by [...] "relief projects" [...] operated by the provinces and funded by both levels of government. The pay-rate {{was similar to the}} earlier camps – five dollars a month compared to the twenty-cents per day offered by the [...] "slave camps". The work was primarily seasonal work on farms. As in 1935, unemployed men from across the country drifted to British Columbia because of the milder climate, but also because relief projects in forestry camps paid as much as three times that of equivalent farm placements. From the perspective of the government, the main difference between the earlier camps established under R. B. [...] "Iron Heel" [...] Bennett and the relief projects under William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberals was that the men were comparatively isolated from each other making it more difficult to organize. In both cases, <b>the</b> <b>throngs</b> of disaffected unemployed men were kept out of urban centres.|$|E
