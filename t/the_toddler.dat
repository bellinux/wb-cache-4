5|$|Typical {{attachment}} development {{begins with}} unlearned infant reactions to social signals from caregivers. The ability to {{send and receive}} social communications through facial expressions, gestures and voice develops with social experience by seven to nine months. This {{makes it possible for}} an infant to interpret messages of calm or alarm from face or voice. At about eight months, infants typically begin to respond with fear to unfamiliar or startling situations, and to look to the faces of familiar caregivers for information that either justifies or soothes their fear. This developmental combination of social skills and the emergence of fear reactions results in attachment behavior such as proximity-seeking, if a familiar, sensitive, responsive, and cooperative adult is available. Further developments in attachment, such as negotiation of separation in <b>the</b> <b>toddler</b> and preschool period, depend on factors such as the caregiver's interaction style and ability to understand the child's emotional communications.|$|E
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} <b>the</b> <b>toddler</b> Allegra {{while she was}} being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a foster home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E

25|$|The {{main part}} of the game is to lead a Sim from the start of life to death. A Sim will be born when a female Sim and a male Sim try for a baby. The mother will spend 3 Sim days (each day lasts 24 minutes though time can be sped-up) {{pregnant}} before giving birth to a baby. Players can name the new Sim upon birth. The baby's appearance and personality will be based on the genetics of its parents (though the baby's appearance is hidden until it becomes a toddler). Babies can also be adopted by calling the social worker on the phone, even by single parents or same-gender couples. The baby will change into a toddler in 3 days, and 4 more days for <b>the</b> <b>toddler</b> to change into a child. After 8 days, the child grows into a teenager, and will live 15 days before changing into an adult. After 29 days, the Sim will become an elder.

25|$|On Krypton, {{parallel}} evolution {{led to the}} emergence of analogous species to Terran cats, simians, birds and dogs, which were domestic companion animals as they were on Earth. As explained in his first appearance, Krypto was originally <b>the</b> <b>toddler</b> Kal-El's dog while they were on Krypton. Jor-El, testing prototypes for the rocket that would eventually send Kal-El to Earth, decided to use Krypto as a test subject. However, Krypto's rocket was knocked off-course; the rocket drifted through space for years until it eventually landed on Earth, where Krypto was reunited with the now-teenaged superhero, Superboy. Due to the environment (Earth's yellow sun and lower gravity), Krypto possessed the same powers and abilities as his master, although his physical abilities were proportionate to his smaller size and species, similar to an ordinary dog vs. a human. Certain sensory abilities of Krypto's (senses of smell and hearing) would be more acute than those of Superman, just as an ordinary dog's senses would be more acute than those of an ordinary human. Krypto also had super-canine intelligence (approximately human level, though with his canine traits and interests still present); the comics expressed this via the use of thought balloons indicating what Krypto was thinking.|$|E
25|$|The first {{indications}} of A-T usually occur during <b>the</b> <b>toddler</b> years. Children start walking at a normal age, {{but may not}} improve much from their initial wobbly gait. Sometimes they have problems standing or sitting still and tend to sway backward or from side to side. In primary school years, walking becomes more difficult, and children will use doorways and walls for support. Children with A-T often appear better when running or walking quickly in comparison to when they are walking slowly or standing in one place. Around {{the beginning of their}} second decade, children with typical forms of A-T start using a wheelchair for long distances. During school years, children may have increasing difficulty with reading because of impaired coordination of eye movement. At the same time, other problems with fine-motor functions (writing, coloring, and using utensils to eat), and with slurring of speech (dysarthria) may arise. Most of these neurologic problems stop progressing after the age of about 12 – 15 years, though involuntary movements may start at any age and may worsen over time. These extra movements can take many forms, including small jerks of the hands and feet that look like fidgeting (chorea), slower twisting movements of the upper body (athetosis), adoption of stiff and twisted postures (dystonia), occasional uncontrolled jerks (myoclonic jerks), and various rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements with attempts at coordinated action (tremors).|$|E

25|$|Crittenden {{proposes that}} {{both kinds of}} {{information}} can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized {{to be based on}} reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond' Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion. For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, <b>the</b> <b>toddler</b> then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT One {{of common}} health problem among {{toddlers}} in Indonesia is diarrhea. Diarrhea {{is a disease}} that has risk to cause death. The {{main causes of death}} in diarrhea is dehydration by the loss of fluids and electrolytes through feces. Based on monthly reports of diarrhea at Kalijudan Health Center (Indonesian: Puskesmas Kalijudan) in 2013, there were some toddlers aged 1 – 4 years old that suffered dehydration due to diarrhea. This research aimed to analyze the relationship between maternal characteristics and knowledge and <b>the</b> incidence of <b>toddler</b> dehydration due to diarrhea at Kalijudan Health Center, Surabaya. This research was an analytic observational research with case-control design. Subjects of the research were drawn from the population using simple random sampling. Number of samples obtained was 30 individuals for case group and another 30 for control group. The independent variables were the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>toddler’s</b> mother (including age, education, work statu, family income) and knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>toddler’s</b> mother. Primary data were collected using questionnaires. Analysis of the data was done using Chi Square statistical test. The results of bivariate analysis, {{it was found that the}} variables associated with the incidence of diarrheal dehydration among toddlers were mother’s work status (p = 0. 010), and knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>toddler’s</b> mother (p = 0. 002). There were no relationship among age of toddlers’ mother (p = 0. 779), mother’s education (p = 0. 797), and family income (p = 0. 430).

30|$|One way {{to share}} any discoveries is through video documentation. The use of mobile phone video {{to capture the}} immediacy of a {{transitory}} moment, requires the researcher {{to be aware of}} <b>the</b> <b>toddler’s</b> activity and open to filming spontaneously. In <b>the</b> <b>toddler’s</b> daily walks to LDC, the recording of the smallest gestures and signals are vital {{in the sense that they}} indicate the care for, and ongoing interest in toddler Luci. This attitude of interest and care reflects the ethical approach taken in the research example. The transitory moment, filmed spontaneously on mobile phone and used as data for this article, happened during a daily walk and was not pre-planned. Responsive and attuned to an unplanned opportunity for documenting <b>the</b> <b>toddler’s</b> daily life, <b>the</b> researcher realised during the walk that a special moment was unfolding. Familiar with being documented by her family, Luci continued her playful activity uninterrupted during the short mobile phone video capture. The fleeting experience was later shared with Luci and her parents for reflection, discussion and the researcher’s analysis. Paying attention to the smallest moments of toddler activity, only becomes possible when video data is available. It stabilises the action, making moments shareable and open to interpretation.|$|R
