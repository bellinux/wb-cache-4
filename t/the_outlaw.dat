A Street Fight is fought under no {{disqualification}} rules, which is won either by a pinfall or submission. <b>The</b> <b>Outlaw</b> requested to be called by a new name before the contest, Kip James. <b>The</b> <b>Outlaw</b> was busted open during the bout. Multiple referees had to be replaced for the match, due to reoccurring attacks on them by <b>The</b> <b>Outlaw.</b> Brown won the encounter after performing his signature Pounce maneuver on Killings, knocking him across the ring onto the mat, at 5 minutes and 20 seconds. After the contest, B.G. James entered the ring where <b>The</b> <b>Outlaw</b> offered James a chair to hit Konnan with, which James declined.|$|E

25|$|During this time, <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws</b> began a {{feud with}} Kane and Mankind. Although Kane and Mankind won the Tag Team Championship, {{they could not}} get along. At SummerSlam, Mankind faced <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws</b> in a Handicap match after Kane no-showed the title defense. <b>The</b> <b>Outlaws</b> {{defeated}} Mankind to win the titles for the third time. <b>The</b> <b>Outlaws</b> then helped X-Pac in his feud with Jeff Jarrett and Southern Justice.

5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws one by one. Once an outlaw {{has been found}} and shot (shooting <b>the</b> <b>outlaw</b> does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to the first-person {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must shoot the rapidly moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for <b>the</b> <b>outlaw</b> to draw, or take the initiative and shoot first, which will make the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E

50|$|The emperor {{sends the}} army to attack Liangshan five times, but <b>the</b> <b>outlaws</b> emerge victorious {{eventually}} each time, {{with some of the}} commanders, such as Huyan Zhuo and Guan Sheng, defecting over to join <b>the</b> <b>outlaws.</b> Gao Qiu takes command of the army during the fifth military campaign and he is captured by <b>the</b> <b>outlaws</b> after his defeat. Lin Chong and some of <b>the</b> <b>outlaws</b> want to kill Gao Qiu for revenge, but Song Jiang stops them, because he intends to use Gao to help <b>the</b> <b>outlaws</b> attain amnesty from the government.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Outlaws</b> {{watch some}} girls playing hockey - so {{they make up}} their own kind of hockey with upside down walking sticks. They enjoy the game and play it {{whenever}} they get a chance- and other children see <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws</b> playing it, and start to do it as well. In less than a week, the entire village's population of boys is playing it. The only people who refuse to play it are Hubert Lane and his gang (they are <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws</b> enemies). Hubert Lane and <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws</b> organise a match. <b>The</b> <b>Outlaws</b> arrive before <b>the</b> match, and spot Hubert and his best friend hiding all the good food that had been organised for the match, and leaving the bad, not-as-good food out for <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kicking off {{the season}} at home, <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws</b> had a brutal win over Kent, {{one of the}} new league franchises. Not long after <b>the</b> win, <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws</b> {{suffered}} a loss on a no-call on pass interference, this left Sioux Falls victorious and <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws</b> dumfounded with 1 in the loss column, and the second and last loss was controversial because <b>the</b> <b>Outlaws</b> were called for three penalties in the final minute of the game to which Fairbanks countered with a last second score to win 55-54. <b>The</b> <b>Outlaws</b> rebounded after <b>the</b> loss with a scoring onslaught to defeat the Tri-Cities Fever twice, the Kent Predators once, the San Angelo Stampede Express once, the Arkansas Diamonds once, and the Sioux Falls Storm twice. <b>The</b> <b>Outlaws</b> again won <b>the</b> United Bowl, this time over long-time rival Sioux Falls by a score of 43-34 on July 17, 2010 in front of a packed house in the Sportsplex.

5|$|Team Nash (Diamond Dallas Page, Sean Waltman, and {{an unknown}} member) fought Team Jarrett (Jeff Jarrett, Monty Brown, and <b>The</b> <b>Outlaw)</b> in the first-ever three-on-three Lethal Lockdown match, which ran 15 minutes and 35 seconds. Waltman and Jarrett started the match by {{fighting}} {{through the crowd}} before entering the cage. After five minutes, <b>The</b> <b>Outlaw</b> joined the match and helped Jarrett attack Waltman. Diamond Dallas Page entered the match two minutes later and attacked Jarrett and <b>The</b> <b>Outlaw</b> with a cane. Following another two minutes, Brown joined the fray, finished out Team Jarrett, and threw Waltman into the cage wall. The final member of Team Nash was revealed after the final two minutes, as B.G. James was thrown into the mix that allowed a pinfall or submission to occur.

Eventually, Waltman performed a move called a hurricanrana on Brown, leading to the pinfall and victory.|$|E
5|$|The 3Live Kru (Konnan and Ron Killings) and {{the team}} of Monty Brown and <b>The</b> <b>Outlaw</b> fought at Sacrifice, this time with B.G. James as Special Guest Referee.

As such, this forced Zbyszko to name B.G. as the Special Guest Referee on the July 29 episode of Impact!. The 3Live Kru were the victors at Sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} of the Old West, tales tended to grow with {{repeated}} telling, and a single fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K.

Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self-promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Outlaw</b> Star manga {{series and}} {{animated}} television series are paced differently. The anime episodes often involve Gene and his comrades taking on various jobs or missions to fund their ship's massive maintenance costs. Throughout their travels, the crew often encounters Ronald MacDougall and Harry MacDougall, {{a pair of}} bounty hunters {{responsible for the death}} of Gene's father. Ronald acts as a rival to Gene, while Harry wishes to form a bond with Melfina, a bio-android like himself, who instead develops strong feelings for Gene. The crew also contends with others that learn of <b>the</b> <b>Outlaw</b> Star's connection to the Galactic Leyline. They are Nguyen Khan, a scientist wishing to gain omniscience through the Leyline; and Lord Hazanko, the leader of the ruthless assassin organization the Anten Seven that seek the Leyline to gain ultimate power. The series climaxes when all parties meet on the physical plane of the Leyline. In the end, Ron MacDougall retreats, saved by a computer copy of his brother Harry (who is killed trying to protect Melfina from Hazanko), Khan is integrated into the Leyline as data, Gene reveals to Melfina that he is in love with her and frees her from the Leyline by making it their shared wish to be together forever, and Hazanko is eventually defeated by <b>the</b> <b>Outlaw</b> Star crewmembers. Once the conflict comes to a close, Gene and his friends return to Sentinel III and go their separate ways, but ultimately reunite to continue their adventures together.|$|E
