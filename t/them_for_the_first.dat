5|$|The Minority Treaties, {{recognized}} as history's first minority treaties, were {{an important step}} in protection of minorities and recognition of human rights, bringing the subject to an international forum. In <b>them,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, states and international communities recognized that there are people living outside normal legal protection and who required an additional guarantee of their elementary rights from an external body, as protection within individual states itself may not be sufficient. Among issues successfully resolved by the Minority Treaties was the Åland crisis.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942 the U-boats {{became aware}} of Coastal Command {{aircraft}} using another innovation – sonobuoys, which were {{thought of as the}} air equivalent of the Navy's ASDIC. A U-boat reported them on 29 July being dropped in the north transit area, and they were thought by the enemy to be devices for preventing U-boats from travelling on the surface. They were, in fact, for detecting submerged U-boats, and were used by No. 210 Squadron RAF, operating Sunderlands. In operational records they were coded High Tea. Most crews were unaware of their existence. The devices stayed in use until 1998, when some wartime crews saw <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. Until then the RAF had kept them secret.|$|E
5|$|Max Mosley {{was born}} on 3 April 1940 in London, {{in the early years}} of the Second World War. His father, Sir Oswald Mosley, had been a Labour minister, and a Member of Parliament for both the Conservative and Labour parties in the 1920s before leaving {{mainstream}} politics and becoming leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF) in the 1930s. The month after Max's birth, Sir Oswald, who had campaigned for a negotiated peace between the United Kingdom and Nazi Germany, was interned by the British Authorities under Defence Regulation 18B, along with other active fascists in Britain. Max's mother, Lady Diana Mosley, was imprisoned a month later. Max and his older brother Alexander were not included in their parents' internment and as a result were separated from <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> few years of their lives. In December 1940, then-prime minister Winston Churchill, asked Home Secretary Herbert Morrison to ensure Lady Mosley was able to see Max regularly.|$|E

In 14 appearances with Buffalo, 12 of them starts, Robertson had a 4–5 record with a 7.27 ERA. The Indians called Robertson up to the major league roster on June 25 after placing Rafael Betancourt on the disabled list. In eight games for the Indians, Robertson had a record of 1–1 and a 12.21 ERA. In his final appearance in the major leagues, a July 21 game against the Chicago White Sox, Robertson was ejected after hitting Magglio Ordóñez with a pitch in the fifth inning.|$|E
5|$|The term 'bomber mafia' {{came from}} the {{sometimes}} bitter debates between United States Army staff and Air Corps men who observed, and argued with, the insistence by instructors and students of the ACTS that heavy bombers were the new primary weapon of war, and that a separate air arm was required to command <b>them.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> few years, the strongest voice at ACTS against the bomber doctrine was Captain (later General) George C. Kenney who called {{for the use of}} air power to attack enemy fighting units on the ground. He advocated the close coordination of air and ground forces, with an emphasis on medium bombers and fighter bombers. Kenney left ACTS in 1929, and heavy bomber doctrinarians filled the vacancy. The doctrine also ran counter to the theories of Billy Mitchell himself, who espoused that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations.|$|E
5|$|Floodlights were {{installed}} {{at a cost}} of £12,000 in 1957. On 30 October they were switched on for the first time for a match against Everton to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Liverpool County Football Association. In 1963 the old Kemlyn Road stand was replaced by a cantilevered stand, built {{at a cost of}} £350,000, accommodating 6,700 spectators. Two years later alterations were made at the Anfield Road end, turning it into a larger covered standing area with refreshments under the structure. The biggest redevelopment came in 1973, when the old Main Stand was partially demolished and extended backwards with new roof. Simultaneously the concrete pylon floodlights were demolished with new lights installed along the rooflines of the Kemlyn Road and Main Stands. The new stand was officially opened by the Duke of Kent on 10 March 1973. In the 1980s the paddock in front of the Main Stand was turned into seating, and in 1982 seats were introduced at the Anfield Road end. The Shankly Gates were erected in 1982, a tribute to former manager Bill Shankly; his widow Nessie unlocked <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time on 26 August 1982. Across the Shankly Gates are the words You'll Never Walk Alone, the title of the hit song by Gerry and the Pacemakers adopted by Liverpool fans as the club's anthem during Shankly's time as manager.|$|E

25|$|Sheep flight {{behavior}} is cited in one major study in California {{as the major}} stimulus responsible for eliciting predatory behavior in coyotes. Even coyotes that had not previously been exposed to sheep demonstrated predatory behavior when exposed to <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. Of particular interest was that coyotes with no previous prey-killing experience readily attacked and killed sheep when given the chance. The coyotes were likely to attack sheep that exhibited flight behavior even when these coyotes were not hungry.
