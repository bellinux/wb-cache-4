50|$|The {{steering}} column was adjustable for length. The steering system by Marles-Weller had been improved. Because the engine had moved forward the <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> was now {{forward of the}} front axle.|$|E
5000|$|It was a {{difficult}} first year for the rookie team with heavy damage sustained at Donington, but good performances at Brands Hatch and Snetterton [...] Limping the car home with a damaged <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> at Croft gave Creasey enough points to claim the Road Sport title. Westbourne Motorsport's Anton Spires claimed the overall Road Series title at the previous meeting at Snetterton.|$|E
5000|$|In automobiles, the {{tie rods}} {{are part of}} the {{steering}} mechanism. They differ from the archetypal tie rod by both pushing and pulling (operating in both tension and compression). In the UK, these items are generally referred to as <b>track</b> <b>rods.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Bolam {{has never}} commented on {{what caused the}} rift, but is known for being guarded about his private life. He once remarked: [...] "I'm having a man fix the <b>track</b> <b>rods</b> on my car. I don't want to know {{anything}} about him. Why should he want {{to know anything about}} me?" ...|$|R

5000|$|Rather {{than the}} {{preceding}} [...] "turntable" [...] steering, where both front wheels turned around a common pivot, each wheel gained its own pivot, {{close to its}} own hub. While more complex, this arrangement enhances controllability by avoiding large inputs from road surface variations being applied {{to the end of}} a long lever arm, as well as greatly reducing the fore-and-aft travel of the steered wheels. A linkage between these hubs pivots the two wheels together, and by careful arrangement of the linkage dimensions the Ackermann geometry could be approximated. This was achieved by making the linkage not a simple parallelogram, but by making the length of the <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> (the moving link between the hubs) shorter than that of the axle, so that the steering arms of the hubs appeared to [...] "toe out". As the steering moved, the wheels turned according to Ackermann, with the inner wheel turning further. If the <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> is placed ahead of the axle, it should instead be longer in comparison, thus preserving this same [...] "toe out".|$|E
50|$|This left Lucien Bianchi and {{co-driver}} Jean-Claude Ogier in {{the lead}} ahead of Gilbert Staepelaere/Simo Lampinen in the German Ford Taunus, with Andrew Cowan in the Hillman Hunter 3rd. Then Staepelaere's Taunus hit a gate post, breaking a <b>track</b> <b>rod.</b> This left Cowan in second position and Paddy Hopkirk's Austin 1800 in third place. Approaching the Nowra checkpoint {{at the end of}} the penultimate stage with only 98 miles to Sydney, the Frenchmen were involved in a head-on collision which wrecked their Citroën and hospitalised the pair.|$|E
50|$|Many {{currently}} manufactured automobiles worldwide use MacPherson strut suspension, which utilises one {{ball joint}} per side, between {{the lower end}} of the strut and the control arm, with the necessary small amount of articulation at the top of the strut being usually provided by an elastomeric bearing, within which is a ball bearing to allow free rotation about the steering axis. So, there are commonly only two ball joints in the suspension, however there will be at least four (<b>track</b> <b>rod</b> ends and rack ends) in the steering linkage.|$|E
50|$|The 1093 was {{a factory}} racing model limited edition of 2,140 homologated, which were tuned to 55 hp (41 kW) and {{featured}} a twin-barrel carburettor, rear <b>track</b> <b>rods,</b> four-speed manual transmission and tachometer, had {{a top speed}} of 140 km/h, and were produced in 1962 and 1963. All were painted white with two thin blue stripes running front to back along the hood, roof and trunk.|$|R
50|$|The {{shaft of}} the {{steering}} control was connected directly to the <b>track</b> <b>rods</b> controlling the front wheels, resulting in approximately one-third of a turn from the left extreme to the right extreme ("lock to lock"). The handlebar-shaped steering control would be operated with small, controlled inputs by swivelling the steering bar about its axis from the horizontal (straight-ahead) position instead of rotating it as with a conventional steering wheel.|$|R

50|$|He was mortally injured on 18 May 1958 {{during an}} {{accident}} in {{a sports car}} race at Spa-Francorchamps, driving a Lister Knobbly and duelling for the lead with Gregory. Battling hard with Masten Gregory driving the Ecurie Ecosse Lister Jaguar, they swapped the lead between them inches apart.The competition was so fierce that Archie dented his car's nose on {{the rear of the}} Ecosse car on lap three.With Archie leading on lap six they arrived at Blanchimont, then in the Clubhouse bend (where Richard Seaman died in 1939) to find the track slick with rain, the right hand front wheel of the Lister hit a road sign snapping the <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> causing a disastrous accident. He died in hospital (Heusy) the following day, {{less than a week after}} his 31st birthday.|$|E
50|$|At {{the start}} of the race, Jenson Button had a fantastic start, jumping his McLaren from second past Fernando Alonso's Ferrari. Alonso, who was {{alongside}} with his teammate Felipe Massa through the turn one chicane, just clipped the rear of Button's diffuser, but there was only light damage to the McLaren. As the pack headed down to the second chicane of turns three and four, Button's teammate Lewis Hamilton, who was in fourth, tried to pull a move on Massa, but there was contact between the two. Although Lewis tried to carry on, the front <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> was broken and he pulled up at the next corner. Massa managed to carry on unscathed. Kamui Kobayashi did start the race but retired his BMW Sauber on the first lap with a gearbox failure.|$|E
50|$|In {{honor of}} his late mother’s birthday, a tribute that’s been done since 2013, Kobang {{released}} Bank Rolls (Remix) on April 19, 2015 as a promotional hit for his newest mixtape. Bank Rolls (Remix) was a featured song in Watch Dogs 2. The song uses Baltimore rapper Tim Trees’ 2000 song “Bank Roll” and features a verse that remembers Baltimore DJ K-Swift, who died in 2008. That day is also the day of Freddie Gray's death after being in a coma from injury complications allegedly caused by the Baltimore Police Department. With heavy media attention and national focus on Baltimore at this time, Kobang released the song to bring a sense of happiness and pride to the city. Following the viral success of the 90-second video, Kobang went into the studio with the producer of the original <b>track,</b> <b>Rod</b> Lee, to extend the track into a full song.|$|E
50|$|Guided Wave testing (GWT) {{is one of}} latest {{methods in}} the field ofnon-destructive evaluation. The methodemploys {{mechanical}} stress waves that propagate along an elongatedstructure while guided by its boundaries. This allows thewaves to travel a long distance with little loss in energy. Nowadays, GWT is widely used to inspect and screen manyengineering structures, particularly for the inspectionof metallic pipelines around the world. Insome cases, hundreds of meters can be inspected from a singlelocation. There are also some applications for inspectingrail <b>tracks,</b> <b>rods</b> and metal plate structures.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{the design}} used with the DB 18 chassis, the front wheels were {{suspended}} independently of each other by pairs of control arms, of which the lower arms were of the wide-based wishbone type and were supported by coil springs mounted to the frame. The upper arm was shorter than the lower and operated Luvax-Girling dampers. The <b>track</b> <b>rods</b> were pivoted to swing at the same radius as the suspension links. The front dampers were connected to each other by an anti-roll bar. The front track was 60 in wide.|$|R
50|$|Extrusion is a {{manufacturing}} process {{used to make}} pipes, hoses, drinking straws, curtain <b>tracks,</b> <b>rods,</b> and fibre. The granules melt into a liquid which is forced through a die, forming a long 'tube like' shape. The shape of the die determines {{the shape of the}} tube. The extrusion is then cooled and forms a solid shape. The tube may be printed upon, and cut at equal intervals. The pieces may be rolled for storage or packed together.Shapes that can result from extrusion include T-sections, U-sections, square sections, I-sections, L-sections and circular sections.|$|R
5000|$|Launched at the 1932 London Motor Show, the K-Type {{replaced}} the F-Type Magna but having at first a slightly smaller capacity engine {{it took the}} name Magnette. The chassis {{was similar to the}} Magna but strengthened and had the track increased by 6 inches (150 mm) to 48 inches (1200 mm) and was available in two lengths with a wheelbase of either 94 inches (2388 mm) or 108 inches (2743 mm). The steering was modified with a patented divided <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> which was claimed to reduce kick back at the steering wheel. The brakes were cable operated with 13-inch (330 mm) drums made of [...] "Elektron", a light magnesium alloy, with shrunk in steel liners. Suspension by half-elliptic springs and Hartford friction shock absorbers all round with rigid front and rear axles. Wire wheels with 4.75 x 19 tyres and centre lock fixing were used.|$|E
50|$|The W152's {{mechanicals}} {{are from}} a Jaguar XJ from 1968-1986. There are three different engine options in a W152, the Jaguar XK6, AJ6 or V12. Any appropriate gearbox can be used but normally a suitable manual gearbox from a Jaguar is used. The W152 uses the independent rear suspension (IRS) unit and front wishbones from the Jaguar donor car but instead of using the standard springs and shock absorbers, it utilises modern coil over shocks. The steering rack is sourced from an MGB and uses extenders to the track-rod ends to suit the wider track of the car. The car uses the standard Jaguar brake calipers and discs but uses a different, split system pedal box, remote fluid reservoirs and twin servos. Most cars up until about 2011 used a custom built pedal box but they now use an OBP pedal box. The front suspension arms and steering arm and <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> end extensions are usually nickel-plated.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} session, Massa was fastest on a lap of 1:35.392, which was over a second {{faster than any}} of his rivals. Räikkönen ended up second, despite running out of fuel during the session, and Kovalainen ended up third, just under a tenth of a second slower than his fellow Finn. Also during the session, the Red Bull Racing machine of David Coulthard {{suffered}} a <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> failure on the curb of turn 12, and forced the team to show the FIA clarification that their car design was safe for the Grand Prix, under Article 2.3 of the 2008 Formula One Technical Regulations. Coulthard sat out the second practice session, which saw Hamilton top the timesheets with a lap of 1:35.055, beating Massa by 0.151 seconds, with Räikkönen a further two tenths back in third. In preparation for the qualifying session, many teams put their cars on soft tyres for the third practice session. The soft tyre gives better performance than the harder type of tyre but is less durable than the harder compound. Just like in Australia, the BMW of Heidfeld was fastest, setting a lap of 1:35.019, edging out the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa with Jarno Trulli's Toyota fourth, ending up just one-thousandth of a second behind Massa's time.|$|E

The KR175's steering bar was made from tubular steel. The gearshift lever, {{on the right side}} of the cockpit, had a secondary lever on it which operated the clutch. The throttle was operated by a twist-grip on the left handlebar. The foot brake pedal, which was the only pedal in the car, operated brakes on all three wheels mechanically, using cables. The handbrake lever operated similarly.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 26, {{and on the}} approach to the hairpin later in the lap Robert Kubica hit the back of Jarno Trulli's Toyota. The impact forced Kubica onto the grass {{at the edge of}} the track, where a bump launched his car into and along the concrete wall just before the hairpin. After losing three wheels, the nose and suffering major damage to the sidepods in the initial impact, the BMW flipped back across the track and came to rest against the barrier in the run-off area on the other side of the track. Although initial reports said that he had broken his leg, Kubica only suffered a sprained ankle and concussion. The safety car was deployed again after this crash. The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving Christijan Albers on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to Vitantonio Liuzzi crashing into the wall of champions once again.On Lap 58, Jarno Trulli was trying to pass Wurz but later his front <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> clipped away causing him to crash.Cement was placed at the hairpin around Kubica's accident. Räikkönen ran wide after he misjudged the braking on the dust. The Super Aguri of Takuma Sato went past him as a result and moved into 10th place.On lap 37, Trulli and Nico Rosberg were battling for position going into turn 1. Both span off the track in almost synchronised fashion without touching each other. This occurrence amused reporters due to it resembling a form of dance. Both drivers were able to keep going. Also on this lap Anthony Davidson made an unscheduled pit stop. He claimed after the race that a beaver had damaged his front wing although Canadian reports said it more likely to have been a groundhog. One lap later David Coulthard was forced to retire due to a gearbox problem. Ralf Schumacher also stopped on this lap and this allowed Massa, Fisichella and Sato to move ahead of both of them. Räikkönen had his second pit stop on lap 52 at the same time as Alonso. The latter was able to pass him just after they had exited the pits side-by-side. This moved him into 5th.|$|E
40|$|O etanol tem influÃncia sobre diversos sistemas de neurotransmissores. VÃrios estudos tÃm relatado a interaÃÃo entre a via dopaminÃrgica e colinÃrgica e a interaÃÃo delas isoladamente com os efeitos do etanol. O bloqueador colinÃrgico atropina, que Ã um alcalÃide muito utilizado no caso de intoxicaÃÃes colinÃrgica e comprometimento cardÃaco e o haloperidol, Ã neurolÃptico, antagonista das vias dopaminÃrgicas, principalmente pelo bloqueio do {{receptor}} D 2, utilizado no tratamento da esquizofrenia, tanto na fase aguda como crÃnica, psicoses e episÃdios manÃacos psicÃticos sÃo fÃrmacos utilizados para o estudo desses sistemas. Este trabalho objetivou estudar os efeitos comportamentais e neuroquÃmicas produzidos em corpo estriado induzidos pelo tratamento subcrÃnico com etanol na presenÃa e ausÃncia de atropina ou haloperidol. Foram utilizados camundongos Swiss, fÃmeas, com peso variando entre 25 â 30 g. Os animais foram tratados com Ãgua destilada (controle), etanol (1 ou 3 g/kg, v. o) ou prÃ tratados com haloperidol (0, 5 mg/kg, i. p) ou atropina (0, 5 mg/kg, i. p), essa aplicaÃÃo foi feita trinta minutos antes da administraÃÃo do etanol ou Ãgua destilada diariamente durante sete dias. Trinta minutos apÃs a Ãltima administraÃÃo das drogas por via intraperitoneal ou sessenta minutos apÃs a Ãltima administraÃÃo por via oral, os animais foram submetidos aos testes comportamentais de campo aberto e rota rod (atividade locomotora), placa perfurada e plus maze (atividade de ansiedade) e, posteriormente, sacrificados com dissecaÃÃo do corpo estriado para determinaÃÃo dos nÃveis de monoaminas (norepinefrina, dopamina e seu metabÃlico Ãcido 3, 4 -dihidroxifenilacÃtico) e a atividade da acetilcolinesterase. O etanol apresentou efeito estimulante na menor dose e depressor na maior dose, principalmente nos testes de atividade locomotora. Quando associado Ã maior dose, o haloperidol apresentou, na maioria das vezes o efeito potencializador do etanol, jÃ a atropina apenas em alguns testes mostrou uma tendÃncia de reversÃo desse efeito apenas associado ao etanol na menor dose, embora nÃo observado em todos os paramentos avaliados. AlÃm disso, o efeito produziu um discreto aumento nos nÃveis de dopamina no corpo estriado, porÃm quando associado aos bloqueadores, houve reduÃÃo desses nÃveis, sendo mais acentuada quando essa associaÃÃo foi feita com o etanol na maior dose. Na avaliaÃÃo da atividade da enzima acetilcolinesterase, todas as substÃncias utilizadas associadas ou nÃo, provocaram a reduÃÃo de mais de 60 % na atividade desta enzima, sendo mais evidente na administraÃÃo isolada de atropina, ou seja, as administraÃÃes que apresentaram reduÃÃo significativa da concentraÃÃo de DA, apresentaram tambÃm a atividade da AchE reduzida, evidenciando a interaÃÃo desses dois sistemas, sugerindo-os como possÃveis alvos de aÃÃo no desenvolvimento de medicamento que coadjuvem no tratamento do alcoolismoEthanol is {{an agent}} with nonspecific action, which may interfere in various neurotransmitter systems. Atropine is an alkaloid with blocking {{action of the}} cholinergic system, used in cholinergic intoxication and other with cardiac involvement. The neuroleptic, haloperidol, is an antagonist of dopaminergic pathways, mainly by blocking the D 2 receptor, used {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia in both acute and chronic psychoses and maniac psychotic episodes. Several studies have reported the interaction between the dopaminergic and cholinergic pathway and their interaction separately with the ethanol. This study investigated the behavioral and neurochemical effects produced in the striatum induced by subchronic treatment with ethanol in presence and absence of atropine or haloperidol. Swiss mice were used, females, weighing between 25 - 30 g. The animals were treated with distilled water (control), ethanol (1 or 3 g/kg, po) or pre-treated with haloperidol (0. 5 mg / kg, ip) or atropine (0. 5 mg / kg, ip), this application was thirty minutes before administration of ethanol or distilled water daily for seven days. Thirty minutes after the last drug administration intraperitoneally or sixty minutes after the last oral administration, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests of open field and <b>track</b> <b>rod</b> (locomotors activity), hole board and plus maze (anxiety activity) and then sacrificed with dissection of the striatum for determination of monoamines (norepinephrine, dopamine and its metabolic acid 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylacetic) or the concentration of acetylcholinesterase. Ethanol showed a stimulating effect in depressing the lower dose and higher dose, especially in tests of locomotors activity. When associated with a higher dose, haloperidol showed, in most cases the potentiating effect of ethanol, since atropine in some tests only showed a tendency to reverse this effect only associated with ethanol at the lowest dose, although not observed in all parameters of evaluated. However, the effect produced a modest increase in the concentrations of dopamine in the striatum, but when associated with blockers, a reduction of these levels was more pronounced when the association was made with ethanol at the highest dose. In the evaluation of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, all substances used, combined or not, reduced more than 60 % levels this enzyme, being more evident in the administration of atropine alone, or the authorities which showed a significant reduction in the concentration of AD, also showed reduced AChE, showing the interaction of these two systems, suggesting them as possible targets of action of drug development which contribute to the treatment of alcoholis...|$|E
