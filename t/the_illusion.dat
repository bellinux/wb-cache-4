5|$|Immediately {{after hearing}} the rumours about the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for its protection. Later he sent 300 {{horsemen}} (cavalry was not needed at the trench) as well to protect the city. The loud voices, in which the troops prayed every night, created <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of a large force.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} portray the {{characters}} underwater, the actors wore Heelys wheeled footwear, which simulate the gliding action of swimming creatures. The actors playing Ariel and the other merfolk had wire-frame tails attached to their hips. Subsequent productions feature different designs for Ariel and the merfolk; the Dutch and Japanese productions use wirework and aerial stunts to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of underwater swimming.|$|E

5|$|It's {{about how}} people take drugs to connect to God or {{to a higher level}} of consciousness. I keep saying, 'Plugging into the matrix'. If you get high, you can do that, which is why a lot of people drop acid or do drugs, because they want to get closer to God. But there's going to be a short circuit, and that's <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of drugs, because they give you <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of getting closer to God, but {{ultimately}} they kill you. They destroy you. I mean, I tried everything once, but as soon as I was high, I spent my time drinking tons of water {{to get it out of}} my system. As soon as I was high, I was obsessed with flushing it out of me. I was like, 'OK, I'm done now'.|$|E

5|$|Time is also {{connected}} {{to the theme of}} light and dark. In Shakespeare's day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of its passage.|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. <b>The</b> <b>illusion</b> of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also {{led to the creation of}} the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan's name, proclaiming victory.

His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him. Turkish sources state that <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution.|$|E
50|$|Diana Deutsch (born February 15, 1938 in London, England) is a British-American perceptual and {{cognitive}} psychologist, born in London, England. She is currently {{professor of psychology}} at the University of California San Diego, and is a prominent researcher on the psychology of music. She is known for the musical and auditory illusions that she has discovered, which include <b>the</b> octave <b>illusion,</b> <b>the</b> scale <b>illusion,</b> <b>the</b> glissando <b>illusion,</b> <b>the</b> tritone paradox, <b>the</b> phantom words <b>illusion,</b> <b>the</b> speech-to-song <b>illusion</b> and <b>the</b> cambiata <b>illusion,</b> among others. She also studies the cognitive foundation of musical grammars, the ways in which people hold musical pitches in memory, and the ways in which people relate the sounds of music and speech to each other. In addition, she is acclaimed for her work on absolute pitch, or perfect pitch, which she has shown is far more prevalent among speakers of tone language.|$|R

5|$|Although the Madonna's throne {{is in the}} mid-ground, {{her head}} is level with the {{standing}} figures in the foreground, who are closer in perspective. The apse in which she sits adds to <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of depth and is an expanded area for her throne. A similar approach {{can be seen in}} the later Dresden Triptych, but that work contains a better handling of spatial depth; Mary's throne is moved back, and the donors and saints are relegated to wing panels. The figures in Canon van der Paele are within a more confined space, are somewhat cramped, but far more monumental.|$|E
5|$|Art Director Roger Christian used {{scrap metal}} and parts to create set pieces and props to save money, a {{technique}} he employed {{while working on}} Star Wars. For example, some of the Nostromo corridors were created from portions of scrapped bomber aircraft, and a mirror was used to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of longer corridors in the below-deck area. Special effects supervisors Brian Johnson and Nick Allder made many of the set pieces and props function, including moving chairs, computer monitors, motion trackers, and flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|Both Mulder and Scully stumble {{down the}} stairs in hope of just getting outside to die. They meet up by the door, both {{crawling}} on the floor, covered in massive amounts of blood.

Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E

5|$|Quad {{have now}} brought out five {{generations of the}} classic {{electrostatic}} design. Originally designed for monaural sound in a domestic context, the popularisation of stereophonic sound prompted the manufacturer to modify the electrostatic panels to improve their stereo dispersion. These speakers featured larger panels and a revolutionary stator design, made up of eight concentric rings fed from the centre outwards through analogue delay lines, so that the audio signal gives <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of radiating from a point source one foot behind the panel.|$|E
5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} {{for an audience}} {{in a variety of}} media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E
5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to flatten out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Anomalous motion illusions {{represent}} a popular class of illusions and {{several studies have}} {{made an effort to}} explain their perception. However, understanding is still inconsistent. Age-related differences in susceptibility to illusory motion may contribute to further clarification of the underlying processing mechanisms. We investigated the effect of age on the perception of four different anomalous motion <b>illusions.</b> <b>The</b> Enigma <b>illusion,</b> <b>the</b> Rotating-Snakes <b>illusion,</b> <b>the</b> Pinna <b>illusion,</b> and <b>the</b> Rotating-Tilted-Lines <b>illusion</b> were tested on a total of one hundred and thirty-nine participants covering an age range from 3 to 82 years. In comparison with young adults, children showed a lower likelihood of perceiving motion in all <b>illusions</b> with <b>the</b> exception of <b>the</b> Rotating-Tilted-Lines <b>illusion.</b> For adult subjects, we found significant age effects in <b>the</b> Rotating-Snakes <b>illusion</b> and <b>the</b> Rotating-Tilted-Lines illusion: occurrence of the illusory effect decreased with age. <b>The</b> other two <b>illusions</b> turned out to be unaffected by aging. Finally, intercorrelations between different motion illusions revealed that only <b>the</b> Pinna <b>illusion</b> and <b>the</b> Rotating-Tilted-Lines <b>illusion</b> correlated significantly with each other. The results confirm that anomalous motion illusions should not be considered as a homogeneous group. Possible links between perceptual data and neurophysiological changes related to age are discussed. Perceptual differences due to age provide the opportunity to improve our understanding of illusory motion and point to specific underlying mechanisms. ...|$|R
5|$|The Kraken was {{difficult}} to animate as it had no real-life reference, until animation director Hal Hickel instructed the crew to watch King Kong vs. Godzilla which had a real octopus crawling over miniatures. On the set, two pipes filled with 30,000 pounds of cement were used to crash and split the Edinburgh Trader: Completing <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> are miniature masts and falling stuntmen shot on a bluescreen stage. The scene where the Kraken spits at Jack Sparrow does not use computer-generated spit: it was real gunge thrown at Johnny Depp.|$|E
