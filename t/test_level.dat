40|$|The {{majority}} of software faults {{are present in}} small number of modules, therefore accurate prediction of fault-prone modules helps improve software quality by focusing testing efforts on a subset of modules. This paper evaluates {{the use of the}} faults-slip-through (FST) metric as a potential predictor of fault-prone modules. Rather than predicting the fault-prone modules for the complete test phase, the prediction is done at the specific <b>test</b> <b>levels</b> of integration and system test. We applied eight classification techniques to the task of identifying fault-prone modules, representing a variety of approaches, including a standard statistical technique for classification (logistic regression), tree-structured classifiers (C 4. 5 and random forests), a Bayesian technique (Na"ive Bayes), machine-learning techniques (support vector machines and back-propagation artificial neural networks) and search-based techniques (genetic programming and artificial immune recognition systems) on FST data collected from two large industrial projects from the telecommunication domain. Results: Using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the location of (PF, PD) pairs in the ROC space, GP showed impressive results in comparison with other techniques for predicting fault-prone modules at both integration and system <b>test</b> <b>levels.</b> The use of faults-slip-through metric in general provided good prediction results at the two <b>test</b> <b>levels.</b> The accuracy of GP is statistically significant in comparison with {{majority of}} the techniques for predicting fault-prone modules at integration and system <b>test</b> <b>levels.</b> (ii) Faults-slip-through metric {{has the potential to be}} a generally useful predictor of fault-proneness at integration and system <b>test</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
5|$|Toshack's {{performance}} in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a single wicket in each innings. England won the toss and elected to bat. Toshack trapped the home captain Norman Yardley leg before wicket with a ball that straightened after pitching, ending with 1/28 as England were bowled out for 165. Toshack then came to the wicket at 9/476 and was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 33 with Johnston, scoring 19runs—his best at <b>Test</b> <b>level</b> to date—in just 18minutes, batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner, before falling lbw to Alec Bedser, ending Australia's innings on 509 with a 344-run lead.|$|E
5|$|He then top-scored with 190 in the Third Test in Sydney {{to set up}} a large first innings lead of 270 and an innings victory. Harvey alone {{made more}} than his opponents in the first innings and the innings saw him {{complete}} 1000 Test runs against the South Africans in only eight Tests. Harvey made it consecutive centuries in as many matches, with 84 and 116 in Adelaide. Starting with an on-driven boundary off the first ball of the last day's play, Harvey's century took 106 minutes and was the fastest record in the Australia since World War II and the sixth fastest of all time in Australia. With leading pacemen Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller breaking down in the match, Harvey bowled for only the third time in his Test career. He took his first of three wickets at <b>Test</b> <b>level,</b> that of Russell Endean as a depleted Australian attack could not defeat the visitors who finished seven wickets down.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, and Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves. The score {{had reached}} 117 before Barnes fell to Hollies for 61, ending a partnership {{that had taken}} only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings {{would be his last}} at <b>Test</b> <b>level</b> if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat. Yardley led his team in giving Bradman three cheers. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly. Hassett came in at 117/2 and Australia closed at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77.|$|E

A four-level data flow test approach can be employed to perform structure testing on them.

But that approach was limited because only the basic features of such framew ork are implemented. Therefore, in this research thesis we are further extending that framew ork w ith more specific features implement like specific test agents for each particular type of Web document or object. Moreover, integrating more testing approaches, such as navigation testing, object state testing, statistical testing, etc., is still necessary for a systematic testing approach for Web applications.

5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, and Morris and Barnes passed England's first innings total by themselves. The score {{had reached}} 117 before Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61. The opening stand had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 6 pm {{late on the}} first day. As Bradman had announced that the tour was his last at international level, the innings {{would be his last}} at <b>Test</b> <b>level</b> if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to bat. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving his Australian counterpart three cheers. With 6996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100 in Test cricket, but Hollies bowled him second ball for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Hassett came in at 117/2 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 153/2. Morris was unbeaten on 77, having hit two hook shots from Hollies for four.|$|E
5|$|The Third Test was Johnston's first Test {{in front}} of his home crowd of the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In the first innings, he scored his first runs at <b>Test</b> <b>level,</b> adding five before being run out. He removed both of India's openers, Chandu Sarwate and Mankad, and ended with 2/33 as Australia took a 103-run first innings lead. In the second innings, he did the same, bowling both players, and ended with 4/44 as Australia won by 233 runs. Johnston missed the Fourth Test in Adelaide due to injury but {{returned}} for the Fifth Test in Melbourne where he scored 23 not out and took match figures of 2/29 in another innings victory and Australia ended the summer with a 4–0 win. He headed the series averages with 16 wickets at 11.37. This ensured his selection for the 1948 tour of England as part of Bradman's Invincibles. However, Johnston was less successful outside the Tests, ending the summer with 20 wickets at 21.08.|$|E
5|$|The {{diminutive}} Hassett was {{an elegant}} middle-order batsman, {{known for his}} wide range of strokes, timing, quick footwork and strong wrists. However, as his career progressed and his seniority in the Australian team increased, he became a more cautious player who often frustrated spectators with sedate scoring, particularly after World War II. Despite this, Hassett remained an aggressive and adventurous strokemaker in matches for Victoria. He had a poker face, and this benefited him as a captain, as even his teammates sometimes {{found it hard to}} discern his mood or thinking. During his 24 Test matches in charge, he won 14 games and suffered defeat only four times, but it was the last of the four losses that blighted his record. Hassett was a very occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, averaging one over per first-class match. He took 18 wickets in 216 matches, and never took more than two in a single innings. He never took a wicket at <b>Test</b> <b>level</b> and bowled less than 19 overs.|$|E

40|$|The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) Observatory was {{successfully}} launched on November 18, 1989 using a Delta l expendable launch vehicle. Prior to launch, COBE {{was subjected to}} sinusoidal sweep vibration testing in each of three axes in the 15 Hz to 40 Hz region. The tests were used to qualify COBE for the sustained periodic oscillation events that were expected to occur in flight for the Delta l launch vehicle. These events were called pre-MECO (Main Engine Cutoff) POGO and MECO-POGO. Pre-MECO POGO is also commonly called mini-POGO. This paper will describe the process used to derive the sinusoidal sweep <b>test</b> <b>levels</b> and will present {{a comparison of the}} actual COBE flight data versus the derived <b>test</b> <b>levels.</b> The results show that the derived <b>test</b> <b>levels</b> were sufficient to encompass the levels measured in flight for the COBE mission...|$|R

5|$|While {{this style}} {{facilitated}} his solid defensive play, it inhibited {{him as a}} stroke player and made him susceptible to hand and arm injuries. Such injuries would be common throughout his career. One such injury almost required {{the tip of a}} broken finger to be amputated. He was occasionally vulnerable to left-arm bowlers, either due to his inability to adjust his line of stroke or because during his career there were few fast left-hand bowlers for him to practise against in the nets. Boycott himself disputes this. In spite of that, he was never vulnerable to any one particular bowler. Pace bowler Dennis Lillee was the most successful against him in Test matches, with seven dismissals. Gary Sobers also dismissed him seven times, but Lillee did so in fewer matches. Peter Lever, a Test colleague, discussed with Boycott his vulnerability when playing the hook stroke, which was to get him out on more than one occasion. Overall in Test cricket, 54% of Boycott's dismissals were by being caught, with lbw and bowled taking 14% and 16% respectively. Boycott was an occasional medium-pace inswing bowler. He was never a genuine all-rounder, but took seven wickets at <b>Test</b> <b>level</b> at an average of 54.57, often bowling wearing his cap turned back-to-front to assist his vision.|$|E
5|$|A right-arm fast bowler of express pace, Lindwall {{was widely}} {{regarded}} as the greatest pace bowler of his era and one of the finest of all time. Together with Keith Miller, Lindwall formed a new-ball pairing {{regarded as one of the}} greatest to have played cricket. Lindwall was known for his classical style, with a smooth and rhythmic run-up and textbook side-on bowling action, from which he generated his trademark outswinger which moved away late at high pace. Lindwall mixed his outswinger with a searing yorker, subtle changes of pace and an intimidating bouncer that skidded at the heads of opposing batsmen. Later in his career, Lindwall developed an inswinger, which together with his variety, pace and control made him the most feared paceman of his time. Lindwall was a fine all round cricketer; he was a hard-hitting batsman who scored two centuries at <b>Test</b> <b>level</b> and often improved Australia's position with his lower order batting. Lindwall's best known performance was his role in leading the Australian bowling during the 1948 tour of England under Don Bradman; the 1948 Australian team went through the tour undefeated and gained the sobriquet The Invincibles which saw it regarded as one of the finest teams in cricketing history. Lindwall's place in Australian cricket history saw him inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members. In 2000, Lindwall was named in the Australian Cricket Board's Team of the Century.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only Arthur Morris as a {{specialist}} opener. Johnson was thus deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He had never opened at <b>Test</b> <b>level,</b> but had once batted at No. 3 when used as a nightwatchman {{after the fall of}} the first wicket late on a day's play. He was unable to make an impact—Bedser removed him for one, caught by Evans at chest height off the inside edge from a ball that reared from the pitch. It was a difficult catch as Evans was standing up to the stumps and he had little time to react to the ball's change of direction. O'Reilly criticised the use of Johnson as an opener, as vice-captain Lindsay Hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach. Johnson's dismissal brought Bradman in to face the new ball. The Australian captain thus had to face Bedser, who had already dismissed him three times in the Tests with a new ball, and Pollard, who had troubled him in the match against Lancashire. Pollard then trapped Bradman lbw with an off cutter that struck the Australian captain on the back foot for seven to leave Australia in trouble at 13/2. This provoked a strong cheer from the crowd in support of Pollard, the Lancashire local. Australia were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming for leg stump to stifle the scoring. He was partnered by Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes.|$|E

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{software testing}} {{strategies for the}} Radio Network Controller (RNC) RadioNetwork Handler (RNH) subsystem at the WCDMA development department at Ericsson AB. Due to the rapid development {{in the area of}} radio communication It is crucial to constantly develop and deliver new software components without errors in the code, which has to be tested and proved to work on a regular basis. Since development teams are working in parallel, one cannot uphold another team for long periods for testing purposes. It should be easy and straightforward to implement and maintain RNH tests. The main goal is to propose the best way of software testing for the RNH subsystem with respect to the agile way of working. In {{the first part of this}} work an investigation of the RNH software was done. This was to define a template for code classification. The aim of the classification is to identify a smallest testable unit for different <b>testing</b> <b>levels.</b> The data classes were considered as smallest testable unit for <b>testing</b> on low <b>level.</b> In the second part, unit test was deployed to two different blocks to evaluate unit testing and prove testability of data classes on a low level. In addition, the automated regression test framework was evaluated with respect to node <b>level</b> <b>testing</b> performance. In the third part, unit test was evaluated in comparison to the current <b>testing</b> <b>level</b> at RNH. The major result of this investigation shows all <b>testing</b> <b>levels</b> are required for the RNH subsystem, because each level focuses on a specific area of software testing. Furthermore, unit testing is recommended to be a permanent <b>testing</b> <b>level</b> at RNH subsystem, since unit testing is promoted by agile testing strategies (test as early as possible). Besides, when more detailed <b>test</b> on low <b>level</b> (unit <b>testing)</b> is applied, it may lead to the less testing effort on higher level...|$|R
5|$|Toshack's {{performance}} in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a wicket in each innings. He was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 32 with Johnston, scoring 19runs, his best at <b>Test</b> <b>level</b> to date in just 18minutes. Toshack's best Test performance was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's when Miller was unable to bowl after being injured, including the wickets of Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, captain Yardley and Alec Coxon. During this performance, he employed two short legs and a silly mid-off. He had a moderately successful Third Test, taking figures of 3/101 in the only Test that Australia did not win. His knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test after taking an ineffective 1/112 in the first innings, {{he was unable to}} bowl in the second innings of an Australian win. He made a recovery and it was hoped that {{he would be able to}} play in the Fifth Test, but he injured again himself in the lead-up match against Lancashire. He was taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his tour and his Test career. An inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in first-class fixtures, Toshack managed a Test average of 51 on the 1948 tour after being out only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in an uninhibited tenth-wicket stand with Johnston. Due to the fragility of his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour. Toshack totalled 50 wickets at the average of 21.12 for the tour.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall had no {{intentions}} to retire. He continued onto the early 1955 {{tour of the}} West Indies, the first by an Australian team to the Caribbean. Lindwall was determined to enjoy himself, having recovered from his recent illness. By day, he and Miller battled with the three W's but at night they socialised. However, Lindwall needed respite and dietary discipline in order to completely ward off his hepatitis. He {{was no longer the}} reveller that Miller once knew. After Australia had made 9/515, Lindwall took a match total of 6/124, as the hosts were forced to follow on in the First Test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica. Australia went on to win by nine wickets. The team's travelled to Queen's Park in Trinidad for the Second Test, where the West Indies batted first and made 382. This time Lindwall bowled a long spell of 24.5 overs, and eventually prized out six of the West Indians for the cost of 95 runs. The culmination of this was a spell of 4/16. Australia replied with 9/600, with Lindwall contributing an unbeaten 37 with the bat. Lindwall's match soured in the second innings when he broke down with an achilles tendon problem as the match ended in a draw. Lindwall recovered {{for the start of the}} Third Test at Bourda in Georgetown, Guyana. Lindwall had a quiet time in a spin dominated game, taking two wickets in an eight-wicket Australian victory. Australia won the toss and batted in the Fourth Test at Bridgetown, Barbados. Australia had already reached 6/439 when Lindwall came to the crease. In a highly aggressive innings, he reached his fifty in 69 minutes and was unbeaten on 80 at stumps. The next morning, he went on the make his second Test century, scoring 118 with two sixes and 16 fours. It was his second century at <b>Test</b> <b>level,</b> eight years after his first, but showed the same counter-attacking aggression. Lindwall had another quiet match with two wickets in another high scoring draw with both teams amassing more than 500 in the first innings. Lindwall finished the series with four wickets in the Fifth Test in Jamaica as Australia completed a 3–0 series win with another innings triumph. In a high scoring series, Lindwall had taken 20 wicket at 31.85 while also scoring 187 runs at 37.40, a strong all round performance.|$|E
