[...] One of these clients is chosen by the group as the protagonist, and the director calls on the other clients to assist the protagonist's [...] "performance," [...] either by portraying other characters, or by utilizing mirroring, doubling, or role reversal. [...] The clients act {{out a number of}} scenes in order to allow the protagonist to work through certain scenarios. [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> beneficial for the protagonist, but also is helpful to the other group members, allowing them to assume the role of another person and apply that experience to their own life. [...] The focus during the session is on the acting out of different scenarios, rather than simply talking through them.

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Brian Lowry of Variety said: [...] "Despite a pedigree that includes Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz {{and many of}} that program's stars, Sit Down seldom rises above sniggering double entendre." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode B, saying: [...] "I'm staying optimistic that the characters {{are going to get}} fleshed out in upcoming episodes, because <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> going to be a character-based ensemble comedy." [...] Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode, noting the [...] "familiar aspects" [...] of [...] Arrested Development, such as the [...] "deft wordplay, biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor". He concluded, saying: [...] "As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter, this should continue to be a very entertaining show." [...] Kona Gallagher [...] of TV Squad watched the episode twice, and said that it [...] "definitely grows on you." [...] She concluded, saying: [...] "In all, I think the first time you watch Sit Down, Shut Up, it's really easy to blow it off as another animated show that's trying too hard. However, it's actually worth sticking around and watching a couple of episodes." ...|$|E

Several older musicians expressed their discontent; Kirito (Pierrot, Angelo) said [...] "now it's more like people are dressing up a certain way {{because they want to}} be visual kei or look visual kei.

At his retirement ceremony at his headquarters in Naples, Italy on January 31, 1968, Griffin asserted that the relatively peaceful Soviet posture in central Europe was a tactical move to cover a thrust of naval forces into the Mediterranean, and complained that France's recent withdrawal from NATO was tantamount to freeriding off the contributions of allies who met their treaty obligations. [...] "NATO's great shield of collective security has become so broad that it even covers those who say they no longer choose to contribute to its support, giving them freedom to pursue their policy of withdrawal, secure in the knowledge that, in a showdown, they would still share the benefits of its great protection. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> a game which only a few can play, for if {{all of us were}} to be so foolhardy, the alliance, as an effective institution, would cease to exist.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Interscope notifying mainstream media outlets on upcoming releases for Artpop in July 2013, Gaga {{announced plans for}} a multimedia application software which [...] "combines music, art, fashion, and technology with a new interactive worldwide community". Relative Wave, the architects behind Björk's multimedia app for Biophilia (2011), took nearly a year to develop the Artpop app. Some dismissed the project as an elaborate ploy to inflate album sales, under the assumption Billboard would count a downloaded track as a complete unit. Editorial director Bill Werde later addressed these concerns on in July 2013, [...] "As we understand, Gaga fans will get [...] Artpop app for free and can buy the album [...] app. Albums purchased this way would count on Billboard charts, however, ... concerns about self-reported data by Gaga's [...] seem unfounded– sales will be fulfilled and reported by existing digital retailers... for those who may ask: <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> different from Jay Z's Magna Carta Holy Grail / Samsung [...] which—via an app—gave [...] for free [...] had no option for fans to buy."

2500|$|Voldemort {{appears at}} {{the climax of the}} fifth book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, having again plotted against Harry. In this book, Harry goes through extreme {{emotional}} stress, and according to Rowling, it was necessary to prove that Harry is emotionally vulnerable and thus human, in contrast to his nemesis Voldemort, who is emotionally invulnerable and thus inhuman: [...] " [...] a very human hero, and <b>this</b> <b>is,</b> <b>obviously,</b> there’s a contrast, between him, as a very human hero, and Voldemort, who has deliberately dehumanised himself. [...] and Harry, therefore, did have to reach a point where he did almost break down." [...] In this book, Voldemort makes liberal use of the Ministry of Magic's refusal to believe that he has returned. Voldemort engineers a plot to free Bellatrix Lestrange and other Death Eaters from Azkaban and then embarks on a scheme to retrieve the full record of a prophecy stored in the Department of Mysteries regarding Harry and himself. He sends a group of Death Eaters to retrieve the prophecy, where the Order of the Phoenix meets them. All but Bellatrix are captured, and Voldemort engages in a ferocious duel with Dumbledore. When Dumbledore gets the upper hand, Voldemort attempts to possess Harry but finds that he cannot; Harry is too full of that which Voldemort finds incomprehensible, and which he detests as weakness: love. Sensing that Dumbledore could win, Voldemort disapparates, but not before the Minister for Magic sees him in person, making his return to life public knowledge in the next book.|$|E
2500|$|N.T. Wright, {{the former}} Anglican bishop and {{professor}} of NT history at Cambridge and Oxford, now Research Professor of New Testament and Early Christianity at St Mary's College in the University of St Andrews in Scotland, also sees the dating of Thomas in the 2nd or 3rd century A.D. Wright's reasoning for this dating is that the [...] "narrative framework" [...] of 1st century Judaism and the New Testament is radically different from the worldview expressed in the sayings collected in the Gospel of Thomas. Thomas makes an anachronistic mistake by turning Jesus the Jewish prophet into a Hellenistic/Cynic philosopher. Wright concludes his section on the Gospel of Thomas in his book The New Testament and the People of God in this way: [...] " [...] implicit story {{has to do with}} a figure who imparts a secret, hidden wisdom to those close to him, so that they can perceive a new truth and be saved by it. 'The Thomas Christians are told the truth about their divine origins, and given the secret passwords that will prove effective in the return journey to their heavenly home.' <b>This</b> <b>is,</b> <b>obviously,</b> the non-historical story of Gnosticism... It is simply the case that, on good historical grounds, it is far more likely that the book represents a radical translation, and indeed subversion, of first-century Christianity into a quite different sort of religion, than that it represents the original of which the longer gospels are distortions... Thomas reflects a symbolic universe, and a worldview, which are radically different from those of the early Judaism and Christianity." ...|$|E
