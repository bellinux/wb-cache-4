5|$|By the mid-1930s, No.1 AD {{comprised}} 350 staff; {{the overall}} {{strength of the}} RAAF at this time was under 2,000. The depot serviced a range of aircraft that included the Westland Wapiti, Bristol Bulldog, Hawker Demon, de Havilland Dragon Rapide, Avro Cadet, Avro Anson, and North American NA-16. The NA-16 was later augmented by {{the purchase of the}} more advanced North American NA-33, which was licensed and built in Australia by the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation as the CAC Wirraway. To cope with the Government's decision to rapidly expand the RAAF, a Recruit <b>Training</b> <b>Section,</b> incorporating the nascent School of Armaments and Signals, was formed under the depot's auspices by Flight Lieutenant Charles Eaton on 1March 1935; it was reorganised as Recruit Training Squadron on 1September 1936. No.1 AD also commenced formal training courses for aircraft fitters and riggers in 1935, leading to the formation of No.1 School of Technical Training five years later.|$|E

The C-130Hs were retired in 2012, and with them No.285 Squadron's C-130H simulator; the simulator remained at Richmond until 2016, when it was sent to Jakarta to support training for the Indonesian Air Force's fleet of ex-RAAF C-130Hs.
