He used {{to take me to}} see cowboy movies all the time when I was a little boy because I loved cowboy movies. He got a cowboy name for me, which was Smokey Joe. So from the time I was three years old if people asked me what my name was I didn't tell them my name was William, I told them my name was Smokey Joe. That's what everyone called me until I was about 12 and then I dropped the Joe part. I've heard that story about him giving it <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> I'm a light skinned Black man but that's not true.|$|E
500|$|Aguilera further commented {{about the}} event with USA Today, [...] "When you're {{part of a}} pop phenomenon, {{you have so many}} {{opinions}} shoved down your throat. People try to tell you what you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening for me, it was popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> it's so boring and superficial".|$|E

In a statement {{released by the}} gallery, Dylan said, [...] "I've been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I {{was born and raised}} in iron ore country, where you could breathe it and smell it every day. Gates appeal <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding the record, Smith said: [...] "I {{thought my}} head would be chopped off {{immediately}} {{when it came}} out because {{at the time it was}} so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular... The thing is that album was really well received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed , unfortunately." [...] Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: [...] "The idea of playing [...] for people didn't occur <b>to</b> <b>me...</b> <b>because</b> at the time it was the Northwest—Mudhoney and Nirvana—and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo while the {{production}} was handled by Dave Fortman. It was recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles, mixed by Dave Fortman at Ocean Way Studios, Los Angeles and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound, New York. The programming was done by DJ Lethal. Talking about The Open Door, Lee said that lot of people expected the new songs on the album to be similar with [...] "My Immortal" [...] (2003) before adding that [...] "'Weight of the World', 'Sweet Sacrifice' and 'All That I'm Living For' are so amazing <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> of the adrenaline. Especially when we play them live." [...] She further revealed the inspiration behind the song, ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, Levine {{took part}} in an {{educational}} campaign {{to raise awareness of}} Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The project, titled [...] "Own It", was created by Shire and organized in collaboration with the Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA), Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADHD). The project targets people who were previously diagnosed with the disorder, focusing on how it may continue into adulthood. Levine, who himself was diagnosed with it as a teenager, said, [...] "This campaign is important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> it can help young adults and adults realize that there's a chance they may still have ADHD if they had it as a kid". In connection to this, he wrote an article in ADDitude Magazine about his personal experience with it.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Ralph Bakshi {{decided that}} it was time to make another {{animated}} film. According to Bakshi, [...] "I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought it would be nice to pick up a piece of change. So I called my lawyer, who was still speaking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where I should go to sell a movie." [...] Bakshi pitched Cool World to Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's animation division) as an animated horror film. The concept of the film involved a cartoon and live action human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder the father who abandoned her. Bakshi states that Paramount Pictures [...] "bought the idea in ten seconds".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Gould {{published}} The Structure of Evolutionary Theory (2002), a long treatise recapitulating {{his version of}} modern evolutionary theory. In episode 13 of the Dutch TV series Of Beauty and Consolation Gould remarked, [...] "In {{a couple of years}} I will be able to gather in one volume my view of how evolution works. It is to me a great consolation because it represents the putting together of a lifetime of thinking into one source. That book will never be particularly widely read. It's going to be far too long, and it's only for a few thousand professionals—very different from my popular science writings—but it is of greater consolation <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> it is a chance to put into one place a whole way of thinking about evolution that I've struggled with all my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Carmen Bryan, Nas' ex-wife, was {{critical}} of the song, calling it a [...] "disappointment" [...] while claiming via Twitter, [...] "He had nothing positive to say about our daughter and his depiction of her is false!" [...] In response, American rapper Common defended Nas for his personal songwriting and likened [...] "Daughters" [...] to his own 1997 song [...] "Retrospect for Life", which he wrote about his girlfriend's abortion. [...] "I've had people come <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> of those type of songs and say it changed their life", Common told XXL. [...] "Or somebody be like, 'Man, that song made me decide to have my child instead of having an abortion.'

500|$|Petrucci and keyboardist Jordan Rudess {{wrote the}} album's music {{independently}} {{from the rest}} of Dream Theater by getting together everyday, going over ideas in the morning, and then working through the music during the day and night. Upon finishing their initial drafts, they presented them {{to the rest of the}} band, who worked on writing parts for their own instruments. In an interview with Artisan News, drummer Mike Mangini reflected, [...] "The biggest challenge for me was interpreting the initial music that was given <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> there were no drums. So , 'All right, I need to listen to this, really, as a whole piece to understand where I should kind of let loose or I should lay back a lot.' All that. Just to see it as a whole, 'cause I don't wanna play blindly or try to fit too much where it doesn't belong." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Holmes from Destructoid {{questioned}} {{the controversy over}} the decision by stating [...] "While there are surely plenty of folks who adore seeing their screen filled with frilly thong shots, I imagine there may be even more players out there who'd find the sudden prioritization of arse in their fighting games to be little out of place." [...] Chris Carter at Destructoid commented [...] "It's still a bit weird that something this goofy was removed, especially with the design Laura has in general," [...] and noted that a character like Necalli is [...] "probably far more harmful" [...] for children's eyes. In another article by Destructoid, Carter stated [...] "It's such a weird thing <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> R. Mika's butt is still very visible, she just doesn't lightly tap it a few times per match." [...] Likewise, ND Medina at iDigitalTimes expressed confusion over the change, noting that her full butt was still being exposed. The butt slap was later restored as a mod for the PC version, albeit in a different pose.|$|E
500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever. [...] For many, winning {{a share of the}} prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. [...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> I know that I can use this money {{to do a lot of}} good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity.

500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. [...] The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. [...] Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, [...] "What can I do for you, Sarge?", Mitsui responded, [...] "What are you doing to me? I served my country. [...] You've taken everything away from me.... What are the good of my medals?" [...] He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. [...] He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. [...] Mitsui later stated, [...] "I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be doing anything <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> of being a veteran." [...] All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried.|$|E
500|$|Since its airing, [...] "The Injury" [...] has {{received}} critical acclaim from television critics. The scene featuring Dwight crashing his car received specific attention. IGN ranked {{the scene with}} Dwight getting {{in a car accident}} as its seventh-best moment in the first two seasons, noting that [...] "he fact that this show can get such inspired and unusual comedy from what is essentially a puke joke is a testament to how clever The Office is." [...] Rolling Stone named the same scene as the twentieth-funniest in The Offices first three seasons. TV Squad's Michael Sciannamea said that [...] "The Injury" [...] was [...] "another solid episode" [...] and that the [...] "show gets better with each and every week." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A–". Francis Rizzo III from DVD Talk wrote positively of the episode and praised the performance of Rainn Wilson as Dwight and wrote that [...] "nothing he does compares" [...] to his performance in [...] "The Injury". He called Wilson's performance as Dwight [...] "flat-out strange" [...] and noted that the episode, along with several others, [...] "wouldn't be nearly as entertaining" [...] without his character. Mindy Kaling later stated in an interview that it was her favorite episode of the show that she had written. She later expanded that the entry's [...] "full-on loopy" [...] quality made it humorous. She noted that the episode was [...] "so funny <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> what happened to [...] is so stupid." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
