5|$|As the new emperor, Macrinus had to {{deal with}} the major threat of the Parthians, with whom Rome were {{currently}} at war. An indecisive battle at Nisibis is cited as a reason for the opening of peace negotiations. Negotiations may have been favourable for both sides; Rome was being threatened by Armenia and Dacia, and the Parthians were far from home and low on supplies. The settlement, however, was viewed by many people as being unfavourable to Rome. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a concession of 200 million Sesterces was rendered to the Parthians in exchange for peace. Historian Andrew Scott doubts the credibility of <b>this</b> <b>high</b> figure, noting that Dio's records are frequently unreliable on finances. Regardless, the prevailing opinion accuses Macrinus of being cowardly and weak during negotiations.|$|E

About 100 species occur in the Palaearctic. A few species are found in southern Europe, and a single species is in England, the New Forest cicada, Melampsalta montana, which also occurs in continental Europe.|$|E

5|$|Of all the {{measured}} parameters for this planet, the value for orbital eccentricity {{is the most}} uncertain. The frequently cited value of 0.7 for Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity is inconsistent {{with the presence of}} the proposed asteroid belt at a distance of 3AU. If the eccentricity was actually <b>this</b> <b>high,</b> the planet would pass through the asteroid belt and clear it out within about ten thousand years. If the belt has existed for longer than this period, which appears likely, it imposes an upper limit on Epsilon Eridanib's eccentricity of about 0.10–0.15. If the dust disk is instead being generated from the outer debris disk, rather than from collisions in an asteroid belt, then no constraints on the planet's orbital eccentricity are needed to explain the dust distribution.|$|E

While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious threat to the Republic.
