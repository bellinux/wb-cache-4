50|$|A {{variation}} of the omega wrap, such as that used by Echo Science Corporation of Mountain View, California in its instrumentation and high resolution video recorders in the late 1970s and 1980s, wraps the 1-inch tape about 190 degrees around the two-headed drum, so there is signal overlap between the two heads. Head switching in video recorders occurs instantaneously in the video models, during an horizontal sync interval. With a standard NTSC video signal a head can cover one sixth of a field each time it passed across the <b>tape.</b> <b>Switching</b> in instrumentation models is gradual, so the signals from both heads overlaps briefly, producing a transient-free output signal where the original signal does not contain convenient dead intervals during which a switching transient can be hidden.|$|E

With the help of large capacity disk, writing to tape is less problematic than reading from tape. We are investigating how to use multiple tape libraries to build a parallel tape storage system with high aggregated data retrieval bandwidth. The challenge lies in that increasing data transfer parallelism may also increase <b>tape</b> <b>switch</b> time and data seek time that reduce the effective data retrieval bandwidth. We are proposing a novel scheme to place objects across tape drives based on object access pattern to reduce <b>tape</b> <b>switch</b> time and in the meanwhile increase data transfer parallelism.

The research {{presented in}} this thesis includes the design, fabrication, and experimental verification of a novel multiband log periodic dipole array antenna. The antenna was designed to provide both omnidirectional and directional radiation patterns across its operational frequency bands at 1. 8 GHz, 3. 0 GHz, and 5. 0 to 7. 0 GHz, respectively. It was designed to provide reconfigurable operation with switching elements implemented with PIN diodes and associated bias networks. It was also designed for inexpensive fabrication and assembly processes, using industry-standard FR- 4 and commercially available surface-mount components. The antenna was modeled and simulated using Ansys High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS). Additional circuit simulation for the lumped components, switching elements, and their bias circuits was performed using the circuit simulator in Ansys Designer. The antenna was first fabricated by milling unused copper from copper-clad pre-preg FR- 4 stock material. However, as the copper cladding became delaminated during the measurement process, the antenna was refabricated using an inexpensive prototyping service. The simulated and measured scattering parameters (S 11) and radiation patterns are generally in acceptable agreement. However, there are some discrepancies in the simulated and measured radiation patterns in the low frequency bands. This was investigated further by performing an additional set of measurements with copper <b>tape</b> <b>switches</b> instead of PIN diode switches. With the copper ribbon configuration, there was good agreement with the simulated data in both the S 11 data and radiation patterns. Finally, {{it was concluded that}} the differences between the simulated data and the measured data with PIN diodes was due to the wires required to bias the PIN diodes...|$|R

Theoretical part of this thesis identifies options which generally lead to higher safety and availability of applications, regardless of the solution. A package of cloud services (called Productivity Suite) was defined, based on the customers' requirements, which is built on Microsoft platform and combined of the following products: Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Lync and is intended to be used by end customers. Specification of the service package, identified opportunities for strengthening the level of security and requirements of potential customers are the primary inputs for designing safe cloud infrastructure, which is the main contribution of this thesis. First step of designing infrastructure is to choose the service provider of data center, who will operate the solution. A decision must be made to select leased solution or owned components. The result of this part is a calculation, which contains all HW components (servers, firewalls, <b>switches,</b> <b>tape</b> library backups, disk arrays) and SW components considering the licensing policy, SSL certificate, domain, backup solution and other operating costs.

40|$|Monitoring large {{clusters}} is {{a challenging}} problem. It {{is necessary to}} observe a large quantity of devices with a reasonably short delay between consecutive observations. The set of monitored devices may include PCs, network <b>switches,</b> <b>tape</b> libraries and other equipments. The monitoring activity should not impact the performances of the system. In this paper we present PerfMC, a monitoring system for large clusters. PerfMC is driven by an XML configuration file, and uses the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) for data collection. SNMP is a standard protocol implemented by many networked equipments, so the tool {{can be used to}} monitor a wide range of devices. System administrators can display informations on the status of each device by connecting to a WEB server embedded in PerfMC. The WEB server can produce graphs showing the value of different monitored quantities as a function of time; it can also produce arbitrary XML pages by applying XSL Transformations to an internal XML representation of the cluster's status. XSL Transformations may be used to produce HTML pages which can be displayed by ordinary WEB browsers. PerfMC aims at being relatively easy to configure and operate, and highly efficient. It is currently being used to monitor the Italian Reprocessing farm for the BaBar experiment, which is made of about 200 dual-CPU Linux machines.

40|$|When {{backing up}} {{a large number of}} {{computer}} systems to many different storage devices, an administrator has to balance the workload to ensure the successful completion of all backups within a particular period of time. When these devices were magnetic tapes, this assignment was trivial: find an idle tape drive, write what fits on a tape, and replace tapes as needed. Backing up data onto deduplicating disk storage adds both complexity and opportunity. Since one cannot swap out a filled disk-based file system the way one <b>switches</b> <b>tapes,</b> each separate backup appliance needs an appropriate workload that fits into both the available storage capacity and the throughput available during the backup window. Repeating a given client’s backups on the same appliance not only reduces capacity requirements but it can improve performance by eliminating duplicates from network traffic. Conversely, any reconfiguration of the mappings of backup clients to appliances suffers the overhead of repopulating the new appliance with a full copy of a client’s data. Reassigning clients to new servers should only be done when the need for load balancing exceeds the overhead of the move. In addition, deduplication offers the opportunity for content-aware load balancing that groups clients together for improved deduplication that can further improve both capacity and performance; we have seen a system with as much as 75 % of its data overlapping other systems, though overlap around 10 % is more common. We describe an approach for clustering backup clients based on content, assigning them to backup appliances, and adapting future configurations based on changing requirements while minimizing client migration. We define a cost function and compare several algorithms for minimizing this cost. This assignment tool resides in a tier between backup software such as EMC NetWorker and deduplicating storage systems such as EMC Data Domain. ∗ Work done during an internship...|$|R
