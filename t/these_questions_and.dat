25|$|The Protestants {{characterize}} the dogma concerning the Pope as Christ's representative {{head of the}} Church on earth, the concept of works made meritorious by Christ, and the Catholic idea of a treasury of the merits of Christ and his saints, as a denial that Christ is the only mediator between God and man. Catholics, on the other hand, maintained the traditional understanding of Judaism on <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> appealed to the universal consensus of Christian tradition.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} of Uzbekistan has acknowledged {{the extent of}} the country's environmental problems, and it has made a commitment to address them in its Biodiversity Action Plan. But the governmental structures to deal with these problems remain confused and ill-defined. Old agencies and organizations have been expanded to address <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> new ones have been created, resulting in a bureaucratic web of agencies with no generally understood commitment to attack environmental problems directly. Various nongovernmental and grassroots environmental organizations also have begun to form, some closely tied to the current government and others assuming an opposition stance. For example, environmental issues were prominent points in the original platform of Birlik, the first major opposition movement to emerge in Uzbekistan. By the mid-1990s, such issues had become a key concern of all opposition groups and a cause of growing concern among the population as a whole.|$|E
25|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to address <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> many others. The starting point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of particle physics can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, there is only one kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. In string theory, one of the vibrational states of the string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force. Thus string theory is a theory of quantum gravity.|$|E

25|$|What greatly {{facilitates}} statistical accuracy {{by reducing}} non-response bias is that answering questions is sometimes required by law. Some surveys must be answered. This requirement lessens agency expense, practically eliminates non-response bias (a perennial headache for most private market researchers), and improves accuracy. For example, for the General Social Survey, people are selected randomly for 10-minute phone interviews which sometimes ask personal {{questions such as}} wage and salary information. But people must answer <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> won't be paid for their time. It's required by the Statistics Act 1975. This policy is substantially different from countries such as the United States, where answering official surveys is rarely compulsory, including responding to its census which is done every ten years. Further, if a person doesn't get a census survey for any reason, {{he or she is}} still obligated to visit a local census bureau, get one, fill it out, and return it; the government can't be held accountable for mixing up an address. Questionnaires can be downloaded from the Internet via the Statistics New Zealand website.|$|E
500|$|The Stanley {{plan also}} {{established}} {{a committee to}} investigate race relations and integration in Virginia. [...] This committee was officially titled the Virginia Committee on Law Reform and Racial Activities, but was publicly known as the [...] "Thomson Committee" [...] after its chair, Delegate James McIlhany Thomson. In 1954, David Scull (a printer in Annandale, Virginia) began publishing pro-integration literature {{on behalf of a}} number of organizations in Virginia. The Fairfax Citizens' Council, a group opposed to desegregation, publicized Scull's role in the printing of the literature in 1957. Scull was subpoenaed to appear before the Thomson Committee, and subjected to an aggressive series of questions (many of which did not pertain to the committee's legal charge). Scull refused to answer some of <b>these</b> <b>questions,</b> <b>and</b> the committee went to court to force him to answer. A state circuit court ruled against Scull and ordered him to answer the questions. He refused, and was convicted of contempt of court.|$|E
2500|$|The {{success of}} The Guide to Science {{convinced}} Brewer that his readers still accepted religious explanations rather than evolutionary theory. Following {{the publication of}} On the Origin of Species in 1859, Brewer wrote Theology in Science; or The Testimony of Science to the Wisdom and Goodness of God (published in 1860) in order to demonstrate that evolution had not destroyed theological tradition and to continue The Guide to Sciences promotion of natural theology. The book's popularity also resulted in Brewer being sent [...] "a large number of questions on all imaginary matters". <b>These</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> their answers became the nucleus of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, first published in 1870. This latter book has long outlived all of Brewer's other publications and remains a classic reference work.|$|E

2500|$|The special {{theory of}} {{relativity}} is a formulation {{of the relationship between}} physical observations and the concepts of space and time. The theory arose out of contradictions between electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics and had great impact on both those areas. The original historical issue was whether it was meaningful to discuss the electromagnetic wave-carrying [...] "ether" [...] and motion relative to it and also whether one could detect such motion, as was unsuccessfully attempted in the Michelson–Morley experiment. Einstein demolished <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> the ether concept in his special {{theory of relativity}}. However, his basic formulation does not involve detailed electromagnetic theory. It arises out of the question: [...] "What is time?" [...] Newton, in the Principia (1686), had given an unambiguous answer: [...] "Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external, and by another name is called duration." [...] This definition is basic to all classical physics.|$|E
2500|$|Stockler {{arrived in}} Lisbon and was {{immediately}} arrested, by order of the Cortes, resulting in a long process in the press, debates and ridicule. His actions were refuted by Luiz Manuel de Moura Cabral, of the Casa da Supplicação, in letters that described the events {{on the island of}} Terceira, in addition to illustrated observations in Campeão Lisbonense, Voz da Verdade provada por documentos and the pamphlet Voz da Verdade, as well as an analysis of the libelous Noticia resumida dos acontecimentos da ilha Terceira na installação do seu governo constitucional. Finally, Stockler responded in his own name in some critical notes, published in 1822 by Dr. Vicente José Ferreira Cardoso da Costa, to the Count of Arcos. All <b>these</b> <b>questions</b> <b>and</b> judicial processes end with the fall of the constitutional government in 1823, resulting from the Vilafrancada, leaving Stockler with an unblemished record {{in the eyes of the}} absolutist government. As a result, on 10 June 1823, it was concluded that Stockler provided loyal service to the Crown within the legals bestowed on him, and his career rehabilitated, along with Bishop Manuel Nicolau de Almeida. As one of the politicians liberated in the aftermath, Stockler was seen as a celebrity, and nominated to elaborate the Legal Charter, following the revocation of the former-constitution. But, the commission was extinguished before ever producing a new Charter, and Stockler was re-appointed Captain-General of the Azores and invested with title of Baron of Vila da Praia by decree, [...] on the 29 September 1823.|$|E

40|$|Rotational Inertia is an {{integral}} part of any electric power system. Due to the increased use of power electronics-both to connect Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and as drives for electric motors-inertia levels are generally reduced and become time dependent. The same power electronic technologies can also be used to actively provide inertia to the power system, raising the question what effect changes in inertia has on power system stability, and how to best place devices providing virtual inertia. We propose an optimization program that answers <b>these</b> <b>question,</b> <b>and</b> analytically derive the sensitivities of transient frequency overshoot and damping ratio to inertia and damping.
