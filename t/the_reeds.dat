5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding species, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in <b>the</b> <b>reeds,</b> and is also a major migration stopoff and wintering site. There are also several nationally or locally scarce invertebrates and plants specialised for this coastal habitat. It has five bird hides and an environmentally friendly visitor centre and further expansion is planned through the acquisition of neighbouring land and improvements to visitor facilities.|$|E
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning {{that it would be better}} to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by <b>the</b> <b>Reeds</b> and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} illustrations depict <b>the</b> type of <b>reed</b> {{typical of}} harmonicas, pitch pipes, accordions, and reed organs {{as it goes}} through a cycle of vibration. One side of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> frame is omitted from the images for clarity; in reality, the frame completely encloses <b>the</b> <b>reed.</b> Airflow over one side of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> creates an {{area of low pressure}} on that side (see the Bernoulli's principle article for details), causing <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> to flex towards the low-pressure side. <b>The</b> <b>reed</b> frame is constructed so that the flexing of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> obstructs <b>the</b> airflow, which reduces or eliminates the low pressure area and allows <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> to flex back.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> {{mouthpiece}} and <b>reed</b> {{are surrounded}} by the player's lips, which put light, even pressure on <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and form an airtight seal. Air is blown past <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and down <b>the</b> instrument. In {{the same way a}} flag flaps in the breeze, the air rushing past <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> causes it to vibrate. As air pressure from the mouth increases, <b>the</b> amount <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> vibrates increases until <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> hits <b>the</b> mouthpiece. At this point <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> stays pressed against the mouthpiece until either the springiness of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> forces it to open or a returning pressure wave 'bumps' into <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and opens it. Each time <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> opens, a puff of air goes through the gap, after which <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> swings shut again. When played loudly, <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> can spend up to 50% of the time shut. The 'puff of air' or compression wave (around 3% greater pressure than the surrounding air) travels down the cylindrical tube and escapes {{at the point where the}} tube opens out. This is either at the closest open hole or at the end of the tube (see diagram: image 1).|$|R

5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet slowly {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The casks brought from Cuba were leaking and the expedition was now running dangerously low on fresh water; {{the hunt for}} more became an overriding priority as the expedition advanced, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull close to the shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the day of Saint Lazarus, another city was spotted and named San Lázaro by the Spanish – it is now known by its original Maya name, Campeche. A large contingent put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats to fill their water casks in a freshwater pool. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. They were led amongst large buildings until they stood before a blood-caked altar, {{where many of the}} city's inhabitants crowded around. The Indians piled reeds before the visitors; this act was followed by a procession of armed Maya warriors in full war paint, followed by ten Maya priests. The Maya set fire to <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> and indicated that the Spanish would be killed if they were not gone by the time <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> had been consumed. The Spanish party withdrew in defensive formation to the shore and rapidly boarded their boats to retreat to the safety of the ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in <b>the</b> <b>reeds.</b> To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, reed warbler and sedge warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location {{is important for}} migrating birds. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with one}} last push over {{mountains}} that {{were described as}} much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had {{to decide whether to}} forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told that the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently, an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then Kesebergs, Stanton with <b>the</b> <b>Reeds,</b> Graveses, and Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of the Donners' wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood, but it seemed a superficial wound.|$|E
50|$|Various {{features}} {{are incorporated into}} the design of ligatures to hold <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> securely while minimizing pressure distortion of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and allowing maximum vibration. Contact rails may be either parallel or transverse to <b>the</b> <b>reed,</b> on either a metal band or pressure plate type ligature. The contact rails may be either metal, wood, or plastic. Pressure plates may also have raised contact points, prongs, or a concave form to control contact with <b>the</b> <b>reed.</b> Some bands are designed for minimal contact with the mouthpiece, allowing even less absorption of <b>the</b> <b>reed's</b> vibrations.|$|R

40|$|A reed is vibrated by {{the minute}} {{vibrations}} of a base frame which, in turn, is vibrated by a driver mechanism. The vibration of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> is picked off and fed back to the driver means, causing the base frame to be vibrated at the resonant frequency of <b>the</b> <b>reed.</b> A counter {{is connected to the}} feedback loop to measure the frequency of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> oscillations. By adding the mass to be weighed to <b>the</b> <b>reed,</b> <b>the</b> resonant frequency of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> will be changed, which will in turn change the reading at the counter by an amount which is proportional to the added mass...|$|R
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. <b>The</b> <b>reeds</b> and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When the gun is triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E

25|$|Inside the {{accordion}} are <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding banks, {{which can be}} further combined into registers producing differing timbres. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low registers. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre. See {{the accordion}} reed ranks and switches article for further explanation and audio samples.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> double <b>reed</b> woodwinds, <b>the</b> oboe and bassoon, have no mouthpiece. Instead <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> is {{two pieces}} of cane {{extending}} from a metal tube (oboe - staple) or placed on a bocal (bassoon, English horn). <b>The</b> <b>reed</b> is placed directly on the lips and then played like the double-lip embouchure described above. Compared to <b>the</b> single <b>reed</b> woodwinds, <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> is very small and subtle changes in the embouchure can have a dramatic effect on tuning, tone and pitch control.|$|R
50|$|The {{top section}} {{consists}} of the mouthpiece (the uppermost portion) and <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> cover (<b>the</b> thicker portion). The player blows into the mouthpiece. It can be made of nylon, wood, or plastic. <b>The</b> <b>reed</b> cover channels <b>the</b> air over <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> causing it to vibrate and produce the sound. The ring {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> cover is a ferrule, and is purely decorative. It can be made out of ivory, imitation ivory, plastic, nylon, or a metal such as silver.|$|R
50|$|The {{instrument}} uses {{a single}} <b>reed</b> made from <b>the</b> cane of Arundo donax, {{a type of}} grass. Reeds may also be manufactured from synthetic materials. The ligature fastens <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> to <b>the</b> mouthpiece. When air is blown through the opening between <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and <b>the</b> mouthpiece facing, <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> vibrates and produces the instrument's sound.|$|R
25|$|Chikatilo {{had killed}} three further victims by August 1990: on 4 April, he lured a 31-year-old woman, named Lyubov Zuyeva, off a train and killed her in {{woodland}} near Donleskhoz station.

On 28 July, he lured a 13-year-old boy, named Viktor Petrov, away from a Rostov railway station and killed him in Rostov's Botanical Gardens; and on 14 August, he killed an 11-year-old boy, named Ivan Fomin, in <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> near Novocherkassk beach.|$|E
25|$|Birds which {{prefer the}} wetland habitat include kingfishers and bank swallows. Finally {{there is an}} {{abundance}} of bird life around the wetland marshes. Many species of ducks make their summer homes in these waters and Canada geese nest in the more remote marshes. Blackbirds, marsh wrens and black terns nest in <b>the</b> <b>reeds.</b> Franklin gulls nest in the marsh vegetation, but range over agricultural fields for grasshoppers, crickets, and mice. Shore birds include: avocet, piping plover, spotted sandpiper, willet, common snipe and killdeer.|$|E
25|$|Not all crafts are {{international}} {{known or}} collection. One {{such is the}} weaving of baskets. This craft is mostly practice in very small communities in the Central Valleys region, where reeds grow abundantly along riverbanks. In addition to traditional baskets for carrying, <b>the</b> <b>reeds</b> are also fashioned into bird cages, lamps, candy dishes and screens/curtains. Towns best known for this activity include Etla, Ocotlán de Morelos, Tlacolula, Santa Cruz Papalutla, Santa Ana del Valle, Villa Diaz Ordaz and San Miguel del Valle.|$|E
2500|$|After <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> has dried, <b>the</b> wires are {{tightened}} around <b>the</b> <b>reed,</b> {{which has}} shrunk after drying, or replaced completely. The lower part is sealed (a nitrocellulose-based cement such as Duco may be used) and then wrapped with thread to ensure both that no air leaks {{out through the}} bottom of <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> and that <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> maintains its shape. The wrapping itself is often sealed with Duco or clear nail varnish (polish). Electrical tape {{can also be used}} as a wrapping for amateur <b>reed</b> makers. <b>The</b> bulge in the wrapping is sometimes referred to as the [...] "Turk's head"—it serves as a convenient handle when inserting <b>the</b> <b>reed</b> on <b>the</b> bocal.|$|R
500|$|The {{clarinet}} [...] uses {{a single}} <b>reed</b> made from <b>the</b> cane of Arundo donax, {{a type of}} grass. Reeds may also be manufactured from synthetic materials.
