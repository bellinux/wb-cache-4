40|$|Abstract- Wireless {{communication}} plays a {{vital role}} in day to day life. Voice over IP (VoIP) {{is one of the most}} exciting new developments emerging within the telephony market. Wireless VoIP utilizes wireless LAN technology, the same wireless infrastructure used for the corporate network, in order to communicate. Traditional PBX systems can be replaced by IP PBX system in a cost effective way. Wireless IP phones can be used to access corporate telephony system as this technology combines the <b>telephony</b> <b>function</b> directly into an already existing data network infrastructure. This paper discusses the working and principle of wireless IP telephony. Keywords- wireless communication, VoIP, wireless LAN, PBX, IP phone. 1...|$|E
40|$|The IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) {{defined by}} the 3 GPP has been mainly {{developed}} and deployed by telephony vendors on vendor-specific hardware. Recent advances in Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) technology {{paved the way for}} virtualized hardware and <b>telephony</b> <b>function</b> elasticity. As such, Telecom vendors have started to embrace the cloud as a deployment platform, usually selecting a privileged virtualization platform. Operators would like to deploy telecom functionality on their already existing IT cloud platforms. Achieving such flexibility would require the telecom vendors to adopt a software architecture allowing deployment on many cloud platforms or even heterogeneous cloud platforms. We propose a distributed software architecture enabling the deployment of a single software version on multiple cloud platforms thus allowing for a solution-based deployment. We also present a prototype we developed to study the characteristics of this architecture. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, 1 table. Accepted for oral presentation at S 2 CT 2015 in Toronto.

This paper concerns the domain of customer-oriented telephony, i. e., software producing the externally observable behavior of voice telecommunications systems. Customer-oriented telephony is worth the attention of industrial researchers and academicians alike, for the following three reasons: Accessibility. Everybody uses telephones.

40|$|The {{number of}} Internet {{telephone}} users is gradually in-creasing because of widespread broadband (ADSL, FTTH, CATV, etc.) Internet access services. We started our new Internet telephony service ”IP Talk ” in 2002. Recently Wireless LAN (WLAN), {{as one of}} leading net-work technologies, is introduced as Internet telephony for mobile users. We have developed and evaluated mobile IP phone ter-minals, ”Mobile IP Talk ” since 2001. ”Mobile IP Talk” could achieve continuous call waiting time performance of about one day by power managing function of WLAN inter-face, and moreover solve the IP address mobility problem by our original IP telephony protocol HTTP-based Confer-ence Application Protocol (HCAP) to handle with DHCP, NAT and firewall problems of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).

40|$|Existing {{standard}} protocols for {{the web and}} Internet telephony fail {{to deliver}} real-time interactive communication from within a web browser. In particular, the client-server web protocol over reliable TCP is not always suitable for end-to-end low latency media path needed for interactive voice and video communication. To solve this, we compare the available platform options using the existing technologies such as modifying the web programming language and protocol, using an existing web browser plugin, and a separate host resident application that the web browser can talk to. We argue that using a separate application as an adaptor is a promising short term as well as long-term strategy for voice and video communications on the web. Our project aims at developing the open technology and sample implementations for web-based real-time voice and video communication applications. We describe the architecture of our project including (1) a RESTful web communication API over HTTP inspired by SIP message flows, (2) a web-friendly set of metadata for session description, and (3) an UDP-based end-to-end media path. All other <b>telephony</b> <b>functions</b> reside in the web application itself and/or in web feature servers. The adaptor approach allows us to easily add new voice and video codecs and NAT traversal technologies such as Host Identity Protocol. We want to make web-based communication accessible to millions of web developers, maximize the end user experience and security, and preserve the huge global investment in and experience from SIP systems while adhering to web standards and development tools as much as possible. We have created an open source prototype {{that allows you to}} freely use the conference application by directing a browser to the conference URL.

40|$|Despite recent {{advances}} in automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology, successful ASR applications tend {{to be limited to}} <b>telephony,</b> command-and-control <b>functions,</b> head-worn microphones, small vocabularies, and/or simple grammars. Recording and processing spontaneous, human-to-human conversations in natural settings is a far more challenging task. Face-to-face meetings are not only challenging because of acoustic uncertainty, but they also contain very rich content. In contrast to typical ASR corpora, meetings contain a vast amount of overlapping speech, interrupts, false starts, laughter, and other interesting linguistic, acoustic, and prosodic features. To address some of these issues, we have begun research on the recording and processing of meetings. In this paper, we will describe the Meeting Recorder project, including possible applications, corpus collection, and progress to date. 1 Why Record Meetings? 1. 1 Challenging Speech Recognition Firstly, natural human-to-human me [...] ...|$|R
40|$|An Internet <b>telephony</b> system <b>functions</b> like a {{conventional}} telephone to support real-time voice communication over the Internet. Numerous proprietary systems have surfaced since its introduction {{as a result}} of its main attraction of allowing transcontinental telephone calls to be made at prices of local telephone calls. Currently, these systems are at their infancy stage with no support for standards to allow interoperability among systems. A proper framework to allow evaluation or comparison between systems is also lacking. This paper proposes such a framework that utilises a feature and functionality appraisal together with both quantitative and qualitative assessment techniques to allow a systematic evaluation of Internet telephony systems to take place. These techniques include voice processor evaluation through signal reproduction, Diagnostic Rhyme Test, Diagnostic Acceptability Measure, Degradation Category Rating, and Free Conversation Test. This framework has been successfully [...] ...|$|R
40|$|IP Telephony {{recently}} finds a lot {{of attention}} and will be used in IP based networks and in combination with the existing conventional telephone system. There is a multitude of competing signaling protocol standards, interfaces and implementation approaches. A number of basic functions can be found throughout all of those, though. This includes the addressing of participants using symbolic names, the negotiation of connections and their parameters as well as the enforcement of a dedicated handling of data streams by means of QoS signaling activities. Thus, a generic abstraction hiding underlying protocol specifics is very desirable and useful. The Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework DMIF - as part of the MPEG approach towards distributed multimedia systems - forms a general and comprehensive framework that is applicable {{to a wide variety of}} multimedia scenarios. In this paper we describe a more generalized and abstract view to basic IP <b>Telephony</b> signaling <b>functions</b> and show how these can be hidden below a common DMIF interface. This will allow for the implementation of inter-operable applications and a concentration on communication functionality rather than protocol details. We expect that this will also allow for better exchangeability, interoperability and deployability of emerging signaling extensions...|$|R
50|$|Occasionally {{connected}} computing is {{a software}} architecture {{based on the}} idea that an end user should be able to continue working with an internet application even when temporarily disconnected or when a wireless connection fails or is otherwise unavailable. OCC has been seen as one aspect of 'pervasive computing'. In the past, audio and visual <b>telephony</b> no longer <b>functioned</b> when a connection was lost. In an OCC architecture, tasks continue and update a central data store when a connection is restored. Client-side persistent data (CSPD), while not permanent data as in a central data store, are a common implementation of an OCC framework on non-handheld devices such as personal and laptop computers. As the local data store on PDAs commonly exceeds several Gigabytes, OCC becomes more viable for handheld devices.|$|R
