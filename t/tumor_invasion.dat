25|$|Staging {{is based}} on the TNM staging system, which classifies the amount of <b>tumor</b> <b>invasion</b> (T), {{involvement}} of lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M). The currently preferred classification is the 2010 AJCC staging system for cancer of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. To help guide clinical decision making, this system also incorporates information on cell type (ESCC, EAC, etc.), grade (degree of differentiation – an indication of the biological aggressiveness of the cancer cells), and tumor location (upper, middle, lower, or junctional).|$|E
25|$|Additional {{testing is}} needed to assess how much the cancer has spread (see Staging, below). Computed {{tomography}} (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can evaluate whether the cancer has spread to adjacent tissues or distant organs (especially liver and lymph nodes). The sensitivity of a CT scan is limited by its ability to detect masses (e.g. enlarged lymph nodes or involved organs) generally larger than 1cm. Positron emission tomography {{is also used to}} estimate the extent of the disease and is regarded as more precise than CT alone. Esophageal endoscopic ultrasound can provide staging information regarding the level of <b>tumor</b> <b>invasion,</b> and possible spread to regional lymph nodes.|$|E

Methods: Patients with advanced breast cancer who had been treated in our hospital from February 2010 to February 2014 were randomly selected as research objects. They were randomly divided into control group (conventional surgical treatment group) and observation group (neoadjuant chemotherapy group). There were 32 cases of each group.

500|$|NEDD9 binds {{directly}} to the Aurora-A mitotic kinase at the centrosome, and promotes its activity, allowing cells to enter mitosis. [...] Degradation of NEDD9 {{at the end of}} mitosis contributes to timely Aurora-A degradation. [...] Cell overexpressing NEDD9 exhibit deficient cytokinesis resulting in accumulation of multipolar mitotic spindles and abnormal numbers of centrosomes. On the other hand, cells with depleted NEDD9 have prematurely separated centrosomes and are deficient in microtubule organizing activity at mitosis leading to abundance of monopolar or asymmetric spindles, preventing cells from entering mitosis. NEDD9 also regulates Aurora-A activation at the basal body of cilia as cells resorb cilia during early G1. [...] Cilia are small organelles that protrude from the surface of adherent cells that are the obligate site of action for proteins such as Hedgehog, and the polycystins: by influencing ciliary stability, NEDD9 is positioned to affect these signaling systems. Interaction of NEDD9 with Aurora A kinase may also play a role in <b>tumor</b> <b>invasion.</b> NEDD9 binds to and regulates acetylation of cortactin (CTTN) in an Aurora A kinase (AURKA)/HDAC6–dependent manner. The knockdown of NEDD9 or AURKA results in an increase in the amount of acetylated CTTN and a decrease in the binding of CTTN to F-actin. Overexpression of the deacetylation mimicking (9KR) mutant of CTTN is sufficient to restore actin dynamics at the leading edge and migration proficiency of the tumor cells. Inhibition of AURKA and HDAC6 activity by alisertib and tubastatin A in xenograft models of breast cancer leads to a {{decrease in the number of}} pulmonary metastases.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{expression}} of podoplanin, a small mucin-like protein, is upregulated in the invasive {{front of a}} number of human carcinomas. We have investigated podoplanin function in cultured human breast cancer cells, in a mouse model of pancreatic β cell carcinogenesis, and in human cancer biopsies. Our results indicate that podoplanin promotes <b>tumor</b> cell <b>invasion</b> in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the expression and subcellular localization of epithelial markers are unaltered, and mesenchymal markers are not induced in invasive podoplanin-expressing tumor cells. Rather, podoplanin induces collective cell migration by filopodia formation via the downregulation of the activities of small Rho family GTPases. In conclusion, podoplanin induces an alternative pathway of <b>tumor</b> cell <b>invasion</b> in the absence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) ...|$|R

Materials and methodsIn this study, urinary samples were dialyzed to remove any interfering molecules and concentration by lyophilization. The urinary proteome maps of 10 healthy volunteers and 10 bladder transitional cell carcinoma (BTTC) patients were explored through two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2 -D PAGE) coupled with mass spectrometry. With no fractionation, the proteome maps acquired in this study likely represented the total urinary proteins. ResultsComparative proteomics indicated that six proteins were down-regulated and five proteins were up- regulated in BTCC patients as compared with normal. The down-regulated spots were identified as human haptoglobin precursor, human heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H 4 precursor, and AMBP protein precursor. The up-regulated spots were identified as peroxiredoxin 2, heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, protease serine 1 fragment and AMBP protein precursor.

40|$|Molecular therapies are {{hallmarks}} of "personalized" medicine, but how tumors adapt to these agents is not well-understood.

40|$|Invadopodia are matrix-degrading {{membrane}} protrusions in {{invasive carcinoma}} cells enriched in proteins that regulate actin polymerization. The on–off regulatory switch that initiates actin polymerization in invadopodia requires phosphorylation of tyrosine residues 421, 466, and 482 on cortactin. However, {{it is unknown}} which of these cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation sites control actin polymerization. We investigated the contribution of individual tyrosine phosphorylation sites (421, 466, and 482) on cortactin to the regulation of actin polymerization in invadopodia. We provide evidence that the phosphorylation of tyrosines 421 and 466, but not 482, {{is required for the}} generation of free actin barbed ends in invadopodia. In addition, these same phosphotyrosines are important for Nck 1 recruitment to invadopodia via its SH 2 domain, for the direct binding of Nck 1 to cortactin in vitro, and for the FRET interaction between Nck 1 and cortactin in invadopodia. Furthermore, matrix proteolysis-dependent <b>tumor</b> cell <b>invasion</b> is dramatically inhibited in cells expressing a mutation in phosphotyrosine 421 or 466. Together, these results identify phosphorylation of tyrosines 421 and 466 on cortactin as the crucial residues that regulate Nck 1 -dependent actin polymerization in invadopodia and <b>tumor</b> cell <b>invasion,</b> and suggest that specifically blocking either tyrosine 421 or 466 phosphorylation might be effective at inhibiting <b>tumor</b> cell <b>invasion</b> in vivo...|$|R
