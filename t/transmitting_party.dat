Both the set of possible states, {ρˆi}, and the associated probabilities for selection, {pi}, are known to Bob but not, of course, the selected state. His task is to determine {{as well as he}} can which state was prepared and he does this by choosing a measurement to perform. If the states are not mutually orthogonal then there is no measurement that will reveal the selected state with certainty. The strategy he chooses will depend on the use for which the information is intended and there exist many figures of merit for Bob's measurement [1, 2]. Among these the simplest is the minimum probability of error or, equivalently, the maximum probability for correctly identifying the state. Necessary and sufficient conditions for realizing a minimum error measurement are known [3 - 6], but it has proven to be easier to prove sufficiency than necessity. This letter presents an appealingly simple proof that the conditions are necessary...|$|E

40|$|Protection of {{transferable}} {{information in}} the telecommunication systems is possible by its imposition of coding sequence on a plaintext. Encryption of pseudorandom sequences can be performed by using generation algorithms which are implemented {{on the basis of}} the phenomenon of dynamical chaos, which is sensitive to changes in the initial conditions. One of the major problems encountered in the construction of secure communication systems is to provide synchronization between the receiving and <b>transmitting</b> <b>parties</b> of communication systems. Improvement of methods of hidden data transfer based on the systems with chaotic synchronization is the important task of research in the field of information and telecommunication systems based on chaos. This article shows an implementation of a data transmission system, encrypted by sequences, generated on the basis of one-dimensional discrete chaotic maps with ensuring synchronization of the transmitting and receiving sides of the system. In this system realization of synchronization is offered by a transmission through certain time domains of current value of xn generated by a logistic reflection. Xn transmission period depends on computer speed and distance between subscribers of the system. Its value is determined by transmitting a test message before the session. Infallible reception of test message indicates the optimal choice of a transmission period of the current value of xn. Selection period is done at the program level. For the construction of communication network modern software was used, in particular programming language Delphi 7. 0. The work of the system is shown on the example of information transmission between the users of the system.

Non-asymptotic behavior of BC protocol has been demonstrated in [2]. The current paper provides stricter asymptotic conditions on Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) to be feasible OT protocol proposed in [1]. We also generalize this protocol using different encoding and decoding methods that require to regain formulas for Renyi entropy. Nonasymptotic case (finite length of blocks <b>transmitted</b> between <b>parties)</b> is also presented. Some examples are given to demonstrate that these protocols are in fact reliable and information-theoretically secure. We also discuss the problem – how to extend (2) -OT protocol to (L) -OT protocol and how to arrange BSC 1 1 connecting parties. Both BC and OT protocols {{can be used as}} components of more complex and more important for practice protocols like “Digital cash”, “Secure election ” or “Distance bounding”. ...|$|R

This encoding uses a constant sized alphabet. This improves on an earlier result of Schulman, who showed how to recover when the fraction of errors is bounded by 1 / 240. We also show how to simulate an arbitrary protocol with a protocol using the binary alphabet, a constant factor increase in communication and tolerating a 1 / 8 − ǫ fraction of errors. ...|$|R

The N party GHZ is one such state; I derive a large class of such states, and show that they are in general not equivalent to the GHZ.

At first one projected that the channel is obtained through the operators of cable and mediantes decoders of a UHF signal after the payment of a monthly sum. Finally it was decided on the launching of an operator of satellite television own Zap, in December 2003, besides operating in the television by cable. In 2007, Zap was acquired by the Mexican Telmex, and so it happened to be called Telmex TV. From 2006 Basic signal CDF is sent renombrando first channel CDF Premium. The four parties per date of the championship of first division and some parties of the Chilean Selection of Soccer have the same programming excepting that emits live CDF Premium. The Channel of soccer <b>transmits</b> the <b>parties</b> of the Chilean championship of soccer of the First and Second Divisions. In addition it emits programs of European soccer and other sports.

40|$|Why {{was it so}} {{difficult}} for European Union countries to establish the European Central Bank? In the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, EU governments committed themselves to an independent, stability-oriented ECB, and to ensuring low inflation rates and low budget deficits. Between 1992 and 1998, they fought over the terms of membership and whether European economic policy should promote growth more than stability. Political <b>parties</b> <b>transmit</b> voter preferences over growth and stability into national policy on the basic priorities of monetary union, while the arrangement of economic institutions reinforces or frustrates the ambitions of a governing coalition. This not only leads to governments with clear priorities that conflict at the European level. Governing coalitions frustrated by economic institutions that thwart their economic policies can promote monetary union in order to force changes domestically. Therefore, conflict arose among stability-oriented governments over whether low budget deficits and inflation were to be achieved before EMU was launched. This reflected the conflict between France and Germany.

Acoustic communication faces many known problems, such as high propagation delays, very low data rates, and highly environment-dependent channel behavior. In this article, to address these shortcomings, magnetic induction is introduced as a possible communication paradigm for underwater applications. Accordingly, all research challenges in this regard are explained. Fundamentally different from the conventional underwater communication paradigm, which relies on EM, acoustic, or optical waves, the underwater MI communications rely on the time varying magnetic field to covey information between the <b>transmitting</b> and receiving <b>parties.</b> MI-based underwater communications exhibit several unique and promising features such as negligible signal propagation delay, predictable and constant channel behavior, sufficiently long communication range with high bandwidth, as well as silent and stealth underwater operations.

30|$|The {{flexibility}} {{of a particular}} DER or an aggregate of multiple DERs {{can be described as}} the set of all feasible load profiles for a given time frame. Feasible in the context of DER load profiles refers to load profiles that can be realized based on the current state while providing all necessary services (Mauser et al. 2017 a). In this paper we pick up the idea of representing and communicating flexibility with artificial neural networks (ANNs) presented in (Förderer et al. 2018): A single ANN implicitly learns a flexibility model for one or multiple aggregated DERs using generated or measured load profiles and state data relating to the corresponding DERs as training data. It {{is important to note that}} a single (measured) load profile does generally give only few clues about the available flexibility. In order to derive an adequate description of the flexibility in a given state, a sufficient number of measured load profiles with comparable initial states is required. Since the ANNs can be trained to consider these initial states, they should be able to deduce the actual flexibility. The ANNs are trained locally and then <b>transmitted</b> to third <b>parties</b> to offer flexibility information and act as surrogate models. Depending on the chosen training pattern, such an ANN could, e.g., evaluate if a given load profile is feasible for a particular DER. This approach enables the abstraction and communication of distributed flexibility regardless of the type, configurations and sizes of the considered DERs. Since a trained ANN may factor in the current state of the corresponding DERs, it is sufficient to only communicate states rather than a complete model once an ANN is known.|$|R
