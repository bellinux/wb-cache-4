Four distinct cases of time differentiation are examined by combining fixed and moving body derivatives (fundamental to rigid body mechanics) with material and local derivatives (fundamental to continuum mechanics). Three combinations always yield another screw quantity while the most common, the material derivative {{with respect to}} the fixed body, does not. Two fundamental formulations are examined with this last derivative, Euler's Laws and the gravitational loading of an elastic system.

40|$|The present article proposes an {{alternative}} way {{to compute the}} torsional stiffness based on <b>three-dimensional</b> continuum <b>mechanics</b> instead of applying a specific theory of torsion. A thin, representative beam slice is discretized by solid finite elements. Adequate boundary conditions and coupling conditions are integrated into the numerical model to obtain a proper answer on the torsion behaviour, thus on shear center, shear stress and torsional stiffness. This finite element approach only includes general assumptions of beam torsion which are independent of cross-section geometry. These assumptions essentially are: no in-plane deformation, constant torsion and free warping. Thus {{it is possible to}} achieve numerical solutions of high accuracy for arbitrary cross-sections. Due to the direct link to <b>three-dimensional</b> continuum <b>mechanics,</b> it is possible to extend the range of torsion analysis to sections which are composed of different materials or even to heterogeneous beams on a high scale of resolution.

40|$|Movement within {{eukaryotic}} cells largely originates from localized forces {{exerted by}} myosin motors on scaffolds of actin filaments. Although individual motors locally exert both contractile and extensile forces, large actomyosin structures at the cellular scale are overwhelmingly contractile, {{suggesting that the}} scaffold serves to favor contraction over extension. While this mechanism is well understood in highly organized striated muscle, its origin in disordered networks such as the cell cortex is unknown. Here we develop a mathematical model of the actin scaffold's local two- or <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>mechanics</b> and identify four competing contraction mechanisms. We predict that one mechanism dominates, whereby local deformations of the actin break the balance between contraction and extension. In this mechanism, contractile forces result mostly from motors plucking the filaments transversely rather than buckling them longitudinally. These findings sheds light on recent in vitro experiments, and provides a new geometrical understanding of contractility in the myriad of disordered actomyosin systems found in vivo.

40|$|The {{theory of}} the elastic shells {{is one of the}} most {{important}} parts of the theory of solid mechanics. The elastic shell can be described with its middle surface; that is, the three-dimensional elastic shell with equal thickness comprises a series of overlying surfaces like middle surface. In this paper, the differential geometric relations between elastic shell and its middle surface are provided under the curvilinear coordinate systems, which are very important for forming two-dimensional linear and nonlinear elastic shell models. Concretely, the metric tensors, the determinant of metric matrix field, the Christoffel symbols, and Riemann tensors on the three-dimensional elasticity are expressed by those on the two-dimensional middle surface, which are featured by the asymptotic expressions with respect to the variable in the direction of thickness of the shell.

Recently it has also been identified that patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) display alterations in gait in the coronal and transverse planes. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of patellar bracing and taping on the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>mechanics</b> of the knee of patellofemoral pain patients during a step descent task. METHOD: Thirteen patients diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome performed a slow step descent. This was conducted under three randomized conditions: (a) no intervention, (b) neutral patella taping, (c) patellofemoral bracing. A 20 cm step was constructed to accommodate an AMTI force platform. Kinematic data were collected using a ten camera infra-red Oqus motion analysis system. Reflective markers were placed on the foot, shank and thigh using the Calibrated Anatomical System Technique (CAST). RESULTS: The coronal plane knee range of motion was significantly reduced with taping (P= 0. 031) and bracing (P= 0. 005). The transverse plane showed a significant reduction in the knee range of motion with the brace compared to taping (P= 0. 032) and no treatment (P= 0. 046). CONCLUSION: Patients suffering from patellofemoral pain syndrome demonstrated improved coronal plane and torsional control of the knee during slow step descent following the application of bracing and taping.

40|$|Background Most {{previous}} {{work on the}} use of knee bracing and taping has focussed on sagittal plane movement. However, most bracing and taping techniques aim to modify patellar movement in the coronal and transverse planes. Objective This study investigated the effect of patellar bracing and taping on the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>mechanics</b> of the knee during a controlled eccentric step down task. Method Twelve healthy subjects were asked to conduct a slow step down exercise. The step down was conducted under three randomised conditions: (a) no intervention, (b) neutral patella taping and (c) patellofemoral bracing. A step was constructed to accommodate an AMTI force platform and to produce a step height of 20 cm. Kinematic data were collected using a six camera ProReflex motion analysis system. Reflective markers were placed on the foot, shank and thigh using the Calibrated Anatomical Systems Technique (CAST). Results The patellofemoral brace and taping led to a significant reduction in the maximum coronal and range of torsional knee angles by 5 ° and 2 °, respectively (p = 0. 030, 0. 006). The range of coronal and transverse plane knee moments was also significantly reduced by 0. 15 Nm/kg and 0. 03 Nm/kg (p = 0. 020, 0. 0019). The brace was shown to be more effective in the coronal and transverse planes in comparison to taping or no intervention. Conclusion Bracing and taping appear to offer coronal plane and torsional control of the knee during eccentric step descent.

40|$|A semi-numerical {{method is}} {{reviewed}} for solving {{a set of}} coupled partial differential equations subject to mixed and possibly coupled boundary conditions. The line method of analysis {{is applied to the}} Navier-Cauchy equations of elastic and elastoplastic equilibrium to calculate the displacement distributions in various, simple geometry bodies containing cracks. The application of this method to the appropriate field equations leads to coupled sets of simultaneous ordinary differential equations whose solutions are obtained along sets of lines in a discretized region. When decoupling of the equations and their boundary conditions is not possible, the use of a successive approximation procedure permits the analytical solution of the resulting ordinary differential equations. The use of this method is illustrated by reviewing and presenting selected solutions of mixed boundary value problems in three dimensional fracture mechanics. These solutions are of great importance in fracture toughness testing, where accurate stress and displacement distributions are required for the calculation of certain fracture parameters. Computations obtained for typical flawed specimens include that for elastic as well as elastoplastic response. Problems in both Cartesian and cylindrical coordinate systems are included. Results are summarized for a finite geometry rectangular bar with a central through-the-thickness or rectangular surface crack under remote uniaxial tension. In addition, stress and displacement distributions are reviewed for finite circular bars with embedded penny-shaped cracks, and rods with external annular or ring cracks under opening mode tension. The results obtained show that the method of lines presents a systematic approach to the solution of some <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>mechanics</b> problems with arbitrary boundary conditions. The advantage of this method over other numerical solutions is that good results are obtained even from the use of a relatively coarse grid...|$|E
40|$|Lower back {{injuries}} are an illness which plague our society. Although almost everyone will experience {{some form of}} lower back pain {{in his or her}} lifetime, it is a sickness that is poorly understood, calling for new and innovative research. Much of this back pain is attributed to mechanical factors. Hence, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanics of the spine and the mechanical effects of degenerative changes that may lead to back pain. The spine is a complex three-dimensional structure and it is therefore necessary to study its mechanics with in vitro tests that replicate physiological movements as closely as possible. Traditional spinal testing machines have been unable to simulate the kinematic behaviour of intervertebral joints as they have limited degrees of freedom and cannot produce dynamic motion. The first aim of this research was to commission a robotic testing facility to overcome the limitations of traditional testing machines. This facility incorporated a six degree-of-freedom (DOF) robot arm with a six DOF force transducer. Mechanical tests performed on this facility could simulate the dynamic three-dimensional kinematics of the lumbar spine. In addition, this research aimed to assess the existence of a region of laxity during spinal joint motion defined as the Neutral Zone, and to determine the effect of specific lesions introduced into the intervertebral disc. To investigate these aims, in vitro mechanical tests on spinal specimens were performed using the robotic testing facility. To ensure these tests produced experimental results that were indicative of the mechanics of the spine in life, the intervertebral disc height had to be representative of the disc height in life. A set of experiments was performed to determine a method for ensuring this. The post-mortem disc height change due to a period of time exposed to a moist environment, freezing, defrosting and application of a constant compressive load was documented in a group of sheep spines. Specimens that were frozen immediately upon removal from the body produced the most predictable results. These specimens required no preloading to ensure the disc height during mechanical testing was similar to that in life. In accordance with this result, specimens used in the ensuing mechanical tests were frozen immediately on removal from the body and stored frozen until required for testing. Tests performed on sheep spines with the robotic facility verified the existence of a Neutral Zone. A criterion was determined that defined the Neutral Zone as the region of spinal joint rotation where the gradient of the load/deformation curve is within +/- 0. 5 dNm/degree from zero. This definition was used to determine the extent of the Neutral Zone in spinal motion during different movements. A Neutral Zone of approximately four degrees was found in intact spinal motion segments during flexion/extension. Only spinal musculature can stabilise the spine in this region of rotation. The removal of the zygapophysial joints increased the Neutral Zone in flexion/extension by approximately two degrees and caused the appearance of a Neutral Zone in axial rotation of approximately one degree. This suggests that during these motions, the zygapophysial joints are the main passive stabilisers. The mechanical effects of intervertebral disc lesions were examined by experimentally introducing three types of tears (rim lesions, radial tears and concentric tears) into sheep intervertebral discs and comparing the mechanical response of the injured joint to the joint's response prior to the creation of the lesions. Radial tears and concentric tears had no effect on the maximum moments resisted by the intervertebral disc or the hysteresis of the joint's response to motion. An anterior rim lesion increased the Neutral Zone by approximately 1. 5 degrees and reduced the maximum moment resisted by the intervertebral disc by approximately 20 % during extension in L 1 /L 2 specimens. Rim lesions were also found to reduce the maximum moment resisted by the intervertebral disc in lateral bending and axial rotation for all levels by approximately 15 % and 25 % respectively. Rim lesions did not affect the hysteresis of intervertebral disc motion. In summary, this research commissioned a robotic testing facility capable of simulating the dynamic, three-dimensional kinematics of the lumbar spine and provided a unique insight into the <b>three-dimensional</b> <b>mechanics</b> of intervertebral joints. Testing was performed on sheep joints, however the outcomes provide an insight into the mechanical response of the human spine. The Neutral Zone was shown to exist but only in flexion/extension. This implies that damage to the spinal muscles may produce an unstable structure during flexion/extension within this Neutral Zone. Rim lesions reduce the ability of the intervertebral disc to resist all modes of motion. This suggests that the presence of rim lesions will produce overloading of other spinal elements and instigate progressive degenerative changes...|$|E

Despite the fact that there is no simple analytic expression for non-commutative perturbative corrections to the MIC-Kepler spectrum, there is a term that gives rise to the linear Stark effect which didn’t exist in the standard hydrogen model. Progress in the String theory has recently ignited a great deal of interest to field theories in noncommutative spaces [1]. Quantum Hall effect [2], non-commutative classical and quantum mechanics [4]- [12], and various non-commutative phenomenological models [3] are among these types of theories. In addition to the string theory, these models also give rise to theories describing particles with spin.
