Mathematical model relating the average tree inception stress with the defect tip radius of curvature has been provided for AC and impulse voltages. The resulting equation for AC treeing inception stress is verified by experimental measurements. Moreover, the effects of voltage magnitude, defect tip radius, and time of voltage application on partial discharge (PD) properties are studied, and the conditions for the initiation of bush- and branch-type trees are identified. For each type of tree, the variation of PD level with <b>tree</b> <b>length</b> is investigated experimentally.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method to improve airway {{segmentation}} in {{thoracic computed tomography}} (CT) by detecting and removing leaks. Leak detection is formulated as a classification problem, in which a convolutional network (ConvNet) is trained in a supervised fashion to perform the classification task. In order to increase the segmented airway <b>tree</b> <b>length,</b> we {{take advantage of the}} fact that multiple segmentations can be extracted from a given airway segmentation algorithm by varying the parameters that influence the <b>tree</b> <b>length</b> and the amount of leaks. We propose a strategy in which the combination of these segmentations after removing leaks can increase the airway <b>tree</b> <b>length</b> while limiting the amount of leaks. This strategy therefore largely circumvents the need for parameter fine-tuning of a given airway segmentation algorithm. The ConvNet was trained and evaluated using a subset of inspiratory thoracic CT scans taken from the COPDGene study. Our method was validated on a separate independent set of the EXACT' 09 challenge. We show that our method significantly improves the quality of a given leaky airway segmentation, achieving a higher sensitivity at a low false-positive rate compared to all the state-of-the-art methods that entered in EXACT 09, and approaching the performance of the combination of all of them...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} finding a {{phylogeny}} with maximum parsimony {{is one of the}} main problems in computational biology. While it is impossible to search the possible tree space exhaustively for large data sets, most heuristic approaches try to search in the neighborhood of sub-optimal trees. The speed of computing a score for each tree (e. g. <b>tree</b> <b>length</b> or total number of character changes) is as important as the different tree search strategies. Some techniques include short-cuts that have not been proven to be exact, and an incremental character optimization approach by which the speedup gains depends on data sets and is hardly analyzed in theory. This paper describes an exact and fast algorithm to compute <b>tree</b> <b>length</b> and our algorithm can obtain great speedup for any data sets.
