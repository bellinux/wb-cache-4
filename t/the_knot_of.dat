The brief overlap with NY98 ends at Main Street, which carries NY5 and NY63 through the western portion of the city. NY33 turns east here, overlapping with NY5 and NY63 for five blocks along the four-lane, mostly commercial Main Street. NY63 leaves in downtown Batavia at Ellicott Street; however, NY5 and NY33 continue to follow Main Street {{through much of the}} city's eastern half.|$|E
25|$|On {{the initial}} autopsy report in 1950, doctors {{concluded}} that Tollund Man died by hanging rather than strangulation. The rope left visible furrows {{in the skin}} beneath his chin and {{at the sides of}} his neck. There was no mark, however, {{at the back of the}} neck where <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings. Although the cervical vertebrae were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.|$|E

Now the remainder of the arm-tefillin straps are wound [...] three times around the middle finger and around the hand to form the shape of the Hebrew letter of either a shin (...) according to Ashkenazim, or a dalet (...) according to Sephardim. There are various customs regarding winding the strap on the arm and hand. In fact, the arm strap is looped for counter-clockwise wrapping with Ashkenazi tefillin while it is knotted for clockwise wrapping with Sephardic and Chabad tefillin. On removing the tefillin, the steps are reversed.|$|E
500|$|The Tyneside Theatre company {{presented}} a stage version of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight at the University Theatre, Newcastle at Christmas 1971. It {{was directed by}} Michael Bogdanov and adapted for the stage from the translation by Brian Stone. The music and lyrics were composed by Iwan Williams using medieval carols, such as the Boar's Head Carol, as inspiration and folk instruments such as the Northumbrian pipes, whistles and bhodran to create a [...] "rough" [...] feel. Stone had referred Bogdanov to Cuchulain and the Beheading Game, a sequence which is contained in The Grenoside Sword dance. Bogdanov found the pentangle theme to be contained in most sword dances, and so incorporated a long sword dance while Gawain lay tossing uneasily before getting {{up to go to}} the Green Chapel. The dancers made <b>the</b> <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> the pentangle around his drowsing head with their swords.

500|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the word}} dodo is unclear.

The first record {{of the word}} Dodaars is in Captain Willem Van West-Zanen's journal in 1602. The English writer Sir Thomas Herbert was the first to use the word dodo in print in his 1634 travelogue, claiming it was referred to as such by the Portuguese, who had visited Mauritius in 1507. Another Englishman, Emmanuel Altham, had used the word in a 1628 letter, in which he also claimed the origin was Portuguese. The name [...] "dodar" [...] was introduced into English {{at the same time as}} dodo, but was only used until the 18th century. As far as is known, the Portuguese never mentioned the bird. Nevertheless, some sources still state that the word dodo derives from the Portuguese word doudo (currently doido), meaning [...] "fool" [...] or [...] "crazy". It has also been suggested that dodo was an onomatopoeic approximation of the bird's call, a two-note pigeon-like sound resembling [...] "doo-doo".|$|E

500|$|The {{manufacturing}} processes {{of both the}} boxes and the parchment scrolls are intricate and governed by hundreds of detailed rules. In earlier Talmudic times, tefillin were either cylindrical or cubical, but later the cylindrical form became obsolete. Nowadays the boxes should be fashioned from {{a single piece of}} animal hide and form a base with an upper compartment to contain the parchment scrolls. They are made in varying levels of quality. The most basic form, called peshutim ("simple"), are made using several pieces of parchment to form the inner walls of the head tefillin. The higher quality tefillin, namely dakkot ("thin"), made by stretching a thin piece of leather, and the more durable gassot ("thick") are both fashioned from the single piece of hide. Black leather straps (retsu'ot) pass through the rear of the base and are used to secure the tefillin onto the body. On both sides of the head-tefillin, the Hebrew letter shin (...) is moulded; the shin on the wearer's left side has four branches instead of three. <b>The</b> <b>knot</b> <b>of</b> the head-tefillin strap forms the letter dalet (...) or double dalet (...)
