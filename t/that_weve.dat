As a result, the importance of this role has increased and societies expectation of it is also higher. It is on this point that we conducted a survey using elementary and secondary school children, parents, members of the general public and students of education as subjects to find out the extent of their recognition {{of the role of the}} school nurse teacher, as well as their recognition of it as an occupation. Today, the role of the school nurse teacher has increased from being one of administering just first aid. They are now expected to have a better understanding of people and how to deal with them. However, results from this survey show elementary and secondary school children's impression of the role of school nurse teacher was strongly that of a first aid giver. Parents, we found, knew almost noothing about the role and some hadn't ever heard of the name of this occupation, among members of the public, opinions ranged according to their own occupations, but we canot go as far as saying <b>that</b> they <b>weve</b> familiar with this role. Stubents of education were at least familiar with the role, but their Knowledge of it was rather narrow. Judging from these results, there is a need to deepen and spread understanding of the role of the school nurse teacher among people in society...|$|R

We didnt do a red carpet, we just did a friends and family screening on the eve of its release. I even bought drinks at my own premiere! Its generated warmth but I think - are we allowed to say things like its a peculiarly British film? It feels different? Its a little bit quirky? Its got an intentional DIY feel to it? Its meant to be like that. I think maybe thats something people have picked up on. Superhero films arent so much our cultural history, but we do that kind of comedy really well.

5000|$|A hole, 24 feet by 27 feet, {{had been}} torn in the port side of the midships pump-room. The {{explosion}} had also blown another hole in the starboard side, flooding the compartment. There were jagged tears in the bulkheads and kerosene was spurting up from adjoining tanks, seeping in a film up through {{the holes in the}} hull. The deck had been broken open, so that one could look down into the ship. From beam to beam the deck was buckled, but the ship held together. Another sixty Junkers 87 Stuka dive bombers attacked the convoy, focusing on Ohio. A series of near misses ensued as the tanker approached the island of Pantelleria. Bombs threw spray over the decks of the tanker, while aircraft used their machine guns. One near-miss buckled the ships plates and the forward tank filled with water. The 3-inch (76 mm) gun at the bows was twisted in its mountings and put out of action. A formation of five Junkers 88s was broken up by the tankers anti aircraft guns, with the bombs falling harmlessly into the sea. Another plane, this time a Junkers 87, was shot down by an Ohio gunner; however, the aircraft crashed into Ohios starboard side, forward of the upper bridge, and exploded. Half a wing hit the upper work of the bridge and a rain of debris showered the tanker from stem to stern. The planes bomb fortunately failed to detonate. Captain Mason was telephoned from aft by the chief officer, who told Mason that the Junkers 87 had crashed into the sea and then bounced onto the ship. Mason rather curtly replied: [...] "Oh <b>thats</b> nothing. <b>Weve</b> had a Junkers 88 on the foredeck for nearly half an hour." ...|$|R

[...] STRANGER. Then whats your view?MELCHER. We have no views here; weve faith, as Ive told you already. And <b>thats</b> why <b>weve</b> only one head--placed exactly above the heart. Pause.) In the meantime lets look at number seven in the catalogue. Ah, Napoleon! The creation of the Revolution itself! The Emperor of the People, the Nero of Freedom, the suppressor of Equality and the big brother of Fraternity. Hes the most cunning of all the two-headed, for he could laugh at himself, raise himself above his own contradictions, change his skin and his soul, and yet be quite explicable to himself in every transformation--convinced, self-authorised. Theres only one other man who can be compared with him in this; Kierkegaard the Dane. From the beginning {{he was aware of}} this parthenogenesis of the soul, whose capacity to multiply by taking cuttings was equivalent to bringing forth young in this life without conception. And for that reason, and so as not to become lifes fool, he wrote under a number of pseudonyms, of which each one constituted a stage on his lifes way. But did you realise this? The Lord of life, in spite of all these precautions, made a fool of him after all. Kierkegaard, who fought all his life against the priesthood and the professional preachers of the State Church, was eventually forced of necessity to become a professional preacher himself! Oh yes! Such things do happen.STRANGER. The Powers That Be play tricks. The Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics, 1915, had a short article about Søren Kierkegaard. They wrote, In Gjentagelsen ( [...] Repetition, October 1843), Kierkegaard sketches an abortive transition to the religious sphere. Repetition is one of his characteristic ideas; it signifies persistence in, and faithfulness to, a chosen course of life, and is thus opposed to the (esthetic standpoint, with constancy only in change. But Kierkegaard also gives the word a more special meaning—that rather of resumption (Gjentagelse, taking again)—implying that each higher stage of life carries with it the lower in a transfigured form. Gjentagelsen tells of a young man who seeks to pass from the (esthetic to the religious sphere, but for want of a true penitence becomes merely a romanticist; i.e., he simply resumes his old self; and his case is contrasted with that of Job, who humbled himself utterly before God, and at last regained all that he had lost, and more—the true [...] repetition." ...|$|R
40|$|A investigação deste Trabalho {{consiste}} em um estudo sobre o diálogo entre o design e a arte na sociedade de consumo contemporânea, denominada como hiperconsumidora. Neste contexto, o produto industrializado tece um diálogo com a atividade artística por meio de associações, cada vez mais comuns, entre o universo da arte e grandes marcas e corporações. Procuramos introduzir este assunto por meio de um percurso histórico do período moderno até o contemporâneo, destacando os momentos mais relevantes em que o diálogo entre design e arte contribuiu para o desenvolvimento dos produtos industrializados. Com o intuito de contextualizar este diálogo em fases, tomamos quatro valores atribuídos às mercadorias: uso, troca, posse e seleção. Enquanto os valores de uso e troca se apresentaram como característicos dos primeiros momentos da civilização de consumo, o surgimento dos valores de posse e seleção são reflexos do hipercosumo, que se desenvolveu no decorrer das últimas quatro décadas. Em específico, o valor de seleção dos objetos nos serviu como fundamento para nossas considerações sobre as relações entre o universo da arte e as grandes marcas. Nesse contexto, o valor de seleção representou a ênfase da indústria no consumidor que, na contemporaneidade, é capaz de articular as informações que lhe vêm das características dos mais diversos produtos e serviços em acordo com suas necessidades e desejos. Assim, num mercado consumidor cujo acirramento da concorrência é cada vez maior, verificamos o emprego de ações que criem diferenciais que sejam únicos e inovadores e que contribuam na construção de valores junto às marcas e produtos. Para tanto, notamos a utilização de alguns recursos, que vão desde o investimento na qualidade estética dos produtos e ambientes, até o emprego de ações envolvendo festivais, intervenções e exposições de arte. Ao considerarmos que verificar estas novas relações consistia em explorar o sistema que as envolve, analisamos o sistema de arte moderna: o Regime de Consumo, como fundamento e, em seguida, a sua transposição para o Regime de Comunicação, o sistema de arte contemporânea. Desta feita, verificamos como o Regime de Comunicação se sustenta no circuito em rede, que é ampliado pelas novas tecnologias da comunicação e é capaz de assegurar o diálogo com as marcas e produtos industrializados. This works {{investigation is}} based on a study that covers the dialog between design and art on the contemporaneous consumer society, known as hyper-consumer. Within this theory, processed products compose a dialog with artistic activity that goes through associations, more usual by the second, among art universe and big brands and companies. We tried to introduce this issue showing the historical path from modern to contemporary periods, highlighting the most relevant moments in which the dialog between design and art contributed to processed products development. In order to bring these dialogs into words, four attributed values to these commodities were adopted: usage, exchange, ownership and selection. While usage and exchange appeared as typical on primary moments of this consumer period, ownership and selection were born from the hyper-consumer era, which has expanded in the past four decades. More specifically, the object selections value was the foundation of our thoughts about the relationship between art universe and big brands. The selection value in this context represented how much emphasis the company is able to apply on its consumer, who nowadays, is capable of vary its needs and process the information that comes from the most different products and services properties. Therefore, on a consumer market in which competition is more and more fearless, we could observe some actions that can be applied in order to create uniqueness and innovation and contribute to build values along with brands and products. To <b>that</b> end, <b>weve</b> been observing some resources that go from products and environments esthetic quality investments to different actions adopted in order to gather artistic activity like concerts, celebrations and shows. As we realized that verifying those new relationships were based on explore the system that surrounds them, we could analyze the modern art system: the Consuming Regime, as the foundation, and then its conversion to the Communication Regime, a contemporaneous art system. From this moment on, we verified how the Communication Regime remains in the net circuit, which is enlarged by new communication technologies and is able to assure the dialog between brands and processed products...|$|R

Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Therefore the sage {{practices}} the teaching that has no words. The Way cannot be brought to light; its virtue cannot be forced to come. But benevolence — you can put that into practice; you can discourse on righteousness, you can dupe one another with rites. So it is said, When the Way was lost, then there was virtue; when virtue was lost, then there was benevolence; when benevolence was lost, then there was righteousness; when righteousness was lost, then there were rites. Rites are the frills of the Way and the forerunners of disorder. So it is said, He who practices the Way does less every day, does less and goes on doing less, until he reaches the point where he does nothing, does nothing and yet there is nothing that is not done."

The ten thousand things are numerous, but they are one in their good order. Human beings are many, but they are all subjects of the sovereign.

Therefore it is said that the sovereign of dark antiquity ruled the world through inaction, through Heavenly Virtue and nothing more. (12, tr. Watson 1968:126) ...|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Huffington Post, Brian Baumgartner stated that [...] "The energy Spader has is so totally different. The writers have done really a great job. He has these demented arguments that on the surface make no sense, but hes talking, and suddenly and youre like, Oh yeah, thats right! Thats right!". In the same interview, Kate Flannery commented that Spader [...] "has this grounded intensity <b>that</b> <b>weve</b> never seen on our show before that makes these kind of little Scranton peons stand at attention". In an interview with NBC Chicago.com, Angela Kinsey praised Spaders portrayal of California, stating “He is amazing. Our first table read with him was a week before we went back {{and at that moment}} I was like, Oh, were going to be just fine. He crushed the table read. He brings such a cool, amazing, intensity as Robert California thats so different from Michael Scott. Michael wanted everyone to love him. Robert California wants to run the best company in the world, and to see him turn that kind of intensity onto Kevin Malone was cracking me up. I just love him as this character. And its been really fun to watch Dwight and Robert California act". Paul Lieberstein was pleased that Spader would be joining the cast in the eighth season, stating that [...] "James has an energy that is completely his own, and The Office has no tools for dealing with this guy. Were thrilled hes joining our cast". On July 28, 2011, Rainn Wilson favorably tweeted, when referring to Spaders acting on the series, [...] "hes Killing it!!!!". Former leading actor Steve Carell was also impressed by the decision to hire Spader, stating in an interview with Access Hollywood, [...] "I think its an excellent choice. I think its great and he will infuse all this new energy into the show".|$|E

Most people here, even graphic designers or graphic design academics {{do not know}} {{the answer to the question}} of what graphic design is. This condition brings out a new question of whether we really have a graphic design culture in Indonesia. If we trace back to the cause of it all, we will find a fact how a human interest discourse is still very rare in our country. Even when we find one, it tends to be a very subjective compilation of opinions instead of a strongly based study. In further look, this is one of the reasons of why many graphic designers are stirred into ineffective work process causing unequal partnerships in their professional projects. For this, we have none to blame but ourselves and the system <b>that</b> <b>weve</b> created...|$|E

My method of using cloud computing in career technology education can be implemented in a high school or community college environment.
