50|$|Newly constructed, fabricated, or {{repaired}} {{systems or}} other vessels are sometimes tested to verify satisfactory production or repair. Plumbers often test for leaks after {{working on a}} water or other fluid system. A vessel or system is sometimes pressure <b>tested</b> <b>by</b> <b>filling</b> with air and the pressure monitored {{to see if it}} drops, indicating a leak. A very commonly used test after new construction or repair is a hydrostatic test, sometimes called a pressure test. In a hydrostatic test, a system is pressurized with water to look for a drop in pressure or to see where it leaks out. Helium testing may be done to detect for any very small leakage such as when testing certain diaphragm or bellows valves, made for high purity and utra high purity service, requiring low leak rate capability. Helium and hydrogen have very small molecules which can go through very small leaks.|$|R

Participants carried out a migration <b>test</b> <b>by</b> article <b>filling</b> in provided polypropylene cups (volume 0. 3 L) with food simulant D 1 (ethanol 50 %, v/v) at 70 °C for 2 h and monitored the temperature of the food simulant inside one of the test specimen during the contact phase and provide details for the operating procedure. The participation to the ILC was satisfactory. The results show that 30 % of the 53 migration experiments performed by the 45 laboratories were successful (scoring 100 %) meaning that the temperature of the food simulant was in the desired range during the full contact time. It is clear that this result will trigger further discussion to improve the temperature control during a migration test. The information provided by the laboratories through the questionnaire gives a first insight in the factors that can be important to reach a satisfactory score. This discussion should lead to the selection of one or more methods for temperature control during migration testing. These selected methods need to be compared in a future ILC. JRC.

50|$|Cranial {{capacity}} {{is a measure}} of the volume of the interior of the cranium (also called the braincase or brainpan or skull) of those vertebrates who have both a cranium and a brain. The most commonly used unit of measure is the cubic centimetre or cm3. The volume of the cranium is used as a rough indicator of the size of the brain, although due to the thickness of the membranes that surround the brain, brain volume is less than cranial capacity. Cranial Capacity is often <b>tested</b> <b>by</b> <b>filling</b> the cranial cavity with particulate material (as mustard seed or small shot) and measuring the volume of the latter. However, this method of measuring cranial capacity must be validated in each species to know whether it is an accurate representation of the braincase. A more accurate way of measuring cranial capacity, is to make an endocranial cast and measure the amount of water the cast displaces. In the past there have been dozens of studies done to estimate cranial capacity on skulls, most of these studies have been done on dry skull using linear dimensions, packing methods or occasionally radiological methods.|$|R
30|$|The agar-well {{diffusion}} assay {{as described}} by Wonghirundecha et al. (2014) was performed in this study to determine the antibacterial activity of gliding bacterial crude extract. Crude extracts were tested for antibacterial activity against seven pathogenic bacteria: Vibrio cholerae non O 1 /non O 139 DMST 2873, Listeria monocytogenes DMST 1327, Escherichia coli DMST 4212, Bacillus cereus DMST 5040, Salmonella typhimurium DMST 562, Staphylococcus aureus DMST 8840 and Serratia marcescens TISTR 1354. Tested strains were activated twice in NB broth (at 37  °C, 18  h) and prepared to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland standards (approximately 105 – 106  CFU/ml) as an inoculum. One milliliter of an inoculum was well poured into 9  ml of Muller-Hinton soft medium (0.75  % agar, w/v) in a Petri dish. While those dishes were being solidified, six wells (6  mm in diameter) were drilled into each plate. Methanolic crude extracts were prepared to a final concentration of 25  mg/ml, and aliquots (100  µl) were <b>tested</b> <b>by</b> <b>filling</b> each well. DMSO and tetracycline were used as the negative and positive controls, respectively. Tested plates were incubated at 37  °C for 24  h and then monitored for inhibitory clear zones around the wells. The test for each crude extract against each pathogenic strain was carried out three times. The antibacterial activity was determined as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value, which is the minimum concentration of the extract that could inhibit the growth of tested microorganisms.|$|R
30|$|A unique {{feature of}} the da Vinci Xi system is camera port hopping. The camera may be {{switched}} to the second caudal trocar {{at this point in}} the operation to facilitate visualization of pelvic anatomy for distal ureterectomy and bladder cuff excision. The distal ureter is carefully dissected as it courses over the iliac vessels in order to prevent injury. Ureteral dissection is carried inferiorly to the level of the bladder hiatus and the superior vesicle pedicles can be preserved. The bladder is filled with sterile water and the detrusor muscle is dissected until identification of the bladder mucosa. Bladder cuff excision is performed by incising the mucosa of the bladder in a circumferential manner. An absorbable suture is preplaced at the edge of the cystotomy before completely excising the ureter and bladder cuff in order to maintain traction and control. The bladder defect is then closed in two layers with absorbable, running suture. The integrity of the repair is <b>tested</b> <b>by</b> <b>filling</b> the bladder with sterile water via the Foley catheter. If a leak is identified, additional sutures may be placed until no further extravasation is observed. The nephroureterectomy specimen is placed into a laparoscopic specimen retrieval bag. The renal bed and pelvis are reexamined to ensure hemostasis as the insufflation pressure is lowered to 5  mmHg. A drain is placed and the robot is undocked and all trocars are removed. The specimen may be extracted by making a midline or Gibson incision incorporating the most caudal port.|$|R

40|$|Malaysia is a {{tropical}} country with very high temperature during the day. Car users in Malaysia need in car air-conditioning system because {{the weather is}} hot and humid all year. Passenger adjusts the thermostat level (temperature knob setting) position to regulate the cold air temperature supplied to the cabin. By adjusting the thermostat, it affects the vehicle fuel consumption. When thermostat level is set to the lowest setting, compressor need to be driven {{on a regular basis}} and this require power from the engine. With the use of engine power, fuel consumption will increase. Fuel prices are very unstable and can get very high thus the need to lower its consumption. The objective {{of this study is to}} measure fuel consumption of different thermostat level setting of the air conditioning system, in the case of stationary cars and without passengers and driver in it. The data in this study were taken in four different modes and the two levels of the selected fan speed. At the same time the cabin temperature is monitored by specific device, to record the temperature, relative humidity and CO 2. Fuel consumption was <b>tested</b> <b>by</b> <b>filling</b> 5 liters of petrol into the external tank. After one hour of testing, the total of fuel consumption can be calculated by measuring the amount of fuel remaining. At the end of the experiment, the most practical and suitable thermostat level setting will be propose based on the fuel consumption usage and according to the specifications of the appropriate level of comfort based on parameters such as temperature, relative humidity and CO 2. Besides saving on fuel, it is also in this mode that the condition of temperature and humidity in the car’s cabin were found to be most comfortable.

40|$|ABSTRACT ‘Nothing is as {{variable}} as the weather’ is {{a well-known}} Dutch expression demonstrating the instability of the Dutch climate {{and as a consequence}} the daylight availability. In rapidly changing climate conditions, a non-adjustable, structural shading device is unsuitable. Therefore a system that blocks the direct sunlight when necessary without obstructing the diffuse daylight next to keeping view intact would be the best solution, both for user comfort as for energy consumption. A glazing system with a rapidly adjustable transmittance might be a good solution for such climate. Smart Energy Glass (SEG), a glazing system being developed by Peer+ can quickly switch between two light transmittance values (max. range of 30 %). The research question of this project was to determine, based on users comfort, these two values. An experimental set-up was made in the laboratory of Building Physics and Systems group with five identical rooms. All rooms were equipped with an equal sized daylight opening; four rooms had a different light transmittance (0. 08, 0. 25, 0. 52, and 0. 70). The fifth was the reference room and had normal glass with a transmittance of 0. 70. During summer, autumn, and winter, the same 24 healthy test-persons (age 23 ± 4 years) participated in the <b>tests.</b> <b>By</b> <b>filling</b> out a questionnaire regarding comfort, preferred transmittances and lighting situation under different daylight conditions was determined. The test people considered their working condition as comfortable with horizontal illuminance on the workplace of at least 267 lx. Regarding visual comfort, window luminance values of 6500 cd/m² were still accepted by the subjects, and glare was barely experienced or indicated. It could be concluded that during measurements with sunlight on the façade, the test space with a transmittance of 0. 25 was mostly evaluated for its good lighting by daylight. During measurements without sun, the test spaces with a transmittance of 0. 52 and 0. 70 were mostly positively evaluated for their good lighting by daylight. In the summer period, transmittances of 0. 25 and 0. 52 were most preferred by the subjects. This also applies for sunny days in the autumn. During overcast days in the autumn and during winter, there was a desire for higher light transmission. Taken into account the maximum range of 30 %, a transmittance range between 0. 40 - 0. 70 most users are satisfied with the lighting by daylight namely at least 71 % of the time, up to 89 % of the time...|$|R

50|$|After {{the dome}} on each tank was finished, miners would descend {{into the central}} shaft and begin {{removing}} the remaining rock {{between them and the}} dome. As the rock was mined, it would fall down the shaft and into a hopper which permitted passage of rock sizes suitable to be carried by the conveyor belts below. Then, a jaw crusher would reduce the rock down to 10-inch diameter pieces for disposal. After enough space was cleared, workers constructed a six-foot catwalk around the circumference and suspended from cables anchored in the dome. These walks carried not only miners, but air lines, water lines, hand tools, and other items.  Miners would lower themselves by rope, insert dynamite into the rock wall, raise the catwalk, and then detonate the explosives.  As the excavation went deeper, picks, shovels, and crowbars were used to scale down the loose rock and bring the wall to a sufficient depth behind the excavation line.  This permitted effective application of approximately six inches of gunite (a mixture of cement, sand, and water) to line the basalt rock.  They then coated the gunite with a layer of natural red dirt to prevent bonding with concrete and allow future injection of pressurized grout.  This continued {{all the way down to}} the base.Upon completion of the excavation, workers erected a steel tower in the center to the full height of 250 feet.  The tower served to support concrete chutes, pipes, booms, and other equipment necessary to install the piping, concrete, and steel linings.  Workers then began to erect the steel liner and rebar incrementally so that they could pour concrete in stages. Concrete was poured continually and workers had to remove wooden shoring as concrete filled. They injected pressurized grout to pre-stress the concrete <b>by</b> <b>filling</b> void space between the concrete and the gunite. When finished, the tanks were <b>tested</b> <b>by</b> slowly <b>filling</b> them with water while laborers in boats physically checked the entire surface area of the steel liner.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCurrent {{theories}} of reading eye movements claim that reading saccades are programmed {{primarily on the}} basis of information about the length of the upcoming word, determined by low-level visual processes that detect spaces to the right of fixation. Many studies attempted to <b>test</b> this claim <b>by</b> <b>filling</b> spaces between words with various non-space symbols (fillers). This manipulation, however, confounds the effect of inserting extraneous characters into text with the effect of obscuring word boundaries <b>by</b> <b>filling</b> spaces. We performed the control conditions necessary to unconfound these effects. Skilled readers read continuous stories aloud and silently. Three factors were varied: (i) position of the fillers in the text (at the beginning, the end, or surrounding each word); (ii) {{the presence or absence of}} spaces in the text; and (iii) the effect of the type of filler on word recognition (from greatest effect to least effect: Latin letters, Greek letters, digits and shaded boxes). The effect of fillers on reading depended more on the type of filler than on the presence of spaces. The greater effect the fillers had on word recognition, the more they slowed reading. Surrounding each word with digits or Greek letters slowed reading as much as filling spaces with these symbols. Surrounding each word with randomly chosen letters, while preserving spaces, slowed reading by 44 – 75 %—as much as, or more than, removing spaces from normal text. Removing spaces from text with Latin-letter fillers slowed reading by only 10 – 20 % more. We conclude that fillers in text disrupt reading by affecting word recognition directly, without necessarily affecting the eye movement pattern...|$|R

40|$|Liquid food {{products}} stick to solid surfaces. This problem occurs in all supply chain steps from production to recycling. Although {{the basic problem}} {{has been known for}} a long time, the parameters influencing the interfacial adhesion have not been clarified yet. Here, two methods (product depletion test and tack test) to evaluate the adhesion of highly viscous liquids to solid surfaces have been developed. The product depletion test allows the assessment of the residue amounts and covered surface areas during the gravity-driven flow on an inclined plane. The tack <b>test</b> is conducted <b>by</b> <b>filling</b> the gap between two parallelly mounted, horizontally oriented plates with a liquid product and measuring the normal force while separating the plates by pulling off the upper plate under defined conditions. The influence of the experimental parameters on the maximum normal force (F-max) could be shown. While the correlation between the pull off velocity of the upper plate and F-max follows a power law, the dependency between the gap size and F-max follows an exponential function. Although no significant correlation between F-max or the work of adhesion (W-a) and the solid's properties could be identified, a correlation between F-max and W-a was observed. As shown by product depletion with ketchup, although the surface coverage is only slightly influenced by the packaging material, the opposite is the case for the covered surface area which, therefore, determines the residue amounts. For some coated samples a large residue reduction was observed...|$|R
