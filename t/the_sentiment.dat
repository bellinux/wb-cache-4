5|$|Brown's {{second year}} as coach {{was the best}} in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated {{entering}} the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. This {{would be the last}} Big Game for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> for Stanford to switch back as well.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Wilcher {{released}} Heaven-Haven. The {{music was}} performed by The Linden String Quartet. During production of the CD, Wilcher saw press reports about the fatal attack of 18-year-old Sydney resident Thomas Kelly; Wilcher was unable to separate the sorrow he felt for Kelly and his family from <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> {{he was trying to}} convey through his music. He eventually dedicated the project to Kelly and announced that proceeds from the album would benefit the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brooks ran for {{governor}} representing the Brindle Tails. Brooks was a very vocal supporter of civil rights for former slaves, but also a supporter of re-enfranchisement for ex-Confederates, which was <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> nationally of Liberal Republicans. When the Democrats met, they agreed not only to not run a candidate, but even to support Joseph Brooks, {{as long as the}} election was fair and legal, since elections in the state had been wrought with fraud for five years. The issue of re-enfranchisement of Confederates was central to the election.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{generally}} saw the Knights as heroic {{and noble}} men who brought Christianity and civilization to the east. In August 1914, during World War I, Germany won a battle against Russia near the site. When the Germans realized its propaganda potential, they named the battle the Battle of Tannenberg, despite it having actually taken place {{much closer to}} Allenstein (Olsztyn), and framed it as revenge for the Polish–Lithuanian victory 504 years earlier. Nazi Germany later exploited <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> by portraying their Lebensraum policies as {{a continuation of the}} Knights' historical mission.|$|E
5|$|The Imagists {{rejected}} <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> and discursiveness {{typical of}} much Romantic and Victorian poetry, {{in contrast to}} their contemporaries, the Georgian poets, who were generally content to work within that tradition. Imagism called {{for a return to}} what were seen as more Classical values, such as directness of presentation and economy of language, as well as a willingness to experiment with non-traditional verse forms. Imagists use free verse.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, however, he was engaged to write The Smugglers, which he was told should take a higher priority. “The Nazis” was ultimately abandoned on June 15, 1966, with <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> being that the events it portrayed were {{too close to the}} present day.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Fitzgerald {{suffered}} {{a third and}} final heart attack, and died believing his work forgotten. His obituary in The New York Times mentioned Gatsby as evidence of great potential that was never reached. However, a strong appreciation for the book had developed in underground circles; future writers Edward Newhouse and Budd Schulberg were deeply affected by it and John O'Hara showed the book's influence. The republication of Gatsby in Edmund Wilson's edition of The Last Tycoon in 1941 produced an outburst of comment, with the general consensus expressing <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> that the book was an enduring work of fiction.|$|E
5|$|Minutes {{before the}} NHL trade {{deadline}} on February 27, 2012, Hodgson was dealt, along with defenceman Alexander Sulzer, to the Buffalo Sabres {{in exchange for}} fellow rookie forward Zack Kassian and defenceman Marc-André Gragnani. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis acknowledged the trade {{as an effort to}} balance his team out by trading Hodgson's skill and finesse in return for Kassian's size and toughness. Analysts from TSN and The Vancouver Sun also echoed <b>the</b> <b>sentiment,</b> commenting that while the Canucks gained elements in Kassian that were required to succeed in the playoffs, Hodgson's skill set reflected the style of play that Vancouver's success was based upon.|$|E
5|$|The Flood {{have been}} {{featured}} in four series of Halo action figures, produced by Joyride Studios. For Halo: Combat Evolved, Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle. Halo2s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game. Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and detail of the Flood. The action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the Flood, the third series featured a human Combat Form.|$|E

5|$|The Union Greenbackers {{held their}} {{convention}} first, meeting in St. Louis in March 1880. Although {{much of the}} young party's leadership remained with the Eastern faction, the March gathering included Solon Chase and Kersey Graves, among other third-party notables. They nominated Stephen D. Dillaye, a New Jersey lawyer and journalist, for President and Barzillai J. Chambers, a Texas merchant and surveyor, for Vice President. Because Dillaye had previously declared he {{was not interested in}} the nomination, many delegates protested, seeing Dillaye as a placeholder for eventual re-unification with the National Greenbackers. Dillaye himself supported reunification, and Pomeroy also urged the delegates to send representatives to the Easterners' convention, which was set for June 1880 in Chicago. The majority agreed with <b>the</b> <b>sentiment,</b> and Union Greenbackers gathered in Chicago along with National Greenbackers as their convention began a few months later.|$|E
5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> of both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves {{as if from a}} divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of whiskey {{was certainly not}} a norm in the colonies in the early years. The upper echelon of colonial society looked down upon American whiskey up until {{the time of the}} American Revolution. Some even saw the harsh spirit as a bastion of debauchery in the American colonies. Whatever <b>the</b> <b>sentiment,</b> the Scottish, Irish, and Germans brought a taste for hard spirits from their homelands to the American colonies in the 1730s. These groups continued to produce hard spirits in imported stills, or stills based on Old World designs, in retaliation against the English economic controls.|$|E

5|$|Events of 1848 in Europe and the Austrian Empire brought {{dramatic}} changes to Croatian society and politics, provoking the Croatian national revival that strongly influenced and significantly shaped {{political and social}} events in Croatia. At the time, the Sabor and Ban Josip Jelačić advocated the severance of ties with the Kingdom of Hungary, emphasising links to other South Slavic lands within the empire. Several prominent Croatian political figures emerged, such as Ante Starčević, Eugen Kvaternik, Franjo Rački and Josip Juraj Strossmayer. A period of neo-absolutism {{was followed by the}} Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Croatian–Hungarian Settlement, which granted limited independence to Croatia. This was compounded by Croatian claims of uninterrupted statehood since the early Middle Ages as a basis for a modern state. Two political parties that evolved in the 1860s and contributed significantly to <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> were the Party of Rights, led by Starčević and Kvaternik, and the People's Party, led by Janko Drašković, Ivan Kukuljević Sakcinski, Josip Juraj Strossmayer and Ivan Mažuranić. They were opposed by the National Constitutional Party, which was in power for most of the period between the 1860s and the 1918, and advocated closer ties between Croatia and Hungary.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} countrymen, Słowacki {{decided to}} stay in France as a {{political}} refugee. In 1832 he published his first collections of poems and his first two dramas (Mindowe and Maria Stuart). He also met Mickiewicz again; reportedly, Mickiewicz approached his younger colleague and shook his hand. However, Słowacki's poems, written in the 1820s, were unpopular among his Polish compatriots, as they failed to capture <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> of a people living under foreign occupation. Słowacki was angered by Mickiewicz, who not only stole the limelight with his Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego (Books of the Polish nation and pilgrimage), but his part three of Dziady (1832) cast Słowacki's stepfather, professor Bécu, {{in the role of}} a villain. In a letter to his mother Słowacki wrote that immediately after reading that work he was ready to challenge Mickiewicz for a duel; that did not come to pass but from that moment on, Słowacki would see Mickiewicz as his main rival. Few days later, antagonized by worsening reception of his works among the Polish émigré community in Paris, including sharp criticism from Mickiewicz, Słowacki left on a trip to Geneva, Switzerland. The French authorities denied him the right to return to France {{as part of a larger}} program to rid the country of the potentially subversive Polish exiles who had settled there.|$|E

Aden's brother Justin (Matthew Walker) is involved in a car accident, which causes short-term memory loss, but prompts him to admit that he too was abused by their grandfather. He regains his memory, and recalls that Larry was in the car {{at the time of the}} accident. He and Aden find their father dead. Convinced that the police will think Justin killed him, Aden decides that they should bury Larry. The police become suspicious nonetheless, and the two are arrested for murder, until a phone call made to Aden's phone from Larry confirms that he caused his own death by irresponsible driving. Justin convinces Aden to move to the city. When Nicole refuses to go with him, he leaves anyway.|$|E

5|$|Support for Chovanec's {{comments}} {{was largely}} {{among members of}} parliament elected for the Communist Party. Others accused Chovanec of abusing the tragedy for his own political benefit. Some members of parliament, such as Miroslav Antl, Chairman of the Senate Constitutional Committee, commented that the licensing process is thorough enough, and pointed out that he considers carrying of concealed firearm as a necessity due to variety of reasons, especially in recent time also due to the rising threat of Islamist terrorist attacks. Roman Váňa, Chairman of the Parliamentary Security Committee and member of Chovanec's own Social Democratic party, refused Chovanec's argument, while some other members of parliament went in the opposite direction, claiming {{that there are too}} few armed people among the Czech population, since a single armed civilian might have stopped Kovář's assault. <b>The</b> <b>sentiment</b> was shared also by, for example, Martin Koller, a former ambassador to Kuvait and Iraq, who said that an armed attacker may be stopped only by armed force, and who pointed out to a past well-known Czech case of a machete attack and to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, stating that both might have ended quite differently had the victims been armed.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{method for}} determining sentiment {{is the use}} of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated with having a negative, neutral, or positive sentiment with them are given an associated number on a −10 to +10 scale (most negative up to most positive) or simply from 0 to a positive upper limit such as +4. This makes it possible to adjust <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> of a given term relative to its environment (usually on the level of the sentence). When a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using natural language processing, each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score. This allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding of sentiment, because it is now possible to adjust <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it. Words, for example, that intensify, relax or negate <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> expressed by the concept can affect its score. Alternatively, texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score if the goal is to determine <b>the</b> <b>sentiment</b> in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text.|$|E
