5|$|<b>Tungsten</b> {{carbides}} (W2C and WC) {{are produced}} by heating powdered <b>tungsten</b> with carbon. W2C is resistant to chemical attack, although it reacts strongly with chlorine to form <b>tungsten</b> hexachloride (WCl6).|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of <b>tungsten</b> is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the <b>tungsten</b> sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to <b>tungsten</b> thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. <b>Tungsten</b> forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and <b>tungsten</b> formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated <b>tungsten</b> wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas <b>tungsten</b> arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of <b>tungsten</b> electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E
5|$|Gas <b>tungsten</b> {{arc welding}} (GTAW) – {{also known as}} TIG (<b>tungsten,</b> inert gas), uses a non-consumable <b>tungsten</b> {{electrode}} to produce the weld. The weld area is protected from atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas such as argon or helium.|$|E
5|$|Gas <b>tungsten</b> {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or <b>tungsten</b> inert gas (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process {{that uses a}} nonconsumable <b>tungsten</b> electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a {{separate}} filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, this method {{is characterized by a}} stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds.|$|E
5|$|In its raw form, <b>tungsten</b> {{is a hard}} {{steel-grey metal}} that is often brittle and hard to work. If made very pure, <b>tungsten</b> retains its {{hardness}} (which exceeds that of many steels), and becomes malleable enough {{that it can be}} worked easily. It is worked by forging, drawing, or extruding. <b>Tungsten</b> objects are also commonly formed by sintering.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum oxide {{additive}} to <b>tungsten</b> {{is used in}} gas <b>tungsten</b> {{arc welding}} electrodes, {{as a substitute for}} radioactive thorium.|$|E
5|$|Of all {{metals in}} pure form, <b>tungsten</b> {{has the highest}} melting point (3422°C, 6192°F), lowest vapor {{pressure}} (at temperatures above 1650°C, 3000°F), and the highest tensile strength. Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than <b>tungsten,</b> carbon sublimes at atmospheric pressure instead of melting, so it has no melting point. <b>Tungsten</b> has the lowest {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of any pure metal. The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of <b>tungsten</b> originate from strong covalent bonds formed between <b>tungsten</b> atoms by the 5d electrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{equipment}} {{required for}} the gas <b>tungsten</b> arc welding operation includes a welding torch utilizing a non-consumable <b>tungsten</b> electrode, a constant-current welding power supply, and a shielding gas source.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tungsten</b> {{trioxide}} {{can form}} intercalation compounds with alkali metals. These {{are known as}} bronzes; an example is sodium <b>tungsten</b> bronze.|$|E
5|$|Alloying small {{quantities}} of <b>tungsten</b> with steel greatly increases its toughness.|$|E
5|$|Elemental <b>tungsten</b> resists {{attack by}} oxygen, acids, and alkalis.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} is {{effected by}} a chemical transport reaction developed by Arkel and de Boer: In a closed vessel, hafnium reacts with iodine at temperatures of 500°C, forming hafnium(IV) iodide; at a <b>tungsten</b> filament of 1700°C the reverse reaction happens, and the iodine and hafnium are set free. The hafnium forms a solid coating at the <b>tungsten</b> filament, and the iodine can react with additional hafnium, {{resulting in a}} steady turn over.|$|E
5|$|Gas <b>tungsten</b> {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} <b>tungsten</b> inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable <b>tungsten</b> {{electrode}} to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not require it. A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 an Austrian chemist Auer von Welsbach {{developed}} the Oslamp with a filament made of osmium, which he introduced commercially in 1902. After {{only a few}} years, osmium {{was replaced by the}} more stable metal <b>tungsten.</b> <b>Tungsten</b> has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|In {{military}} ordnance, <b>tungsten</b> or uranium {{is used in}} {{armour plating}} and armour piercing projectiles, {{as well as in}} nuclear weapons to increase efficiency (by reflecting neutrons and momentarily delaying the expansion of reacting materials). In the 1970s, tantalum was found to be more effective than copper in shaped charge and explosively formed anti-armour weapons on account of its higher density, allowing greater force concentration, and better deformability. Less-toxic heavy metals, such as copper, tin, <b>tungsten,</b> and bismuth, and probably manganese (as well as boron, a metalloid), have replaced lead and antimony in the green bullets used by some armies and in some recreational shooting munitions. Doubts have been raised about the safety (or green credentials) of <b>tungsten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum anodes replace <b>tungsten</b> {{in certain}} low voltage X-ray sources for {{specialized}} uses such as mammography.|$|E

5|$|Nickel {{is used as}} {{a binder}} in the {{cemented}} <b>tungsten</b> carbide or hardmetal industry and used in proportions of 6% to 12% by weight. Nickel makes the <b>tungsten</b> carbide magnetic and adds corrosion-resistance to the cemented parts, although the hardness is less than those with a cobalt binder.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, <b>tungsten,</b> brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with <b>tungsten</b> cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In fly fishing, sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with <b>tungsten</b> powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. <b>Tungsten</b> was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. <b>Tungsten</b> hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{oxidation}} state known for seaborgium {{other than the}} group oxidation state of +6 is the zero oxidation state. Similarly to its three lighter congeners, forming chromium hexacarbonyl, molybdenum hexacarbonyl, and <b>tungsten</b> hexacarbonyl, seaborgium {{has been shown in}} 2014 to also form seaborgium hexacarbonyl, Sg(CO)6. Like its molybdenum and <b>tungsten</b> homologues, seaborgium hexacarbonyl is a volatile compound that reacts readily with silicon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tungsten</b> is {{the only}} metal from the third {{transition}} series that is known to occur in biomolecules, where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea. It is the heaviest element known to be essential to any living organism. <b>Tungsten</b> interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to animal life.|$|E
5|$|A {{common set of}} {{calibration}} lamps (Helium and Neon arc lamps, and a <b>Tungsten</b> flat-field lamp) are permanently {{mounted at}} one of the broken-Cassegrain foci, and can be used for any of the other instruments.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>tungsten</b> alloys have been {{standardized}} by the International Organization for Standardization and the American Welding Society in ISO 6848 and AWS A5.12, respectively, {{for use in}} GTAW electrodes, and are summarized in the adjacent table.|$|E
5|$|Another 30 {{artificial}} radioisotopes of <b>tungsten</b> {{have been}} characterized, {{the most stable}} of which are 181W with a half-life of 121.2days, 185W with a half-life of 75.1days, 188W with a half-life of 69.4days, 178W with a half-life of 21.6days, and 187W with a half-life of 23.72 h. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 3hours, {{and most of these}} have half-lives below 8minutes. <b>Tungsten</b> also has 4meta states, the most stable being 179mW (t1/2 6.4minutes).|$|E
5|$|August 21: Harry Daghlian, a physicist, {{receives}} a fatal dose (510 rems) of radiation from a criticality accident when he accidentally dropped a <b>tungsten</b> carbide brick onto a plutonium bomb core. He dies on September 15.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{combines}} {{with some}} metals at high temperatures to form metallic carbides, {{such as the}} iron carbide cementite in steel, and <b>tungsten</b> carbide, widely used as an abrasive and for making hard tips for cutting tools.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} {{is done by}} {{a chemical}} transport reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer. In a closed vessel, the metal reacts with iodine at temperatures above 500°C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a <b>tungsten</b> filament of nearly 2000°C the reverse reaction happens and the iodine and metal are set free. The metal forms a solid coating on the <b>tungsten</b> filament and the iodine can react with additional metal resulting in a steady turnover.|$|E
5|$|Glass {{can also}} be welded to metals and ceramics, {{although}} with metals the process is usually more adhesion {{to the surface of}} the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials. However, certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals. For example, lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum, but not to aluminum. <b>Tungsten</b> electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass, so the <b>tungsten</b> is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass, which bonds to both <b>tungsten</b> and quartz. However, care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again. Special alloys are often used for this purpose, ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match, and sometimes thin, metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass.|$|E
5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, <b>tungsten</b> inclusions in the weld may result. Known as <b>tungsten</b> spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact the molten metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E
5|$|In 1781, Carl Wilhelm Scheele {{discovered}} that a new acid, tungstic acid, could be made from scheelite (at the time named <b>tungsten).</b> Scheele and Torbern Bergman suggested {{that it might be}} possible to obtain a new metal by reducing this acid. In 1783, José and Fausto Elhuyar found an acid made from wolframite that was identical to tungstic acid. Later that year, at the Royal Basque Society in the town of Bergara, Spain, the brothers succeeded in isolating <b>tungsten</b> by reduction of this acid with charcoal, and they are credited with the discovery of the element.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{americium}} {{is obtained}} by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride {{was first used}} for this purpose. The reaction was conducted using elemental barium as reducing agent in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and <b>tungsten.</b>|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} <b>tungsten</b> {{consists of}} five isotopes whose half-lives are {{so long that}} they can be considered stable. Theoretically, all five can decay into isotopes of element 72 (hafnium) by alpha emission, but only 180W has been observed to do so with a half-life of (1.8 ± 0.2)×1018 years; on average, this yields about two alpha decays of 180W in one gram of natural <b>tungsten</b> per year. The other naturally occurring isotopes have not been observed to decay, constraining their half-lives to be at least 4×1021 years.|$|E
5|$|Pure <b>tungsten</b> {{electrodes}} (classified as WP or EWP) are {{general purpose}} and low cost electrodes. They have poor heat resistance and electron emission. They find limited use in AC welding of e.g. magnesium and aluminum.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium diboride (ReB2) {{is a hard}} {{compound}} {{having the}} hardness {{similar to that of}} <b>tungsten</b> carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride.|$|E
5|$|The free {{element is}} {{remarkable}} for its robustness, especially {{the fact that}} it has the highest melting point of all the elements discovered, melting at 3422°C (6192°F, 3695K). It also has the second highest boiling point, at 5930°C (10706°F, 6203K). Its density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline <b>tungsten</b> is an intrinsically brittle and hard material (under standard conditions, when uncombined), making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline <b>tungsten</b> is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{metal parts}} of a torch are made of hard alloys of copper or brass so it can transmit current and heat effectively. The <b>tungsten</b> electrode must be held firmly {{in the center of}} the torch with an appropriately sized collet, and ports around the electrode provide a constant flow of shielding gas. Collets are sized according to the diameter of the <b>tungsten</b> electrode they hold. The body of the torch is made of heat-resistant, insulating plastics covering the metal components, providing insulation from heat and electricity to protect the welder.|$|E
