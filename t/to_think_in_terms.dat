Early relations between Hawaiians and explorers were also based on barter, with nails, beads, and small pieces of iron sometimes being used as money, but as more systematic foreign trade began {{at the turn of the}} 19th century, coins of many lands came to the islands as payment for exports. The arrival of the missionaries, and the plantations and other commercial activity that soon followed, led to the first currencies generated by the islands: tokens and scrip used to pay workers because of the chronic shortage of small change. The trade ties and cultural connections with the United States led the early Hawaii business community <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the US dollar, and it became the basis for trade, with the Hawaiian royal government periodically publishing tables of the value of non-US coins in terms of the dollar. This was necessary because such coins, brought to the islands by foreign trade, circulated as a means of exchange alongside American silver and gold pieces.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} action to alter village society was the land {{reform of the}} late 1940s and early 1950s, in which the party sent work teams to every village {{to carry out its}} land reform policy. This in itself was an {{unprecedented}} display of administrative and political power. The land reform had several related goals. The work teams were to redistribute some (though not all) land from the wealthier families or land-owning trusts to the poorest segments of the population and so to effect a more equitable distribution of the basic means of production; to overthrow the village elites, who might be expected to oppose the party and its programs; to recruit new village leaders from among those who demonstrated the most commitment to the party's goals; and to teach everyone <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of class status rather than kinship group or patron-client ties.|$|E
500|$|The Fairchild Family was so {{successful}} that Sherwood wrote two sequels, one in 1842 and one in 1847. These reflected her changing values {{as well as those}} of the Victorian period. Significantly, the servants in Part I, [...] "who are almost part of the family, are pushed aside in Part III by their gossiping, flattering counterparts in the fine manor-house." [...] But the most extensive thematic change in the series was the disappearance of evangelicalism. Whereas all of the lessons in Part I highlight the children's [...] "human depravity" [...] and encourage the reader <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the afterlife, in Parts II and III, other Victorian values such as [...] "respectability" [...] and filial obedience come to the fore.

[...] The second two volumes also outline narrower roles for each sex. In Part I Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns Latin, but in Part II, Henry's scrapes involve letting loose a bull while the girls focus intently on how to make purchases in an economical yet fair fashion. The most extensive thematic change in the series, however, was the disappearance of its strident evangelicalism.

500|$|After the Dubai World Cup, California Chrome {{was shipped}} to Rae Guest's Newmarket stables in England {{to prepare for}} Royal Ascot week in June. The {{decision}} to go to England was made by Perry Martin, against the wishes of both Coburn and Sherman. Martin explained, [...] "I was trying <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of what's best for the horse. It was my decision to send him to Newmarket. It's a beautiful place, with trees and pastures for gallops...It's good for his mind. I know Art didn't take the decision well. But he'll be okay." [...] The horse's exercise rider in England, Robbie Mills, who was acquainted with the Shermans and advised them to stable the horse with Guest, stated that California Chrome was making a good transition from the flat dirt tracks of the United States to the undulating turf gallops of England. The horse was pointed to the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot, with European jockey William Buick, who rode Prince Bishop in Dubai, tapped to ride. The day before the race, the horse was scratched because of a bruised hoof that was draining pus. Guest stated, [...] "He's been X-rayed and there's no damage." [...] Martin wanted to run him in Chicago's Arlington Million in August, and the requirements of quarantine upon his return to the United States combined with the setback to his training foreclosed any other UK start. [...] Upon California Chrome's return to the US in early July, a veterinary radiograph revealed that he had bruising on his cannon bones that would require at least three months to heal, effectively ending his four-year-old season. The veterinarians at Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Kentucky explained, [...] "California Chrome's x-rays showed all of his joints to be remarkably clean. He has the early signs of bruising {{to the bottom of the}} cannon bones...The return rate for horses with this problem is very high...we found that recovery rate was 95% after giving time in the paddock to heal." ...|$|E

40|$|In a 1989 {{essay on}} “Retrieval {{inhibition}} as an adaptive mechanism in human memory, ” written for a volume honoring Endel Tulving, I argued that inhibitory processes played {{little or no}} role in then-current theories of human memory (Bjork, 1989). I viewed that fact as puzzling—given that inhibitory processes had long been acknowledged by brain and behavioral scientists to be critical at the neural, sensory, attentional, and motor levels, and in the ontogeny of brain development. Towards explaining why inhibition seemed out of favor as an explanatory concept, I suggested that two aspects of the prevailing research zeitgeist played a role: “First, notions of inhibition or suppression in human memory have an unappealing association to certain poorly understood clinical phenomena, such as repression. Second, the information-processing approach, grounded {{as it is in}} the computer metaphor, leads us <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>term</b> of processes like storing, scanning, grouping, erasing, and so forth. Notions like inhibition, suppression, unlearning, and spontaneous recovery are not easily compatible with the computer metaphor. (p. 310...|$|R

2500|$|Because {{conclusions}} about research results {{are made in}} a probabilistic manner, {{it is impossible to}} work with two simple categories of outcome research reports. Research evidence does not fall simply into [...] "evidence-based" [...] and [...] "non-evidence-based" [...] classes, but can be anywhere on a continuum from one to the other, depending on factors such as the way the study was designed and carried out. The existence of this continuum makes it necessary <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of [...] "levels of evidence", or categories of stronger or weaker evidence that a treatment is effective.

[...] Relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism, where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony.

[...] His daughter Agnes, [...] "in conversations, was less polite and oblique: 'Heresy' was her word, pronounced with glee and gusto."

When the 4th Guard Division relieved the 1st Bavarian Division opposite the British 25th Division in early May, British mine attacks were increasing in frequency and the divisional pioneer companies were supplemented by Bergmannszüge (Mine Sections) and Bavarian pioneer units which had stayed behind. Loringhoven used his influence to mass eighty artillery batteries for the operation, on the [...] of front from Liévin, a suburb of Lens, to Vimy, all carefully hidden between houses and in buildings. British positions were photographed by reconnaissance aircrews and aircraft reinforcements and anti-aircraft guns, some on lorries, were used to deter British reconnaissance aircraft.
