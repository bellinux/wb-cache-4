5|$|From {{the close}} of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series of Bourbon Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, {{including}} two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the state's first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley's election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> been unable to preserve this level of parity, and in that period only four of the twenty elected governors have been from the Republican party, including incumbent Matt Bevin.|$|E
25|$|The Republican National Committee (RNC) is {{responsible}} for promoting Republican campaign activities. It {{is responsible}} for developing and promoting the Republican political platform, as well as coordinating fundraising and election strategy. Its current chairwoman is Ronna Romney McDaniel. The chair of the RNC is chosen by the President when <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> the White House or otherwise by the Party's state committees.|$|E
25|$|In the 2016 elections, Republicans {{held the}} New Hampshire House of Representatives with a {{majority}} of 220–175, and held onto their 14 seats in the New Hampshire Senate. In the gubernatorial race, retiring Governor Maggie Hassan was succeeded by Republican Chris Sununu, who defeated Democratic nominee Colin Van Ostern. Sununu became the state's first Republican governor since Craig Benson, who left office in 2005 following defeat by John Lynch. Republicans control the governor's office and both chambers of the state legislature, a governing trifecta in which <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> full governing power. In the presidential race, the state voted for the Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, {{by a margin of}} 2,736 votes, or 0.3%, one of the closest results the state has ever seen in a presidential race, while Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson received 4.12% of the vote. The Democrats also won a competitive race in the Second Congressional District, as well as a competitive senate race. New Hampshire's congressional delegation currently consists of exclusively Democrats. It is one of only seven states with an entirely Democratic delegation, five of which are in New England (the others are Delaware and Hawaii).|$|E

25|$|Opposing them, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Army of the North, {{led by the}} Colonel Prada, {{with the}} XIV Army Corps led by Francisco Galán (8,000–10,000 men) and the Colonel Linares's XVII Army corps (35,000). The Prada's chief of staff was Francisco Ciutat. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> 180 cannons, one {{squadron}} of Chatos and two flights of Moscas, around 35 aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Opposing them, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> Prada's 14th Army Corps and José García Vayas's 15th Army Corps, {{under the}} overall command of General Mariano Gámir Ulíbarri; {{a total of}} about 80,000 men. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> also 44 {{aircraft}} (mostly slow and old, except 18 Soviet-built fighters). Furthermore, the morale of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> troops was low, and Basque soldiers thought that they might surrender to the Italians, in return for their lives.|$|R
500|$|While Sam and Bruno are {{concerned}} about the loyalty of a powerful California union official (Sandoval), Toby and Josh are preparing for a meeting with the congressional opposition to re-negotiate the estate tax—or the [...] "death tax" [...] as <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> labeled it—but are then surprised by a last-minute cancellation. It soon becomes clear that the Republicans are planning to repeal the estate tax altogether, and might have the votes to do so. An attempt to win over the black caucus, led by Congressman Mark Richardson (Barry), fails. At a loss over what to do, an initiative comes from unexpected quarters. The previously over-cautious political strategist, Doug Wegland, suggests the president responds by doing something he has never done before: veto the bill.|$|E
2500|$|According to the California Secretary of State, as of April, 2008, Monterey County has 147,066 {{registered}} voters. [...] Of those voters, 72,550 (49.3%) {{are registered}} Democratic, 42,744 (29.1%) are registered Republican, 5,488 (3.7%) are registered with other political parties, and 26,284 (17.9%) declined to state a political party. [...] Except for Sand City, {{all of the}} other cities, towns, and the unincorporated area of Monterey County have more individuals registered with the Democratic Party than the Republican Party. [...] In Sand City, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> the advantage by 1 voter.|$|E
2500|$|Nixon {{managed to}} win 18% of the African American vote (Gerald Ford would get 16% in 1976). He also {{remains the only}} Republican in modern times to {{threaten}} the oldest extant Democratic stronghold of South Texas: {{this is the last}} election when <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> won Hidalgo or Dimmit Counties, the only time Republicans have won La Salle County since William McKinley in 1900, and one of only two occasions since Theodore Roosevelt in 1904 that Republicans have gained a majority in Presidio County. More significantly, the 1972 election is the last time several highly populous urban counties – including Cook in Illinois, Orleans in Louisiana, Hennepin in Minnesota, [...] Cuyahoga in Ohio, Durham in North Carolina, Queens in New York and Prince George’s in Maryland – have voted Republican.|$|E
50|$|Bridges was reelected to four {{subsequent}} {{terms in}} 1942, 1948, 1954, and 1960, {{but he did}} not complete his final term due to his death. He became <b>the</b> highest-ranking <b>Republican</b> senator, serving as chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation when <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> control of <b>the</b> Senate from 1947 until 1949, Senate Minority Leader from 1952 until 1953, President pro tempore of the United States Senate when <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> control of it from 1953 until 1955, chairman of the Joint Committee on Inaugural Arrangements for both of the inaugurations of President Dwight Eisenhower, Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations when <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> control of <b>the</b> Senate from 1947-1949 and 1953-1955, and Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Policy Committee from 1954 until his death.|$|R
50|$|In the Aragon front <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Army <b>had</b> {{deployed}} <b>the</b> Army of the East, led by {{the general}} Pozas and {{his chief of staff}} Antonio Cordon. This army had six divisions (Lister's 11th Division, 26th Division, 27th Division, Walter's 35th Division, 43rd Division; and Kleber's 45th Division). Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> 200 aircraft and many T-26 and BT-5 tanks.|$|R

2500|$|... Ohio's voter {{demographic}} leans {{towards the}} Democratic Party. An estimated 2,408,178 Ohioans are {{registered to vote}} as Democrats, while 1,471,465 Ohioans are registered to vote as Republicans. These are changes from 2004 of 72% and 32%, respectively, and Democrats have registered over 1,000,000 new Ohioans since 2004. Unaffiliated voters have an [...] of 15% since 2004, losing an estimated 718,000 of their kind. The total now rests at 4,057,518 Ohioans. In total, there are 7,937,161 Ohioans registered to vote. In United States presidential election of 2008, then-Senator Barack Obama of Illinois won 51.50% of Ohio's popular vote, 4.59 percentage points more than his nearest rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona (with 46.91% of the popular vote). However, Obama won only 22 of Ohio's 88 counties. Since 2010, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> largely controlled Ohio state politics, including a super-majority in the state's House, {{a majority in the}} state Senate, the Governorship, etc. As of 2014, the state Senate is 1 Republican away from a super-majority.|$|E
2500|$|The final {{redistricting}} {{plan was}} less ambitious but still made the already heavily Democratic 8th district even more Democratic. It restored a heavily Democratic spur of eastern Montgomery County removed in the 1990 redistricting and added nine precincts in Prince George's County from Al Wynn's heavily Democratic [...] Although it forced Van Hollen and Shriver {{to run against}} each other in an expensive primary, Van Hollen defeated Morella in 2002 with 52 percent of the vote to Morella's 47 percent. Van Hollen trounced her in the Prince George's portion of the district, an area that Morella did not know and that did not know her. However, Morella also lost the Montgomery portion of the district 51% to 48%. She carried only some of the precincts she had previously represented. Proving just how Democratic this district was, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> only put up nominal challengers in the 8th since Morella's defeat; none of them have cracked the 40 percent barrier.|$|E
2500|$|During much of {{the last}} half of the 19th century, Chicago's {{politics}} were dominated by a growing Democratic Party organization. During the 1880s and 1890s, Chicago had a powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, anarchist and labor organizations. For {{much of the}} 20th century, Chicago has been among the largest and most reliable Democratic strongholds in the United States; with Chicago's Democratic vote the state of Illinois has been [...] "solid blue" [...] in presidential elections since 1992. Even before then, it was not unheard of for Republican presidential candidates to win handily in downstate Illinois, only to lose statewide due to large Democratic margins in Chicago. The citizens of Chicago have not elected a Republican mayor since 1927, when William Thompson was voted into office. The strength of the party in the city is partly a consequence of Illinois state politics, where <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> come to represent rural and farm concerns while the Democrats support urban issues such as Chicago's public school funding. Chicago contains less than 25% of the state's population, but 8 of Illinois' 19 U.S.Representatives have part of Chicago in their districts.|$|E

The Basque Army in Biscay had 30,000 men (most of them Basque Nationalists and also Asturians). <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> also <b>had</b> 140 guns, 25-30 aircraft, two destroyers and three submarines.|$|R

2500|$|In April 2010, while Congress was {{considering}} financial reform legislation, a reporter asked McConnell {{if he was}} [...] "doing the bidding of the large banks." [...] McConnell has received more money in donations from the [...] "Finance, Insurance and Real Estate" [...] sector than any other sector according to the Center for Responsive Politics. McConnell responded [...] "I'd say that that's inaccurate. You could talk to the community bankers in Kentucky." [...] The Democratic Party's plan for financial reform is actually a way to institute [...] "endless taxpayer funded bailouts for big Wall Street banks", said McConnell. He {{expressed concern that the}} proposed $50 billion, bank-funded fund that would be used to liquidate financial firms that could collapse [...] "would of course immediately signal to everyone that the government is ready to bail out large banks". In McConnell's home state of Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader ran an editorial saying: [...] "We have read that <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> a plan for financial reform, but McConnell isn't talking up any solutions, just trashing the other side's ideas with no respect for the truth." [...] According to one tally, McConnell's largest donor from the period from January 1, 2009, to September 30, 2015, was Bob McNair, contributing $1,502,500.|$|E

60|$|The French Revolution {{has been}} the subject of various speculations and various histories.

50|$|On July 12, the Democratic National Convention {{convened in}} Philadelphia {{in the same}} arena where <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> met a few weeks earlier. Spirits were low; <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>had</b> taken control of both houses of the United States Congress and a {{majority}} of state governorships during the 1946 mid-term elections, and the public opinion polls showed Truman trailing Republican nominee Dewey, sometimes by double digits. Furthermore, some liberal Democrats had joined Henry A. Wallace's new Progressive Party, and party leaders feared that Wallace would take enough votes from Truman to give the large Northern and Midwestern states to <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|R

6000|$|But in {{all this}} it is very plain the Judge evades the only {{question}} <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> ever pressed upon the Democracy in regard to Utah. That question the Judge well knew to be this: [...] "If the people of Utah peacefully form a State constitution tolerating polygamy, will the Democracy admit them into the Union?" [...] There {{is nothing in the}} United States Constitution or law against polygamy; and why is it {{not a part of the}} Judge's [...] "sacred right of self-government" [...] for the people to have it, or rather to keep it, if they choose? These questions, so far as I know, the Judge never answers. It might involve the Democracy to answer them either way, and they go unanswered.|$|E
6000|$|At length a squabble springs {{up between}} the President {{and the author of}} the Nebraska bill, on the mere {{question}} of fact, whether the Lecompton Constitution was or was not, in any just sense, made by the people of Kansas; and in that quarrel the latter declares that all he wants is a fair vote for the people, and that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up. I do not understand his declaration that he cares not whether slavery be voted down or voted up to be intended by him other than as an apt definition of the policy he would impress upon the public mind--the principle for which he declares he has suffered so much, and is ready to suffer to the end. And well may he cling to that principle. If he has any parental feeling, well may he cling to it. That principle is the only shred left of his original Nebraska doctrine. Under the Dred Scott decision [...] "squatter sovereignty" [...] squatted out of existence, tumbled down like temporary scaffolding--like the mould at the foundry served through one blast and fell back into loose sand,--helped to carry an election, and then was kicked to the winds. His late joint struggle with the Republicans against the Lecompton Constitution involves nothing of the original Nebraska doctrine. That struggle was made on a point--the right of a people to make their own constitution--upon which he and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> never differed.|$|E
