5|$|News of McCabe’s {{death was}} made public while Australia and England were playing in the Fifth Test at The Oval. After the death was {{announced}} over the public address system, the crowd spontaneously stood up and took off <b>their</b> <b>hats,</b> and did the players, and they observed a self-initiated moment of silence. However, McCabe’s friend and former teammate Fingleton, now a journalist, criticised the Australian team for not wearing black armbands.|$|E
5|$|In another {{patrol in}} July, U-14 sailed {{on the north}} side of the island of Corfu while headed for Santi Quaranta, Albania. Because the harbor at Corfu was {{occupied}} by the French fleet at the time, U-14 conducted a ruse de guerre by flying the submarine's former national flag, the French tricolor, in order to pass unmolested. Even though U-14s new conning tower made her look unlike any other Brumaire-class boat, one French patrol plane was successfully fooled by the ruse. When U-14s crew first spotted the aircraft, flying towards them from the direction of the sun, there was not enough time to submerge. As the aircraft drew near, its French markings—and its cargo of bombs—became apparent to the crew. With no other course of action possible, U-14s crew waved <b>their</b> <b>hats</b> and handkerchiefs at the plane. As the French pilot passed overhead, he returned the waves, apparently unaware of the U-boat's true nationality. The only success by U-14 on this cruise was the sinking of Marionga Goulandris, a Greek steamer, near Cape Matapan.|$|E
5|$|The Duke and Duchess of York (later George V and Queen Mary) visited New Zealand in 1901. At an {{official}} Māori welcome in Rotorua, a guide took a huia tail feather {{from her hair}} {{and placed it in}} the band of the Duke's hat as a token of respect. Many people in England and New Zealand wanted to emulate this royal fashion and wear huia feathers in <b>their</b> <b>hats.</b> The price of tail feathers was soon pushed to £1, making each bird worth £12, and some feathers sold for as much as £5. Female huia beaks were also set in gold as jewellery. Shooting season notices ceased listing the huia as a protected species in 1901, and a last-ditch attempt to reinforce government protection failed when the solicitor general ruled that there was no law to protect feathers.|$|E

5|$|Maitland showed Napoleon {{the great}} cabin, {{which he had}} placed at his disposal, {{and gave him a}} tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m. the Superb {{anchored}} in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard the Bellerophon. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on the Superb, and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS Myrmidon. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed <b>their</b> <b>hats</b> and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, only talking with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as Bellerophon came in sight of Ushant, the last piece of French land visible {{for the remainder of the}} journey. He climbed up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak to any of them.|$|E

Ming-Ming is always the first one to get back in her cage, Tuck is always the second, and Linny is always the last.

Brown was extremely flexible and could touch the plume to the ground between his heels.|$|R
50|$|Through the World War I era, the {{campaign}} hat worn by American soldiers was fairly soft.

Each seaman involved received £182 4s 9¾d, the equivalent of ten years pay.|$|E

People would have parties in natural surroundings, with lăutari (fiddlers) for those who could afford it.

25|$|For {{the first}} time in centuries, respectable but daringly fashionable women would leave the house without a hat or bonnet, {{previously}} something often associated with prostitutes. However most women continued to wear something on their head outdoors, though they were beginning to cease to do so indoors during the day (as well as for evening wear). The antique head-dress, or Queen Mary coif, Chinese hat, Oriental inspired turban, and Highland helmet were popular. As for bonnets, their crowns and brims were adorned with increasingly elaborate ornamentations, such as feathers and ribbons. In fact, ladies of the day embellished <b>their</b> <b>hats</b> frequently, replacing old decorations with new trims or feathers.|$|E
25|$|Up until 1997, {{uniforms and}} hats had distinctions {{according}} to their rank. For example, senior constable and sergeant ranks are plastic ranks on the sleeve of the uniform.
