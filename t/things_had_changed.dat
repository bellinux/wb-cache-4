At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was {{not up to the}} task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, <b>things</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> and Cray decided {{it was the only way}} forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, GigaBit Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Apple {{began to}} {{organize}} the Apple Lisa project, aiming to build a next-generation machine similar to an advanced Apple III or the yet-to-be-introduced IBM PC. In 1979, Steve Jobs learned of the advanced work on graphical user interfaces (GUI) taking place at Xerox PARC. He arranged for Apple engineers {{to be allowed to}} visit PARC to see the systems in action. The Apple Lisa project was immediately redirected to utilize a GUI, which at that time was well beyond {{the state of the art}} for microprocessor capabilities; the Xerox Alto required a custom processor that spanned several circuit boards in a case which was the size of a small refrigerator. <b>Things</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> dramatically with the introduction of the 32-bit Motorola 68000 in 1979, which offered at least an order of magnitude better performance than existing designs, and made a software GUI machine a practical possibility. The basic layout of the Lisa was largely complete by 1982, at which point Jobs' continual suggestions for improvements led to him being kicked off the project.|$|E

[...] "I opened the door and it was like someone sucked the air and the life out of Berea", he said. [...] "He was a major presence for the organization. I'm talking about the aura, and the inner power of the man." [...] John Collins was named as his replacement. Several other front-office executives also stepped down, including chief contract negotiator Lal Heneghan and lead spokesman Todd Stewart.|$|E

Nevertheless, Willoughby downplayed the evidence about Chinese intervention in the war. He estimated that up to 71,000 Chinese soldiers were in the country, while the true number was closer to 300,000. He {{was not alone in}} this miscalculation. On 24 November, the Central Intelligence Agency reported to Truman that while there could be as many as 200,000 Chinese troops in Korea, [...] "there {{is no evidence that the}} Chinese Communists plan major offensive operations." ...|$|E

Chris was also worried that he had developed epilepsy like Andrew did, but doctors informed him that the seizure was a temporary symptom of his brain injury. Chris was kept in hospital overnight, which meant his romantic plans with his partner Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt) were put on hold. However, Nate turned up at the hospital and Mason said, [...] "The two of them just cuddle, and for the first time Chris realises this is a serious relationship." [...] Nate then told Chris he loved him for the first time.|$|E
500|$|Industry {{was slow}} to take hold, and by {{the second half of}} the 18th century, Cogglesford Mill was the only working corn mill in the town. An old mill at the {{junction}} of Westgate and Castle Causeway supplied hemp to the growing rope-making business of the Foster and Hill families. As local historian Simon Pawley wrote, [...] "in many respects, <b>things</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> little [...] since the survey of 1692", with few of the buildings or infrastructure being improved. Major changes to agriculture and industry took place in the last decade of that century. From the Middle Ages, Sleaford was surrounded by three open fields: North, West and Sleaford Fields. At the enclosure of the open fields in 1794 more than 90% of the 1,096acres of open land was owned by Lord Bristol. Despite the costs of fencing and re-organising the fields, the system was easier to farm, and cottages were built closer to fields, while the landowner could charge more rent owing to the increased profitability of the land; those who lost out were the cottagers, who could no longer keep a few animals grazing on the common land at no cost. The process allowed the land boundaries and pathways to be tidied up; Drove Lane, which ran to Rauceby, was shifted north and straightened.|$|E

2500|$|NASCAR {{was founded}} by William France, Sr., on February 21, 1948 {{with the help of}} several other drivers of the time. The points system was written on a bar room napkin. The {{original}} plans for NASCAR included three distinct divisions: Modified, Roadster, and Strictly Stock. The Modified and Roadster classes were seen as more attractive to fans. It turned out that NASCAR fans {{wanted nothing to do with}} the roadsters, which fans perceived as a Northeast or Midwest series. The roadster division was quickly abandoned, while the modified division now operates as the Whelen Modified Tour. The Strictly Stock division was put on hold as American automobile manufacturers were unable to produce family sedans quickly enough to keep up with post-World War II demand. The 1948 schedule featured 52 Modified dirt track races. The sanctioning body hosted its first event at Daytona Beach on February 15, 1948. Red Byron beat Marshall Teague in the Modified division race. Byron won the 1948 national championship. <b>Things</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> dramatically by 1949, and the Strictly Stock division was able to debut with a [...] exhibition in February near Miami.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 April 1937 when Orwell and his ILP comrades had {{returned}} to Barcelona on their leave they had been shocked to see how <b>things</b> <b>had</b> <b>changed.</b> The revolutionary atmosphere of four months earlier had all but evaporated, and old class divisions been reasserted. Similarly, as {{he headed for the}} French border on the train to Port Bou, Orwell noticed another symptom of the change since his arrival—the train on which classes had been abolished now had both first-class compartments and a dining car. Bowker reports that [...] "Orwell mused that coming into Spain the previous year, bourgeois-looking people would be turned back at the border by Anarchist guards; now looking bourgeois gave one easy passage." [...] A simple hostility to Stalinist Communism became a [...] "deep-dyed loathing of it." [...] Animal Farm, [...] "his scintillating 1944 satire on Stalinism" [...] would be part of his response to the Spanish betrayal. [...] "He had learned a hard lesson, especially about the new political Europe. Totalitarianism, the new creed of 'the streamlined men' of Fascism and Communism, was a new manifestation of Orwell's old Catholic enemy, the doctrine of Absolutism ... the ghost of Torquemada had arisen, imprisonment without trial, confessions extracted under torture with summary executions to follow." [...] "The essential fact about a totalitarian regime is that it has no laws. People are not punished for specific offences, but because they are considered to be politically or intellectually undesirable. What they have done or not done is irrelevant." ...|$|E
