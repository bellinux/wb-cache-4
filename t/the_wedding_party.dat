5|$|On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from Bhopal to Mumbai {{was held}} up by {{a large group of}} {{passengers}} headed for a marriage in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that <b>the</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>party</b> was politically connected and attempted to coerce the cabin crew to disembark passengers, so that additional members of their party could be accommodated.

5|$|Double Negative's {{work for}} Part 1 {{included}} the corroding Warner Brothers logo and extensive environment {{extensions of the}} Burrows and its surrounds. Additional environment work was completed on Xenophilius Lovegood's home, extending it in 3D and culminating in the Death Eaters' attack.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1450s, the {{relationship}} between the Percy family and the Earl of SalisburyRalph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland's son by his second wife Joan Beaufortstarted to deteriorate. What triggered the conflict was the marriage between Salisbury's son Thomas and Maud Stanhope, niece and heiress of Lord Cromwell. By this marriage Wressle Castle, which had traditionally been in the possession of the Percy family, would pass to the Nevilles. At the same time, the Neville-Cromwell wedding had led Huntingdon (now Duke of Exeter) to join the cause of the Percys, because of a territorial dispute with Cromwell. Northumberland himself, who was nearing sixty, did not take action at the time, but one of his younger sons did. Thomas Percy had been created Baron Egremont in 1449, relating to his possessions in the Neville-dominated county of Cumberland. On 24 August 1453, Thomas attacked the Neville-Cromwell wedding party at Heworth near York with a force of over 700 men. No one was killed in the skirmish, and <b>the</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>party</b> escaped intact.|$|E
5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a jackhammer which drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or Powell said. When the registrar asked for the groom to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers <b>the</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>party</b> celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E

5|$|Marco knew four languages, and {{the family}} had {{accumulated}} {{a great deal of}} knowledge and experience that was useful to Kublai. It is possible that he became a government official; he wrote about many imperial visits to China's southern and eastern provinces, the far south and Burma. They were highly respected and sought after in the Mongolian court, and so Kublai Khan decided to decline the Polos' requests to leave China. They became worried about returning home safely, believing that if Kublai died, his enemies might turn against them because of their close involvement with the ruler. In 1292, Kublai's great-nephew, then ruler of Persia, sent representatives to China in search of a potential wife, and they asked the Polos to accompany them, so they were permitted to return to Persia with the wedding party—which left that same year from Zaitun in southern China on a fleet of 14 junks. The party sailed to the port of Singapore, travelled north to Sumatra, and sailed west to the Point Pedro port of Jaffna under Savakanmaindan and to Pandyan of Tamilakkam. Eventually Polo crossed the Arabian Sea to Hormuz. The two-year voyage was a perilous one—of the six hundred people (not including the crew) in the convoy only eighteen had survived (including all three Polos). The Polos left <b>the</b> <b>wedding</b> <b>party</b> after reaching Hormuz and travelled overland to the port of Trebizond on the Black Sea, the present day Trabzon.|$|E

25|$|Frock coats {{worn with}} {{waistcoat}} and formal striped trousers {{are still very}} occasionally worn as daytime formal wear, especially to weddings, {{as an alternative to}} morning coats, in order to give the wedding attire a Victorian flavour.
