This research quantifies the relationship between terrorism and tourism in 95 different countries and territories using international tourism demand models. After controlling for income, we find there is no long run effect of terrorism on international tourism demand and the short run effect is quite limited from a global perspective using panel data models. Only nine countries out of the 95 show a long run impact of terrorism on tourism and 25 countries out of the 95 show a short run impact using time series models, implying that international tourism is resilient to terrorism.

The group of cultural indicators includes indicators such as the ratio of accommodation capacities to the number of population, and <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> and they show the level of preservation of local population identity. The statistical data from the last four census year were used in the analysis of cultural indicators of tourism sustainability in spa settlements in Serbia. The ratio of accommodation capacities to the number of local population can be defined as favourable in most spas (green zone), since there is no intensive tourist construction (apart from illegal construction), while the <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> based on the example of Serbian spa settlements points at very unfavourable situation, since in all four census years the recorded, the results are in the red zone, i. e. on the one hand, there is a relatively low number of local population and on the other hand, there is a high number of overnight stays.

40|$|Typical {{methods of}} {{stimulating}} intellectual capital (eg. to create KBE) are activities {{conducive to the}} development of business environment supporting the development of sectors based on high and medium-high technology. Th e article examines an alternative method of stimulating intellectual capital - increasing tourist attractiveness of a region. In the case of not traditionally touristic regions, the improvement of tourist attractiveness requires innovative action – eg. conversion of a mine into a concert hall or a spa. Such activities are refl ected in the statistics as an increase in the knowledge-intensive services (KIS) in the regional service structure. Th e main goal of the paper is to fi nd whether two development policies – based on stimulating innovativeness or based on enhancing <b>tourism</b> function <b>intensity</b> are complimentary or substitutes. We found a statistically signifi cant correlation between the stage of tourism development and the share of knowledge-intensive services in total services in 2009 in Polish counties. Th e highest percentage of counties with the highest share of KIS relates to counties with low level of intensity but strong growth of tourist function.

40|$|Chengdu, {{the capital}} city of Sichuan {{province}} in western China is the gateway to Tibet. It is also the major habitat for giant panda and the principal city with the largest total tourism economic output in western China. The energy requirement of tourism industry is calculated by combining the 7 energy intensities with tourist consumption data from the Chengdu Domestic Tourist Expenditure Survey in which over 50, 000 tourists were involved during 1999 - 2004. The carbon dioxide emissions of tourism industry are calculated based on the method introduced by IPCC report. Then, decomposition analysis was used to identify key factors causing the change of carbon emission. From 1999 to 2004, the energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission of tourism industry in Chengdu increased from 1. 8 Â xÂ  107 Â GJ to 2. 3 Â xÂ  107 Â GJ and from 1. 7 Â xÂ  106 Â tons to 2. 1 Â xÂ  106 Â tons, respectively. The indirect energy requirements and indirect CO 2 emissions dominate the total energy consumptions and total CO 2 emissions, with an overwhelming percentage of over 90 %. The transportation is the major contributor for energy consumption and carbon emission of tourism industry. The relative importance of the transportation and shopping tends to increase while the food and entertainment tends to decrease. Among the five factors affecting energy consumption and carbon dioxide emission in <b>tourism,</b> energy <b>intensity,</b> expenditure size and the industry size are generally found to be principal drivers of emission growth, whereas energy share and consumption structure are not found to have a sizable influence on the growth of tourism industry emissions. In addition, the energy intensity has a negative effect on the increase of CO 2 levels while the expenditure size and the industry size {{have a positive effect on}} it.

40|$|According to {{academic}} critics, {{the benefits of}} Caribbean tourism are severely vitiated by the socioeconomic dysfunctions associated with the tourism demonstration effect-the rapid local assimilation of expensive North American consumption patterns stimulated {{by the presence of}} relatively large numbers of tourists. This notion, however, lacks empirical validation. This study examines the simple relationship between <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> and local spending patterns using a small cross-section of nine countries. The findings indicate that tourism may influence host consumption behavior, but that tourism’s impact is considerably weaker than and not easily distinguished from the more encompassing influences associated with societal modernization. The repeated claims of tourism’s alleged demonstration effects must be viewed with caution and a research agenda, suggested here, would more carefully measure demonstration and help disentangle tourism’s impact from nontourist influences...|$|E

Data come from the six waves of the European Social Survey, conducted in 32 countries in 2002 - 2013. The results suggest that tourist arrivals reduce residents' life satisfaction. This negative relationship tends to be more pronounced in countries where <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> is relatively high, as well as among people living in rural areas.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to apply an econometric shift-share model to tourism. The {{approach}} allows us to isolate the growth contributions of changes in regional touristic attractiveness from those induced by the structure of visitors, but does not share the caveats of the conventional shift-share approach. Our application to regional tourism in Austria reveals important results: First, differences in long-run performance between regions are mostly related to idiosyncratic changes in the tourist appeal of individual regions rather than a result of more or less favorable structures of visitors. Second, none of several mega-events during the period observed seem to have left prolonged positive effects on the tourist performance of the host regions. And third, performance appears uncorrelated with <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> of a region. Thus, from a policy and destination management perspective, tourism authorities and local suppliers should mainly focus on upgrading the permanent destination attractiveness rather than investing too much effort into landing megaevents or targeting the visitor mix towards promising source markets...|$|E
40|$|Tourism is an {{important}} economic sector for many developing countries (Mitchell & Ashley, 2010). This {{is especially true for}} Small Island Developing States (SIDS) with limited alternative development options. Although ‘pro-poor tourism’ (PPT) has been widely supported by practitioners across the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), international and bi-lateral aid agencies, governments, and non-governmental organizations, the research community has been debating on the effects of tourism on development (Sharpley & Telfer, 2002) and poverty alleviation (Mitchell & Ashley, 2010) for years. While the PPT approach has received many criticisms (Harrison, 2008) due to the deficiency in systematic analysis of the relationship between tourism and poverty reduction and empirical evidence on how tourism contributes to alleviating poverty, some researchers have been making efforts in collecting empirical evidence on this issue (Mitchell & Ashley, 2010). This note presents some evidence that tourism enhances human development and reduces poverty in SIDS by analyzing the correlations between <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> and several human development indicators. ...|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{and local}} {{planners}} are increasingly interested in tourism contribution to {{economic and social}} development. To this regard, several European cities lead the world rankings on tourist arrivals, and their governments have promoted tourism activity. Mobility is an essential service for tourists visiting large cities, since it is a crucial factor for their comfort. In addition, it facilitates the spread of benefits across the city. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine whether city planners respond to this additional urban transport demand pressure by extending supply services. We use an international database of European cities. Our results confirm that <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> is a demand enhancing factor on urban transport. Contrarily, cities do not seem to address this pressure by increasing service supply. This suggests that tourism exerts a positive externality on public transport since it provides additional funding for these services, but it imposes as well external costs on resident users because of congestion given supply constraints.

40|$|As {{the leading}} {{industry}} in most Pacific Island Countries (PICs), tourism {{plays an important}} role in the achievement of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for Pacific people. Heavily dependent on climate and the environment, tourism is very vulnerable to risks and impacts rising from climate change. This vulnerability of tourism is worse for those remote and small island countries in the Pacific. The already occurring climate changes are hindering MDGs in the region by having negative impacts on tourism. Therefore, Pacific tourism needs to take adaptation measures to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to climate change impacts. This paper discusses the interactions between tourism, the MDGs and climate change in South Pacific. Comparison of <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> to indicators of standard of living for Small Island developing states show that tourism is a powerful agent of poverty alleviation. As a highly climate sensitive economic sector in a highly climate vulnerable region, Pacific tourism needs to adapt immediately to climate change impacts to build and increase resilience to fight against it. Therefore, more efforts are needed to fill in the knowledge gap of tourism adaptation to climate change from various disciplines and perspectives...|$|E
40|$|The first aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the main tendencies in {{employment}} and regional labour productivity in the Spanish hospitality sector in the period 1987 - 2004. A second purpose is to analyse the main determinants of sectoral labour productivity. The estimation of an augmented production function is used to this end. This function includes, in addition to the main determinants of labour productivity, some variables linked with the evolution of technical progress in the sector, such as: the mean degree of <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity,</b> average size of establishments, number of hotels and its distribution by category. Besides this, in the empirical model are included a set of variables related to productive capacity utilisation, such as: average length of stay, number of overnight stays per regional bed capacity, and an indicator of regional demand seasonality. This study might allow assessing to what extent the surge of new hotels from 1995 contributed to explain the tendencies in aggregate productivity growth. Moreover, this paper would be useful to determine the main determinants of labour productivity as well as to design policy measures to increase productivity in the sector. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{short-term}} {{effects of}} tourist boats on the behaviour of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins Tursiops aduncus were investigated off the south coast of Zanzibar, Tanzania, by comparing dolphin group behaviour {{in the presence}} (impact) and absence (control) of tourist boats. Groupfollows were conducted from a carefully maneuvered (non-invasive) independent research vessel and behavioural data on group activity were collected using scan sampling methods. By using a timediscrete Markov chain model, the transition probabilities of passing/changing from one behavioural state to another were calculated and compared between impact and control situations. The data were further used to construct behavioural budgets. In the presence of tourist boats, dolphins {{were less likely to}} stay in a resting or socialising activity but were more likely to start travelling or foraging, as inferred from the Markov chain model. The behavioral budgets showed that foraging, resting and socialising all decreased as an effect of tourist boat presence, while travelling increased. The behavioural responses are likely to have energetic implications, mainly by increasing physical demands. Further, the results demonstrate that the current level of <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> off the south coast of Zanzibar affects the dolphins' cumulative behavioural budget. Regulations on dolphin tourism are therefore urgently needed to minimise potential long-term negative effects on the dolphins...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the growth}} of nature-based tourism worldwide, {{behavioural}} studies are needed {{to assess the impact of}} this industry on wildlife populations and understand their short-term effect. Tourism impact on dolphin populations remain poorly documented in developing countries. This study investigates the effects of nature-based tourism on the behaviour of the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) in southern Kenya. We used Markov chain models to estimate transition probabilities between behavioural states in the presence and absence of tourist boats, and assess the overall behavioural budgets. Based on these data and the <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> in the area, we quantified the potential tourist boat disturbance over the period 2006 - 2013. Our results demonstrated that tourist boat interactions affected dolphins' behavioural budgets, with a significant decrease in the overall amount of time travelling and an increase in diving. The average duration of travelling and resting decreased significantly in the presence of boats. Although the cumulative tourism exposure was not significant for the dolphin population at their current levels, these impacts should be taken into consideration with the potential tourism growth in the area. This is particularly important if tourism reaches periods of high intensity, as we have shown that these periods could have a significant impact for the species, particularly where home-range and core areas are highly overlap by this activity. Understanding the effect of human disturbance variations from previous years may help to predict the consequences on dolphin populations, towards achieving a more ecological and economic sustainability of the activity...|$|E
40|$|Since {{world war}} two, tourism {{has evolved into}} a major {{industry}} within the Caribbean region. This development has not occurred evenly in space, and significant discrepancies in intensity exist among and within the islands. The evolution of the tourism industry on the islands of Tobago may be divided into a number of stages, including pre-touristic, early development and developmental. These constructs, based on tourist arrival and accommodation data, resemble the earlier phases of the product diffusion ‘S’-curve. Each stage {{is the product of a}} set of geographical, technological, political, cultural and economic constraints, both internal and external. As these change, the spatial aspects of tourism are also modified. Currently, <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> within Tobago ranges from pre-tourism construct over most of the island to a north-west coastal area. The Scarborough region in contrast suggests a decline phase. Particular stages of tourism development may be associated with certain positive and negative economic, social and environmental impacts. These impacts vary as the geographic setting changes from place to place. In the case of Tobago, a high level of domestic tourism and local control suggests a more positive social and economic impact. However, environmental and aesthetic concerns may arise as current growth rates and patterns into account national developmental priorities and the carrying capacities of specific areas within the island for particular tourist-related land uses. Future growth should be directed for the most part to the Crown Point-Arnos Vale area, Scarborough, and the new Charlotteville-Speyside region. The periphery would be utilised by the tourism industry for such limited activities as hiking and touring. This strategy would contribute to a diversification of touristic opportunities as well as to a limited dispersion of the industry outside of the Crown Point-Arnos Vale area...|$|E
40|$|Tourism and its impacts are {{characterized}} by spatial variation. Recognizing this, governments have actively tried to influence the location of tourism development {{in an attempt to}} capture perceived benefits associated with tourism. One of the most direct approaches used has been the provision of financial assistance to investors in areas targeted for regional development. Unfortunately, the theoretical understanding of the spatial process associated with tourism development has not kept pace with the practice of intervention into this development process. The intent of this thesis is, therefore, to provide insights into the process of the spatial development of tourism in Ontario with particular attention given to the role of financial assistance.;The first phase of the study examined spatial patterns of development in Ontario from 1974 to 1988. Commercial accommodation capacity in the form of bed space equivalents along with Defert 2 ̆ 7 s measure of <b>tourism</b> <b>intensity</b> were described at the county, tourism region and planning region level. The analysis of these data also explored the spatial variation in the rate of change associated with each measure. Metropolitan Toronto was found to be characterized by exceptional increases in accommodation capacity and intensity while the Muskoka area and Southwestern Ontario were characterized by a decline in tourism intensity.;Factors contributing to this pattern of tourism development were identified in {{the second phase of the}} study which involved a review of regionally specific literature along with a telephone survey of tourism professionals located throughout the province. Findings from these two sources were compared and classified as being either exogenous or endogenous relative to Ontario 2 ̆ 7 s tourism sector. Economic and demographic trends were recognized as being the most influential exogenous factors while marketing and financial assistance programs were generally identified as the most important endogenous factors.;Finally, multiple and bivariate regression analyses were used to empirically test the influence of financial assistance aggregated at a county level on the distribution of accommodation capacity in Ontario during the study period. Financial assistance was not shown to have a statistically significant impact on the change in tourism development under either the multiple or bivariate analyses with the exception of assistance provided between 1980 and 1982 relative to the change in accommodation from 1986 to 1988.;In the concluding chapter, a revised spatial model of tourism development is proposed which incorporates landscape attributes, exogenous factors and endogenous factors. Although it was originally hypothesized that financial assistance programs would act as an endogenous factor, the study results indicate otherwise. While financial assistance may be effective at different scales or when using different evaluative measures, the results of this study suggest that it has not been effective in altering the spatial distribution of accommodation at the county level in Ontario...|$|E
