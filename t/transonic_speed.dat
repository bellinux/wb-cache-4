25|$|A {{supercritical}} airfoil is an airfoil designed, primarily, {{to delay the}} onset of wave drag on aircraft in the <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> range. Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly cambered aft section, and greater leading edge radius as compared to traditional airfoil shapes.

50|$|With {{the help}} of Doppler radar {{measurements}} projectile specific drag models can be established that are most useful when shooting at extended ranges where the bullet speed slows to the <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> region near the speed of sound. This is where the projectile drag predicted by mathematic modeling can significantly depart from the actual drag experienced by the projectile. Further Doppler radar measurements are used to study subtle in-flight effects of various bullet constructions.|$|E
50|$|As speeds {{approach}} {{the speed of}} sound, the additional phenomenon of wave drag appears. This is a powerful form of drag that begins at transonic speeds (around Mach 0.88). Around Mach 1, the peak coefficient of drag is four times that of subsonic drag. Above the transonic range, the coefficient drops dramatically again, although remains 20% higher by Mach 2.5 than at subsonic speeds. Supersonic aircraft must have considerably more power than subsonic aircraft require to overcome this wave drag, and although cruising performance above <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> is more efficient, it is still less efficient than flying subsonically.|$|E

40|$|A {{report is}} {{presented}} {{of a series}} of experiments aimed at an investigation of the fundamental mechanisms of the flow behind an isolated blunt-trailing-edge section, and a rearward-facing step, at subsonic and <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds.</b> Pressure measurements and flow photography formed the principal research tools, but in connection with the tests on the isolated section an extensive wake exploration and a study of the vortex-shedding process were carried out. Tests were also made of simple devices which interfere with the formation of the vortex street. These tests are useful both from a basic research aspect and insofar as they indicate possible methods of reducing base drag. A careful study is made of the events which are associated with the transition, at <b>transonic</b> <b>speeds,</b> from the subsonic vortex-street r 6 gime to the supersonic steady-flow r 6 gime.

50|$|As {{the dawn}} of the jet age arrived, Sweden foresaw {{that there would be a}} need for a jet fighter that could {{intercept}} bombers at high altitude and also successfully engage fighters. During September 1949, the Royal Swedish Air Force (RSAF), via the Swedish Defence Material Administration, released its recently formulated requirement for a cutting-edge interceptor aircraft that was envisioned to be capable of attacking hostile bomber aircraft in the <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> range. As released, this requirement specified a top speed of Mach speed 1.4 to 1.5; however, during 1956, the specified speed was revised upwards to Mach l.7-1.8.|$|E
50|$|A propeller's {{performance}} suffers as {{the blade}} speed nears the transonic. As the relative air speed at any {{section of a}} propeller is a vector sum of the aircraft speed and the tangential speed due to rotation, a propeller blade tip will reach <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> well before the aircraft does. When the airflow over {{the tip of the}} blade reaches its critical speed, drag and torque resistance increase rapidly and shock waves form creating a sharp increase in noise. Aircraft with conventional propellers, therefore, do not usually fly faster than Mach 0.6. There have been propeller aircraft which attained up to the Mach 0.8 range, but the low propeller efficiency at this speed makes such applications rare.|$|E
50|$|A {{supercritical}} airfoil is an airfoil designed, primarily, {{to delay the}} onset of wave drag in the <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> range. Supercritical airfoils are characterized by their flattened upper surface, highly cambered (curved) aft section, and larger leading edge radius compared with NACA 6-series laminar airfoil shapes. Standard wing shapes are designed to create lower pressure {{over the top of}} the wing. The camber of the wing determines how much the air accelerates around the wing. As the speed of the aircraft approaches the speed of sound the air accelerating around the wing will reach Mach 1 and shockwaves will begin to form. The formation of these shockwaves causes wave drag. Supercritical airfoils are designed to minimize this effect by flattening the upper surface of the wing.|$|E

50|$|In {{transonic}} flight (Mach numbers greater than about 0.8 {{and less than}} about 1.4), wave drag {{is the result of}} the formation of shockwaves in the fluid, formed when local areas of supersonic (Mach number greater than 1.0) flow are created. In practice, supersonic flow occurs on bodies traveling well below the speed of sound, as the local speed of air increases as it accelerates over the body to speeds above Mach 1.0. However, full supersonic flow over the vehicle will not develop until well past Mach 1.0. Aircraft flying at <b>transonic</b> <b>speed</b> often incur wave drag through the normal course of operation. In {{transonic flight}}, wave drag is commonly referred to as transonic compressibility drag. Transonic compressibility drag increases significantly as the speed of flight increases towards Mach 1.0, dominating other forms of drag at those speeds.|$|E

5000|$|Spring-piston {{guns are}} able to achieve muzzle {{velocities}} near or greater {{than the speed of}} sound with a single stroke of the cocking lever. The effort required for the cocking stroke is usually related to the designed power of the gun, with higher muzzle velocities requiring greater cocking effort. Spring-piston guns have a practical upper limit of 1250 ft/s for [...]177 cal (4.5 mm) pellets. Higher velocities cause unstable pellet flight and loss of accuracy. This is due to the extreme buffeting caused when the pellet reaches and surpasses <b>transonic</b> <b>speed,</b> then slows back down and goes through sound barrier again, which is more than enough to destabilize the pellet's flight. Shortly after leaving the barrel, the supersonic pellet falls back below the speed of sound and the shock wave overtakes the pellet, causing its flight to be disrupted. Drag increases rapidly as pellets are pushed past the speed of sound, so it is generally better to increase pellet weight to keep velocities subsonic in high-powered guns. Sonic crack from the pellet as it moves with supersonic speed also makes the shot louder sometimes making it possible to be mistaken for firearm discharge. Many shooters have found that velocities in the 800 - 900 ft/s range offer an ideal balance between power and pellet stability.|$|E
