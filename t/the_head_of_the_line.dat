Czolgosz, since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland, had decided to do something he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief, and, when he reached <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As a result of their having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn. Hannover and the other five ships of the squadron therefore were located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the combat}} raged at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> the {{remainder}} of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10:35, the two ships locked together {{to the south of}} the main engagement. As they passed, Canopus, Donegal and Atlas all raked the French ship, bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state. Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial, as Donegal and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave and Jupiter respectively. At 11:00, Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandres crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that had broken out on board. Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action; she formally surrendered ten minutes later.|$|E

5|$|More {{disturbing}} to Lord Howe were {{the actions of}} HMS Russell and HMS Caesar. Russell's captain John Willett Payne was criticised at the time for failing to get {{to grips with the}} enemy more closely and allowing her opponent Téméraire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start to the action. There were no such excuses, however, for Captain Anthony Molloy of Caesar, who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe's signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly. Caesar did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading French ship Trajan but her fire had little effect, while Trajan inflicted much damage to Caesar's rigging and was subsequently able to attack Bellerophon as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once Jellicoe's ships had rendezvoused {{with the}} 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from Cromarty, Scotland, {{on the morning}} of 31 May, he {{organised}} {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet in parallel columns of divisions of four dreadnoughts each. The two divisions of the 2nd Battle Squadron were on his left (east), the 4th Battle Squadron was in the centre and the 1st Battle Squadron on the right. When Jellicoe ordered the Grand Fleet to deploy to the left and form line astern in anticipation of encountering the High Seas Fleet, this naturally placed the 2nd Battle Squadron at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of battle. The sisters were able to fire a few volleys at the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group without effect early in the battle, but the manoeuvers of their escorting light cruisers frequently blocked their views of the German ships. Coupled with the visibility problems from the smoke and mist, none of the King George Vs were able to fire more than 19 rounds from their main guns.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch central {{division}} {{joined the}} battle at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{shortly after the}} engagement of Triumph and Bedford, causing considerable damage {{to all of the}} British vessels, particularly Venerable. The British flagship was soon isolated {{in the midst of the}} Dutch van, engaging Vrijheid, Staaten General, Admiral Tjerk Hiddes De Vries and Wassenaar simultaneously. Despite the heavy odds Duncan continued to fight hard, the British succeeded in knocking out two opponents by wounding Captain Dooitze Eelkes Hinxt of Beschermer, which drifted eastwards in confusion, while shots from either Bedford or Triumph set a powder barrel on Hercules on fire. The blaze on the latter ship, which soon spread to the sails and rigging, prompted a lull in the battle as the crew of Hercules desperately attempted to extinguish the blaze and other Dutch ships scrambled to escape the burning vessel as it drifted through the melee. Shortly afterwards, the battered Wassenaar surrendered to Triumph, with Captain Holland dead on his quarterdeck. Triumph then moved on towards the battle between Vrijheid and Venerable, at which time the crew of Wassenaar raised their colours again after being fired on by a Dutch brig.|$|E

5|$|Duckworth's {{squadron}} was principally {{formed from}} his original Cádiz squadron, except for HMS Powerful {{which had been}} sent to the Indian Ocean in December 1805, and with the addition of two ships from the West Indies squadron under Cochrane, HMS Northumberland and HMS Atlas. Frigates and smaller craft joined the fleet as it sailed north through the Leeward Islands, but none were engaged during the battle itself except to act as tows for the more seriously damaged ships of the line. As he approached the French line, Duckworth separated his force into two divisions: a western force to windward under Duckworth himself and a slower eastern force led by Duckworth's second in command Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis. During the engagement the divisions became separated and as a result Duckworth's division fought the strongest French forces at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Louis was initially engaged with the French rear, but later assisted his commander against the huge Impérial during the final stages of the battle. British casualties were recorded in detail in Duckworth's , based on the returns of each ship, although they were not evenly distributed: HMS Agamemnon arrived late in the battle and suffered minimal losses, while Northumberland was heavily engaged with the French flagship and suffered correspondingly severe casualties.|$|E

500|$|Admiral Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. [...] Having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn, and fell to the disengaged side of the German line. Admiral Mauve considered moving his ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> But by the time the II Squadron reached its position at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> Scheer had ordered another Gefechtskehrtwendung, which placed them at the rear of the German fleet. By 21:00, Scheer had turned the fleet around a third time, but the slow speed of Schleswig-Holstein and her squadron mates caused them to fall out of position, to the disengaged side of the fleet.|$|E
500|$|In May 1916, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, {{the fleet}} commander, planned to lure {{a portion of}} the British fleet away from its bases and destroy it with the entire High Seas Fleet. For the planned operation, Regensburg, {{commanded}} by Commodore Paul Heinrich, was assigned to serve {{as the leader of the}} torpedo boat flotillas that screened for the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group. The squadron left the Jade roadstead at 02:00 on 31 May, bound for the waters of the Skagerrak. The main body of the fleet followed an hour and a half later. At around 15:30, the cruiser screens of the I Scouting Group and the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron engaged; Regensburg was on the disengaged side of the German formation, but steamed to reach <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of battle. As she was moving into position, the opposing battlecruisers opened fire; Regensburg was some [...] from the German battlecruisers, still on the disengaged side. Her crew noted that the British shells were falling well over their targets, which placed Regensburg in greater danger than the battlecruisers at which the British were aiming. By 17:10, Regensburg had reached <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> and the battlecruiser [...] fired several salvos at her, mistaking her for a battlecruiser.|$|E
500|$|Under {{the shroud}} of heavy smoke that {{confused}} the positions and {{identities of the}} ships at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> manoeuvering became hazardous: Atlas fired two broadsides into Impérial as she arrived and then raked the French flagship before her tiller jammed just as Diomède loomed out the smoke. Receiving a heavy broadside from the French ship, Atlas subsequently collided with Canopus as she too appeared immediately ahead, tearing off her bowsprit in the collision. [...] Turning back into the battle, Atlas engaged Diomède at close range {{as the rest of}} the British squadron concentrated their fire on the beleaguered Impérial, with the exception of the damaged Northumberland, which was drifting out of the line.|$|E

500|$|Helgoland and {{her sisters}} first entered direct combat shortly after 18:00.

Nomad, which had been attacked by the [...] ships at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> exploded and sank at 18:30, followed five minutes later by the Nestor, sunk by main and secondary gunfire from Helgoland, Thüringen and several other German battleships. At 19:20, Helgoland and several other battleships began firing on , which, {{along with the other}} s of the 5th Battle squadron, had been pursuing the German battlecruiser force. The shooting stopped quickly though, as the Germans lost sight of their target; Helgoland had fired only about 20 shells from her main guns.|$|E
500|$|While {{the battle}} raged in the bay, the two straggling British ships made strenuous efforts {{to join the}} engagement, {{focusing}} on the flashes of gunfire in the darkness. Warned away from the Aboukir shoals by the grounded Culloden, Captain Benjamin Hallowell in Swiftsure passed the melee at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and aimed his ship at the French centre. Shortly after 20:00, a dismasted hulk was spotted drifting in front of Swiftsure and Hallowell initially ordered his men to fire before rescinding the order, concerned for {{the identity of the}} strange vessel. Hailing the battered ship, Hallowell received the reply [...] "Bellerophon, going out of action disabled." [...] Relieved that he had not accidentally attacked one of his own ships in the darkness, Hallowell pulled up between Orient and Franklin and opened fire on them both. Alexander, the final unengaged British ship, which had followed Swiftsure, pulled up close to Tonnant, which had begun to drift away from the embattled French flagship. Captain Alexander Ball then joined the attack on Orient.|$|E
500|$|With the French army ashore, the French fleet {{anchored}} in Aboukir Bay, [...] northeast of Alexandria. Commander Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers {{believed that he}} had established a formidable defensive position. The British fleet arrived off Egypt on 1 August and discovered Brueys's dispositions, and Nelson ordered an immediate attack. His ships advanced on the French line and split into two divisions as they approached. One cut across <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and passed between the anchored French and the shore, while the other engaged the seaward side of the French fleet. Trapped in a crossfire, the leading French warships were battered into surrender during a fierce three-hour battle, while the centre succeeded in repelling the initial British attack. As British reinforcements arrived, the centre came under renewed assault and, at 22:00, the French flagship Orient exploded. The rear division of the French fleet attempted {{to break out of}} the bay, with Brueys dead and his vanguard and centre defeated, but only two ships of the line and two frigates escaped from a total of 17 ships engaged.|$|E

500|$|It {{was about}} 4:00 pm, over 6 hours {{since the two}} fleets had first sighted each other, when the British—who had the weather gage, and {{therefore}} the initiative—opened their attack. The battle began with [...] opening fire against the Marseillais, its counterpart near <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The action very quickly became general, with the van and center of each line fully engaged. The French, in a practice they were known for, tended to aim at British masts and rigging, {{with the intent of}} crippling their opponent's mobility. The effects of this tactic were apparent in the engagement: [...] and HMS Intrepid, {{at the head of the}} British line, became virtually impossible to manage, and eventually fell out of the line. The rest of Admiral Drake's squadron also suffered heavy damage, but the casualties were not as severe as those taken on the first two ships. The angle of approach of the British line also played a role in the damage they sustained; ships in their van were exposed to raking fire when only their bow guns could be brought to bear on the French.|$|E

500|$|Scheer {{reversed}} {{the course of}} the fleet via a Gefechtskehrtwendung (battle about turn), a maneuver that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously.

Deutschland and the other five ships of the squadron were therefore on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement would interfere with the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Later in the day, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British counterparts. Deutschland and the other so-called [...] "five-minute ships" [...] came to their aid by steaming between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. Poor visibility made the subsequent engagement brief. Deutschland fired only one round from her 28cm guns during this period. Mauve decided it would be inadvisable to continue the fight against the much more powerful battlecruisers, and so ordered an 8-point turn to starboard.|$|E
