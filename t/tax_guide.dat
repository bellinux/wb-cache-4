(p. 42)" [...] This means that according to the law, a homemaker is simply someone living in the taxpayer's home whose income does not significantly contribute to the household, regardless of sex. Later in the document, the [...] "qualified spouse" [...] is referred to as [...] "his or her" [...] (p. 43), further emphasizing that the tax law is not intended to discriminate against housewives in particular.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a system that}} extracts knowledge from technical English texts. Our basic assumption is that in technical texts syntax is a reliable indication of meaning. Consequently, semantic interpretation of the text starts from surface syntax. The linguistic component of the system uses a broad-coverage, domainindependent parser of English, {{as well as a}} user-assisted semantic interpreter that memorizes its experience. The resulting semantic structures are translated into Horn clauses, a representation suitable for Explanation-based Learning (EBL). An EBL engine performs symbollevel learning on representations of both the domain theory and the example provided by the linguistic part of the system. Our approach has been applied to the Canadian Individual Income <b>Tax</b> <b>Guide</b> and examples from it are used in the presentation. 1.

The algorithm is part of a system that analyzes texts in order to acquire knowledge in the presence of as little pre-coded semantic knowledge as possible. On the other hand, we want to make the best use of public-domain information sources such as WordNet. Rather than depend on large amounts of hand-crafted knowledge or statistical data from large corpora, we use syntactic information and information in WordNet and minimize the need for other knowledge sources in the word sense disambiguation process. We propose to guide disambiguation by semantic similarity between words and heuristic rules based on this similarity.

40|$|The paper {{highlights}} {{the impact of}} dividend taxes on the firm’s investment decisions, basedon the analytical framework of the „new” view and „traditional” view of dividend taxation. Using the neoclassical model of investment {{we find that the}} firm will be affected byincreasing the dividend tax rate if it pursues investment financed by issuing shares. Thisimpact is due to increased gross rate of return necessary to achieve the company’sinvestment. Conversely, if we consider the use of undistributed profits as a means offinancing, dividend tax does not predict the impact on investment decisions. In this case,the capital gain taxes are relevant in the investment decisions due the impact on gross rateof return. In the same time, the two types of <b>taxes</b> dimensions <b>guide,</b> also the financingdecision of the company.

40|$|The Constitution {{defines the}} favored legal {{treatment}} {{for small businesses}} without making any explicit exception, including and especially for tax obligations. Nevertheless, all the laws, which have introduced <b>tax</b> benefits <b>guided</b> by this higher provision, have discriminated small companies due to the economic sector of activity. Known as “National Simple” and introduced by the Complementary Law No. 123 / 06, the current legislation did not extend its benefits to small production units {{of a number of}} industries, such as the automotive industry, the passenger transport industry, the energy industry and the industry of manufacture of weapons, beverages and tobacco products. By demonstrating the mistakes of the arguments in favor of such exclusions, the article holds up that none of these provisions meets constitutional standards. Furthermore, based on a critical analysis of the Positive Law, it is shown that the hidden desire behind the exclusions was to keep the economic sectors of high profitability under control of big corporations to the detriment of smaller initiatives...|$|R
