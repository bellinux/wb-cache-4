In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network covers most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines extending into France. Public <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat</b> {{is provided by}} the Mouettes Genevoises, which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman (CGN) which serves more distant destinations such as Nyon, Yvoire, Thonon, Évian, Lausanne and Montreux using both modern diesel vessels and vintage paddle steamers.|$|E
500|$|Even {{though the}} northernmost {{stretch of the}} Main Line Through Upper Norrland had long been planned, {{it was not until}} 1887 and the victory of the Lantmanna Party's {{protectionist}} wing in that year's election that the financial meansfrom increased trade tariff incomeand the political will allowed the completion of the railway through Överluleå, which Boden was sometimes called. The [...] "slumbering resources and the rapid expansion" [...] in Upper Norrland were two reasons to build a railway to the sparsely populated area; another factor that had a big part in the decision to complete the main line was the government's takeover of the Luleå–Gällivare line, which had previously been {{in the hands of an}} English company. The stretch was very lucrative, as it considerably eased the transport of iron ore from the ore fields around Kiruna and Gällivare down to the coast for further <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat.</b> Another English company had in the 1860s tried to construct a combination of a railway and a canalthe English Canalfor the stretch, but went bankrupt before their plans were completed. The company contracted for the new railway line experienced similar economic difficulties and the Swedish state decided to buy the nearly completed line to finish it in 1891.|$|E
2500|$|There are regular ferry {{services}} {{to take people}} from Belgrade's river banks onto the island. In 2008, experimental introduction of public <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat</b> began, one of whose routes is from Blok 44 (Novi Beograd)-Ada Ciganlija. There is also a small electric road vehicle that tours the island called the [...] "tourist train". There is also an impromptu recreational marina on the island's downstream end. There are plans to expand this marina and make it permanent. Boating in the lake, as well as car traffic on land, is strictly forbidden. There is a large parking lot on the Makiš side of the river.|$|E

2500|$|The carrs to {{the north}} {{remained}} flooded, although a number of channels were cut through them by the monks from Meaux Abbey. These ran in an east-west direction and were primarily to aid <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat,</b> rather than for drainage, although their large size tended to have some affect on the land. A move towards a more comprehensive system of control occurred in 1532, {{with the passing of}} the Stature of Sewers. This created Commissioners of Sewers in the main areas of England and Wales which had significant areas of marshland. They had considerable powers, which were exercised through Courts of Sewers. Two such Courts were created in the Hull valley. One was based at Beverley, with separate juries for North, Middle and South Holderness and three other areas, while the second was based at Hull. They were initially only concerned with existing banks and drains, but in 1580 they organised {{the construction of a new}} drain to link Monkdike to Forthdike, providing a more southerly outlet for the water, where the level of the Hull was lower at low tide. An extensive survey of all the drains and banks was made between 1660 and 1662, with the details recorded in a book of pains, now held by the East Riding Record Office. Pains was the term used for records of the size of such structures, the intervals at which they had to be repaired or scoured, and the penalties for failing to carry out the repairs.|$|E
60|$|The Duc d'Enghien {{declared}} {{for this}} plan. Turenne went {{at once to}} Breisach, and arranged for the <b>transport,</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat</b> down the Rhine, of all the necessaries for the siege of Philippsburg. The army started on the 16th of August, a part of Turenne's army being detached to capture small towns and castles. On the 23rd of August Philippsburg was invested by Turenne, Enghien's force arriving on the following day. Philippsburg stood on the Rhine, which at this point formed a sharp elbow, and the land being low, many morasses surrounded the town, and the approach therefore was exceedingly difficult. Eight hundred paces from the town stood a square fort, which commanded the river, and was connected with the town by a causeway. The town itself had seven bastions, round these ran a very thick hedge, and the moat was wide and full of water. The garrison was a weak one, not exceeding a thousand men, {{but they had a}} hundred pieces of cannon and a large store of ammunition.|$|E

50|$|From {{the seventeenth}} century, coal had been {{extracted}} {{in the area}} north of the River Tyne, at first close to the river to allow onwards <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat.</b> As the easiest deposits close to the river became worked out, the focus of mining was pushed back further, and transport to the waterway was essential. Wooden waggonways were introduced and were relatively successful, but a major limitation was the issue of wayleaves, by which owners of land on the proposed route could demand payment, usually on a tonnage basis, for allowing {{the passage of the}} wagons. The wayleave demands were heavy, and this continued to be a major difficulty.|$|E

Four village communities exist on the island: Koh Tuich, Doeum D'keuw, Prek Svay and Sok San. In recent years the island has become home to an increasing but still moderate number of foreign-run guesthouses and bungalow resorts.

50|$|Rurrenabaque lies on {{the east}} bank of the Beni River. It is {{expected}} that a bridge will be built over the river {{to connect with the}} town San Buenaventura on the west bank. The coming bridge is a part of a road project that is expected to be carried out in the years following 2008. It will considerably broaden the economic relationship between the two towns, which has been traditionally stunted by limited and expensive <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat.</b> Since the river simultaneously widens and shallows at the San Buenaventura section, the top current becomes much stronger than on many sections of the river. Most boats and motors capable of crossing the stretch of river represent an investment beyond the means of most individual Bolivian families, but a bridge will allow San Buenaventura to enjoy the same accessibility as that enjoyed between Rurrenabaque and the neighboring town of Reyes.|$|E
5000|$|As {{an island}} nation, <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat</b> to the European {{mainland}} (continental Europe) {{was the most}} common form of transport from the UK prior to air travel. The closest route is Dover in England to Calais in France, at 21 miles. The White Cliffs of Dover are at one end of the Kent Downs designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The cliff face goes up to 350 feet and the cliffs stretch for 8 miles of coastline. The National Trust calls the cliffs [...] "an icon of Britain", with [...] "the white chalk face a symbol of home and war time defense." [...] Because crossing at Dover was the primary route to the continent before the advent of air travel, the white line of cliffs also formed the first or last sight of Britain for travellers. In World War II, thousands of allied troops on the little ships in the Dunkirk evacuation saw the welcoming sight of the cliffs.|$|E

50|$|Food {{stocks in}} the cities in the western Netherlands rapidly ran out. The adult rations {{in cities such as}} Amsterdam dropped to below 1000 {{kilocalories}} (4,200 kilojoules) a day by the end of November 1944 and to 580 kilocalories in the west by the end of February 1945. Over this Hongerwinter ("Hunger winter"), a number of factors combined to cause starvation in especially the large cities in the West of the Netherlands. The winter in the month of January 1945 itself was unusually harsh prohibiting <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat</b> for roughly a month between early January 1945 and early February 1945. Also, the German army destroyed docks and bridges to flood the country and impede the Allied advance. Thirdly, Allied bombing made it extremely difficult to transport food in bulk, since Allied bombers could not distinguish German military and civilian shipments. As the south-eastern (the Maas valley) and the south-western part of the Netherlands (Walcheren and Beveland) became one of the main western battlefields, these conditions combined to make the transport of existing food stocks in large enough quantities nearly impossible.|$|E
50|$|In 1641 {{farmers in}} Drachten North and Drachten South entered into an {{agreement}} with financers from the province of Holland, the Drachten Associates. One of these moneylenders was businessman Passchier Hendriks Bolleman from The Hague. The agreement stipulated that the peat in Smallingerland was designated for the Holland industry. For <b>transport</b> <b>by</b> <b>boat</b> the Drachtster Compagnonsvaart canal and two side channels had to be constructed. During one year 800 workers had been digging every day. And where people spent their days, other developments followed, such as dwellings, places for storage, hostels, and businesses. Although the economic success of cutting peat was short-lived (it even led to Passchier Bolleman's financial ruin), {{it led to the}} foundation of Drachten. The Drachtstervaart brought in ships and the ships brought in not only return freight, but also their own service industry: rope-yards, carpenter's yards, and forges. In 1746 the first real shipyard was established on the Langewijk, initially only for the construction of timber flatboats, but after 1895 also for iron hull ships. In 1902 a second shipyard followed on the Drachtstervaart. Even today, skûtsjes from these shipyards take part in the major Frisian sailing event, the skûtsjesilen.|$|E
50|$|By 1550 the Dutch peat reserve {{had been}} exhausted. Peat {{had become an}} {{important}} source of energy, not only for private households but also for the industry. The need in the rapidly growing province of Holland during the 17th century was higher than Friesland could supply. Most of the transport was over water, therefore often by track boat. Peat exploitation meant a welcome activity for many villages, although most of the income did not flow into the pockets of the struggling peat cutters. In 1641 A.D. farmers in Drachten North and Drachten South entered into an agreement with wealthy residents of The Hague, the 'Drachten Associates'. One of these moneylenders was businessman Passchier Hendriks Bolleman from The Hague.The agreement stipulated that peat cut in Smallingerland was designated for the Holland industry.
