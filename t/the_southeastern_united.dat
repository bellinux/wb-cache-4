5|$|On {{the east}} coast of Florida, Klaus {{produced}} 15foot (4.5m) waves and tides of 3feet (1m) above normal. Beach erosion was reported along {{the east coast}}, due to persistent easterly winds. As the remnant moisture of Klaus entered <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, it produced heavy rainfall between 10–15inches (250–380mm) of rainfall in South Carolina, with slightly lower totals in North Carolina. In South Carolina, the rainfall caused a dam to burst, killing four people. About two days after the remnants of Klaus entered <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, Tropical Storm Marco made landfall on northwestern Florida, dropping more heavy rainfall and causing heavy damage across the region.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} tornado outbreak on record was the 2011 Super Outbreak, which spawned 362 confirmed tornadoes over <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States–218 of them {{within a single}} 24-hour period. The previous record was the 1974 Super Outbreak which spawned 148 tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|Between {{at least}} 1981 and 1988, Grapico was {{distributed}} in only three states: Alabama, Florida and Georgia. In August 1988, Buffalo Rock {{announced that they}} would expand distribution of Grapico the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. The announcement coincided with the new, more contemporary Grapico packaging. By June 1990, Grapico was being sold in South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Bonnie's {{impact was}} minimal. Throughout the Caribbean Sea, the storm's effects {{consisted}} primarily of light rainfall, and in Florida, the precipitation caused flooding and minor damage. The tropical storm caused a tornado outbreak across <b>the</b> <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States which killed three people and inflicted over $1million (2004USD) in damage. Bonnie made landfall in Florida {{the day before}} Hurricane Charley struck.|$|E
5|$|Many Phellodon {{species are}} known from <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, {{where they have}} been {{extensively}} researched. According to Baird and colleagues, there are nine distinct Phellodon species from Great Smoky Mountains and the surrounding southern Appalachian Mountains. Three additional species from this area, P.mississippiensis, P.brunneo-olivaceus, and P.fuligineoalbus were added to the genus in 2013–14.|$|E

5|$|Pentastomida is {{an enigmatic}} group of parasites {{that may be}} related to maxillopod crustaceans. One species, Porocephalus crotali, is known from the marsh rice rat. It infects various mammals in <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, which serve as {{intermediate}} hosts; snakes which eat those mammals are the definitive hosts.|$|E
5|$|The Southeastern SF Awards {{recognizing}} {{achievements in}} fantasy, horror and science fiction by authors connected to <b>the</b> <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, were granted from 2002 to 2006 {{by a vote}} of members. Gibson, a native of South Carolina who grew up in Virginia, was recognized in 2004, when Pattern Recognition was shortlisted for the Southeastern SF Achievement Award.|$|E
5|$|This task {{system of}} slavery was common among sea island {{plantations}} in <b>the</b> <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. In contrast, cotton and tobacco plantations in Virginia {{and other parts}} of the South practiced the gang system, where an overseer who was also a slave drove slaves to work the entire day.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Tammy {{was a short}} lived {{tropical}} storm during October in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season which caused minor damage to <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. More significant, however, were its remnants, which contributed to the Northeast U.S. flooding of October 2005.|$|E
5|$|As the {{hurricane}} approached <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm warnings from Vero Beach, Florida to Wilmington, North Carolina. Later, the agency issued a hurricane warning from Fernandina, Florida to Georgetown, South Carolina, prompting the threatened areas to enact storm preparations and for ships {{to return to}} harbor. Near Jacksonville, Florida, the United States Navy sent 17planes to the Naval Air Station Olathe in Olathe, Kansas.|$|E
5|$|As the {{previous}} storm was moving along the coastline of <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, a new hurricane {{was observed in}} the western Caribbean Sea, about halfway between Honduras and Jamaica. Its intensity, based on a ship report, was estimated at 105mph (165km/h). The hurricane moved slowly west-northwestward, and another ship experienced its strong winds on October7. There were no further observations, so its complete track is unknown.|$|E

In 1998, Georgia Tech was the first university in <b>the</b> <b>Southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States to provide its fraternity and sorority houses with internet access. A campus wireless network, the Local Area Wireless/Walkup Network (LAWN), was established in 1999; it now covers most of the campus.|$|E
5|$|Eastern and red wolves {{are also}} {{products}} of {{varying degrees of}} wolf-coyote hybridization. The eastern wolf probably {{was a result of}} a wolf-coyote admixture, combined with extensive backcrossing with parent gray wolf populations. The red wolf may have originated during a time of declining wolf populations in <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, forcing a wolf-coyote hybridization as well as backcrossing with local parent coyote populations to the extent that about 75–80% of the modern red wolf's genome is of coyote derivation.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} on Saint Lucia destroyed about 15% of its yearly banana crop. Damage was heaviest on Martinique, where seven casualties {{occurred and}} 1,500people were left homeless as the heavy rainfall caused severe flooding on the island, resulting in some landslides. The remnant moisture of Klaus entered <b>the</b> <b>southeastern</b> <b>United</b> States, dropping heavy rainfall and causing four casualties; {{the same area}} was affected with more precipitation {{a few days later}} by Tropical Storm Marco. Due to the damage caused by the storm, the name Klaus was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
