500|$|In the episode, Mulder {{prepares to}} submit his {{application}} to be reassigned to X-Files division. Meanwhile, Mulder's boss, Deputy Director Kersh, informs Doggett {{that he intends}} to deny the request. As season eight was nearly over, the producers and writers decided to refuse Mulder re-admittance into the FBI as a way to segue John Doggett and Monica Reyes into the series as the new main stars of season nine. David Duchovny agreed with this method, noting, [...] "I completely thought it was correct that they should be trying to focus elsewhere, and <b>that,</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was going to come back for the second half of season eight, if you were to refocus on whatever Mulder's up to, you'd be in the same lousy situation at the beginning of season nine." ...|$|E
500|$|Seltmann and Chater did not {{initially}} think <b>that</b> <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> Left You would receive much attention. However, the album garnered widespread critical acclaim {{from the music}} industry. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 89, based on 21 reviews. It {{became one of the}} best reviewed albums of 2001, as well as being the highest rated dance album on that site. The album peaked in the top30 on the ARIA Albums Chart and number12 in Norway on the VG-lista Top40 Albums Chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001, the Avalanches won four awards from nine nominations, including Breakthrough Artist – Album, Best Dance Release and Producer of the Year (for Chater and Seltmann aka Bobbydazzler) for Since I Left You. The fourth award win was for the related single, [...] "Frontier Psychiatrist" [...] as Breakthrough Artist – Single.|$|E
2500|$|The Swedish {{photographer}} Lennart Nilsson, {{who became}} world {{famous for his}} documentation of pregnancy from conception to birth, {{was asked by the}} magazine Life to photograph Birgit Nilsson's vocal cords as she sang high C. Birgit Nilsson turned the proposal down with the words [...] "Your photographer wants me to swallow the tiny camera so he can take pictures of the vocal cord [...] I don't want <b>that,</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> know where it has been before." [...] Eventually, though, she agreed on having the pictures taken.|$|E

6000|$|... "Strange," [...] he remarked, [...] "very strange. I haven't smelt <b>that</b> perfume <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{was with}} the {{excavators}} at Chaldea. A real Oriental flavor, young man, about your manuscript." ...|$|R
2500|$|Such was {{the extent}} to which {{stronger}} drugs entered cycling that the French team manager, Marcel Bidot, was cited to an inquiry by the Council of Europe as saying: [...] "Three-quarters of riders were doped. I am well placed to know <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> visited their rooms each evening during the Tour. I always left frightened after these visits." [...] At the 1956 Tour, it was evident how much drug-taking and the [...] "care" [...] of riders had changed. After stage 14, all members of the Belgian team chose to abandon the race following a [...] "mystery illness". Insiders suspected doping usage as the real reason, while the team attributed the illness to a dinner of 'bad fish' they had eaten, an excuse which was reused in both 1962 and 1991.|$|E
2500|$|During the French Enlightenment, {{there was}} a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual {{enticement}} or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child. In Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy's 1771 play The True Mother (La Vraie Mère), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: [...] "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?" [...] Nearly a century later, also in France, {{a man from the}} provinces who attended a Court ball at the Tuileries in Paris in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: [...] "I haven't seen anything like <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was weaned!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{let it be}} so old-fashioned as {{to include}} North Liberty again," [...] she interrupted, wearily. [...] "We've had quite enough of <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> returned." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not as}} bad as that," [...] said Bertram, [...] "but it deprives me of {{my entire}} fortune. But I care not for <b>that,</b> Gladys, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have won you." ...|$|R
50|$|Reyes stated <b>that</b> “Ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{began to}} paint, my work has {{reflected}} all my experiences.” One {{of these is}} music, which shows in his canvas through his brushstrokes and use of color.|$|R
6000|$|... "By sea, I suppose, Macumazahn, but I {{think that}} you will be wise not to try <b>that</b> road, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> believe <b>that</b> on the sea side the marshes are now impassable and you will be safer on your feet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God, how I envy {{him that}} sweet sleep!" [...] said Wildeve. [...] "I have not slept like <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was a boy--years and years ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{bound to}} admit <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{was at home}} last she's a novelty. A girl like that with such people--it IS a new type." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Such magnanimity Is now not needed, sir; for {{you will}} see <b>That</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> am here, a thing like this is, plainly, [...] Best done by me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so ill, Inkosazana, <b>that</b> is <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{reached the}} Great Kraal. But one of them, he who sits yonder," [...] and {{she pointed to}} a certain induna, [...] "struck me on the journey, and took away my food." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right," [...] said Miss Todd; [...] "quite {{right if}} you like him. Now for me, I'm so fond of my own money and my own independence, that I've never had a fancy <b>that</b> way,--not <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was a girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|Midmore grunted impatiently. 'Everybody {{has talked}} to me about <b>that</b> brook ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> came here. It's never done {{anything}} yet.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr. Smith--ay, that it is!' she said. 'And that's Mr. Knight. I beg {{you to sit}} down. Perhaps {{you know}} <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> saw you last I have married Martin Cannister.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dismission? Ah! {{she was not}} dismissed; I can {{say with}} truth, monsieur, <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> became {{the head of this}} {{establishment}} no master or teacher has ever been dismissed from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am that, Lady, {{and more}} than <b>that,</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> am a friend of your husband, Saduko, also, as you will know when I tell you that my name is Umbelazi." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou knowest {{not what}} thou hast done," [...] Ayesha said at last. [...] "Let all thou sawest on the Mountain's crest {{or in the}} Sanctuary be but visions of the night; let that tale of an {{offended}} goddess be a parable, a fable, if thou wilt. This at least is true, <b>that</b> ages <b>since</b> <b>I</b> sinned for thee and against thee and another; <b>that</b> ages <b>since</b> <b>I</b> bought beauty and life indefinite wherewith I might win thee and endow thee at a cost which few would dare; that I have paid interest on the debt, in mockery, utter loneliness, and daily pain which scarce could be endured, until the bond fell due at last and must be satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I think it's {{extremely}} fortunate," [...] Kate said stoutly. [...] "If it hadn't {{been that}} he had known us before, and cared for me--he says worshipped, but <b>that's</b> nonsense--ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was a child, {{he would never have}} made that terrible ride, and I--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that's true," [...] Lane admitted, {{a little}} hesitatingly. [...] "I don't quite {{know how things}} are done over here. Say, are you English, or French, or what?" [...] he asked, point blank. [...] "I have been puzzling about <b>that</b> ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> saw you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks, gracious madam: but {{the truth}} is, <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have had the bliss of knowing English ladies, I have begun {{to think that they}} are the only ones on earth worth wooing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. My brother's {{expenses}} {{have been}} higher, as well, and I {{was driven to}} the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> could not afford both, I'd better let the mare go and keep the brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will I do presently," [...] said Wayland; [...] "but {{allow me}} to {{condition}} <b>that,</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> incur all the risk of this treatment, no other physician shall be permitted to interfere with it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Dear,'" [...] thought Mary to herself; [...] "he hasn't {{called me}} <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> was sixteen. I {{wonder why he}} does it now? Because I have been scolding him, I suppose; that {{generally}} makes men affectionate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but I've got out o' <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> took to drink. Lord, that's {{the only}} comfort I've got now! If you engage, you'll be set swede-hacking. That's what I be doing; but you won't like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You poor child!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "You cannot think <b>that</b> <b>since</b> <b>I</b> {{know the}} truth I could leave you here for a single second? We can fetch your clothes any time. To-night you are coming home with me." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{count the}} hours <b>that</b> have passed <b>since</b> <b>I</b> escaped {{to the shelter}} of this room by my own sensations--and those hours seem like weeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me! How portentous! Really, I {{almost feel}} as if I were {{interrupting}} a tete-a-tete between yourself and some old flame.

6000|$|... "Thar hezen't been a slice cut off <b>that</b> bacon <b>since</b> <b>I</b> left," [...] {{continued}} Rand, {{bringing a}} side of bacon and some biscuits from the cupboard, and applying himself to the discussion {{of them at the}} table.
