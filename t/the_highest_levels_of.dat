5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area {{with high levels of}} mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E
5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred with animals genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents.

Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> hybrid vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E

5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E

5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E

5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch.

Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
