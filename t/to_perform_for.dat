As a result, the band was unable <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>for</b> several months. Thordendal's {{fingertip}} was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery. The Selfcaged EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.|$|E

5|$|The mission's planet finding {{component}} {{was set up}} {{to serve}} as an important complement to the future missions designed to image and measure terrestrial and other exoplanets. SIM Lite was to perform an important task that these missions will not be capable of: determining planet masses. Another task that the SIM was envisioned <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>for</b> the future missions will include providing the orbital characteristics of the planets. With this knowledge other missions can estimate the optimal times and projected star–planet separation angles for them to observe the terrestrial (and other) planets SIM has detected.|$|E
5|$|By 1967, Ballard {{would not}} show up for {{recording}} dates, or would arrive at shows too inebriated <b>to</b> <b>perform.</b> <b>For</b> some early 1967 shows, she was replaced by Marlene Barrow. Looking for a more permanent replacement, Gordy once again thought of Barbara Randolph, possibly believing that Randolph could be groomed as lead singer for the group once {{it was decided to}} take Ross solo. However, Ross did not receive Randolph well. In April 1967, Gordy then contacted Cindy Birdsong, a member of Patti LaBelle & the Blue Belles who superficially resembled Ballard, with plans to bring her in as Ballard's replacement. He made his plans clear to Ballard and her group mates at a mid-April meeting, and Birdsong was brought in to begin rehearsals. Gordy did not fire Ballard outright at that time, asking Ballard instead to quit on her own.|$|E

The concert was originally scheduled to commence in April 2006, but was postponed due {{to the arrest of}} Salman Khan.

In 2008, Kapoor performed in Shah Rukh Khan's Temptation Reloaded 2008, a series of concerts in a number of countries. The show (which also featured Arjun Rampal, Katrina Kaif, Ganesh Hegde, Javed Ali and Anusha Dandekar) debuted at the Ahoy Rotterdam venue in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

5|$|Harmonix {{was formed}} in 1995 from a {{computer}} music group at MIT. Beginning in 1998, the company developed music games inspired by PaRappa the Rapper. In 2001, the company released Frequency, which puts the player in control of multiple instrument tracks. Ryan Davis of GameSpot wrote that the game provides {{a greater sense of}} creative freedom than earlier rhythm titles. Frequency was critically acclaimed; however, marketing was made difficult by the game's abstract style, which removed the player's ability <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>for</b> onlookers. In 2003, Harmonix followed up Frequency with the similar Amplitude. The company later released more socially driven, karaoke-themed music games in Karaoke Revolution and SingStar (2003 and 2004, respectively). Donkey Konga, a GameCube title developed by Namco and released in 2003, achieved widespread success by leveraging Nintendo's Donkey Kong brand.|$|E

The band premiered two brand-new songs during {{the length of the}} tour. They played a part of the Warped Tour, but declined <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>for</b> the entirety of the tour in order to take time to record another album. Underoath made their first covers of national magazines appearing on CCM Magazine in July 2005 and then Alternative Press in September, and in October, They're Only Chasing Safety was re-released in a two-disc set with four formerly unreleased songs.

5|$|Still {{planning}} to escape, the player aids Troop Bushido, scouts {{living in a}} samurai museum, and the Fargarths, a group of larpers.

5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} tension between those musicians {{who went into}} exile, and were therefore able <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>for,</b> and raise awareness among, much larger audiences, and anti-apartheid musicians who remained in South Africa. The latter group has received significantly less popular attention, though Vershbow states that it played an equally {{important role in the}} movement, and Schumann argues that it was responsible for putting significant pressure on the apartheid government. The role of music in social change in South African is examined in the documentary film , released in 2002. The film focuses specifically on the 'liberation music' of the struggle against white domination.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>for</b> some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days were coming to an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
5|$|Having {{seen the}} concerto delle donne in Ferrara, Caccini created a rival group {{made up of}} his family and a pupil. This {{ensemble}} was sponsored by the Medici, and traveled as far abroad as Paris <b>to</b> <b>perform</b> <b>for</b> Marie de' Medici. Francesca Caccini had much success composing and singing {{in the style of the}} concerto delle donne. Beginning in 1585, rival groups were created in Florence by the Medici, Rome by the Orsini, and Mantua by the Gonzaga. There was even a rival group in Ferrara based in the Castello Estense, the very palace where the concerto delle donne performed. This group was formed by Alfonso's sister Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino. She had lived at the Este court since 1576, and shortly after Margherita's marriage to Alfonso in 1579, Alfonso and his henchmen killed Lucrezia's lover. Lucrezia was unhappy about being replaced as the matron of the house by Margherita, and upset by the murder of her lover, leading to her desire to be separate from the rest of her family during her evening entertainments.|$|E
