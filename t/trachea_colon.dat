50|$|The major {{constituents}} of mucus, the viscous secretion that covers epithelial surfaces {{such as those}} in the <b>trachea,</b> <b>colon,</b> and cervix, are highly glycosylated proteins called mucins. These glycoproteins play important roles in the protection of the epithelial cells and have been implicated in epithelial renewal and differentiation. This gene encodes an integral membrane glycoprotein found on the cell surface, although secreted isoforms may exist. At least two dozen transcript variants of this gene have been found, although for many of them the full-length transcript has not been determined or they are found only in tumor tissues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background MUC 4 {{is a type}} of {{membrane}} anchored glycoprotein {{and serves}} as the major constituent of mucus that covers epithelial surfaces of many tissues such as <b>trachea,</b> <b>colon</b> and cervix. MUC 4 plays important roles in the lubrication and protection of the surface epithelium, cell proliferation and differentiation, immune response, cell adhesion and cancer development. To gain insights into the evolution of the porcine MUC 4 gene, we surveyed the nucleotide variability and linkage disequilibrium (LD) within this gene in Chinese indigenous breeds and Western commercial breeds. Results A total of 53 SNPs covering the MUC 4 gene were genotyped on 5 wild boars and 307 domestic pigs representing 11 Chinese breeds and 3 Western breeds. The nucleotide variability, haplotype phylogeny and LD extent of MUC 4 were analyzed in these breeds. Both Chinese and Western breeds had considerable nucleotide diversity at the MUC 4 locus. Western pig breeds like Duroc and Large White have comparable nucleotide diversity as many of Chinese breeds, thus artificial selection for lean pork production have not reduced the genetic variability of MUC 4 in Western commercial breeds. Haplotype phylogeny analyses indicated that MUC 4 had evolved divergently in Chinese and Western pigs. The dendrogram of genetic differentiation between breeds generally reflected demographic history and geographical distribution of these breeds. LD patterns were unexpectedly similar between Chinese and Western breeds, in which LD usually extended less than 20 [*]kb. This is different from the presumed high LD extent (more than 100 [*]kb) in Western commercial breeds. The significant positive Tajima’D, and Fu and Li’s D statistics in a few Chinese and Western breeds implied that MUC 4 might undergo balancing selection in domestic breeds. Nevertheless, we cautioned that the significant statistics could be upward biased by SNP ascertainment process. Conclusions Chinese and Western breeds have similar nucleotide diversity but evolve divergently in the MUC 4 region. Western breeds exhibited unusual low LD extent at the MUC 4 locus, reflecting the complexity of nucleotide variability of pig genome. The finding suggests that high density (e. g. 1 SNP/ 10 [*]kb) markers are required to capture the underlying causal variants at such regions. </p...|$|E
40|$|Both {{stimulation}} of purinergic receptors by ATP and {{activation of the}} cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibit amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport and activate Cl-secretion. These changes in ion transport may well affect cell volume. We therefore examined whether cell shrinkage or cell swelling do affect amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport in epithelial tissues or Xenopus oocytes and whether osmotic stress interferes with regulation of Na+ transport by ATP or CFTR. Stimulation of purinergic receptors by ATP/UTP or activation of CFTR by IBMX and forskolin inhibited amiloride-sensitive transport in mouse <b>trachea</b> and <b>colon,</b> respectively, by a mechanism that was Cl- dependent. When exposed to a hypertonic but not hypotonic bath solution, amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport was inhibited in mouse <b>trachea</b> and <b>colon,</b> independent of the extracellular Cl- concentration. Both inhibition of Na+ transport by hypertonic bath solution and ATP were additive. When coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, activation of CFTR by IBMX and forskolin inhibited the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in a Cl(-) dependent fashion. However, both hypertonic and hypotonic bath solutions showed only minor effects on amiloride-sensitive conductance, independent of the bath Cl- concentration. Moreover, CFTR-induced inhibition of ENaC could be detected in chocytes even after exposure to hypertonic or bypotonic bath solutions. We conclude that amiloride-sensitive Na+ absorption in mouse airways and colon is inhibited by cell shrinkage by a mechanism that does not interfere with purinergic and CFTR-mediated inhibition of ENaC...|$|R
50|$|Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 (CCL19) {{is a small}} {{cytokine}} {{belonging to}} the CC chemokine family that {{is also known as}} EBI1 ligand chemokine (ELC) and macrophage inflammatory protein-3-beta (MIP-3-beta). CCL19 is expressed abundantly in thymus and lymph nodes, with moderate levels in <b>trachea</b> and <b>colon</b> and low levels in stomach, small intestine, lung, kidney and spleen. The gene for CCL19 is located on human chromosome 9. This chemokine elicits its effects on its target cells by binding to the chemokine receptor chemokine receptor CCR7. It attracts certain cells of the immune system, including dendritic cells and antigen-engaged B cells, CCR7+ central-memory T-Cells.|$|R

40|$|Sections of kidney, <b>trachea,</b> ileum, <b>colon,</b> rectum and rumen {{were removed}} at post mortem from a {{neonatal}} calf and, {{with the exception}} of the rumen, primary cell lines were established for each of the cell types. The adherence of enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) serotype O 157 :H 7, enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) serotype O 111, E. coli K 12 (a laboratory adapted non-pathogenic strain) and Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium was assayed on each cell type. For all adherence assays on all cell lines, EHEC O 157 :H 7 adhered to a significantly greater extent than the other bacteria. S. Typhimurium and EPEC O 111 adhered to a similar extent to one another, whereas E. coli K 12 was significantly less adherent by 100 -fold. In all cell types, > 10 % of adherent S. Typhimurium bacteria invaded, whereas c. 0. 01 - 0. 1 % of adherent EHEC O 157 :H 7 and EPEC O 111 bacteria invaded, although they are regarded as non-invasive. EHEC O 157 generated actin re-arrangements in all cell types as demonstrated by fluorescent actin staining (FAS) under densely packed bacterial micro-colonies. EPEC O 111 readily generated the localised adherent phenotype on bovine cells but generated only densely packed micro-colonies on HEp- 2 cells. The intensity of actin re-arrangements induced in bovine cells by EPEC O 111 was less than that induced by EHEC O 157 :H 7. The intimate attachment on all cell types by both EHEC O 157 :H 7 and EPEC O 111 was clearly demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the nine}} known {{members of the}} protein kinase C (PKC) family, we found that novel (n-) PKC, a newly {{isolated}} Ca 2 -independent isoform, was expressed {{at the highest level}} in the epidermis of mouse skin and epithelia of the digestive and respiratory tracts including the tongue, esophagus, forestomach, glandular stomach, intestine, <b>colon,</b> <b>trachea,</b> and bronchus. Expression of nPKC mRNA in these epithelial tissues was 3 - 10 times that in the brain and was especially high in squamous epithelium. Two other PKC isoforms, conventional (c-) PKCa and nPKC#{ 246 },were also expressed in these epithelial tissues, but no cPKCy was detected. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated the localization of nPKCsi in suprabasal layers of the skin, tongue, esophagus, and forestomach. In the intestine, it was expressed in the epithelial cells of villi, but not of crypts. In the lung, only bronchial epithelium expressed nPKC. The localization of nPKC in differentiating or differentiated epithelial cells, rather than in proliferating basal cells, suggests the involvement of nPKC in epithelial differentiation...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine a}} {{possible}} role of indoleamines {{in the regulation}} of epithelial sodium absorption, the effect of serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) and several derivatives on electrolyte transport was measured in vitro in the baboon bronchus and in the <b>trachea</b> and <b>colon</b> of sodium-deficient rats. Serotonin, melatonin (N-acetyl- 5 -hydroxytryptamine), and harmaline (1 -methyl- 7 -methoxy- 3, 4 -dihydro-beta-carboline) inhibited sodium transport in all three preparations {{in a similar manner}} to the natriuretic agent amiloride. In all three epithelia, sodium absorption via the amiloride-sensitive pathway constitutes a substantial portion of total electrolyte transport, measured as the amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current. Thus 25 microM amiloride inhibited the short-circuit current 21 % in the rat trachea, 63 % in the baboon bronchus, and 90 % in the rat colon. Serotonin, melatonin, and harmaline inhibited the amiloride-sensitive portion of the short-circuit current from the luminal side of the epithelium. The inhibition was rapid, requiring only seconds, and maximal inhibition by serotonin was identical to that by amiloride. When sodium was omitted from the luminal solution, the short-circuit current was reduced a similar amount, suggesting that sodium absorption was being inhibited by both amiloride and the indoles. The IC 50 value for amiloride was 50 nM in the baboon bronchus and 500 nM in the rat colon. In contrast, the IC 50 value for serotonin was 0. 4 mM in the baboon bronchus and 8 mM in the rat colon. These results, together with the wide distribution of amine-precursor-uptake-and-decarboxylation (APUD) cells in the respiratory and intestinal tract, suggest that certain indoleamines could play a role as local regulators of fluid and electrolyte transport. For example, in the airways, indoleamines {{may be one of the}} factors involved in regulation of the depth of the periciliary fluid layer...|$|R
40|$|Disease {{severity}} varies among {{cystic fibrosis}} (CF) patients carrying the same cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genotype and among organs {{of the same}} individual. It {{has been shown that}} the class V splicing mutation 3849 � 10 kb C→T produces both normal and aberrantly spliced CFTR transcripts. We analyzed the levels of normal CFTR messenger RNA (mRNA) in different organs of an aborted fetus carrying the 3849 � 10 kb C→T mutation, and found that they correlated with the histopathologic changes observed in these organs. We performed semiquantitative nondifferential reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction on several organs from a 22 -wk aborted CF fetus carrying the 3849 � 10 kb C→T mutation. A very low level (1 %) of normal CFTR mRNA was detected in the severely affected ileum of this fetus. Higher levels were found in the histopathologically unaffected <b>trachea</b> (17 %), <b>colon</b> (19 %), and lung (26 %). Thus, as early as in utero, the regulation of alternative splice-site selection is an important mechanism underlying variable CF severity. Understanding of the mechanisms regulating alternative splicing in different tissues will contribute to potential therapy for patients carrying splicing mutations in CF and other human disease genes.

40|$|Ultrastructural {{examination}} of rat tracheal explants {{at various times}} of culture in a serum-free and hormone-supplemented medium containing retinoic acid showed that the cytological characteristics of the epithelium were well preserved for at least 192 h. Hybridization analyses for mucin core protein mRNA in the explants were performed with a 30 -base oligonucleotide probe, the design of {{which was based on}} the tandem repeat sequence of the rat intestine mucin core protein. The probe reacted with total RNA prepared from <b>trachea,</b> intestine and <b>colon,</b> but not with total RNA obtained from liver or alveolar region of the lung. Type-I keratin expression was observed in the explant grown at different periods of time in a medium with and without retinoic acid. The hybridization probe gave a prominent reaction with RNA preparations obtained from tracheal explants incubated for as long as 192 h in a medium containing retinoic acid. In the absence of retinoic acid, however, the mucin message was evident at the 24 h time point but thereafter decreased to barely detectable levels. When retinoic acid was added at 96 h to the latter cultures, the mucin mRNA was prominent again after additional incubation for 24 and 48 h. Northern-blot analyses of tracheal RNA showed a diffuse band at approx. 7. 5 kb. Addition of a variety of chemical and pharmacological agents to explants cultured in the presence of retinoic acid had no dramatic induction or inhibitory effects on the mucin mRNA. Only the steroid prednisolone had a reproducible inhibitory effect...|$|R
40|$|At {{least five}} {{families}} of mammalian carboxylesterases (CES) catalyse the hydrolysis or transesterification {{of a wide}} range of drugs and xenobiotics and may also participate in fatty acyl and cholesterol ester metabolism. In this study, in silico methods were used to predict the amino acid sequences, secondary and tertiary structures, and gene locations for CES 3 genes and encoded proteins using data from several mammalian genome projects. Mammalian CES 3 genes were located within a CES gene cluster with CES 2 and CES 6 genes, usually containing 13 exons transcribed on the positive DNA strand. Evidence is reported for duplicated CES 3 genes for the chimp and mouse genomes. Mammalian CES 3 protein subunits shared 58 - 97 % sequence identity and exhibited sequence alignments and identities for key CES amino acid residues as well as extensive conservation of predicted secondary and tertiary structures with those previously reported for human CES 1. The human genome project has previously reported CES 3 mRNA isoform expression in several tissues, particularly in <b>colon,</b> <b>trachea</b> and in brain. Predicted human CES 3 isoproteins were apparently derived from exon shuffling and are likely to be secreted extracellularly or retained within the cytoplasm. Mouse CES 3 -like transcripts were localized in specific regions of the mouse brain, including the cerebellum, and may play a role in the detoxification of drugs and xenobiotics in neural tissues and other tissues of the body. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated the relationships and potential evolutionary origins of the mammalian CES 3 family of genes which were related to but distinct from other mammalian CES gene families.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Locally {{advanced}} tumours as {{the initial}} form of presentation of tumours in the bronchial tree {{are not a}} rare event. Bronchogenic recurrence is frequent in {{the natural history of}} some tumours. The choice of therapeutic options from the raft available depends on such variables as initial therapy, place of recurrence, symptoms and patient’s physical status. Aim: To demonstrate the advantages of endoluminal brachytherapy (EBT) with high dose rate (HDR) in primary and recurrent tumour of the bronchial tree. Material and methods: A retrospective study of seven patients (pts) with primary tumours of the <b>colon,</b> <b>trachea</b> and lung. Tracheobronchial recurrence (trachea, two pts, bronchus, five pts) occurred between March 2003 and September 2004. Patients under-went EBT with HDR for primary or recurrent therapy in association with external radiotherapy, laser therapy and chemotherapy with palliative or curative intention. EBT with HDR doses of 5 to 7 Gy in 2 to 4 fractions at 1 cm from the source axis were given. Treatment included endoluminal application of Ir 192 with a French 6 catheter. Results: There was symptomatic relief related to reduction of tumour in six of the seven patients treated. In one of the six patients studied, there was progression of the local disease between the second and third fractions of the treatment (obstruction of the trachea). In a mean follow up of 17 (2 - 40) months between EBT and this study, three patients are alive, one has no evidence of disease while two have had bronchial recurrence, four patients have died, one after massive haemoptysis and three due to disease progression. Discussion and conclusions: Patients undergoing brachytherapy for symptomatic primary tumours or endobronchial recurrence show good tolerance, important symptom relief and improved quality of life. Despite the small size of our sample, it is clear that EBT with HDR {{plays an important role in}} the palliative/curative treatment of these patients.
