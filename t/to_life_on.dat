5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> Earth.|$|E
5|$|Research by Jennifer A. Clack and {{her colleagues}} showed that the very {{earliest}} tetrapods, animals similar to Acanthostega, were wholly aquatic and quite unsuited <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> land. This {{is in contrast to}} the earlier view that fish had first invaded the land — either in search of prey (like modern mudskippers) or to find water when the pond they lived in dried out — and later evolved legs, lungs, etc.|$|E

5|$|The {{extinction}} {{of the dinosaurs}} {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous period is generally thought to have been caused by the Cretaceous–Paleogene impact event, which created the Chicxulub crater, demonstrating that impacts are a serious threat <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> Earth. Astronomers have speculated that without Jupiter to mop up potential impactors, extinction events might have been more frequent on Earth, and complex life might not have been able to develop. This is part of the argument used in the Rare Earth hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was {{not dangerous}} <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> Earth.

5|$|Despite these {{biological}} possibilities, {{there are}} formidable obstacles <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast {{distance from the}} Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth. Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding {{the early history of}} the terrestrial biosphere. Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Freda's {{deal with}} his {{producers}} failed {{when he left the}} set on the twelfth day of production. After an argument with the producers, Freda left the production allowing Mario Bava to step in to finish the film in the next two days. Reasons for Freda leaving production differ, and range from Freda having a misunderstanding with the producers, to Bava stating that Freda was taking too long to make the film. Bava's ending was different than Freda's initial ending which involved finding the heroine hanged. Among the changes Bava made to finish the film, included changing the supporting character of the journalist becoming the lead and removing a sub-plot about a dismembered criminal who returns <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> being reassembled. Bava also extended other portions of the film with stock footage and montages of newspaper presses.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{decides to}} use Roney's optic-encephalogram, {{a device that}} records {{impressions}} from the optical centres of the brain, and see the visions for himself. Roney's assistant, Barbara Judd, is most sensitive; placing the device on her, they record a violent purge of the Martian hive to root out unwanted mutations. Quatermass concludes that in its most primitive phase mankind was visited by this race of Martians. Some apes and primitive pre-humans were taken away and genetically altered to give them abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis and other psychic powers. They were then returned to Earth, and the buried artefact {{is one of the}} ships that had crashed {{at the end of its}} journey. With their home world dying, the aliens had tried to change humanity's ancestors to have minds and abilities similar to their own, but with a bodily form adapted <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> Earth.|$|E
5|$|Such a {{supernova}} event may pose some threat <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> the Earth. It {{is thought that}} the primary star, IK Pegasi A, is unlikely to evolve into a red giant in the immediate future. As shown previously, the space velocity of this star relative to the Sun is 20.4km/s. This is equivalent to moving a distance of one light year every 14,700years. After 5million years, for example, this star will {{be separated from the}} Sun by more than 500light years. A TypeI{{a supernova}} within a thousand parsecs (3300light-years) is thought to be able to affect the Earth, but it must be closer than about 10 parsecs (around thirty light-years) to cause a major harm to the terrestrial biosphere.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls first {{appeared}} in the Early Carboniferous around 330 million years ago (Mya). During the Carboniferous, temnospondyls included basal medium-sized forms such as Dendrerpeton or large semiaquatic forms such as Cochleosaurus. Other, more derived temnospondyls, such as the amphibamids, were smaller and more terrestrial. They resembled salamanders, and some taxa, such as the genus Branchiosaurus, even retained external gills like the modern-day axolotl. During the latest Carboniferous and Early Permian around 300 Mya, several groups, such as the dissorophids and trematopids evolved strong, robust limbs and vertebrae and became adapted <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> land while others such as the eryopids, developed into large semiaquatic predators. The dvinosaurs, a group of small aquatic temnospondyls, evolved from terrestrial ancestors in the Late Carboniferous.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} {{is the only}} species of the genus Birgus, and {{is related to the}} {{terrestrial}} hermit crabs of the genus Coenobita. It shows a number of adaptations <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> land. Like hermit crabs, juvenile coconut crabs use empty gastropod shells for protection, but the adults develop a tough exoskeleton on their abdomen and stop carrying a shell. Coconut crabs have organs known as branchiostegal lungs, which are used instead of the vestigial gills for breathing and they will drown if immersed in water for long. They have an acute sense of smell, which has developed convergently with that of insects, and which they use to find potential food sources.|$|E
5|$|The {{lifestyle}} of Archaeopteryx {{is difficult to}} reconstruct {{and there are several}} theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal. The absence of trees does not preclude Archaeopteryx from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of Archaeopteryx point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger.|$|E

5|$|Walter Skinner assigns Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to {{investigate}} Sandoz's disappearance, {{giving them a}} rubbing of Merkmallen's artifact. Mulder tells Skinner that both Merkmallen and Sandoz espoused panspermia, a theory suggesting an extraterrestrial origin <b>to</b> <b>life</b> <b>on</b> Earth. Mulder begins suffering from a headache and is unable to hear Scully speak, a condition seemingly caused by the rubbing. At the university, the agents meet Dr. Barnes—the man who posed as Sandoz—who professes disbelief in his theories. Mulder's condition worsens, but he refuses {{to go to the}} hospital and, due to seeming telepathic abilities, realizes that Barnes murdered Merkmallen. Later, in Mulder's office, Chuck Burks tells them that the symbols on the artifact are from Navajo.|$|E
