5|$|Christopher Eccleston was {{the only}} one of the four lead actors who was already an {{established}} television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series Cracker. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film Shallow Grave in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, who he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to successfully perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt <b>the</b> <b>accent</b> at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery himself, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery's personality. He even wore some of the writer's own colourful shirts.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} accents that are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} London accents. The most well known of the London accents long ago acquired the Cockney label, which is heard both in London itself, and across the wider South East England region more generally. <b>The</b> <b>accent</b> of a 21st-century Londoner varies widely; what {{is becoming more and}} more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of ethnic accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled Multicultural London English (MLE). The other widely heard and spoken accent is RP (Received Pronunciation) in various forms, which can often be heard in the media and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this accent is not limited to London and South East England, and can also be heard selectively throughout the whole UK amongst certain social groupings.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> pitch <b>accent</b> in Kansai dialect is very {{different}} from <b>the</b> standard Tokyo <b>accent,</b> so non-Kansai Japanese can recognize Kansai people easily from that alone. <b>The</b> Kansai pitch <b>accent</b> is called <b>the</b> Kyoto-Osaka type <b>accent</b> (京阪式アクセント, Keihan-shiki akusento) in technical terms. It is used in most of Kansai, Shikoku and parts of western Chūbu region. <b>The</b> Tokyo <b>accent</b> distinguishes words only by downstep, but <b>the</b> Kansai <b>accent</b> distinguishes words also by initial tones, so Kansai dialect has more pitch patterns than standard Japanese. In <b>the</b> Tokyo <b>accent,</b> <b>the</b> pitch between first and second morae usually change, but in <b>the</b> Kansai <b>accent,</b> it does not always.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the descriptive acoustic analysis of Croatian prosodemes, i. e. <b>the</b> four lexical <b>accents</b> and <b>the</b> post-accentual length in the pronunciation of twenty young speakers of Croatian (average age 21. 6). The total corpus consisting of 900 tokens has been analysed through listening {{and after that}} the auditory unambiguous words (52 % of tokens in the corpus) have been analysed according to acoustic dimensions of duration, intonation and intensity. The results of the acoustic analysis indicate that the mean duration of the stressed vowel in <b>the</b> short-falling <b>accent</b> is 123 ms (SD 28), in <b>the</b> short-rising <b>accent</b> 124 ms (SD 24), in the long-falling 190 ms (SD 33) and in the long-rising 185 ms (SD 33). Post-hoc tests of durational differences show that two long accents are significantly longer than <b>the</b> two short <b>accents</b> (p <. 000). Durational differences between rising and falling accents are small and statistically not significant: LF vs. LR (p =. 282); SF vs. SR (p =. 573). In 2 / 3 of the words the post-accentual phonologically long vowel is perceived as long, and its mean duration is 130 ms (SD 36), that is, 96 % of the total duration of the stressed vowel. Phonologically short post-accentual vowel averagely lasts 95 ms (SD 31), that is, 66 % of the total duration of the stressed vowel. Falling accents have a downward pattern of fundamental frequency in <b>the</b> <b>accented</b> syllable and mostly flat pattern in the post-accentual syllable, while rising accents have a generally flat frequency contour in <b>the</b> <b>accented</b> syllable and a downward contour in the post-accentual syllable. The pitch range (in semitones – ST) within <b>the</b> <b>accented</b> vowel of <b>the</b> long-falling <b>accent</b> is 3. 7 ST, of <b>the</b> short-falling <b>accent</b> 2. 2 ST, of <b>the</b> long-rising <b>accent</b> 1. 4 ST and of <b>the</b> short-rising <b>accent</b> 1. 3 ST. The relation between average tone and intensity of <b>the</b> <b>accented</b> and post-accentual vowel indicates that the post-accentual vowel of <b>the</b> falling <b>accents</b> generally has a significantly lower tone and lower intensity than of <b>the</b> rising <b>accents.</b> <b>The</b> pitch level of post-accentual vowel expressed as a ratio of the pitch level of <b>accented</b> vowel in <b>the</b> long-falling <b>accent</b> are - 3. 8 ST, in <b>the</b> short-falling <b>accent</b> - 3. 7 ST, in <b>the</b> long-rising <b>accent</b> - 1. 7 ST and in <b>the</b> short-rising <b>accent</b> - 1. 2 ST. The intensity level of post-accentual vowel expressed as a ratio of the intensity level of accented vowel (in dB) in <b>the</b> long-falling <b>accents</b> are - 8. 5 dB, in <b>the</b> short-falling <b>accent</b> - 7. 6 dB, in <b>the</b> long-rising <b>accent</b> and - 7. 6 dB and in <b>the</b> short-rising <b>accent</b> - 5. 5 dB...|$|R
