40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to estimate prevalence rates of psychological problems in immigrant Iranian children in the UK and to evaluate the associated characteristics. Methods: A group of 244 children and adolescents, 111 boys and 133 girls between the ages 6 to 15 was selected. The children were categorised into groups with different psychological problems by their teachers on the Teacher’s Report Form (TRF). Also, the parents and The children completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL) and the Youth Self-Report (YSR) for the ages 11 to 15 years, respectively. Results: <b>Two-way</b> <b>ANOVAs</b> using gender and age groups as factors showed that there were significant effects of gender in these subscales.
