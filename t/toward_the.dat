5|$|Gustav moved erratically to the west-northwest <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> North Carolina-South Carolina border {{over the}} next two days, it slowly strengthened, {{acquiring}} more tropical characteristics. On September 10, a poorly organized band of stronger winds developed around the center, and Gustav was designated a fully tropical storm shortly before turning <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> north and brushing Cape Hatteras, then accelerating <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northeast and away from the coast. On September 11, while under the influence of a non-tropical system over New England, Gustav quickly strengthened into a hurricane, in a process similar to the intensification of Hurricane Michael in 2000. Gustav reached its peak intensity of 100mph (160km/h) later that day.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} ridge {{over the}} central Atlantic steered the nascent storm westward <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Lesser Antilles. Thunderstorm activity was strong near the center, although initially somewhat disorganized and asymmetric. However, a tight inner core soon took shape, and Gonzalo began to quickly intensify {{throughout the day}} on October 12. Following the appearance of an eye feature early the next day, the storm was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane while located near Antigua in the eastern Caribbean. Shortly thereafter, the storm passed directly over the island. The hurricane later struck Saint Martin and Anguilla, and skirted {{just north of the}} British Virgin Islands while continuing to intensify. By that time, it was headed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest around the periphery of the aforementioned ridge.|$|E

5|$|Developing as a {{tropical}} depression near Nassau in the Bahamas on September 12, Felice had {{its origins in}} a persistent upper-level trough over the area.

Over the open waters of the Gulf, the system accelerated <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west-northwest along the southern periphery of a large ridge of high pressure to the north. While reconnaissance aircraft data on the storm suggested that the depression strengthened into {{a tropical}} storm midday on September 14, the official Atlantic tropical cyclone database known as HURDAT indicates the disturbance attained tropical storm status at 0000 UTC on September 15.|$|E

5|$|Early on August28, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{an unusually}} vigorous tropical wavean elongated area of low air pressureinland over West Africa. Trailed by widespread cloudiness, the wave tracked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> open Atlantic as it developed a broad cyclonic rotation within the lower atmosphere near Guinea's coastline. The disturbance veered <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northwest {{and entered the}} ocean off Conakry around 18:00UTC, August29. By that time, the NHC was predicting a favorable environment for tropical cyclone development within the next 48hours; heavy thunderstorms thrived overnight and consolidated near a well-defined low-pressure center. Around midnight August30, satellite images and scatterometer data confirmed that a tropical depression had formed about 300miles (480km) west-northwest of Conakry, with wind speeds of 35mph (55km/h).|$|E
