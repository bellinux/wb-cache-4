40|$|Summary-The binding {{characteristics}} of substrate and effector ligands to testicular microsomal cytochrome P- 450 (17 a-hydroxylase/C,,_,, lyase) {{have been investigated}} by difference spectroscopy. Steroid products and their analogs induce oxygen-mediated amage of microsomal P- 450 activities of cultured Leydig cells, whereas <b>testosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> protects P- 450 from this damage [I]. Progesterone and 17 a-hydroxyprogesterone, the nzyme’s substrates, bound stoichiometrically to microsomal P- 450 with unusually high affinity (& = 23 - 51 nM). These properties of the enzyme {{may be responsible for}} the extremely efficient metabolism of these intermediates in androgen biosynthesis. The binding affinities of inhibitory effeetor ligands were determined in competition experiments with the substrates. Several steroids which have varying effects on damage of P- 450 in cultured Leydig cells inhibited substrate binding similarly (&, = 3. 8 - 12. 8 PM). Aminoglutethimide did not inhibit substrate binding. The results suggest that steroid binding to P- 450 is necessary but not suthcient o increase oxygen free-radical damage of the testicular microsomal P- 450. <b>Testosterone</b> <b>acetate,</b> which diminishes P- 450 loss in Leydig cell cultures, was also bound stoichiometrically with high affinity (K,, = 17 nM) and produced a unique spectra, with maxima at 408 nm, an isosbestic point at 418 nm and minima at 428 nm. Therefore, the protection of P- 450 in cultured Leydig cells probably results from binding of <b>testosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> at the active site of P- 450...|$|E

Optimal conditions for this bioassay, particularly {{the concentration of}} testosterone, were established using the inhibitory effects of cyproterone acetate on testosterone-induced 125 iododeoxyuridine (I-UdR) uptake as an index of DNA synthesis inhibition. Using 4 X 10 (- 7) M testosterone, only the highest concentration (X 10 (- 5) M) of cyproterone acetate inhibited I-UdR uptake and histological observations indicated that {{this was due to}} a non-specific cytotoxic effect. In contrast, cyproterone acetate had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the proliferative response to 4 X 10 (- 9) M <b>testosterone.</b> Cyproterone <b>acetate</b> (4 X 10 (- 7) M) combined with 4 X 10 (- 9) M testosterone exerted an inhibitory effect on I-UdR uptake and caused epithelial atrophy indicative of androgen deprivation. The results are consistent with similar in vivo studies and confirm the hypothesis that cyproterone acetate acts by directly antagonising testosterone action at the target tissue level. Thus, this in vitro method provides a useful model for screening the direct effects of antiprostatic drugs...|$|R

40|$|From {{the results}} {{reported}} by previous pap e rs of this series, {{it seems that}} the accessory organs of phallus (rudimentary copulatory organ) of the cock correspond to the accessory reproductive glands of the mammal in respect of the physiological functions of them. In order to investigate t he response of the androgen to the accessory organs of phallus, daily dose of 0. 5 - 5 mg. of <b>testosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (total dosage, 52. 5 mg.) was injected for 25 days with oestrone benzoate, the amount of this being about one thirtieth of <b>testosterone</b> <b>acetate,</b> into three adult capons. The degenerated accessory organs of phallus in these capons i n creased in their weight or size to those in normal cocks. These organs became functional as glands, and the transparent fluid was secreted by them and was able to be collected from these capons, by means of the abdominal massage as well as with semen collector. Thus, the influence of androgen on the accessory. organs of phallus in the fowl is quite similar to that of androgen on the accessory reproductive glands in the mammal. So, the writer believes that the accessory organs of phallus in fowls and the accessory reproductive glands in mammals are analogous organs. In this experiment, it was also recognized that the secondary sex character, sexual behavior, phallus and vas deferens of the capon restored to the state of normal cocks by androgen administration.

30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{formation}} from alkanes and alkenes by microorganisms, ketones are occurring in plant oils, insects and mammals (Forney and Markovetz [1971]). Due to that ketones are common substances {{in the environment}} and therefore there are microorganisms that can convert those. Forney et al. showed the formation of undecane- 1 -ol and undecyl acetate from tridecane- 2 -one by Pseudomonas multivorans (Forney et al. [1967]). In the course of further degradation undecyl acetate was hydrolyzed to undecane- 1 -ol and acetate. Moreover, {{it was reported that}} the strain Gordonia spec.

Each fowl was given 50 mg of 2 ̆ 2 Amolisin 2 ̆ 2 during a period of 20 days by daily subcutaneous injections. The results of the investigations may be summarized as follows : Combs and wattles became enlarged, above all female combs extremely larger. Remarkable changes of the difference in their living weights could not be found between treated fowls and controls. After 5 or 6 days from the beginning of this treatment, the arrest of laying occurred in female fowls. Then after two weeks 2 ̆ 7 injections they began to crow and behaved as if they were active males. They also imitated the male gestures of copulation to the control fowls.

Injected cocks 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 Gefassreicher Korper 2 ̆ 2 became more intensive in their reddish color. Testes, ovaries and oviducts decreased exceedingly in weight and size. Under histological observations, the hormon e accomplished its effect upon the comb primarily by stimulating the cells of the intermediate layer of loose connective tissue whose fibers were widely spread apart by a matrix of mucoid; especially the comb of injected hen had an intermediate layer much highly developed. In the 2 ̆ 2 Gefassreichem Korper 2 ̆ 2, loose connective tissue was found to have entered into marrow core tissue, and lymphatic sinuses were filled with lymph fluid. According as the shrinkage of the testis, the seminiferous tubules were reduced markedly in size and spermatogenesis was inhibited. Under the influence of androgen, atrophy of endometrium and oedema of the circular layer of myometrium in the uterus portion of oviduct occured. The changes induced in the albumen secreting portion of oviduct were almost of the same results as uterus portion. The characteristic changes which occurred in the anterior lobe of pituitary by injection of androgen, were degranulation of the basophiles and decreasing their cells in number and size. On the other hand, the results on the acidophiles had only a tendency of slightly increasing, but they were not so clear as basophiles. In these reactions females appeared to be more responsible to androgen than males. 成長を遂げた雌雄鶏に雄性ホルモンを給与して肉眼観察並びに組織観察により次の結果を得た. (1). 体重には著しい変化がなかつた. (2). 冠・肉髯は雌雄共伸長肥厚したが, 雌に於てはその程度が著しかつた.

40|$|Depriving hormone-dependent {{breast cancer}} cells of estrogens {{has been shown}} to be a {{beneficial}} strategy in the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of estrogens include: 17 [beta]-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 [beta]-HSD), aromatase (AR) and estrone sulfatase (ES). The latter two have been the target of intensive research within our group. Within the current project, we report the synthesis of various types of compounds as potential inhibitors of AR in an effort to determine detailed information regarding the active site of this enzyme; we have also attempted to combine our knowledge of AR and ES in the development of compounds which are able to ihhibit both enzymes. In the first series of compounds to be investigated, compounds were synthesised based on enantiomerically pure forms of the "Evans chiral auxiliary", which is commercially available in both the R and S forms. The oxazolidinone and the phenyl ring systems were derivatised so as to produce N-alkylated compounds which contained a phenylamine moiety for ligating to the Fe of the cytochrome P- 450 haem. The compounds were evaluated using a standard literature assay and were, in general, found to be equipotent or more potent than the standard compound aminoglutethimide (AG), with the most potent inhibitor being the pentyi derivative of the R-form (IC 50 = 0. B 3 ±O. 05 ¡ [...] tM). An interesting and different trend was observed 'within the inhibitors based on the S-enantiomer, which were found to be weak inhibitors of AR in comparison to AG - the most potent compound (55) was found to possess an IC 50 value of 16. 82 ± 0. 20 ¡ [...] tM. The inhibitory activities of both the R- and S-forms were rationalised using the novel substrate-haem complex (SHC) approach. 'From the rationalisation of the inhibitory activity of the oxazolidinone based compounds, the importance of the C(17) position of the steroid backbone was highlighted. As such, we undertook the synthesis and biochemical evaluation of a series of esters based on testosterone. On undertaking the biochemical evaluation of these compounds it was discovered that testosterone possessed potent inhibitory activity (IC 50 = 20. 6 ±O. 15 ¡ [...] tM), and that of the esters, <b>testosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> was shown to have an IC 50 value of 4 B. 7 ±O. 07 ¡ [...] tM, whereas testosterone decanoate possessed an IC 50 value of 164. 1 ±O. 5 ¡ [...] tM. However, the derivatisatian of the alkyl to an aryl carboxylate moiety resulted in one compound which was found to possess highly potent inhibitory activity. That is, testosterone 4 -nitrobenzoate was found to possess an IC 50 value of B. 5 ± 0. 05 ¡ [...] tM. In an effort to synthesise dual inhibitors of AR and ES, we undertook the synthesis of compounds based on the results of our previous studies into ES and the inhibitory activities observed within the testosterone and oxazolidinone based compounds. 'In particular, an attempt was made to incorporate the structural aspects of anastrozole (an aromatase inhibitor) together with a sulfonated phenyl moiety. We synthesised a series of azole based compounds and as expected, these compounds were found to be potent inhibitors of AR, the most potent [1 -(4 -chloro-benzyl) - 1 H-imidazole (BO) ] was found to possess an IC 50 value of 70 ± 0. 5 nM. However, the synthesis of the sulfonated compounds proved troublesome and as such no inhibitory data was obtained for these compounds. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Zeranol (alpha-zearalanol) is produced semi-synthetically, but it also occurs naturally in some foods. It is one of several derivatives of zearalenone produced by certain Fusarium. [...] Although its occurrence in animal products can be partly due to its ingestion in such feeds, alpha-zearalanol can also be produced endogenously in ruminants that have ingested zearalenone and some zearalenone derivatives in such feeds. [...] The EU did not impose an absolute ban. Under veterinary supervision, cattle farmers were permitted to administer the synthetic versions of natural hormones for cost-reduction and possibly therapeutic purposes, such as synchronising the oestrus cycles of dairy cows. All six hormones were licensed for use in the US and in Canada.|$|R

Title of diploma thesis: HPLC {{method for}} {{determination}} of testesterone {{and its use}} for chatacterization of carbonyl reductases Prostate cancer belong to hormone-dependent tumors, the proliferation of transformed cells is dependent on activation of the androgen receptor by testosterone. Androgen deprivatin therapy is complicated by productin of active androgens directly in prostate cells. It was proved that among other enzymes also carbonyl-reducing enzymes participate in androgen production, especially enzyme aldo-keto reductase 1 C 3 (AKR 1 C 3). The aim {{was to develop a}} HPLC method for the determination of testosterone and use this method for in vitro screening of activity of carbonyl-reducing enzymes in formation of potent androgen testosterone from its inactive precursor androstenedione. Enzyme samples were incubated with androstenedione c = 20 - 120 µmol/l and after incubation were extracted by ethyl <b>acetate.</b> <b>Testosterone</b> formed during the incubation was determined by HPLC analysis (column BDS Hypersil C 18, 5 µm, 250 × 4. 6 mm, mobile phase metanol:voda, 70 : 30, detection: DAD při 240 nm).

The stimulation is not due to degradation to the acetate level. It is obtained only in highly aerated cultures. The rate of growth of Torula utilis was not increased. Both organisms were inhibited by desoxycorticosterone, <b>testosterone,</b> androstenedione, cortisone <b>acetate,</b> progesterone, and diethylstilbestrol. T. utilis was also inhibited by estradiol. A small decrease in progesterone inhibition of T. utilis was obtained by adding ergosterol, cholesterol, or pregnenolone. Of the compounds which have been adequately tested the order of stimulatory activity for A. niger is: ergosterol > cholesterol > stigmasterol > 7 -dehydrocholesterol > cholestanol > pregnenolone. Progesterone was inhibitory at low concentrations but stimulatory at higher ones, while 17 -hydroxyprogesterone was neither inhibitory nor stimulatory. Desoxycorticosterone and testosterone were inhibitory at all concentrations. Complete inhibition of the growth of the fungus was not obtained with any of the steroids. It is concluded that A. niger has a metabolic requirement for a steroid with a hydroxy group on carbon 3, a double bond in the 5 – 6 position, and a side chain similar to that in ergosterol or cholesterol and that this material is growth-limiting {{in the early stages of}} the cultures described...|$|R

LH-RH administration (15 [mu]g/h/ 3 h) associated with physiological or pharmacological doses of several steroid hormones such as estradiol (E 2), progesterone, 17 [alpha]OH-progesterone, 20 [alpha]OH-progesterone, chlormadinone <b>acetate,</b> <b>testosterone</b> (T) and 5 [alpha]-dihydrotestosterone (5 [alpha]DHT) was evaluated by radioimmunoassayable plasma LH and FSH measurements, in normal and post-menopausal women, normal men, and in a Flinefelter's syndrome subject. Analysis of results indicated that E 2 in doses of 132 [mu]g/h/ 6 hs blocks the pituitary response to LH-RH in all cases except in the Klinefelter's syndrome patient. Nevertheless, E 2 in doses of 6. 6 [mu]g/h/ 6 hs did not cause a significant inhibitory effect. The infusion of physiological (330 [mu]g/h/ 6 hs) or pharmacological (3300 - 6600 [mu]g/h/ 6 hs) doses {{of any of the}} selected progestational steroids did not block the pituitary response to LH-RH. When chlormadinone acetate was infused together with E 2 in normal and postmenopausal women, the inhibitory effect of E 2 on the pituitary response to LH-RH was antagonized. T in doses of 600 [mu]g/h/ 6 hs produced a partial inhibitory effect on the pituitary response to LH-RH in normal men, nevertheless in the post-menopausal women and in the Klinefelter's syndrome patient did not cause inhibition. 5 [alpha]DHT did not inhibit the pituitary response to LH-RH administration in all subjects tested. It was concluded that: (1) pharmacological doses of E 2 completely blocks the pituitary response to LH-RH; (2) the inhibitory effect of E 2 was counteracted by chlormadinone acetate; (3) the infusion of T produced a partial inhibitory effect on the pituitary response to LH-RH in normal men, and (4) in the patient with Klinefelter's syndrome, the infusion of pharmacological doses of T and E 2 did not inhibit the LH pituitary response to LH-RH...|$|R

Bibliography: leaves 136 - 144. xii, 144 lSingle {{doses of}} {{aldosterone}} {{were administered to}} normal rats, {{and the effect of}} RNA synthesis was studied. The maximal stimulation of the incorporation of l 4 c-ATP into RNA by nuclei isolated from rat kidneys was observed 30 minutes after an intravenous injection of aldosterone. Thereafter, the RNA synthesis decreased to a level less than that of the control, reaching a minimum at 2. 5 hours. The return to control level was followed by further oscillations in RNA synthesis. Likewise, in isolated brain nuclei, an oscillation in RNA synthesis was observed following an intravenous injection of aldosterone. The effect of single injections of aldosterone, cortisol, deoxycorticosterone <b>acetate,</b> <b>testosterone</b> or progesterone was studied on RNA synthesis by isolated rat spleen nuclei. It was found that the l 4 C-ATP incorporation was initially inhibited following the injection of aldosterone, cortisol or deoxycorticosterone acetate. The initial response to an injection of testosterone or progesterone was a stimulation in the spleen RNA synthesis. The response to the administration of aldosterone was similar to that of cortisol. Subsequent to the initial inhibition, a stimulation followed by a return {{to the level of the}} control, was observed and secondary inhibitions were found. RNA synthesis in the thymus was initially inhibited following the administration of aldosterone. RNA synthesis was studied in the nuclei isolated from the kidney and spleen of adrenalectomized or hypophysectomized rats injected with aldosterone. Oscillations were observed in the RNA synthesis of both tissues of the endocrinectomized rats. It was concluded that the oscillations in RNA synthesis were not a function of some form of homeostatic control involving the pituitary and adrenal glands. Aldactone (SC 9420) was found to modify the RNA synthesis of nuclei isolated from the kidney, spleen and thymus of intact, adrenalectomized or hypophysectomized rats. Again, oscillations in RNA synthesis were observed, however there was the suggestion that the adrenals or the pituitary might be involved in the response as observed in the kidney and the thymus. Experiments were carried out in which both aldosterone and Aldactone were injected, and their action on RNA synthesis was observed in the kidney, spleen and thymus. The results indicated that these two steroids alter RNA synthesis independently from each other. Analysis of the RNA synthesized in vitro by the isolated nuclei of the kidney and spleen indicated that only a single species of RNA was made. This 5 s RNA was identical to that species of RNA present in nuclei, prior to incubation for the incorporation of l 4 C-ATP...|$|R
