The error estimation procedure is extended to multiple target functionals. The discontinuous ansatz spaces of the DG discretization allow for both element subdivision as well as a local increase of polynomial degrees for increasing the flow resolution. Targeting optimal rates of convergence, a smoothness estimation based on a truncated Legendre series expansion of the solution is employed to locally select the more promising strategy.

In {{addition to the}} exact approximation of these quantities it is of increasing importance, in particular {{in the field of}} uncertainty quantification, to estimate the error in the computed quantities. In recent years a posteriori error estimation and goal-oriented refinement approaches have been developed for the accurate and efficient computation of single <b>target</b> <b>quantities.</b> The current approaches are based on computing an adjoint solution related to each of the specific <b>target</b> <b>quantities</b> under consideration. In this paper we extend this approach to the accurate and efficient computation of multiple <b>target</b> <b>quantities.</b> Instead of computing multiple adjoint solutions, one for each target functional, the new approach is based on the computation of one adjoint and one adjoint-adjoint solution. This way only two auxiliary problem are required irrespective of the number on target functionals. The practical performance of this approach is demonstrated for a laminar compressible flow. In particular, the proposed approach is compared to the standard approach of error estimation and goal-oriented refinement as well as to residual-based refinement. The performance of the algorithms is measured in terms of computing resources required for meeting industrial as well as academic accuracy requirements on the computed force coefficients...|$|R

Although techniques for mounting PSP in tropical forests are well known, their planning still deserves attention. This study aims at defining a rationale for determining the size and number of replicates for setting up PSP in mixed tropical forests. It considers PSP as a sampling plan to estimate a <b>target</b> <b>quantity</b> with its associated margin of error. The <b>target</b> <b>quantity</b> considered here is the stock recovery rate, which is a key parameter for forest management in Central Africa. It is computed separately for each commercial species. The number of trees to monitor for each species defines the margin of error on the stock recovery rate. The size and number of replicated plots is obtained as the solution of an optimization problem that consists in minimizing the margin of error for every species while ensuring that the mounting cost remains below a given threshold. This rationale was applied using the data from the M'Baïki experimental site in the Central African Republic. It showed that the stock recovery rate is a highly variable quantity, and that the typical cost that forest managers are prone to devote to PSP leads to high margins of error. It also showed that the size and number of replicated plots is related to the spatial pattern of trees: clustered or spatially heterogeneous patterns favor many small plots, whereas regular or spatially homogeneous patterns favor few large plots.

40|$|Inverse {{modelling}} {{is a key}} step in groundwater-related hydrological studies. Several inversion {{techniques were}} developed during the last decades, but hardly any comparison between them was presented. We compare seven modern inverse methods for groundwater flow: the Regularised Pilot Points Method (both the estimation, RPPM-CE, and the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation variants, RPPM-CS), the MC variant of the Representer Method (RM), the Sequential Self-Calibration Method (SSC), the Moment Equations Method (MEM), the Zonation Method (ZM) and a non-iterative Semi-Analytical Method (SAM). These methods are applied to a two-dimensional synthetic example, depicting steady-state groundwater flow around a pumping well. Their relative performance is assessed {{in terms of their}} ability to characterise the logtransmissivity and hydraulic head fields and to predict the extent of the well catchment, both for a mildly and a strongly heterogeneous transmissivity field. The main conclusions drawn from the comparison are: (1) MC-based methods (RPPM-CS, SSC and RM) yield very similar results, regardless the degree of heterogeneity and despite they use different parameterisation schemes and objective functions; (2) statistical moments of the <b>target</b> <b>quantities</b> provided by MEM and RPPM-CE {{are similar to those of}} MC-based methods; (3) ZM and SAM are negatively affected by strong heterogeneity; and (4) in general, observed differences between the performances of all methods are not very large. MC-based inverse methods need considerably more CPU time than the other tested approaches. An advantage of MC-based methods is that they allow computing the posterior probability distribution of the <b>target</b> <b>quantities,</b> which can be directly fed to probabilistic risk-assessment procedures...|$|R

Based on the dynamic response of inflation to different shocks, including nominal public debt, results show that a number of SSA countries were characterized throughout the period 1980 - 2005 either by chronic fiscally dominant regimes, with weak or no response of primary surpluses to public debt; or by a consistent adoption of a monetary dominant regime. However, a number of countries were also characterized by lack of a clear monetary and fiscal policy regime.
