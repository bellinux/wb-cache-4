40|$|<b>Tightening</b> {{method for}} flange joints {{proposed}} by ASME PCC [...] 1 specifies that bolts are <b>tightened</b> by the cross-pattern sequence and <b>tightening</b> torque is raised with several steps. On the other hand, new <b>tightening</b> method {{has been proposed}} by Japan BFC committee, in which bolts are <b>tightened</b> in the clockwise-pattern sequence and <b>tightening</b> torque is 100 % of the target torque in all steps after an install step with some snug torque. <b>Tightening</b> tests using flanges with various nominal sizes, performed in this study, show that the new <b>tightening</b> method achieves comparable uniformity in bolt preloads and in flange alignment with ASME PCC- 4 procedure. This new <b>tightening</b> method is able to reduce both the work volume in the <b>tightening</b> operation {{and the possibility of}} human errors like missing the <b>tightening</b> order in it. Stepqike increment of the bolt tension under the rep ated <b>tightening</b> with small increment of the <b>tightening</b> torque is also discussed. Experimental results show that continuous control of the bolt tension by the repeated <b>tightening</b> is impossible.

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} <b>tightening</b> speed on the torque coefficient in lag screw timber joints with steel side plates, <b>tightening</b> tests were conducted on main timber members made from Cryptomeria japonica, Chamaecyparis obtusa and Pseudotsuga menziesii, under four <b>tightening</b> speed conditions (1, 4, 10, and 20  rpm). Major stick-slip behavior was observed in C. obtusa based {{on the relationship of}} <b>tightening</b> angle with clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque at <b>tightening</b> speeds of 1 and 4  rpm. In addition, <b>tightening</b> speed’s effects on the torque coefficient (K) varied depending on the wood species of the main member. In P. menziesii, K was not affected by the <b>tightening</b> speed: the ratio of torque expended on <b>tightening</b> was 25 % on average, and the ratio of torque expended on bearing surface friction was higher than the ratio of torque expended on thread friction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Plastic region <b>tightening</b> {{is widely}} used in {{critical}} bolted joints in internal combustion engines {{in order to reduce}} the engine weight by maximizing the use of load-carrying capacity of bolt. Mechanical behavior of bolt <b>tightened</b> in plastic region under external axial tensile load is investigated for various friction conditions using three dimensional finite element analysis. The behavior of bolt <b>tightened</b> in elastic region as well as that in tensile test are investigated for comparison. <b>Tightening</b> process is simulated by rotating the bolt in order to examine the friction effect realistically. It is revealed that the bolt <b>tightened</b> in plastic region can carry more external load until the joint is opened, and yields at lower bolt load than the bolt <b>tightened</b> in elastic region. The friction coefficient has effect on the yield load, but not on the load-carrying capacity. Moreover, the scatter in the bolt preload due to friction begins with plastic deformation of bolt in the angle <b>tightening</b> control, whereas it begins with the onset of <b>tightening</b> in the torque <b>tightening</b> control. The observations are interpreted with the residual torsional stress in the bolt generated during the <b>tightening...</b>|$|R

30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} typical {{relationships}} obtained for <b>tightening</b> angle versus clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque. In C. japonica, <b>tightening</b> torque and thread torque follow {{the profile of}} clamp force: first rising, then falling after reaching a peak value. The initial, sharp rise in <b>tightening</b> torque and thread torque is likely the initial driving torque when the lag screw head pressed against the bearing surface. Similar behavior was observed in P. menziesii at all <b>tightening</b> speeds and in C. obtusa at <b>tightening</b> speeds of 10 and 20  rpm. In all test specimens of C. obtusa at <b>tightening</b> speeds of 1 and 4  rpm, however, jagged, ‘sawtooth’ patterns are apparent in the relationships between <b>tightening</b> angle and clamp force, <b>tightening</b> torque, and thread torque. During the experiments, the wooden members were heard to creak, suggesting these fluctuations were due to stick-slip behavior between the lag screw thread and the main member. When major stick-slip occurs, the resultant clamp force is predicted to be highly variable, even if a torque control method were applied.|$|R
