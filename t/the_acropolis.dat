5|$|<b>The</b> <b>acropolis</b> is {{the largest}} {{architectural}} complex at Quiriguá, it lies at the southern limit of the ceremonial centre of the city. It is a complex construction, with new buildings and features being added over time. Construction of <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> began in 550 and continued through to 810 when the site was abandoned. <b>The</b> <b>acropolis</b> was a palace complex used primarily as an elite residence and for administrative purposes. <b>The</b> <b>acropolis</b> complex includes structures 1B-1, 1B-2, 1B-3, 1B-4, 1B-5 and 1B-6. Excavations of <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> encountered the fallen remains of corbel arches, but none are still standing.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic {{there appears}} to have been greater public access to <b>the</b> <b>acropolis,</b> with {{stairways}} communicating between the various terraces leading up to the south range. During the Terminal Classic, these stairways were filled in, as were many of the access doorways to <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> itself, with some buildings being sealed completely. This closing of public access to the palace reflects the greater political instability engulfing the entire Petén region at this time. <b>The</b> <b>acropolis</b> complex was abandoned by the city's elite in the Terminal Classic, a time when most of the city centre was also deserted by its residents. Many flint projectile points were recovered from the south terraces of <b>the</b> <b>acropolis,</b> this combined with the remains of two individuals very near the surface indicates that a violent confrontation took place around the time that the city was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|Three great {{complexes}} {{forming the}} ceremonial site core survive: the North Plaza, <b>the</b> East <b>Acropolis</b> and <b>the</b> Great <b>Acropolis.</b> <b>The</b> ceremonial center displays the key features of Maya architecture: terraces with temples, palaces, platforms and plazas. Several temples have vaulted inner chambers, which {{allowed them to}} also function as tombs.|$|R
5|$|Further {{excavations}} {{have taken}} place since the 1990s, including investigations of the West Plaza in 2003, the East Plaza in 2004, <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> in 20052006 and the Northwest Plaza in 2006.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Acropolis</b> was {{the royal}} complex {{at the heart}} of Copán. It {{consists}} of two plazas that have been named the West Court and the East Court. They are both enclosed by elevated structures. Archaeologists have excavated extensive tunnels under <b>the</b> <b>Acropolis,</b> revealing how the royal complex {{at the heart of}} Copán developed over the centuries and uncovering several hieroglyphic texts that date back to the Early Classic and verify details of the early dynastic rulers of the city who were recorded on AltarQ hundreds of years later. The deepest of these tunnels have revealed that the first monumental structures underlying <b>the</b> <b>Acropolis</b> date archaeologically to the early 5thcentury AD, when K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' established the royal dynasty. These early buildings were built of stone and adobe and were themselves built upon earlier earth and cobble structures dating to the predynastic period. The two styles of building overlap somewhat, with some of the earthen structures being expanded during the first hundred years or so of the dynastic history of the city. The early dynastic masonry buildings of <b>the</b> <b>Acropolis</b> included several with the Early Classic apron-molding style of Tikal and one built in the talud-tablero style associated with Teotihuacan, although at the time the talud-tablero form was in use at both Tikal and Kaminaljuyu as well as in Central Mexico.|$|E

5000|$|The Comalcalco archeological site is in {{the center}} of the region. Comalcalco is {{distinct}} from other Mayan sites as its monumental structure are made of adobe, rather than stone. There are three main groups of buildings called the North Plaza, <b>the</b> Grand <b>Acropolis</b> and <b>the</b> East <b>Acropolis.</b> <b>The</b> architectural style is similar to Palenque but made with bricks instead of stone. <b>The</b> Grand <b>Acropolis</b> is <b>the</b> most important group of monumental buildings, which are also the tallest. There is a site museum with ceramics and other pieces on display.|$|R
25|$|Yaxchilan {{flourished in}} the 8th and 9th centuries. The site {{contains}} impressive ruins, with palaces and temples bordering a large plaza upon a terrace above the Usumacinta River. The architectural remains extend across the higher terraces and the hills {{to the south of}} the river, overlooking both the river itself and the lowlands beyond. Yaxchilan is known for the large quantity of excellent sculpture at the site, such as the monolithic carved stelae and the narrative stone reliefs carved on lintels spanning the temple doorways. Over 120 inscriptions have been identified on the various monuments from the site. The major groups are <b>the</b> Central <b>Acropolis,</b> <b>the</b> West <b>Acropolis</b> and <b>the</b> South <b>Acropolis.</b> <b>The</b> South <b>Acropolis</b> occupies <b>the</b> highest part of the site. The site is aligned with relation to the Usumacinta River, at times causing unconventional orientation of the major structures, such as the two ballcourts.|$|R
5|$|The Palace of the Underworld is entered via three step-vaulted arches on {{the eastern}} side of the second terrace of <b>the</b> <b>Acropolis.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>acropolis</b> is also {{distinguished}} {{by a great}} quantity of graffiti inscribed onto the stucco interior walls of its rooms, some of which display a considerable level of artistic skill. The graffiti is believed to date to the last phase of occupation of <b>the</b> <b>acropolis,</b> during the Early Postclassic, and includes local fauna and human figures, {{some of which are}} playing musical instruments. Animals depicted in the graffiti include a deer, a turtle and a frog. Two human figures are depicted playing flutes, while other subjects include pyramid temples, courtly scenes, vulvas and supernatural beings.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the eastern side of <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> has been eroded away by the Copán River, although the river has since been diverted {{in order to protect the}} site from further damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> East <b>Acropolis</b> is on <b>the</b> {{east side}} of the city centre, to the south of the Twin Pyramid Complex. It {{occupies}} the highest area of the city and is surrounded by Plazas A, B and C. The area that was to become occupied by <b>the</b> East <b>Acropolis</b> was first levelled from the limestone bedrock in the Middle Preclassic. In the Preclassic <b>the</b> East <b>Acropolis</b> was laid out as a triadic pyramid complex but was radically modified during the Early Classic. In its final form <b>the</b> East <b>Acropolis</b> formed a closed complex with twelve structures covering a total area of 8100 m2. The main buildings of <b>the</b> East <b>Acropolis</b> were Structure 216, a pyramid-temple, and Structure 218, a palace. <b>The</b> East <b>Acropolis</b> plaza featured a west-facing monumental stairway built in the Late Preclassic and remodelled in the Late Classic. The first version of the temple was built in the Late Preclassic, while the earliest version of the palace dates to the Early Classic. <b>The</b> East <b>Acropolis</b> appears to have been temporarily abandoned {{at the end of the}} Early Classic due to destruction caused by an earthquake, but was reoccupied and developed during the course of the Late Classic. During the Terminal Classic (9th century AD) great quanitites of ash and domestic ceramics were deposited in <b>the</b> East <b>Acropolis.</b> At this time a small platform was built against Structure 219, which blocked access to the southwestern terrace of the complex.|$|R
50|$|Excavations {{focused on}} five smaller {{buildings}} adjacent to <b>the</b> South <b>Acropolis</b> {{in order to}} determine the presence attached specialists; TDP begins stabilization of <b>the</b> South <b>Acropolis.</b> Four burials and a collapsed Protoclassic chultun were also recovered.|$|R

The site is relatively natural with howling monkeys, bats, toucans and other wildlife to be seen in and around the buildings.|$|R
5|$|After this victory, an Argive army came to Corinth, and, seizing <b>the</b> <b>acropolis,</b> {{effected}} {{the merger}} of Argos and Corinth. The border stones between Argos and Corinth were torn down, and the citizen bodies of the two cities were merged.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of pigment traces {{from the}} south range of <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> were {{carried out by the}} Polytechnic University of Valencia, they {{revealed}} a preference for mineral and vegetable pigments of local origin, perhaps collected from the nearby El Camalote hill.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{artefacts}} excavated from <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> {{date from}} {{the transition from the}} Terminal Classic Period to the Early Postclassic, when the surrounding population appears to have occupied the abandoned palace. Excavations of the south range of <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> uncovered a great many potsherds (roughly 11,000) dating to the Terminal Classic, and about 150 pieces dating to the Early Postclassic. In the same building 150 stone artefacts were excavated together with hundreds of fragments of waste chippings. Fifteen incomplete ceramic figurines were also found, including zoomorphic figures and elite human figures with elaborate headdresses. One of these figurines was a whistle in the shape of an owl, identical to another found in an excavated rubbish heap in <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> courtyard. Both of these owl-shaped whistles are very similar to a larger whistle found at Yaxha. A number of artefacts were recovered from the threshold of Room 3 of the south range, including a complete terminal classic ceramic vessel, a flint knife, some broken figurine fragments and some lithic fragments. In the area of the threshold of Room 4 in the south range a complete Early Postclassic tripod plate was recovered. Within Room 4 itself were found a further 70 broken pieces of Terminal Classic ceramics and 232 pieces dated to the Early Postclassic, and a greenstone axe among other finds. Many of the Postclassic fragments were from a tripod pitcher with zoomorph supports that archaeologists were largely able to reconstruct. Additionally, 798 Terminal Classic ceramic fragments were found during the exploration of the terraces immediately south of <b>the</b> <b>acropolis,</b> together with stone chippings and pieces of animal bones.|$|E

5|$|Pits sunk {{within the}} {{courtyard}} of <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> revealed 5425 ceramic fragments, 22 fragments of zoomorphic figurines, together with stone and shell artefacts, animal bones and waste flint chips, all dated to the Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterwards, at {{the dawn}} of the Postclassic, {{immediately}} after the Classic Maya collapse, <b>the</b> <b>acropolis</b> was reoccupied by refugees from the periphery of the city. These final occupants appear to have abandoned the city some time in the 11th century AD, after which it was never reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|Stela P was {{originally}} erected in an unknown location {{and was later}} moved to the West Court of <b>the</b> <b>Acropolis.</b> It bears a long hieroglyphic text {{that has not yet}} been fully deciphered. It dates from the reign of king K'ak' Chan Yopaat and was dedicated in AD623.|$|E

5|$|Structure 10L-25 {{is in the}} East Court of <b>the</b> <b>Acropolis.</b> It {{covers a}} rich royal tomb nicknamed Sub-Jaguar by archaeologists. It is presumed to be the tomb of either Ruler7 (B'alam Nehn), Ruler8 or Ruler9, who all ruled {{in the first half}} of the 6thcentury AD.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>acropolis</b> {{buildings}} contain inscribed graffiti {{dating to}} the last phase of occupation in the Early Postclassic, including human and animal figures, deities, temples and courtly scenes.
