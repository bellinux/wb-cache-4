5|$|In mid-June 1941, the {{division}} received new orders to relocate. The 16th Panzer Division crossed the German–Polish border at Groß Wartenberg heading for Ożarów at the Vistula, which was reached on 19 June 1941. The German soldiers initially believed that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> going to transit through Russia, {{on their way}} to the Middle East where they would link up with Erwin Rommel's Afrika Corps. But Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Walther von Reichenau, who visited his son, a Leutnant in the 4th company of Panzer-Regiment 2, revealed to them the true objective of the next campaign. It would be Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of equites cohortales (the cavalry arm of cohortes equitatae), as expounded by G.L. Cheesman, {{was that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> a mounted infantry with poor-quality horses. They would use their mounts simply {{to reach the}} battlefield and then would dismount to fight. This view is today discredited. Although {{it is clear that}} equites cohortales did not match equites alares (ala cavalrymen) in quality (hence their lower pay), the evidence is that they fought as cavalry {{in the same way as}} the alares and often alongside them. Their armour and weapons were the same as for the alares.|$|E

5|$|Kriegseisen {{notes that}} the {{institution}} of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The stereotype of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>just</b> that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.|$|E

25|$|After the {{successful}} Bolshevik coup of November 1917, the Petrograd newspapers published a decree summoning all the Romanovs {{to report to}} the dreaded Cheka, the secret police.

Merlo arrived in the Mexican capital with a fake Uruguayan passport, where he soon realized that the Mexican security forces were following him.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's # 21 to new pitcher Jason Marquis, {{despite the fact}} that it was {{formerly}} worn by Sosa, who coincidentally later hit his 600th home run against Marquis.
