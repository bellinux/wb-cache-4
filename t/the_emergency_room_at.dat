5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He {{was placed in the}} back of the van, on his stomach, and taken to <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E

25|$|On April 30, 2010, <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> St. Vincent's closed, officially {{shuttering}} {{the hospital}} after 161 years. Hospital administrators said that the vote to close came after a six-month-long effort to save the financially troubled institution, but August 21, 2011, prosecutors with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office {{were reported to have}} launched an investigation to determine whether administrators intentionally ran St. Vincent's into the ground. The remaining parts of Saint Vincent Catholic Medical Centers, including its nursing homes, home health agency, St. Vincent's Hospital Westchester, and US Family Health Plan, were to continue to operate without interruption, but these entities were sold to other providers' systems.|$|E

The new services include a consolidated resuscitation center {{on the fifth floor}} with four dedicated beds and a camera monitoring system, as well as instant x-rays and electronic lab results. The expansion was coupled with a $14 million remodel to the first-floor emergency department, which added 12 private beds to the facility for a grand total of 36.|$|E

25|$|The park entertained {{over one}} million {{visitors}} per year, {{with as many as}} 12,000 coming on some of the busiest weekends. Park officials said this made the injury and death rate statistically insignificant. Nevertheless, the director of <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> a nearby hospital said they treated from five to ten victims of park accidents on some of the busiest days, and the park eventually bought the township of Vernon extra ambulances {{to keep up with the}} volume. In September 1989, Great American Recreation negotiated a deal with International Broadcasting Corporation that would result in the sale of Vernon Valley-Great Gorge, and Action Park, for $50 million. IBC, however, backed out of the deal, feeling the site was not suitable for their needs upon further inspections of the properties.|$|E

500|$|Lennon was {{pronounced}} dead on arrival in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> the Roosevelt Hospital at 11:15 pm by Dr. Lynn, but the time of 11:07 pm has also been reported. Lennon's body was then taken to the city morgue at 520 First Avenue and autopsied. The {{cause of death was}} reported on his death certificate as [...] "hypovolemic shock, caused by the loss of more than 80% of blood volume due to multiple through-and-through gunshot wounds to the left shoulder and left chest resulting in damage to the left lung and left subclavian artery and aortic arch". The pathologist who performed the autopsy on Lennon also stated in his report that even with prompt medical treatment, no person could have lived {{for more than a few}} minutes with such multiple bullet injuries to all of the major arteries and veins around the heart.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Stephan Lynn, {{head of the}} Emergency Department, who {{had been}} called in again after having just {{returned}} home after a 13-hour-long work shift, received Lennon in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> <b>at</b> Roosevelt Hospital {{a few minutes before}} 11:00 pm, when Officers Frauenberger and Moran arrived, with Moran carrying Lennon on his back from their squad car and onto a gurney, into the emergency room demanding a doctor for a multiple gunshot wound victim. When Lennon arrived, he had no pulse and was not breathing. Dr. Lynn, two other doctors, a nurse, and two or three other medical attendants worked on Lennon for 10 to 15 minutes {{in a desperate attempt to}} resuscitate him. As a last resort, Dr. Lynn cut open Lennon's chest and attempted manual heart massage to restore circulation, but he quickly discovered that the damage to the blood vessels above and around Lennon's heart from the multiple bullet wounds was too great.|$|E

[...] An emergency room nurse, Magalie Laurent, suspecting the nature of Louima's extreme injuries were {{not the result of}} homosexual sex, notified Louima's family and the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau of the likelihood of sexual assault and battery. The attack left Louima with severe internal damage to his colon and bladder that required three major operations to repair. He was hospitalized for two months after the incident.|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} retrospective, comparative {{analyses of}} contamination rates for cultures of blood obtained in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> of Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; Lilongwe Central Hospital (LCH) in central Malawi; and the Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) in the United States. None of <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> patients had indwelling intravascular devices {{at the time}} that the blood samples for cultures were obtained. In addition, we reviewed the contamination rates for a cohort of patients already hospitalized in the DUMC inpatient medical service, most of whom had indwelling intravascular devices. The bloodstream infection rates among the patients at MNH (n = 513) and LCH (n = 486) were similar (∼ 28 %); the contamination rates at the two hospitals were 1. 3 % (7 / 513) and 0. 8 % (4 / 486), respectively. Of 54 microorganisms isolated from cultures of blood collected in <b>the</b> DUMC <b>emergency</b> <b>room,</b> 26 (48 %) were identified as skin contaminants. Cultures of blood collected in <b>the</b> DUMC <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> were significantly more likely to yield growth of contaminants than the cultures of blood collected in <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>at</b> MNH and LCH combined (26 / 332 versus 11 / 1, 003; P < 0. 0001) or collected in the DUMC inpatient medical service (26 / 332 versus 7 / 283; P < 0. 01). For the MNH and LCH blood cultures, lower contamination rates were observed when skin was disinfected with isopropyl alcohol plus tincture of iodine rather than isopropyl alcohol plus povidone-iodine. In conclusion, blood culture contamination was minimized in sub-Saharan African hospitals with substantially limited resources through scrupulous attention to aseptic skin cleansing and improved venipuncture techniques. Application of these principles when blood samples for culture are obtained in U. S. hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>rooms</b> should help mitigate blood culture contamination rates and the unnecessary microbiology workup of skin contaminants...|$|R

30|$|The CPR {{protocol}} in our institution {{was based}} on the guidelines of the American Heart Association in 2005 (Deasy et al. 2011). All of the patients with cardiac arrest received closed cardiac compression and positive pressure ventilation by paramedics. After they reached <b>the</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>room</b> (ER) <b>at</b> our hospital, our advanced CPR procedures were performed. A central venous line was inserted by the right subclavian approach and connected to acetated Ringer’s solution. Initially, epinephrine (1  mg) was administered intravenously every 3  minutes and CPR was continued for longer than 30  minutes in the patients without ROSC. However, the termination of CPR and the doses of epinephrine and the Ringer solution were determined by the ER physicians in charge.|$|R
