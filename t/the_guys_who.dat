25|$|As a cricketer he was {{the most}} talented player of my time, a guy who had {{extraordinary}} talents in every facet of cricket. In hindsight he probably didn't reach the heights that he should have, based on his cricket ability, but <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> played with him and against him will recognise he was a fantastic player, who was dynamic in anything he did in cricket. When he was on he was unplayable. He bowled a swinging ball, he could hit the ball a mile, throw it like a bullet and he was a fantastic catcher either close to the wicket or in the outfield – a supreme cricketer. He was a very popular person, Gus, a bit of a larrikin and very much liked by everyone. He didn't take life all that seriously, played for the enjoyment of it.|$|E
500|$|I {{think the}} {{standard}} of our cricket was really good. We were up to the mark in the finals. We lost as a team. There were a few errors in batting and bowling.

That's what sport is all about. the response from our team was great. even <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> didn't get a chance were completely behind the team. So the spirit was great." ...|$|E

[...] In her book, Food Lovers' Guide to Portland, Oregon: The Best Restaurants, Markets and Local Culinary Offerings (2014), Laurie Wolf wrote: [...] "I like The Parish.

500|$|In March 1969, Maryland {{athletic}} director Jim Kehoe called a meeting among 120 players, Ward, his assistants, and a three-man committee. Thirty-one players told Ward {{that they no}} longer wished to play on the team and accused him of using intimidation tactics that included verbal and physical abuse. Ward listened to the player's grievances, but did not respond at the time. Two days later, he resigned as head coach. Later that year, Sports Illustrated interviewed Ward, and he said:"I won't go into all the specifics, but it wasn't the good players who started it. It was <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, guys who sat on the bench and couldn't take it and a couple of pip-squeak cub newspaper guys who don't know what football's all about...He gets on the campus newspaper {{and all of a sudden}} he's got power he never thought of having." ...|$|E
500|$|Pausch {{then went}} to the first part of his speech, {{explaining}} his childhood dreams and how he accomplished (or tried to accomplish) them. Pausch first explained his childhood, as well as his family life in the 1960s. Pausch stated that he had a [...] "really good childhood", and, when going back through his family archive of photographs, had never found a picture of him not smiling. Some of these pictures were shown on the projection as slides, including one of him dreaming. He explained how he was inspired by the Apollo 11 lunar landing in 1969. Pausch then transitioned to a slide which contained a list of his childhood dreams, and explained them. His dreams were being in zero gravity, playing in the National Football League, being the author of a World Book Encyclopedia article, being Captain Kirk, being [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> won the big stuffed animals in the amusement park", and becoming a Disney Imagineer.|$|E

500|$|Gabriel Luna, who portrays Reyes, {{explained}} {{at the end}} of October 2016 {{that the}} confrontation between his character and the last member of the Fifth Street Locos gang in the episode [...] "Lockup" [...] revealed to Reyes that the accident that caused him to become Ghost Rider [...] "wasn’t just random, it was a hit, somebody ordered that, these guys were just <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> carried it out—there’s a whole batch of new questions that Robbie has after that. In episode 6, we’re going to find out exactly how it happened, and we may find out why later." [...] Luna said that the series' take on Reyes' origin story would mix elements from Felipe Smith's original comic with [...] "this new angle that we’re approaching from, but that new angle still draws from the source material." [...] He also felt the episode's approach to revealing the story, by having Reyes tell it to his brother Gabe for the first time, was [...] "really interesting and powerful" [...] and the most surprising aspect of the script for him.|$|E
500|$|Davies {{believed}} that Lee's film did not overcome [...] "the problem of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> get the girls not seeming quite good enough", {{and set out}} {{to try to find a}} way of making them into heroes in his script. He said that Austen should have made the reader feel that Edward was worthy of Elinor and explained how Marianne falls in love with Colonel Brandon, after having her heart broken by Willoughby. The writer increased the male roles, so they could be turned into stronger characters. Davies told Hill that the team [...] "worked very hard" [...] on the men. Brandon is seen rescuing people and doing a lot of fast horse riding, while Edward was given a wood-chopping scene where he vents his frustrations about his engagement. Davies also made the Dashwood sisters younger and [...] "more vulnerable" [...] than how they were portrayed in Lee's film. Hattie Morahan, who portrayed Elinor in the drama, stated, [...] "We are trying to play the story as it was written. In the novel the girls are 19 and 17, so these romantic relationships are real rites of passage for them." ...|$|E
500|$|The fictional company Isodyne Energy, who is {{involved}} with nuclear testing in the desert, {{was influenced by the}} real life 1940s companies such as Radiodyne, General Atomic or the beginnings of the Jet Propulsion Lab, [...] "all of which were in L.A. in the '40s, and were developing the space program and were developing nukes." [...] Additionally, the season avoids depicting real life Hollywood stars from the 1940s because [...] "the focus would shift from story to: does that person look or sound like an actor?" [...] Instead, the character Whitney Frost is depicted as an actress [...] "who will have a part to play in our larger storyline." [...] The season introduces the Council of Nine, based on the Secret Empire, who [...] "meet at the Arena Club, which is like this social club of white guys. They're just <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> sort of run the world. They have orchestrated assassinations. We insinuate that they orchestrated the 1929 Stock Market crash." [...] Members of the Council include powerful businessmen Calvin Chadwick and Hugh Jones, and their influence extends to [...] "high levels of the government" [...] as seen with War Department veteran Vernon Masters. Despite close similarities between the 'A' symbol of the Arena Club and a Hydra symbol introduced in the third season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Fazekas stated that she [...] "would not say" [...] there was a connection between the Council and Hydra.|$|E

500|$|The film {{takes place}} {{simultaneously}} with {{the events of}} The Incredible Hulk and Iron Man 2, the latter of which is set {{six months after the}} events of Iron Man, Clark Gregg, who appeared in Iron Man and Iron Man 2 as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, reprised the role in Thor. About his role in Thor he stated, [...] "Agent Coulson was one of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>who</b> wasn't really in the comic books, and he [...] a very kind of small role in Iron Man. And I was just very lucky that they chose to expand that character and [...] to put him more into the universe of it." [...] After signing on to appear as Clint Barton / Hawkeye in The Avengers, Jeremy Renner made a cameo appearance as the character during a scene in Thor. Branagh said that they [...] "were always going to have a guy in a basket above the action where Thor breaks in the S.H.I.E.L.D. camp", and that he was thrilled when the producers told him they wanted to use Renner's Hawkeye for that role. The film ends with a post-credits scene featuring Loki, watching as Erik Selvig and Nick Fury discuss the Tesseract. The scene was directed by Joss Whedon, who directed The Avengers. Stellan Skarsgård, who played Selvig, said the scene was not included when he first read the screenplay for Thor, and that he was sent pages for the scene after agreeing to appear in The Avengers.|$|E
2500|$|An {{untitled}} record (typically {{known as}} LP5 or simply Autechre) followed in 1998.
