5|$|After {{a victory}} over Spen Valley District, the team {{travelled}} west to play Somersetshire, Devonshire, Taunton, and Gloucestershire, and won all five games. The victory over Somerset was the New Zealanders' largest of the tour; <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> nine tries in a 17–4 victory. Half-back Keogh played outstandingly for the Natives, while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition. Devonshire and Tauton suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders, before a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed. After defeating Midland Counties, the Natives returned to London.|$|E
5|$|Benfica {{played their}} last {{game of the}} season on 1 June at home against Vitória Guimarães, winning 4–0; Féher scored a hat-trick.

Simão was the joint highest scorer in the Primeira Liga, with 18 goals, equal to Beira-Mar's Faye Fary; the latter took the Bola de Prata award due to having played fewer games.|$|E
5|$|Each club {{needed to}} get past four rounds to reach the final. Chelsea made {{comfortable}} progress; <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> 12 goals while conceding only one to Wycombe Wanderers in the semi-final. Arsenal fielded a relatively young team throughout the competition; their wins against fellow league opponents Liverpool in the fifth-round and Tottenham Hotspur in the semis were acclaimed by the British press. Chelsea entered the match as favourites and were undefeated against Arsenal in all competitions since 2004.|$|E

25|$|If a batsman {{has been}} {{dismissed}} {{in every single}} innings, then their total number of runs scored divided {{by the number of}} times they have been out gives exactly the average number of runs <b>they</b> <b>score</b> per innings. However, for a batsman with innings which have finished not out, this statistic is only an estimate of the average number of runs <b>they</b> <b>score</b> per innings – the true average number of runs <b>they</b> <b>score</b> per innings is unknown as it is not known how many runs <b>they</b> would have <b>scored</b> if <b>they</b> could have completed all their not out innings. If their scores have a geometric distribution then total number of runs scored divided by the number of times out is the maximum likelihood estimate of their true unknown average.|$|R

5|$|The day {{following}} the MVP award, the Colts played their 2007 nemesis, the Chargers, in their wild-card playoff game. Down 14–10 at the half, Manning put the Colts ahead 17–14 {{in the third}} quarter as he completed a 72-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Reggie Wayne.

5|$|After her commissioning, {{she served}} with the II Scouting Group, part of the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She was assigned to patrols off the island of Heligoland at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914. At the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers. Mainz was initially stationed {{in support of the}} forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered a much stronger force of British cruisers and destroyers. <b>They</b> <b>scored</b> several damaging hits with gunfire and a torpedo that disabled Mainz and prompted her commander to abandon ship. The British rescued 348 men from the crew before the ship rolled over and sank. Eighty-nine men were killed in the battle, including her commanding officer.|$|E

50|$|Some teams play a {{strategy}} of ensuring that <b>they</b> <b>score</b> points every time they get close to their opponents' 22-metre line.

5|$|China {{won their}} fifth {{gold medal in}} the women's event and the first since 2004 after winning the silver medal in the last three Olympiads. <b>They</b> <b>scored</b> 20 match points with nine wins and two draws, {{finishing}} three points ahead of Poland and Ukraine who scored 17 match points each. Poland won the silver medal after winning the tie-breaker with Ukraine. The defending champions from the previous three Olympiads Russia finished without a medal on the fourth place after losing the decisive match for the gold medal against China in the final round. Vietnam, Azerbaijan and Israel have all surprised positively, finishing on the seventh, eighth and the ninth place, respectively. The teams that disappointed with their place in the final standings include Georgia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Germany, Spain and Turkey.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the Kop {{had been}} {{redesigned}} and extended to hold 30,000 spectators, all standing. At the time, the Kop {{was the biggest}} football stand in the country, able to hold more spectators than the entire capacity of some grounds. The increase in spectators did not fully restore Liverpool's fortunes; <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> 90 goals during the 1928–29 season, striker Gordon Hodgson scoring thirty of them, yet finished in fifth place. McQueen was unable to replicate his early triumphs with the club, and retired in 1928 after his leg was amputated following a road accident. He was replaced as manager by club secretary George Patterson. The club's fortunes did not improve under Patterson's leadership; they generally finished midtable. Their results were inconsistent; in September 1930, they lost 7–0 at West Ham United, yet nine days later they beat Bolton Wanderers 7–2 at Anfield.|$|E
5|$|In Euro 2008 qualifying, Andorra again lost every game. The closest {{game was}} against Russia, a 1–0 defeat on 21 November 2007.

Andorra scored only two goals and conceded 42 {{in a total of}} 12 games. In 2010 World Cup qualifying, Andorra lost all ten matches. For the tournament, <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> three goals, in defeats to Belarus and Kazakhstan, and conceded 39 goals, including six in a defeat to England, the largest margin in the group.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes, {{competition}} ranking is done {{by leaving}} the gaps in the ranking numbers before the sets of equal-ranking items (rather than after them as in standard competition ranking). The number of ranking numbers that are left out in this gap remains one less {{than the number of}} items that compared equal. Equivalently, each item's ranking number is equal to the number of items ranked equal to it or above it. This ranking ensures that a competitor only comes second if <b>they</b> <b>score</b> higher than all but one of their opponents, third if <b>they</b> <b>score</b> higher than all but two of their opponents, etc.|$|R
50|$|Houses {{are also}} {{instrumental}} {{in determining the}} size of their keep: a player places a keep marker upon completion of their first house, and then moves the marker to every subsequent larger house that <b>they</b> <b>score.</b> If multiple features are completed, <b>they</b> may be <b>scored</b> in any order - the order of which, unlike other Carcassonne games, is significant.|$|R
5|$|In {{a rematch}} against the B.A.C. {{a month later}} at Lakeview Park in Birmingham, Alabama lost their second {{game of the season}} by a final score of 10–8. After they trailed 4–0 {{at the end of the}} first half, Alabama scored their first points of the season on a William Walker {{touchdown}} run early in the second half and tied the game 4–4. The Athletics retook a 10–4 lead when <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> a touchdown and converted the extra point, but then Walker scored his second touchdown of the game that made the final score 10–8 after a missed extra point. The second loss against the B.A.C. marked the only time in Alabama football history the same team defeated the Crimson Tide twice in the same season.|$|E
5|$|In {{a three-day}} match {{starting}} on Thursday, 15 August, the England XI defeated Gloucestershire at The Oval by 6 wickets after Grace {{had won the}} toss for his county and decided to bat. <b>They</b> <b>scored</b> 118 (Grace 25) and England replied with 163 (Grace 3–67). Rain prevented play {{for most of the}} Friday and Gloucestershire in their second innings had reached 27–1 {{at the end of the}} day. On the Saturday, England bowled them out for 118 (Grace 29) with Tom Emmett taking 8–51 (12–93 in the match). Grace took 3–39 in England's second innings as they made 7–44 to win by six wickets. Midwinter suffered a hand injury in the field when he attempted to stop a powerful drive played by George Ulyett; he was unable to play again in 1878.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, Bolton {{had their first}} trip, and their first game against top-flight opposition, facing Liverpool at Anfield on 3 December. Jardel scored the first goal within five minutes, with Danny Murphy {{equalising}} with 20 minutes remaining. Youri Djorkaeff would have put Bolton back into the lead, but referee Mike Riley disallowed it for an earlier handball; <b>they</b> <b>scored</b> minutes later from Jay-Jay Okocha's free kick. Liverpool got a second equaliser from a 25-yard Vladimír Šmicer strike, but with a minute remaining Salif Diao fouled Kevin Davies in the penalty area and Djorkaeff sent the resulting spot-kick past Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek to win the game. Thirteen days later, in extra time at home to the Premier League's Southampton, Pedersen volleyed the only goal with five minutes remaining.|$|E
50|$|The {{winner of}} the semi-final round, then goes forward to the final. They are given a choice of five songs and can sing at maximum three of them. For the first song, they'll score 40 or more to win £5,000, the second song is worth £25,000 if <b>they</b> <b>score</b> 60 or higher, and the third song is worth the £50,000 jackpot, if <b>they</b> <b>score</b> 80 or more. After {{the second and third}} songs, the finalist is given the choice to take the money they've got at that stage or gamble. If they gamble and fail to reach the score target, they'll leave with nothing.|$|R
5000|$|Scoring {{varies from}} place to place. The most common version is that after a game each player with cards {{remaining}} scores -1 point for each, unless they have 10 or more remaining, in which <b>they</b> <b>score</b> -2 for each. If they didn't get to play any cards at all, <b>they</b> <b>score</b> -3 for each. Then {{the winner of the}} hand scores +1 for every -1 his opponents got. (So, for example, if North won, and East, West, and South respectively still had 3, 11, and 8 cards left, East would score -3, West would score -22, South would score -8, and North would score +33.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a variant}} {{described}} as [...] "piggybacking" [...] or [...] "high-stakes", each player {{after the first}} can choose to begin their turn either with a fresh set of six dice, or by throwing the dice remaining after the previous player has completed their turn. For example, if a player banks three 1's for a score of 1000, the next player may choose to roll the remaining three dice. If <b>they</b> <b>score</b> at least one die, <b>they</b> <b>score</b> 1000 plus whatever additional <b>score</b> <b>they</b> accumulate. Players may thus assume the greater risk of farkling for the chance of scoring the points already accumulated by the player before them. If a player ends their turn on a [...] "hot dice", the next player may [...] "piggyback" [...] using all six dice.|$|R
