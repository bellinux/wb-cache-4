5|$|Qatar Radio (QR) is {{currently}} an associate {{member of the}} European Broadcasting Union (EBU), while all competing countries of the Eurovision Song Contest must be active members of the Union. The broadcaster first revealed on 12 May 2009 that {{they were interested in}} becoming active members of the Union, which would allow the nation to compete in the Contest. Qatar Radio has stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to join Eurovision by 2011.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most {{recently}} built coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, but with a generating capacity of only 420megawatts (MW), is now one of the smallest operating. Two separate wind farm plans currently have permission to be built near the station, one for a 13 turbine wind farm near the smelter and another three turbine wind farm to the north of the station. In 2009, Alcan announced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to fit the station with carbon capture and storage technology. In 2011, it was announced that the power station may be converted to burn biomass only, in a bid to avoid government legislation. In January 2016 the station was purchased by Energetický a průmyslový holding (EPH).|$|E
5|$|In the Second Phase, events play in vaguely {{the same}} fashion, {{but there are}} minor variations: Lorica forms an {{alliance}} with Milites rather than being conquered, and while Concordia offers an alliance, Imperial sympathizers within Concordia orchestrate the Queen's death and ally with Concordia. After overcoming Lorica and Concordia, the Rubrum forces storm the Militesi capital and Cid is killed. Before dying, he warns the Cadet and his comrades of the Crystals' role in Orience's cycle. When Tempus Finis arrives, Ace goes alone to find the one mentioned by Cid. He is himself marked as a l'Cie and transformed into Judge Ace. As with the previous cycle, he is defeated, but Tempus Finis arrives and the cycle continues. In a final side story episode, various additional stories revolving around the main cast are revealed. Among the events presented are a talk between Myuria and Arecia as to whether to continue the experiment, and then Lean and Tono are chosen by Arecia to exist outside the cycle and retain their memories. In this new form, the two agree to gather the memories of Orience's people {{and find a way}} of liberating the world from its cycle. The story ends with them wishing the Cadet well, saying <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to meet them again in a future cycle.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{good deal}} of {{interest}} in the 2004 transit as scientists attempted to measure the pattern of light dimming as Venus blocked out some of the Sun's light, in order to refine techniques <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to use in searching for extrasolar planets. Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing. Measuring light intensity {{during the course of a}} transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets. However, extremely precise measurement is needed: for example, the transit of Venus causes the amount of light received from the Sun to drop by a fraction of 0.001 (that is, to 99.9% of its nominal value), and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny.|$|E

50|$|There is {{some concern}} about the twins' {{continued}} good health, because only four known sets of conjoined twins who share an undivided torso and two legs have ever survived into adulthood, and most have congenital heart defects or other organ anomalies. None have shown up in their case. They intensely dislike being stared at or photographed by strangers while going about their private lives. In interviews for the Discovery Channel in 2006, they, then 16, said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> to date, get married, and have children. <b>They</b> also stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>that</b> by providing some information about themselves, {{they would be able}} to lead otherwise fairly typical social lives.|$|R

25|$|UNICA, a Brazilian ethanol {{producers}} association, {{welcomed the}} ruling and commented <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> {{the classification of}} Brazilian sugarcane ethanol as an advanced biofuel will contribute to influence {{those who seek to}} lift the trade barriers imposed against clean energy, both in the U.S. {{and the rest of the}} world. EPA's final ruling is expected to benefit Brazilian producers, as the blending mandate requires an increasing quota of advanced biofuels, which is not likely to be fulfill with cellulosic ethanol, and then it would force blenders to import more Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, despite the existing 54¢ per gallon tariff on ethanol imported directly from Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The {{solution}} of Domokos and Várkonyi has curved edges and resembles a sphere with a squashed top. In the top figure, it rests in its stable equilibrium. Its unstable equilibrium position is obtained by rotating the figure 180° about a horizontal axis. Theoretically, it will rest there, but the smallest perturbation will {{bring it back}} to the stable point. The mathematical gömböc has indeed sphere-like properties. In particular its flatness and thinness are minimal, and this is the only type of nondegenerate object with this property. Domokos and Várkonyi are interested to find a polyhedral solution with the surface consisting of a minimal number of flat planes. Therefore, they offer a prize to anyone who finds such solution, which amounts to $10,000 divided by the number of planes in the solution. Obviously, one can approximate their curvilinear gömböc with a finite number of discrete surfaces, however, their estimate is it will take thousands of planes to achieve <b>that.</b> <b>They</b> <b>hope,</b> by offering this prize, to stimulate finding a radically different solution from their own.|$|E
500|$|Rita Skeeter, the {{journalist}} played by Miranda Richardson in Goblet of Fire, was also removed.

2500|$|Optional {{ingredients}} can {{be added}} to the drink, with its usage altering how much the drinker gets drunk. There are no dialogue options in VA-11 HALL-A, with the only interactivity being making clients' requested drinks. Most of the time, clients tell the player exactly what they want, though some can be more cryptic, for example by asking for a certain flavour. As such, VA-11 HALL-A contains nonlinear gameplay in the form of branching storylines, though it is dependent not on traditional choices but rather through the drinks the player prepares. There also exists a recipe book where the recipes to all drinks that can be made can be looked up. Sukeban Games says <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> the book, which was a requested feature in the game's prologue, would make the bartending [...] "feel more organic", as well as allowing players to experiment.|$|E

He wrote again from Santa Cruz, describing the events of the previous weeks including the discovery of a planned mutiny, and his admiration of Captain Phillip.
