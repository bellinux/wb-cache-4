5000|$|Being {{the last}} of his dynasty and an enemy of the Gelugpa hierarchs, the memory of Karma Tenkyong {{suffered}} from the damnation of later Gelugpa historians. He, and the previous Tsangpa rulers, were regarded as inherently evil and opposed to Buddhism, in spite of their well-attested patronage of the Karma Kagyu and Jonang sects. Contemporary clerical observers, such as Yolmo Tenzin Norbu, reacted angrily on his transgressions of the elaborate social hierarchy of Tibet, as he tried to forge a pretentious genealogy for his upstart family, going back to a disciple of Padmasambhava: [...] "He expects all to perform prostrations to him and raise up stacks of tea offerings. He even acts like that to our lama! He rejoices in his great qualities such as the power of his blessings and magical abilities. Yet, he was unable to humble himself regarding the height of the seat to the seats of the Karmapa, and so forth". Karma Tenkyong was known to his contemporaries for his hasty <b>temper,</b> <b>strength,</b> and audacious rashness, characteristics that incidentally were reminiscent of early Indian legends of Vajrapani, the deity he was believed to incarnate.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The double curvatures {{encountered}} in aerospace skin components require significant plastic strain levels to achieve final form. In {{order to obtain}} the required part geometry and final <b>temper</b> <b>strength,</b> while avoiding failure, multistage-processing is employed. For components that {{are more difficult to}} form this requires three stretching stages and two heat treatment processes. After the first forming stage the material is annealed, then formed to a second strain level, before solution heat treatment and final form. An experiment that replicates this processing route is presented. The results indicate that for all processing routes the material exhibits a significant change in texture as described by the r-values. Furthermore, the biggest strength increase is obtained when using the lowest total strain processing route. The formability of the processed material is shown to be less than the original fully annealed sheet, although there is little difference in the formability of the various processing routes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{pearlitic}} steels, hydrogen trapping at interphase boundaries {{may induce}} hydrogen- cracking {{in the absence}} of external applied stress such as in blistering and Hydrogen Induced Cracking. However, in low alloy steels containing a much lower density of such trapping sites and/or when hydrogen activity is reduced, most instances of hydrogen-induced cracking involve strong interactions between local plasticity and hydrogen effects. We investigated the effects of these variables on the crack growth rate in two quenched and <b>tempered</b> high <b>strength</b> low alloy (HSLA) steels. Slow strain rate tensile and low-amplitude cyclic tests were conducted on micro-notched specimen in conditions of variable hydrogen activity. The results indicate a strong dependence of crack growth rate with the tempering {{on the one hand and}} both the notch-tip plastic zone and hydrogen activity on the other.

The {{relationship}} between microstructure and cleavage resistance in quenched and <b>tempered</b> high <b>strength</b> bainitic and martensitic steels is investigated {{by means of}} Charpy-V three-point bending tests, uniaxial tensile test on unnotched specimens and EBSD. Steels under investigation are low/medium carbon (C= 0. 10 %- 0. 40 %) steels with yield strength in the range YS= 500 - 1000 MPa. Results show that the tensile strength and the cleavage resistance of Q&T steels appear {{to be controlled by}} different structural parameters and not, {{as in the case of}} polygonal ferritic steels, by the same structural unit. In particular, yield strength is controlled by the mean subgrain size, whereas the structural unit controlling the critical cleavage stress is the covariant (bainitic or martensitic) packet, whose size is slightly lower than the average unit crack path (UCP). The critical stage in the fracture process appears to be the propagation of a Griffith crack from one packet to another, and the resistance offered by high-angle boundaries is approximately the same as that of low-C steels with bainitic or polygonal ferrite microstructure...|$|R
