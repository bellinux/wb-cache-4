[She sits and turns to Mrs Gilbey] Bobby's given me the squiffer. [To the company generally] Do you know what <b>theyve</b> <b>been</b> doing downstairs? [She goes off into ecstasies of mirth]. Youd never guess. <b>Theyve</b> <b>been</b> trying to teach me table manners. The Lieutenant and Rudolph say I'm a regular pig. I'm sure I never knew there was anything wrong with me.

5000|$|Baker and Martin devised for Doctor Who {{the robotic}} dog K-9 (created for The Invisible Enemy), the renegade Time Lord Omega (created for The Three Doctors, Doctor Whos 10th anniversary story) and the Axons. K-9 was {{originally}} intended to appear in one story only, but the BBC decided {{to make it a}} recurring character. [...] Several of Bakers stories had elements of hard science not often found in Doctor Who, even though <b>theyve</b> also <b>been</b> criticised for scientific inaccuracy. Together with Martin, they also created fantasy television serials for children including Sky (1975).|$|R

5000|$|In an April 2003 article, Miller, ostensibly on {{the basis}} of {{statements}} from the military unit in which she was embedded, reported claims allegedly made by an Iraqi scientist that Iraq had kept biological and chemical weapons until [...] "right before the invasion." [...] This report was widely repeated in the press. Miller went on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer and stated: Well, I think they found something more than a smoking gun.

The Sun confirmed this to The Mail, saying that they had not made public certain sections of the recording, [...] "for fear of damaging Diana irreparably." [...] "All the reporters in London seem to know whats on that tape," [...] complained Reenan, [...] "and <b>theyve</b> all <b>been</b> to me to confirm it.

5000|$|Writing for web {{magazine}} Popboks, Đorđe Bajić opines that [...] "despite {{being promoted}} as a provocative political film, {{its hard to}} imagine Ustanička ulica generating any kind of political discussion", adding: [...] "Yes, there are politics in this movie, but <b>theyve</b> largely <b>been</b> marginalized and pushed to the side. Additionally, the films politics have downright been rendered inconsequential by the screenplay gaffes". He further praises Miroslav Terzićs direction and Fehmius portrayal of Mićun/Sredoje, but has big problems with the [...] "films second-rate screenplay that seriously erodes its overall credibility", saying: [...] "Its hard to believe such an ambitious film even went into production with a script full of glaring dramaturgical oversights and uneven parts, including one unbelievable and unnecessary coincidence, forced parallelism, numerous naivetés, mishandled characters, two-bit dialogues..." ...|$|R

5000|$|Lactococcus lactis is a Gram-positive {{bacterium}} {{used extensively}} {{in the production of}} buttermilk and cheese, but has also become famous as the first genetically modified organism to be used alive for the treatment of human disease. L. lactis cells are cocci that group in pairs and short chains, and, depending on growth conditions, appear ovoid with a typical length of 0.5 - 1.5 µm. L. lactis does not produce spores (nonsporulating) and are not motile (nonmotile). They have a homofermentative metabolism, meaning they produce lactic acid from sugars. <b>Theyve</b> aso <b>been</b> reported to produce exclusive L-(+)-lactic acid. However, reported D-(−)-lactic acid can be produced when cultured at low pH. The capability to produce lactic acid {{is one of the reasons}} why L. lactis is one of the most important microorganisms in the dairy industry. Based on its history in food fermentation, L. lactis has generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status [...] with few case reports of being an opportunistic pathogen.|$|R

5000|$|Below Stairs {{was one of}} a wave {{of working-class}} memoirs {{beginning}} in the 1950s, and is about class—she writes, [...] "We always called them Them"— but [...] "defiantly individualistic" [...] rather than socialist. Powell is bitter about the injustice of her situation, [...] "very good at dramatising ... mortifying moments", and [...] "throws the last shovel of dirt on the myth of the devoted help and their unfailing love and respect for the stately home". The book [...] "prompted a storm of hurt letters". However, she has no time for politics and instead focusses on beating the odds: [...] "Those people who say the rich should share what <b>theyve</b> got <b>are</b> talking a lot of my eye and Betty Martin; its only because they havent got it they think that way ... If I had it Id hang on to it too". The Wall Street Journals reviewer in 2012 called her [...] "admirably feisty" [...] and [...] "wittily scathing of the class-bound cant conditioning Britain {{in the early decades of}} the 20th century".|$|R
5000|$|While British {{companies}} and creators have {{helped create the}} market for collected volumes there have, {{with a few exceptions}} like Raymond Briggs, been very few British original graphic novels published. Briggs himself has said [...] "On the Continent, graphic novels have been as accepted as films or books for many years, but England has had a snobby attitude towards them. <b>Theyve</b> always <b>been</b> seen as something just for children". However, thanks to the strong sales for Briggs Ethel and Ernest, and Jimmy Corrigan winning The Guardians best first novel award, publishers have started expanding into this area. Random House UKs imprint Jonathan Cape has tripled its graphic novel output and Random House has also established Tanoshimi to publish manga. Other publishers have also been increasing their output, which, as well as producing original works like Alice in Sunderland, have also been included adaptations of works of literature. There are a number of new publishers who are specifically targeting this area, including Classical Comics and Self Made Hero, the latter having an imprint focused on manga adaptations of the works of Shakespeare.|$|R
5000|$|At Strange Horizons, {{months after}} publication, Kanakia {{took a more}} {{measured}} view, calling it [...] "more of a premise than a novel" [...] but admitting he was intrigued enough by that. The background scenario was an [...] "inspired juxtaposition" [...] against stock crime-novel characters. But, he regretted, it makes use of that [...] "just barely enough." [...] While he said Winters exploration of how people might continue on with the things <b>theyve</b> always <b>been</b> doing {{in the face of}} imminent doom [...] "adds a few hills to the psychogeography of the planet-busting asteroid trope," [...] the rest of the book undercut its themes, especially as it starts to become apparent that Maias impact may not be the end, after all. Nonetheless, the story was still [...] "a fun and competent police procedural story. The working-out of the murder offers enough twists to make the book an enjoyable experience." [...] He particularly praised the novelist for setting the story in a smaller city.The Concord Monitors reviewer liked the book and verified that Winters had [...] "done his homework" [...] in his depiction of the city.|$|R

Keller claims that once the KrayTaks destroy the rebels, they intend to come after Earth. He also claims that the real Tobias LeConte has been captured by the KrayTaks and that a Stormer has been impersonating him all along.|$|E

Kirk laughs at this, insisting that the adventure <b>theyve</b> just had <b>is</b> proof hes not suitable. Bones reminds Kirk of how hes a living legend and how simulations of his adventures will be seen by Starfleet cadets for centuries to come. Kirk comments [...] "I only hope they enjoy those adventures as much as I did", realizing that this way, he really will live forever.|$|R
5000|$|Three interrelated {{mechanisms}} {{explain the}} trend of forest loss following {{the establishment of a}} drug transit hub. The first is the clearing of forestland for the construction of clandestine roads and airstrips used by vehicles transporting narcotics, pesticides, and fertilizers. Second, the influx of vast amounts of cash and weapons into areas that are already weakly governed only intensifies the preexisting pressures on forests there. The introduction of narco-capital into these frontiers encourages landowners and other actors in the region to participate in the drug trade, which often leaves indigenous communities bereft of their land and livelihoods. Finally, the large profits to drug traffickers incentivize DTOs to convert forest to agriculture in order to launder these profits. [...] "Improving" [...] remote land not only allows narco-traffickers to inconspicuously convert their assets into private earnings but also legitimizes the DTOs presence in the area. Though conversion of land within protected forest area and indigenous communities is illegal, traffickers have the political influence necessary to guarantee impunity. As for the indigenous communities marginalized by increased drug trafficking activity, they are powerless {{in the face of the}} narcos violence and corruption; conservation groups in the region are threatened and state prosecutors are bribed to turn a blind eye to illegal [...] "narco-zones." [...] According to Dr. Kendra McSweeney from Ohio State University, the baseline rate of deforestation in the region of about 20 km2 per year has accelerated to 60 km2 [...] McSweeney cites Honduras worlds highest homicide rate, explaining that conservationists [...] "dont breathe a word of narco-trafficking, out of fear... <b>theyve</b> all <b>been</b> silenced." [...] International environmental groups have pointed to the death of Jairo Mora Sandoval as an example of this sort of silencing of conservationists by narco-traffickers, indicating that the ecological and social effects of the drug trade have been felt throughout Central America.|$|R
5000|$|Tetzlaff plays a {{contemporary}} violin by Stefan-Peter Greiner {{which he has}} had since 2002, preferring it to his previous Stradivarius instrument. He uses a Peccatte bow, and Vision strings by Thomastik-Infeld in Vienna. He eschews routinely playing the violin with the full, lyrical sound preferred by many of his contemporaries, telling The New Yorker: [...] "The listener loses the ear for the most beautiful sounds if <b>theyve</b> <b>been</b> used for arbitrary, non-important things". This approach has occasionally left Tetzlaff open to criticism. The Guardians critic Andrew Clements argued that his recording of the Schumann piano trios, mentioned above, lacked [...] "any sense of involvement or affection for the music", and that his 2014 release of Shostakovichs violin concertos was sometimes devoid of [...] "character".|$|E
5000|$|Despite its low charts, Love You was {{met with}} praise, and viewed as a {{dramatic}} improvement over 15 Big Ones the year before. Chris Shields has written that the album is [...] "one of the most divisive" [...] of the Beach Boys catalog, while Scott Schinder cited a [...] "sharp divide" [...] between fans and critics, some of whom saw the album {{as a work of}} [...] "eccentric genius" [...] whereas others [...] "dismissed it as childish and trivial". Rolling Stones Billy Altman wrote a positive review, calling the album: [...] "truly wonderful ... and reminiscent of many other Beach Boys albums. Like the best of them, its flawed but enjoyable. Brian Wilson still isnt singing as well as he used to, but his playing and composing talents have certainly returned from wherever <b>theyve</b> <b>been</b> the past few years." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{calls for}} the books to be banned from schools have led to legal {{challenges}} often {{on the grounds that}} witchcraft is a government-recognised religion and that to allow the books to be held in public schools violates {{the separation of church and}} state. The Orthodox churches of Greece and Bulgaria have also campaigned against the series, and some Catholic writers and officials have voiced a critical stance. The books have been banned from private schools in the United Arab Emirates and criticised in the Iranian state-run press. Religious responses to Harry Potter have not all been negative. [...] "At least as much as <b>theyve</b> <b>been</b> attacked from a theological point of view," [...] notes Rowling, [...] "books have been lauded and taken into pulpit, and most interesting and satisfying for me, its been by several different faiths." ...|$|E
5000|$|Previous {{same-sex}} storylines in {{the show}} had led to criticism from conservative groups. Bower has said that she expects this storyline to come under fire, saying [...] "I do believe homophobia is still alive and well, and I {{have no doubt that}} we will get complaints about it". Australian LGBT website SameSame said the story had attracted attention from some media commentators, who called it [...] "an obvious ratings grab and an attempt to out-gay rival soap, Home and Away". However, script producer, Emma Steele defended the storyline and said {{that it is not a}} [...] "ploy to grab ratings". Steele said that she is [...] "particularly proud" [...] of the way Chriss storyline had been handled and she added [...] "It was something we wanted to do for a while because its a story that affects so many people and in so many different ways. It wasnt just Chriss story. I think its interesting to see how sexuality affected his friends and his relationships with them too". Mason said he hoped that his storyline would [...] "draw in viewers in a responsible way" [...] and the feedback would stay positive. Mason added that he would like to see Chris happy in the future and hopes the viewers will warm to him. He added [...] "I know its quite a sensitive topic, but I think the difference between his and the last encounters <b>theyve</b> had <b>is</b> that were looking more in-depth into more than just a [...] "gay kiss". We go more into the relationships, how it affects people around". Steele backed this up, saying [...] "We wanted gay to be part of Chriss character, not Chris to be the gay character. Hes not your typical gay stereotype that some TV shows like to play up. Hes on the basketball team, hes had a girlfriend for a time, and I think the show does a good job of portraying the way his character is discovering who he really is".|$|R
5000|$|Don Letts (guest vocalist, 2007): “Keith Levene and Jah Wobble {{needed some}} money, so {{they ended up}} making a single for Virgin Records called Steel Leg V. The Electric Dread. They got {{me down to the}} studio to work on some vocals, even though I had never sung in my life. I {{remember}} sitting on the stairs with a microphone trying to write some words. Eventually I said to them Okay guys, Ill go home and work out some lyrics. I never heard back from them, and the next thing I knew there was a record out. They had used my demo vocals and stuck them on the track! ... It was a crap record, and I look back and laugh about all this stuff now.” “I didnt even know they were recording me. I went into some basement toilet just to mumble some lyrics into a mic and hear what they sound like ... Then Im waiting to get a call to do the record, and the next thing I heard <b>is</b> <b>theyve</b> played with my voice a bit, stuck a track under it and put the whole thing out as a finished record.

5000|$|Former {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall expressed his boredom on the focus given on Greys relationships storylines while reviewing the second seasons finale: [...] "On those occasions when Merediths {{not involved in}} a plot about her love life, I do kind of like her, but those moments are so infrequent compared to her constant angsting over McDreamy -- not to mention all those seemingly unrelated storylines that always turn into a metaphor for that relationship -- that I really, really cant stand her." [...] During the shows third season, {{the development of the}} character received negative reviews, with Cristopher Monfette of IGN stating that her storyline has become [...] "some bizarrely under-developed sub-plot about depression and giving Derek a seasons worth of reconsidering to do." [...] Also during the third season, Robert Rorke of the New York Post noted the decline in Merediths role in the show, expressing disappointment: [...] "She used to be the queen of the romantic dilemmas, but lately, shes been a little dopey, what with the endless McDreamy soliloquies." [...] Similarly, Macleans.ca found their storyline in the fourth season overused, [...] "This whole Oh I need more time, but Oh, Im jealous if you look at someone else angst was tired in the second season, frustrating in the third and now a total channel changer. The will-they-or-wont-they plot doesnt work because <b>theyve</b> already <b>been</b> in and out of that relationship too many times. Meredith is a nag and McDreamy is henpecked." [...] On a more positive note, her relationship with Shepherd was included in AOL TVs list of the [...] "Best TV Couples of All Time" [...] and in the same list by TV Guide.During the sixth season the development of the character was praised, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV commented that [...] "You gotta love Mer when shes gloomy.", in addition to praising Pompeos performance. In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote [...] "I felt for Meredith, but after Lexies heartfelt begging and pleading, I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside. Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first, and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver—her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone." [...] Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the heart and soul of the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." ...|$|R
