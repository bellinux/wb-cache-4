40|$|In {{the sheet}} metal forming {{industry}} lubricants are applied in forming processes to expand the technological boundaries by reducing friction and wear. The friction between tool and sheet metal {{is crucial to the}} deep drawing process. Due to economic and ecological reasons the aim of the manufacturers is to reduce or even avoid the use of lubricants. Consequently, this approach enables both a shortening of the process chains and an essential saving of resources. The advantages of structured <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> in lubricated processes concerning the reduction of the coefficient of friction by the appearance of lubricating micro pockets are well-known.

40|$|In {{finite element}} {{simulations}} of high speed {{sheet metal forming}} processes the contact between workpiece and <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> has to be modeled very carefully. Several important aspects {{have to be taken}} into account. Robust and locking-free finite element formulations are required to model the sheet forming process, the die has to be considered as a deformable component, and the description of the contact constraints between workpiece and <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> is a significant source of shortcomings in modeling. The contact and impact simulation makes high demands on the robustness of finite element formulations. For this reason finite elements with low order ansatz functions are preferred. Furthermore, they prove to be advantageous when automatic meshing tools are applied. To overcome the undesired effects of locking we work with an improved version of the innovative solid-shell concept proposed by [11]. It is based on the concept of reduced integration with hourglass stabilization. The use of this solid-shell finite element allows us to test the influence of the modeling of the die and the contact constraints in a very efficient way. An overview of so-called macro and micro deformations of <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> in sheet metal forming simulations can be found in [8]. We show that the deformation of the die has a noticeable influence in electromagnetic sheet metal forming. However, in most commercial finite element codes taking into account elastically deformable <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> requires a full finite element discretization of the die which leads to very high computational effort. Therefore users often assume the tools as being rigid and apply node-based spring-dashpot systems to improve the modeling of the interaction between sheet metal and die. But also in this case local interactions cannot be taken into account realistically. As a possible remedy we investigate a fully elastic description of the <b>forming</b> <b>tools</b> in combination with model reduction techniques. These significantly reduce the number of degrees-of-freedom in the finite element simulation. For this reason we present different alternatives of this technique...|$|R
40|$|Sheet-bulk {{metal forming}} {{is a new}} {{production}} process capable of performing deep-drawing and massive forming steps in a single operation. However, due to the high forming forces of the forming process, continuous process control is {{required in order to}} detect wear on the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> before production quality is impacted. To be able to measure the geometry of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> in the limited space of forming presses, a new inspection system is being developed within the SFB/TR 73 collaborative research center. In addition to the limited space, the process restricts the amount of time available for inspection. Existing areal optical measurement systems suffer from shadowing when measuring the tool's inner elements, as they cannot be placed in the limited space next to the tool, while tactile measurement systems cannot meet the time restrictions for measuring the areal geometries. The new inspection system uses the fringe projection optical measurement principle to capture areal geometry data from relevant parts of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> in short time. Highresolution image fibers are used to connect the system's compact sensor head to a base unit containing both camera and projector of the fringe projection system, which can be positioned outside of the moving parts of the press. To enable short measurement times, a high intensity laser source is used in the projector in combination with a digital micro-mirror device. Gradient index lenses are featured in the sensor head to allow for a very compact design {{that can be used in}} the narrow space above the <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> inside the press. The sensor head is attached to an extended arm, which also guides the image fibers to the base unit. A rotation stage offers the possibility to capture measurements of different functional elements on the circular <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> by changing the orientation of the sensor head next to the <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> During operation of the press, the arm can be travelled out of the moving parts of the forming press. To further reduce the measurement times of the fringe projection system, the inverse fringe projection principle has been adapted to the system to detect geometry deviations in a single camera image. Challenges arise from vibrations of both the forming machine and the positioning stages, which are transferred via the extended arm to the sensor head. Vibrations interfere with the analysis algorithms of both encoded and inverse fringe projection and thus impair measurement accuracy. To evaluate the impact of vibrations on the endoscopic system, results of measurements of simple geometries under the influence of vibrations are discussed. The effect of vibrations is imitated by displacing the measurement specimen during the measurement with a linear positioning stage. The concept of the new inspection system is presented within the scope of the TR 73 demonstrational sheet-bulk metal forming process. Finally, the capabilities of the endoscopic fringe projection system are shown by measurements of gearing structures on a <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> compared to a CAD-reference. Â© 2015 SPIE...|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} the forming heads for production of profile-molded products {{must be considered}} patterns of manifestation of elastic recovery polymer melt {{and the degree of}} slip {{on the walls of the}} <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> The study aims to account for the influence of viscoelastic properties of polymer melts at changing the structure of the flow after the forming of the channel, which in turn leads to the need for change as a process of extrusion process parameters and structural dimensions of the <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> When designing extrusion dies the elastic properties of the melt, i. e. the ability of the melt to store an imposed de-formation elastically (memory fluid) are generally not considered. The elastic properties bring about effects, however, that are important for the design of the die. Neglecting the elasticity of a melt can lead to relatively large errors in the computation of the pressure loss, demonstration this with an example of flow of a high molecular and hence highly elastic PE-HD through a blow molding head. The effect of viscoelastisity on the results in even more pronounced in the computation of the extrudate swelling. Extrusion swelling phenomenon is expanding jet of polymer melt exits the <b>forming</b> <b>tool.</b> Expanding the jet may be due to two factors. The first is the manifestation of the elastic properties of the liquid. The second ? a restructuring velocity profile in the transition from the regime of fluid flow to Poiseuille flow with a free surface. Tanner showed that the expansion of the jet is the interaction of both mechanisms. In the production of polymer products by extrusion cross-section extruded polymer jet is increased compared to the channel cross-section profiling, which affects the final size and shape of the product. In technological practice, evaluate the effect of swelling ratio of extrudate diameter to the diameter of the forming channel. In the extrusion of complex profiles heterogeneity swelling of various elements of the intersection due to the fact that in different parts forming channels are different tensions that is the cause of viscoelastic deformation of various sizes. This may lead to a distortion of the profile up to a total inability to obtain the desired product configuration using a <b>forming</b> <b>tool</b> with a specific configuration forming channels.
