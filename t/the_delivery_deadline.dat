40|$|Abstract: We {{solve the}} problem of uplink video {{streaming}} in CDMA cellular networks by jointly designing the rate control and scheduling algorithms. In the pricing-based distributed rate control algorithm, the base station announces a price for the per unit average rate it can support, and the mobile devices choose their desired average transmission rates by balancing their video quality and cost of transmission. Each mobile device then determines the specific video frames to transmit by a video summarization process. In the time-division-multiplexing (TDM) scheduling algorithm, the base station collects the information on frames to be transmitted from all devices within the current time window, sorts them in increasing order of deadlines, and schedules the transmissions in a TDM fashion. This joint algorithm takes advantage of the multi-user content diversity, and maximizes the network total utility (i. e., minimize the network total distortion), while satisfying <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>deadline</b> constraints. Simulations showed that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the constant rate provision algorithm...|$|E

Similarly, Vinel in [22, 23] presents an analytical framework which compared IEEE 802.11 p and LTE {{in the context of}} road safety applications. These studies made two conclusions. First, for an average contention window (W[*]=[*] 256) and network (N[*]=[*] 25) sizes, the probability that beacons are received within <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>deadline</b> (100 ¬†ms) varies between 100 % and 90 %. Moreover, this probability decreases to just 20 % for W[*]=[*] 16 and N[*]=[*] 50. Second, the download unicast in LTE network is appropriate only for small number of vehicles (less than 100) in the cell. Our simulation study given in Figure¬† 6 a,b validates the former, while Figure¬† 8 a,b replicates the later conclusions which were obtained using theoretical analysis. Certainly, the differences in the specific simulation/analytical tools used to measure performance could contribute to the differences between the present study and that of Vinel [22, 23].

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} popularity of various applications for smartphones, 3 G networks are currently overloaded by mobile data traffic. Offloading cellular traffic through opportunistic communications is a promising solution to partially solve this problem, {{because there is no}} monetary cost for it. As a case study, we investigate the target-set selection problem for information delivery in the emerging Mobile Social Networks (MoSoNets). We propose to exploit opportunistic communications to facilitate the information dissemination and thus reduce the amount of cellular traffic. In particular, we study how to select the target set with only k users, such that we can minimize the cellular data traffic. In this scenario, initially the content service providers deliver information over cellular networks to only users in the target set. Then through opportunistic communications, target-users will further propagate the information among all the subscribed users. Finally, service providers will send the information to users who fail to receive it before <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>deadline</b> (i. e., delay-tolerance threshold). We propose three algorithms, called Greedy, Heuristic, and Random, for this problem and evaluate their performance through an extensive trace-driven simulation study.

For example, the Heuristic algorithm can offload cellular traffic by up to 73. 66 % for a real-world mobility trace...|$|E

In this paper, as a target applica-tion, we suppose a system that allows users in a sightsee-ing area to exchange word-of-mouth information including photos on each sightseeing spot. We assume that multiple portable servers called ‚ÄúInfoBoxes ‚Äù that collect/disseminate data from/to user terminals via short range wireless commu-nication (e. g., Bluetooth) are deployed at sightseeing spots. In our proposed system, each user terminal sends, to an In-foBox, a query specifying (1) a destination spot on which the user wants to get information, (2) the importance of the query (to what extent the user satisfies when getting the query response), and (3) a receiving spot where the user wants to receive the query response. We propose a carry-and-forward based technique for delivering queries/responses so that the overall user satisfaction is maximized. Depending on a given probability of user movement between two spots, the pro-posed method appropriately adjusts the number of data repli-cas copied from each InfoBox to user terminals. In addition, the method discards the data which cannot meet <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>deadline</b> for efficient bandwidth utilization.

40|$|Avionics {{full-duplex}} switched Ethernet, {{with its}} capability of delivering deterministic latency at low deployment costs, represents a major advance for avionics communication systems. However, avionics full-duplex switched Ethernet does not eliminate contentions at network switches, which {{may result in}} an uncontrolled increase in end-to-end latencies, and hence limit the potential of this technology. The use of time to pace packet transmission and forwarding (that is, the adoption of pipeline forwarding) has been demonstrated to avoid contentions at switching nodes in wide-area communication networks, thus being potentially attractive also for avionics networks in general, and avionics full-duplex switched Ethernet in particular. However, questions might arise concerning the actual feasibility of such an approach in the avionics domain due to the possibly high costs required to deploy packet switches able to operate according to a very precise time schedule, which is necessary to respect <b>the</b> stringent <b>delivery</b> <b>deadlines</b> of avionics systems.

StrathSat-R is the second experiment, which had the purpose of deploying two cube satellites with inflatable structures from the REXUS 13 sounding rocket, was launched first in May 2013 and will be launched a second time in spring 2014. The last experiment is the iSEDE experiment which has the goal of deploying an inflatable structure with disaggregated electronics from the high altitude balloon BEXUS 15 / 16 in October 2013.
