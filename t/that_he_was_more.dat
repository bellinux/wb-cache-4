5|$|Junior Johnson, {{owner of}} one of the top NASCAR teams, {{approached}} Kulwicki {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 season to try to get him to replace Terry Labonte in the No. 11 Budweiser Ford. Kulwicki declined, stating <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> interested in running his own team. He won his second Cup race at Rockingham on October 21, 1990, and finished eighth in points that year, his first finish in the top10 points in a season. In 29races, he had thirteen top10 finishes and onepole position.|$|E
5|$|Rosenthal is {{referred}} to as the pioneer of research into seasonal affective disorder. In 1984, he coined the term and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment. Rosenthal's interest in studying the effects of the seasons on mood changes emerged when he emigrated from the mild climate of Johannesburg, South Africa, to the northeastern US. As a resident in the psychiatry program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, he noticed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> energetic and productive during the long days of summer versus the shorter darker days of the winter.|$|E
5|$|The Gospel of Luke {{says the}} census from Caesar Augustus took place when Quirinius was {{governor}} of Syria. Tipler suggests this took place in AD 6, nine years {{after the death of}} Herod, and that the family of Jesus left Bethlehem shortly after the birth. Some scholars explain the apparent disparity as an error {{on the part of the}} author of the Gospel of Luke, concluding <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> concerned with creating a symbolic narrative than a historical account, and was either unaware of, or indifferent to, the chronological difficulty.|$|E

5|$|At {{a meeting}} of local Democrats in Bardstown, Kentucky, in 1859, Brown was {{nominated}} to oppose Joshua Jewett for Jewett's seat in the House of Representatives. Despite Brown's protests <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> than a year younger than the legal age to serve, he was elected over Jewett by about two thousand votes. He did not take his seat until the second congressional session because of his age. He {{became a member of}} the Douglas National Committee in 1860 and engaged in a series of debates with supporters of John C. Breckinridge for president, including Breckinridge's cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{started the}} season {{competing}} over 400 metres {{in order to}} improve his speed, winning two races and registering 45.54 s in Kingston, and windy conditions gave him his first sub-10 second finish of the season in the 100 m in March. In late April Bolt suffered minor leg injuries in a car crash. However, he quickly recovered following minor surgery and (after cancelling a track meet in Jamaica) he stated that he was fit to compete in the 150 metres street race at the Manchester Great City Games. Bolt won the race in 14.35 s, the fastest time ever recorded for 150 m. Despite not being at full fitness, he took the 100 and 200 m titles at the Jamaican national championships, with runs of 9.86 s and 20.25 s respectively. This meant he had qualified for both events at the 2009 World Championships. Rival Tyson Gay suggested that Bolt's 100 m record was within his grasp, but Bolt dismissed the claim and instead noted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> interested in Asafa Powell's return from injury. Bolt defied unfavourable conditions at the Athletissima meet in July, running 19.59 seconds into a 0.9m/s headwind and rain, to record the fourth fastest time ever over 200 m, one hundredth off Gay's best time.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs {{was given}} a third benefit by Surrey in 1926 which raised £2,670. Further {{recognition}} came when he and Rhodes joined the England selection committee for the Ashes series to be played that summer; for professional cricketers to serve as England selectors was unprecedented. Hobbs began the season well, and after the first Test, which was badly affected by rain, he remained in form by scoring 261 against Oxford University, sharing an opening partnership of 428 with Sandham; this remained a Surrey first wicket record as of 2016. In the drawn second Test, he and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 182. Hobbs scored 119 but was criticised for slowing down later in his innings, leading to accusations <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> concerned with reaching three figures than batting for the team. The third Test was also drawn. England followed on {{in the face of}} a large Australian total, but Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened the second innings with a partnership of 156 and Hobbs scored 88 as the game was saved. During the fourth Test, he temporarily assumed the captaincy when Arthur Carr withdrew from the match owing to illness; Hobbs became the first professional to captain England at home. The selectors and players on both teams believed Hobbs performed well tactically. He scored 74 in England's innings, but heavy rain ensured a fourth successive draw.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Chamberlain became {{deeply involved in the}} war effort. In addition to his duties as councillor, Chamberlain helped recruit men for the Royal Warwickshire Regiment and set up funds for injured soldiers. Late in 1914, he became an alderman of Birmingham, and the following year, became Lord Mayor. Chamberlain's biographer, Robert Self, suggested that as Joseph Chamberlain had died the previous year, the honour was due to Neville Chamberlain's hard work rather than to any family influence. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a tremendous burden of work, and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard. He set up crèches for workers, stockpiled coal to be distributed to the poor at cost in time of shortage, and reinvigorated Birmingham's various committees, which were ineffective and engaged in wasteful rivalries. He also chaired the local committee evaluating exemptions from conscription, and stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> lenient than were other members of the tribunal. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance, and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1940, the {{injustice}} he had suffered was privately recognised when he was offered the Headship of the Petroleum Warfare Department {{which would have been}} de facto reinstatement and full restitution.

25|$|Russell claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{convinced}} of his method of doing philosophy than of his philosophical conclusions. Science {{was one of}} the principal components of analysis. Russell was a believer in the scientific method, that science reaches only tentative answers, that scientific progress is piecemeal, and attempts to find organic unities were largely futile. He believed the same was true of philosophy. Russell held that the ultimate objective of both science and philosophy was to understand reality, not simply to make predictions.|$|E

25|$|Gabreski {{was also}} criticized {{for having a}} poor {{attitude}} towards wingmen. One historian, citing five interviews with pilots and an unpublished manuscript by a sixth, observed that Gabreski flew the fastest aircraft available and failed to notice when his slower wingmen could not keep up. These pilots, reportedly afraid to fly with him, commented <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> interested in personal achievement than in his wingmen. He was also criticized {{for a lack of}} discipline among his off-duty pilots and for allegedly encouraging exaggerated kill claims.|$|E
25|$|The king did not {{appoint a}} {{replacement}} viceroy {{or even a}} governor at Ava to administer the upcountry. With that decision, he had effectively retreated from Upper Burma and Shan states. It shows <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> concerned about having a strong potential rival in the upcountry than about dealing with myriad competing minor vassal rulers from afar. The decision was not cost free. Without closer control of a viceroy, Nanda {{would not be able}} to enlist any men from the remaining vassals in Upper Burma and Shan states in the following years.|$|E

25|$|Bragg {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1921—"a {{qualification}} that makes other ones irrelevant". He was knighted by King George VI in the 1941 New Year Honours, and received both the Copley Medal and the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. Although Hunter, {{in his book}} on Bragg Light is a Messenger, argued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> a crystallographer than a physicist, Bragg's lifelong activity showed otherwise—he {{was more of a}} physicist than anything else. Thus, from 1939 to 1943, he served as President of the Institute of Physics, London. In the 1967 New Year Honours he was appointed Companion of Honour by Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
25|$|Historian K. N. Panikkar {{described}} Singh {{as one of}} {{the early}} Marxists in India. The political theorist Jason Adams notes <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> enamoured with Lenin than with Marx. From 1926 onward, he studied the history of the revolutionary movements in India and abroad. In his prison notebooks, he quoted Lenin in reference to imperialism and capitalism and also the revolutionary thoughts of Trotsky. When asked what his last wish was, Singh replied that he was studying the life of Lenin and he wanted to finish it before his death. In spite of his belief in Marxist ideals however, Singh never joined the Communist Party of India.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, {{when he was}} 21 and {{a student}} at the University of California, Berkeley, London searched for and read the {{newspaper}} accounts of his mother's suicide attempt and the name of his biological father. He wrote to William Chaney, then living in Chicago. Chaney responded that he could not be London's father because he was impotent; he casually asserted that London's mother had relations with other men and averred that she had slandered him when she said he insisted on an abortion. Chaney concluded by saying <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> to be pitied than London. London was devastated by his father's letter; in the months following, he quit school at Berkeley and went to the Klondike during the gold rush boom.|$|E
