50|$|Henry Bohlen (October 22, 1810 - August 22, 1862) was a German-American Union Brigadier General of <b>the</b> American Civil <b>War.</b> Before {{becoming}} <b>the</b> first foreign-born Union {{general in}} <b>the</b> Civil <b>War,</b> he fought in <b>the</b> Mexican-American <b>War</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S. side), and in <b>the</b> Crimean <b>War</b> (<b>on</b> <b>the</b> French side).|$|R

5|$|After the war, {{some women}} who had been {{especially}} active in supporting <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> the home front turned their organizational skills to other concerns, especially prohibition and woman suffrage.

5|$|Another {{arm of the}} {{conspiracy}} was directed at the Indian troops who were serving in Middle East, while efforts were directed at drawing Afghanistan into <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of the}} Central Powers, which it was hoped would incite a nationalist or pan-Islamic uprising in India and destabilise the British recruiting grounds in Punjab and across India. After Russia's defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese war, her influence had declined, and it was Afghanistan that was at the time seen by Britain as the only power in the sub-continent capable of directly threatening India.|$|E

5|$|Conditions {{in camps}} varied {{considerably}} geographically and over time. Conditions were particularly {{poor in the}} summer of 1940, when facilities proved insufficient to accommodate the large number of new POWs, and in the particularly cold winter that same year. Gradually, as prisoners were repatriated, relieving overcrowding, conditions generally improved. From 1943, however, as <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>on</b> the Eastern Front turned against Germany, conditions worsened and the food supply became more precarious. Some camps were purpose-built, like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses.|$|E
