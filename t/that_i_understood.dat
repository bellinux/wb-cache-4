[...] Coach Rene Lachemann said, [...] "If you're one run down, there's nobody you'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey." [...] Teammate Mitchell Page said, [...] "It wasn't until I saw Rickey <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> what {{baseball}} was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1–0. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarence Hickman {{was born}} on a farm {{established}} by his grandfather Leak on August 16, 1889. The nearest town was Lizton, Indiana to the south. Clarence and his siblings attended the Leak country school until 1898, when the family moved northward to the Job Hadley farm, where the children attended another country school. In both residences, Clarence pursued an interest in archery, playing with bows and arrows made by his father. By his own account, The arrows had heavy heads so {{that we did not}} need feathers to guide the arrow.... We boys shot fish with bows, using umbrella staves as arrows. I well remember that I could not understand why we had to aim under the fish to hit it. [...] It was not until I attended high school, where I learned about refraction of light, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> this phenomenon.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1989 {{interview}} with radio host Timothy White, Townshend apparently acknowledged his bisexuality, referencing the song [...] "Rough Boys" [...] on his 1980 album, Empty Glass. He called the song a [...] "coming out, {{an acknowledgment of}} the fact that I'd had a gay life, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> what gay sex was about." [...] However, in a 1994 interview for Playboy, he said, [...] "I did an interview about it, saying that [...] "Rough Boys" [...] was about being gay, and in the interview I also talked about my [...] "gay life," [...] which—I meant—was actually about the friends I've had who are gay. So the interviewer kind of dotted the t's and crossed the i's and assumed that this was a coming out, which it wasn't at all." [...] Townshend later wrote in his 2012 autobiography Who I Am that he at one point felt as if he was [...] "probably bisexual". Townshend also stated jokingly that he once felt sexually attracted to The Rolling Stones lead singer, Mick Jagger.|$|E

6000|$|She did at last {{make him}} think, {{and it was}} fairly as if light broke, though not quite all at once. [...] "You must let me say I do see.

60|$|As a proof <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> him, I {{promised the}} secrecy {{which he had}} every right to expect from me.|$|E

60|$|If Bladesover is my key for the {{explanation}} of England, I think my invincible persuasion <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> Russia was engendered by the circle of Uncle Frapp.|$|R
