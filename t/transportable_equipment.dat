In situ non- destructive study is typically diagnostic, therefore requiring only qualitative or semiquantitative results. In the case of alloys, quantitative results can also be obtained. In Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) analysis, portable instruments can now be assembled. For instance, miniaturised X-ray tubes with air cooling and high resolution semiconductor detectors thermoelectrically cooled are now available, allowing the construction of completely transportable apparatus for EDXRF analysis. In this work, aspects regarding methodology of analysis and discussion of the precision obtainable in analysis of ancient metals are presented.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{environmental}} scientists, geoscientists, and analysts skilled {{in the use of}} X-ray fluorescence spectrometry and X-ray diffractometry. The challenge for educators is how to inspire, teach, and make the next generation of professional X-ray users and analysts ready for employment. In this paper, we present vignettes from teaching applications of X-ray analytical techniques at three scaffolded levels, from senior high school students, undergraduate science students, to postgraduate researchers. At each of these levels the pedagogical complexity increases, from simple data use at high school, to observing how data are generated and being able to constrain analytical uncertainty at the undergraduate level, to generating high-quality data at the postgraduate level. In all cases, <b>transportable</b> <b>equipment</b> is used in on-site analytical programs to inform the experimental design, level of sampling required, and research outcomes. 7 page(s...|$|E

On 21 January 1975, the 15th Evacuation Hospital was officially redesignated and reorganized as the 15th Combat Support Hospital, utilizing the new and conventional Medical Unit, Self-contained, <b>Transportable</b> (MUST) <b>equipment</b> which was capable of holding 100 to 300 patients and preparing them for further evacuation.|$|R
40|$|Composite plates having {{durable and}} {{lightweight}} structure are most interesting materials considering several applications. Because durability {{is a major}} criteria, {{it is important to}} develop methods for finding flaws that affect this quality. In the case of carbon-glass fibre composites we have earlier demonstrated the suitability of radio frequency (RF) induction heating combined with IR-detection [1]. Based on the good experiences obtained with the method, a suitable equipment for field experiments was developed. Last year we showed the feasibility of a <b>transportable</b> thermal NDT <b>equipment</b> using laser line heating [2]. Modifying this measurement system for RF induction heating, several disadvantages of laser heating can be overcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{space and}} ground {{segments}} of the Landsat-D thematic mapper (TM) for remote sensing of a 185 km swath with 30 m resolution are described. Scanning the full earth once every 16 days from its 705 km sunsynchronous orbit, Landsat-D will relay its data on the ku-band through the TDRSS satellite to a ground station. The X-band will {{also be used to}} transmit data directly to foreign and domestic ground stations; the S-band will be reserved for MSS data only. Landsat-D comprises the multimission modular spacecraft and the instrument module, which features the MSS and TM, a wideband communication subsystem, a solar array, and an L-band global positioning system. Three computers on the ground provide a high degree of automation for reception, storage, retrieval, back-up, and transmission of data and commands. Additionally, a van is equipped with <b>transportable</b> <b>equipment,</b> including an antenna. Procedures followed for image generation from the MSS and TM are detailed, noting storage at Goddard until dispersal of tapes {{under the direction of the}} EROS data center...|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation load is {{a potential}} health risk. Its monitoring at work places was difficult {{because of the need}} of expensive and hardly <b>transportable</b> <b>equipment.</b> Since UV damage extremly depends from the wavelengths inflicted, results of measurements with common small integrating radiometers were not satisfying. In this project, new equipment needed for measuring UV exposure on work places was constructed and established. The new radiometer promotes high accuracy in measuring of biologically relevant UV radiation at work places. The handy construction and accuracy recommend it for field investigations of UV burdened work places. Using that compact instrument, representative UV-burdened work places in industries and medical institutions were investigated. Using our data, recommendations are possible for design and correction of such work places. The committee 'Strahlenkunde' of German Buero of Standardization (DIN) has endorsed the results of this project and accepted a first proposal for a new DIN Standard 'Radiometer for measurement of actinic radiation data'. The results have been published and discussed with further responsible committees (Strahlenschutzkommission und Berufsgenossenschaft Feinmechanik und Elektrotechnik). (orig.)

40|$|Logistical problems, {{in remote}} areas in Africa, make it {{extremely}} difficult if not impossible to use sophisticated testing methods to analyse the bearing capacity of roads and airport pavements. Hence, engineers have to be innovative in obtaining maximum information with easily <b>transportable</b> <b>equipment</b> and testing methods such as the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP). Information obtained from such testing {{can be used to}} get appropriate input values into existing design models {{in order to determine the}} bearing capacity and rehabilitation needs. This paper covers a preliminary analysis for an airport in Angola. The South African Mechanistic Design Method (SAMDM), together with the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO’s) empirically design method/s (i. e. based on the US FAA CBR design method), were used to calculate the bearing capacity of the airport for the design aircraft. The results obtained from the SAMDM analyses are compared with the designs recommended by ICAO’s and show great promise in analysing airport pavement structures. It is demonstrated that the results obtained using the SAMDM (with rudimentary test results as input) compare excellently with the design obtained using the ICAO method. The SAMDM procedure was also used to determine the Aircraft Classification Number (ACN) ratio’s (or equivalent factors) for the different aircraft types for comparison reasons...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} Fluor Hanford and BNG America have {{combined}} nuclear plant skills from the U. S. and the U. K. to devise methods to retrieve and treat the sludge that has accumulated in K Basins at the Hanford Site over many years. Retrieving the sludge {{is the final}} stage in removing fuel and sludge from the basins {{to allow them to}} be decontaminated and decommissioned, so as to remove the threat of contamination of the Columbia River. A description is given of sludge retrieval using vacuum lances and specially developed nozzles and pumps into Consolidation Containers within the basins. The special attention that had to be paid to the heat generation and potential criticality issues with the irradiated uranium-containing sludge is described. The processes developed to re-mobilize the sludge from the Consolidation Containers and pump it through flexible and transportable hose-in-hose piping to the treatment facility are explained with particular note made of dealing with the abrasive nature of the sludge. The treatment facility, housed in an existing Hanford building, is described, and the uranium-corrosion and grout packaging processes explained. The uranium corrosion process is a robust, tempered process very suitable for dealing with a range of differing sludge compositions. Optimization and simplification of the original sludge corrosion process design is described and the use of <b>transportable</b> and reusable <b>equipment</b> is indicated. The processes and techniques described in the paper are shown to have wide applicability to nuclear cleanup...|$|R
40|$|Simplified {{measurements}} of the field-saturated hydraulic conductivity, Kfs, require short duration experiments, small water volumes and easily <b>transportable</b> <b>equipment.</b> A simplified falling-head (SFH) technique for the rapid determination of Kfs has been developed and tested. The technique consists in applying a small volume of water on a soil surface, confined by a ring inserted a short distance into the soil, and then measuring the time from the application of water to the instant at which the surface area is no longer covered by water. A measurement of the initial and field-saturated soil water contents, and {{an estimate of the}} *-parameter of the Gardner’s exponential model are then used to calculate Kfs using a simple solution that includes gravity. The Kfs of both repacked and undisturbed soil cores was determined in the laboratory by the SFH and the Early-Time Constant-Head (ECH) techniques. The SFH and (Constant-Head) Pressure Infiltrometer (PI) techniques were then compared in the field. The maximum discrepancy between the mean Kfs results obtained within an experiment was of a factor of approximately two. This difference is negligible in most practical applications and it was concluded that the SFH technique compared favorably to the ECH technique in the laboratory and to the PI technique in the field. The SFH technique appears promising for determining Kfs in {{a relatively short period of}} time without the need for extensive instrumentation or analytical methodology, and therefore it appears suitable for detailed field measurements over large areas...|$|E
