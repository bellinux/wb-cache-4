This paper proposes an integrated sustainable approach for partner selection and closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) network configuration, particularly in the case of outsourcing reverse logistics process to third- party provider. We propose a trade-off between sustainability criteria for both supplier and 3 PRL provider selection. A multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MILP) model is also proposed to configure CLSC network and to select the best partners. The model minimizes the total cost of sourcing, and the total greenhouse gas emissions, while it maximizes the total value of reverse logistics, and the number of new job opportunities.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Third-party</b> reverse <b>logistics</b> providers(3 PRLPs) {{selection}} {{has become}} an important logistics function which can help companies to maintain their competitive edge. Traditionally, companies solely considered economic aspects for selecting their 3 PRLPs. However, due to increased pressure from different types of stakeholders regarding environmental and social issues in recent years, companies have been obliged to incorporate these issues in their logistics and supply chains functions. Although many {{studies have been conducted}} in the field of 3 PRLPs selection, much less attention has been devoted to incorporating all three aspects of sustainability (social, environmental, and economic) in this field. In this research, a hybrid fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making (FMCDM) approach is proposed for selecting 3 PRLPs while all three dimensions of sustainability were taken into account. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) was used in order to weight the selected sustainability criteria and subcriteria. Then, fuzzy technique fororder preference by similarity to ideal solution (FTOPSIS) was applied for determining the ranking of suppliers. The applicability of the proposed approach wastested in an electronic manufacturing company...|$|R
40|$|AbstractReverse {{supply chain}} logistics, means {{mobility}} of goods from end consumers towards core manufacturer in the channel of product distribution. In the turbulent business environment, the companies must promote alternative uses of resources {{that may be}} cost-effective and ecology friendly by extending products’ routine life cycles. Reveres logistics activities i. e. storing, transporting and handling of used products poses a great challenge to reverse logistics managers as there is always chances of uncertainty in terms of quantity, quality and timing of return of EOL products in case of reverse supply chains. Business organizations including those of white/electronics goods manufacturing industries would like to focus on their core competency areas and there is need of making outsourcing decisions of their reverse <b>logistics</b> process to <b>Third-Party</b> reverse <b>Logistics</b> Providers (3 PRLPs). Thus, most important strategic issue for top management is the evaluation and selection of third party logistics service provider who can effectively provide reverse logistics operation services to the firms. The objective of this work is to develop decision support system to assist the top management of the company in selection and evaluation of different 3 PRL service providers by hybrid approach using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. A real life case study of a mobile phone manufacturing company is presented to demonstrate {{the steps of the}} decision support system.

The Drake University {{accreditation}} self-study {{was initiated}} in January 2004. After becoming {{familiar with the}} new Higher Learning Commission accreditation criteria, President Maxwell and Provost Troyer determined that the self-study process could assist the University to move forward toward several of its assessment and planning goals. They appointed Sue Wright, Associate Provost and Director of Institutional Research, as Self-Study Coordinator. The Provost and Self-Study Coordinator sought agreement of individuals {{to serve on the}} Steering Committee and to chair or co-chair criterion committees. The Steering Committee membership was intended to emphasize the importance accorded to the tasks being undertaken in the self-study. Chaired by the Provost, the Steering Committee included chairs of the five Criterion Committees, the President, Vice President Business and Finance, Associate Director of Athletics, the Chief Information Officer, and Self-Study Coordinator. The Committee {{met for the first time}} in June 2004 and began to discuss the new accreditation criteria. Working with committee chairs, the Steering Committee appointed members for each of the five criterion committees. On September 10, 2004, the self-study officially kicked off with a lunch and orientation for all self-study committee members. At that event members were introduced to the process, the self-study criteria and to Drake’s commitment to using the process for real self-study. Each committee was first asked to consider how examining the University using their criterion and its components could help Drake University better achieve its mission. These deliberations led to several major campus initiatives discussed in Intro 7. C. During succeeding years the committees identified evidence and drafted information for the “Self-Study Report. ” With normal transition among chairs and members, the committees continued to meet through spring 2007 when they submitted reports to the Self-Study Coordinator. In addition to the steering and criterion committees, a publicity and promotion task force met to recommend ways to get the campus involved in the self-study process. They also considered issues such as publication of the requests for <b>third-party</b> comments. A <b>logistics</b> committee prepared for the team visit.
