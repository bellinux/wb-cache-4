5|$|Librarians at Valley Library {{began using}} text {{messaging}} in March 2010 {{to communicate with}} some library patrons, and earlier started to loan out Amazon's Kindle reader. In April, the school started allowing students to use the library 24-hours-a-day from Sunday through <b>Thursday</b> <b>to</b> test whether there was enough demand to allow 24-hour access on a permanent basis. The program {{was sponsored by the}} Associated Students of Oregon State University and paid for by university technology funds, and was {{due in part to the}} closure of some computer labs that had been 24-hour study areas.|$|E

There, she finds Arthur and Fred, and joins them in a raid led by Sir <b>Thursday</b> <b>to</b> find and destroy the New Nithlings' weapon, which is {{preventing}} the mechanical floor of the Great Maze from shifting. Arthur destroys the weapon by throwing the pocket into it, simultaneously destroying the Skinless Boy. As Arthur escapes from the Piper with Sir Thursday, he distracts Thursday enough for the fourth part of the Will, a snake embodying the virtue of justice, to break free, whereupon it makes Arthur the Bearer of the Fourth Key – a sword or baton depending {{on whether or not}} the wielder is in combat – and Commander of the Glorious Army of the Architect. With help from Dame Primus and others from the lower demesnes, Arthur defeats the New Nithling army.|$|E
5|$|The season length {{was similar}} to the 2010 Claxton Shield by {{spreading}} ten rounds over twelve weeks, playing only the season's first game in the first week and taking a week off for Christmas and Boxing Day. Six teams were involved, playing a four-game series every week totaling two series against each team, one at home and one away. In total, the schedule allowed for 40regular season games per team before a four-team finals series. During the regular season, games were played <b>Thursday</b> <b>to</b> Sunday, varying depending on the series and team, with 18games scheduled as doubleheaders on a Saturday. Doubleheaders were scheduled to have the first of the two games shortened to seven innings, with the second game using the full nine innings.|$|E

25|$|The above halakhic quandary is avoided {{completely}} if a firstborn fasts {{the entire}} day on Thursday. However, Rabbi Feinstein {{makes no mention of}} this requirement. In order for a firstborn (who eats on <b>Thursday)</b> <b>to</b> comply with the ruling of the Rema, the Piskei T'shuvot suggests participating in a second siyum on Friday, while Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank suggests partaking on Friday of leftovers from the previous day's siyum.|$|E

25|$|A {{description}} of the institution and character of the Ascensiontide rogations is given by Sidonius Apollinaris. The solemnity of these, he says, was first established by Mamertus. Hitherto they had been erratic, lukewarm, and poorly attended (vagae, tepentes, infrequentesque). Those he instituted were characterized by fasting, prayers, psalms, and tears. In the Ambrosian rite the rogations take place after Ascension, and in the Spanish on the <b>Thursday</b> <b>to</b> Saturday after Whitsuntide, and in November (Synod of Girona, 517).|$|E

The Los Angeles Clippers moved a playoff game against the Utah Jazz to nearby Anaheim. In baseball, the Los Angeles Dodgers postponed games for four straight days from <b>Thursday</b> <b>to</b> Sunday, including a whole 3-game series against the Montreal Expos; all were made up as part of doubleheaders in July. In San Francisco, a city curfew due to unrest forced the postponement of a May 1 San Francisco Giants home game against the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E

25|$|At {{least five}} members of the {{security}} forces were killed by the IRA in around this area during the same period. Among the killed were two constables shot dead while driving a civilian type vehicle in Fivemiletown's main street on 12 December 1993. A British Army helicopter was fired on {{in the aftermath of the}} ambush. Another fatality was a RIR soldier, Private Reginald McCollum, from Cookstown who was abducted and shot dead while on leave; his body was found in the outskirts of Armagh City on 21 May 1994. His murder was the IRA's first act of terrorism since the Government replied on <b>Thursday</b> <b>to</b> Sinn Féin's 20 questions about the Downing Street Declaration. His elder brother, Nigel McCollum, a civilian contractor to the Ministry of Defence, had died in a South Armagh Brigade mortar attack one year earlier, on 8 March 1993, while working inside an Army base near Keady. A decade before Nigel McCollum's death, on 19 September 1983, the brothers' grandmother, Lilly McCollum, was killed by a booby trap bomb said to have been meant for her brother, at that time a member of the security forces.|$|E

500|$|Despite Vanderbilt's strong record, the Sewanee Tigers were undefeated {{and felt}} cause for {{optimism}} in the effective Southern championship. One account recalls: [...] "A high authority on foot-ball {{said the other}} day: Vanderbilt is not invincible, by a good deal. The Sewanee [...] "Tigers" [...] are going to Nashville on <b>Thursday</b> <b>to</b> prove that fact." [...] Vanderbilt struggled, but still won 20–0. [...] "With Vandy making only 20 points–Vandy was stale, was the explanation." [...] After the big win over Carlisle, [...] "a matter-of-course feeling pervaded the entire game." [...] The first score of the game came on a 25-yard field goal. The first touchdown came from Owsley Manier. In the second half, Bob Blake made a 22-yard field goal, and Manier got another touchdown.|$|E
500|$|The quarter-finals {{were played}} on Wednesday, 11 July, before a [...] {{larger number of}} spectators than had {{attended}} the previous matches. Start of play was delayed from the scheduled 3:30p.m. due to strong winds. Gore defeated Langham in four sets, William Marshall beat Erskine, also in four sets, and Julian Marshall, who injured his knee during the match after a fall, lost to Heathcote in straight sets. The quarter-final matches left three players, instead of four, in the draw for the semi-finals scheduled for <b>Thursday.</b> <b>To</b> solve the situation lots were drawn and Marshall, a 28-year-old architect and Cambridge real tennis blue, was given a bye to the final. His opponent would be [...] Gore, who defeated Heathcote in straight sets in the only semi-final played. When the semi-final stage had concluded on Thursday, 12 July, play was suspended until next Monday, 16 July, to avoid a clash with the popular annual Eton v Harrow cricket match that was played at Lord's on Friday and Saturday.|$|E
