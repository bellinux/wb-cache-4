25|$|The {{decision}} {{to build the}} first stage of the East West Link was criticised as a misuse of public funds that should have been spent on public transport. Fristacky said the project would deprive Melbourne of billions of dollars that were needed for the construction of the Melbourne airport railway, Doncaster railway line, Rowville line, Melbourne Metro and the Mernda rail extension. Public <b>Transport</b> <b>Users</b> Association president Tony Morton said the project would not solve Melbourne traffic problems and that the 2013 state Budget should have focused on badly needed rail upgrades.|$|E

25|$|In March 1960 the {{proposed}} withdrawal of passenger services was announced, {{the main line}} from Gravesend to Grain remaining unaffected by the changes.

25|$|TransInfo was a phone {{inquiry and}} {{timetable}} service established in August 1993 by Queensland Transport. It {{was found to}} be a very successful service, and in a 1997 research study 99% of surveyed <b>transport</b> <b>users</b> were either very or fairly satisfied with the service. After the success of TransInfo, in June 2003 the Queensland Government introduced TransLink as an agency within Queensland Transport, replacing the former TransInfo service. With a $21.4 million budget, TransLink was tasked to introduce common fares, zones and ticket types irrespective of transit mode, and from mid-2004 a smartcard system. Prior to TransLink's introduction, combined patronage for public transport services was only around 112 million trips per year.|$|E
25|$|With {{the line}} still {{proposed}} for closure, the <b>Transport</b> <b>Users</b> Consultative Committee {{heard from the}} Western National bus company that it would require twenty buses in the summer {{to cope with the}} influx of holidaymakers, but that most would be idle for much of the year when far fewer people travelled to Minehead and the surrounding district. In an attempt to make the loss-making line profitable, BR reduced the double track from Norton Fitzwarren to one track on 1 March 1970 and closed the signal boxes at Bishops Lydeard and Norton Fitzwarren. This left the branch with three sections (Silk Mills to Williton; Williton to Dunster; Dunster to Minehead) but still required seven staff per shift as there were three signal boxes and four level crossings. The line continued to make a loss so was eventually closed. The last train left Minehead on 2 January 1971; this was a Saturday and the following Monday 4 an enhanced bus service came into operation.|$|E

25|$|The freeway {{has been}} a {{contentious}} issue, amid concerns over environmental damage and the possibility {{it would lead to}} a 'complete' metropolitan ring road. In October 1999 the Bracks Government announced that the freeway (which Labor had not promised at the election) had been scrapped. Instead the government promised to investigate a preferred route for the Rowville railway line and extend the 75 tram to Knox, of which neither have been fulfilled. However, in 'major policy about-face' the Bracks Government announced in August 2000 that they would seek federal funding for the freeway. To obtain funding the freeway would need to be classified as a road of 'national importance', {{despite the fact that it}} did not form part of the national highway grid. The 'U-turn' on the freeway was strongly criticised by opponents such as the Public <b>Transport</b> <b>Users</b> Association as it would result in public transport alternatives such as the Rowville railway line being scrapped.|$|E
25|$|The Brighton Main Line railway route {{south from}} Croydon links {{the town to}} Sussex, Surrey, and Kent and to central London to the north: {{providing}} direct services to Hastings, Southampton, Brighton, Portsmouth, Gatwick Airport, Bedford and Luton. The main station for all these services is East Croydon station in {{the centre of the}} town centre. East Croydon station is the largest and busiest station in Croydon, third busiest in London, excluding Travelcard Zone 1. The station at West Croydon serves all trains travelling west except the fastest. There are also more regional stations scattered around the borough. Passenger rail services through Croydon are provided by Southern and Thameslink. A pilot scheme launched by the Strategic Rail Authority, Transport for London and three train operators is designed to encourage more passengers to travel off-peak. In full partnership with the South London Boroughs which includes Croydon, SWELTRAC, SELTRANS and the <b>transport</b> <b>users</b> group, the scheme promotes the advantages of off-peak travel following improvements to safety, travel connections and upgrading of station facilities. The Thameslink Programme (formerly known as Thameslink 2000), is a £3.5billion major project to expand the Thameslink network from 51 to 172 railway stations spreading northwards to Bedford, Peterborough, Cambridge and King's Lynn and southwards to Guildford, Eastbourne, Horsham, Hove to Littlehampton, East Grinstead, Ashford and Dartford. The project includes the lengthening of platforms, station remodelling, new railway infrastructure (e.g. viaduct) and additional rolling stock. When implemented, Thameslink services would call at other stations in the borough including Purley and Norwood Junction.|$|E

40|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>user</b> {{benefits}} are {{of great importance}} in cost benefit analysis when appraising transport projects. Generally they have {{the greatest impact on}} the results of cost-benefit analyses. It is common to adopt the consumer surplus for calculating <b>transport</b> <b>user</b> benefits. The consumer surplus measure is based on the underlying demand model and follows from the integration of the demand curve. If the popular logit model is used for forecasting travel demand, consumer surplus measure takes a closed form (the “logsum”) that is easy to calculate. Furthermore, in cost-benefit analyses the change in consumer surplus between an initial and final state is needed, which can be easily derived by the difference of the logsums of the two states. This logsum approach is proven and correct for travel demand models based on the logit model without multiple constraints. However, for travel demand models dealing with two or more sets of constraints the logsum approach fails. In this paper we describe a mathematical approach for a <b>transport</b> <b>user</b> benefits measure that corresponds to the consumer surplus and is universal for all travel demand models with constraints. We exemplarily derive the measure for a doubly constrained trip distribution. The applicability of the derived approach is shown by a small example...|$|R

After finding only Rush's mother, the group learns that the Conqueror, with his demands rejected, has started a war and is marching his army with the support of the [...] "God-Emperor", a 1000-year-old legendary figure.|$|E
