500|$|Generally, fans {{reacted with}} {{confusion}} {{as to why}} the short existed. Bill Oakley and several other writers loved the short so much that they wanted to do more, but time limitations prevented them. As a result, Oakley and Josh Weinstein decided to produce an entire episode <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> but loosely associated shorts, which became the season seven episode [...] "22 Short Films about Springfield". The Flanders/Lovejoy segment of that episode was written by David X. Cohen. [...] "22 Short Films about Springfield" [...] in turn inspired the Futurama episode [...] "Three Hundred Big Boys".|$|E
500|$|Fury (1936) was {{the first}} film to prove that Tracy could make a success on his own merit. Directed by Fritz Lang, Tracy played a man who swears revenge after {{narrowly}} escaping death by a lynch mob. The film and performance received excellent reviews. It was popular with the public, going on to make $1.3 million worldwide. Curtis writes: [...] "audiences who, just a year earlier, had no clear handle on him, were suddenly turning out to see him. It was a transition <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> short of miraculous... a willingness {{on the part of}} the public to embrace a leading man who was not textbook handsome nor bigger than life." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 16 March 1867, {{when the}} first results of Lister's work were {{published}} in the Lancet, he had treated a total of eleven patients using his new antiseptic method. Of those, only one had died, and that was through a complication <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with Lister's wound-dressing technique. [...] Now, for the first time, patients with compound fractures were likely to leave the hospital with all their limbs intact ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{technique}} of printing his more popular lectures in periodicals which {{were sold to}} the general public was extremely effective. A good example was The physical basis of life, a lecture given in Edinburgh on 8 November 1868. Its theme— that vital action is nothing more than [...] "the result of the molecular forces of the protoplasm which displays it"— shocked the audience, though <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> compared to the uproar when it was published in the Fortnightly Review for February 1869. John Morley, the editor, said [...] "No article that had appeared in any periodical for a generation had caused such a sensation". The issue was reprinted seven times and protoplasm became a household word; Punch added 'Professor Protoplasm' to his other soubriquets.|$|E
2500|$|In May, Tunney competed at the 2012 European Women's Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Brussels, Belgium. [...] After qualifications, Tunney said, [...] "I competed at the 2010 junior Euros but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> like here, {{with a full}} crowd, it {{was really}} great I enjoyed every minute of it. I've {{been working on the}} new vault, the Yurchenko double twist and it's paying off, I was really happy with that today." [...] In team finals, she competed on vault, uneven bars, and floor for the British team which placed fourth. [...] "I had good {{performances}} all round and I'm really happy with how the team have done. I was nervous coming into this event but think I've coped really well. To make no mistakes in all my routines so far is brilliant, my floor has been solid all week so I'm looking forward to the final tomorrow." [...] In event finals, she finished fifth on floor with a score of 13.800.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the autumn}} of 1937, Hitler secured Mussolini's support to annex Austria (Mussolini was {{originally}} apprehensive of the Nazi takeover of Austria) and informed his generals of his intentions to invade both Austria and [...] Czechoslovakia. Getting Mussolini to approve political intrigue against Austria was a major accomplishment, as the Italian Duce had expressed great concern previously {{in the wake of}} an Austrian SS unit's attempt to stage a coup not more than three weeks after the Röhm affair, an episode that embarrassed the SS, enraged Hitler, and which ended in the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss on 25 July 1934. Nonetheless, to facilitate the incorporation of Austria into the greater Reich, the SD and Gestapo went to work arresting people immediately, using lists compiled by Heydrich. Heydrich's SD and Austrian SS members received financing from Berlin to harass Austrian Chancellor von Schuschnigg’s government all throughout 1937. One section of the SD <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> more than a front for subversive activities against Austria ironically promoted [...] "German-Austrian peace".|$|E

2500|$|In March 2011, {{when asked}} about the album's musical {{direction}} in an interview with gossip website Dean Piper's World, Goulding stated, [...] "It's started to sound very dark and very weird. This album is going to be even more emotional [...] I wanted to make it so there is hope. I want to make an effect whether it's happy or sad." [...] Goulding added, [...] "This album for me is a journey from dark into light from confusion to understanding [...] I didn't set out to write a break-up record but I think it became one." [...] In an interview with MTV News on 29 August 2012, Goulding elaborated on the sound of the album, saying, [...] "I've moved on quite a bit since the first album, because I've discovered so much; I've learned a lot more and I've grown up a lot more. I've gained more influences and different influences and people have influenced it; I suppose just circumstances. It's a bit more tribal and anthemic; a bit more piano and vocal than anything. The last album was very electronic, but it was tied in with my voice; this one, to me, is way more of a pop record." [...] Goulding revealed to The Sun that her former relationship with BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James provided inspiration for the album, stating, [...] "The last record I felt like I was singing about stuff like that and I thought it was really sincere but I listen back and I think, God that was really naive, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing.</b> This time it's the real deal. There's stuff about Greg. I played it to him because I felt that was better than him hearing it randomly somewhere." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{held up his}} arms, and {{let them}} drop again heavily to his side.
