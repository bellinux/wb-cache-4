500|$|Starting {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Wii in 2006, Iwata placed focus on development of products that improved quality of life. The Wii Fit series, conceptualized by Miyamoto, epitomized this movement. At E3 2009, Iwata revealed development of an add-on product to the Wii: the Wii Vitality Sensor. The device measured autonomic nerve functions, namely pulse, and incorporate acquired data into relaxation products. Iwata saw the device as a continuation of the [...] "blue ocean" [...] strategy previously articulated. He indicated that the market of motion controls was turning into a [...] "red ocean," [...] whereby too many companies would saturate the market and restrict profits. The Vitality Sensor was developed in hopes of providing a novel way to interact with video games and continue Nintendo's history of innovation. However, <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>prototype</b> device yielded less than desirable results and Nintendo had postponed the release of the product indefinitely by 2013.|$|E
