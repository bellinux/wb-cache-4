40|$|The {{impressive}} {{development of}} techniques compressing time and (almost) abolishing distance, which support economic globalisation, at first {{gave rise to}} expectations that the economy would become independent of concrete territories, and that large cities would be less important. In fact, it is the contrary that has happened. Far from being dissolved into the non-spatial world of teleworking, global cities concentrate a growing share of wealth and power. In 1990, the Tokyo metropolitan area ranked {{in the first world}} position in terms of production, with a GDP of 854, 4 billion dollars, amounting to the GDP of the <b>total</b> <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom.</b> Paris ranked in the 5 th position, just after Los Angeles and Osaka, with a GDP of 318, 1 billion equivalent to that of China. Researchers have tried to explain the intensification of the metropolisation process (strengthening of the leading activities of large cities) under economic globalisation. The most well-known theory is that of the "global city " by Saskia Sassen (Sassen, 1990). We will not discuss here whether Paris fits in with the model of global city according to Sassen's parameters. It can be assumed that Paris is not a global city because its financial sector (th...|$|E

As in previous years, over half the reports have come from southern counties of England, especially the south-east and south-west health regions. A provisional total of 768 cases were reported overall in 2006. Over 3, 500 confirmed cases of Lyme borreliosis have been reported since the introduction of enhanced surveillance in 1997. Mean annual incidence rates for laboratory-confirmed cases have risen from 0. 38 per 100, 000 <b>total</b> <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> (UK) population between 1997 and 2000, to 0. 64 / 100, 000 in 2002, and to 1. 46 / 100, 000 in 2006 [2]. Although the infection is most commonly diagnosed and reported in the summer months, coinciding with greater tick activity, cases are reported throughout the year, in part, because non-specific symptoms may lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, but also because of the long incubation period of some of the later clinical manifestations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{review the}} safety and {{efficacy}} of the Amplatzer septal occluder for transcatheter closure of interatrial communications (atrial septal defects (ASD), fenestrated Fontan (FF), patent foramen ovale (PFO)).  DESIGN—Prospective study following a common protocol for patient selection and technique of deployment in all participating centres.  SETTING—Multicentre study representing <b>total</b> <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> experience.  PATIENTS—First 100  consecutive patients in whom an Amplatzer septal occluder was used to close a clinically significant ASD or interatrial communication.  INTERVENTIONS—All procedures performed under general anaesthesia with transoesophageal echocardiographic guidance. Interatrial communications were assessed by transoesophageal echocardiography with reference to size, position in the interatrial septum, proximity to surrounding structures, and adequacy of septal rim. Stretched diameter of the interatrial communications was determined by balloon sizing. Device selection was based on and matched to the stretched diameter of the communication.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Success defined as deployment of device in a stable position to occlude the interatrial communication without inducing functional abnormality or anatomical obstruction. Occlusion status determined by transoesophageal echocardiography during procedure and by transthoracic echocardiography on follow up. Clinical status and occlusion rates assessed at 24  hours, one month, and three months.  RESULTS— 101 procedures were performed in 100  patients (86  ASD, 7  FF, 7  PFO), age 1. 7  to 64. 3  years (mean (SD), 13. 3  (13. 9)), weight 9. 2  to 100. 0  kg (mean 32. 5  (23. 5)). Procedure time ranged from 30  to 180  minutes (mean 92. 4  (29. 0)) and fluoroscopy time from 6. 0  to 49. 0  minutes (mean 16. 1  (8. 0)). There were seven failures, all occurring in patients with ASD, and one embolisation requiring surgical removal. Immediate total occlusion rate was 20. 4 %, rising to 84. 9 % after 24  hours. Total occlusion rates at the one and three month follow up were 92. 5 % and 98. 9 %, respectively. Complications were: transient ST elevation (1), transient atrioventricular block (1), presumed deep vein thrombosis (1), presumed transient ischaemic attack (1).  CONCLUSIONS—It appears feasible to close interatrial communications and atrial septal defects up to 26  mm stretched diameter safely with the Amplatzer septal occluder. Short term results confirm an early high occlusion rate with no major complications. Careful selection of cases based on the echocardiographic morphology of the ASD and accurate assessment of their stretched diameter is of utmost importance. Further experience with the larger devices and longer term results are required before a firm conclusion regarding its use can be made.    Keywords: interatrial communications; atrial septal defect; Amplatzer septal occluder; congenital heart defect...|$|E

40|$|The <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> Government {{recently}} {{expressed concern}} about the financial repercussions that feigned whiplash claims following road traffic accidents (RTAs) are having on the insurance industry and the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> economy. Indeed, this is a problem that is a likely result of a significant percentage of otherwise law-abiding citizens, who interpret this behaviour to be victimless. Nevertheless, feigning illness for some external incentive is not new, and psychiatry has long battled with the problem of ‘malingering’. Previous research has indicated that a substantial prevalence of malingering exists across a variety of contexts; however, establishing the ground truth of those who malinger for financial compensation is problematic. This article presents an alternative approach that provides a brief insight into the problem of malingering following a RTA. A <b>total</b> of 197 <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> residents completed a hypothetical questionnaire that examined their likelihood of malingering with respect to depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or whiplash following a RTA. The results suggest that a substantial percentage of those in the present sample indicated they would be likely to malinger using either a partial malingering or a false imputation strategy. Malingering following a RTA in the <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> appears to be regarded with little severity, and the present paper discusses the wider implications of the findings...|$|R

Methods: We analyzed the focus and type of norovirus research funding awarded to institutions in the United States and <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> during 1997 – 2013. Data were obtained from key public and philanthropic funders across both countries, and norovirus-related research was identified from study titles and abstracts.

Norovirus publication trends are also described using data from Scopus. Results: In <b>total,</b> US and <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> funding investment for norovirus research was £ 97. 6 million across 349 awards; 326 awards (amount, £ 84. 9 million) were received by US institutions, and 23 awards (£ 12. 6 million) were received by <b>United</b> <b>Kingdom</b> institutions.
