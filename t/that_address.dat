5|$|In April 2011, the ESRB {{introduced}} a streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable {{games as a}} way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games.

Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed.
