40|$|The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) {{rules on}} the {{resolution}} of <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts</b> are known as being despondently unhelpful. One identified lacuna is that these rules disregard many differences present in different kinds of treaties. This paper characterizes treaties {{on the basis of}} their differences and investigates whether this yields legal rules to resolve <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts.</b> This paper presents three broad characterizations founded on: the subject matter; the number of State Parties; and the intended objects and purposes of treaties. Respecting the intended objects and purposes, this paper presents three sub-characterizations, namely: universal character treaties; constitutional character treaties; and <b>treaties</b> with <b>conflict</b> resolution clauses. The results are variegated, but the discussions expose the mythic role of treaty characterization in {{the resolution of}} <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{viability}} {{of international law}} rests largely on the {{viability of}} treaties {{as a source of}} law. In {{the second half of the}} twentieth century, the international state system was supported by the development of treaties. States focused the majority of their regime-building efforts on three sets of concerns: restraining interstate conflict, securing human rights, and managing the economic system. States used treaties as the primary tool in the construction of these international institutions and in the codification of these norms. Moreover, treaties shift issues from the political arena into a juridical, rule-based, forum. The very success of treaties as a policy tool has caused a new dilemma: a surfeit of treaties that often overlap and, with increasing frequency, conflict with one another. For the treaty partners of states that have adopted <b>conflicting</b> <b>treaties,</b> this results in a lack of certainty as to which-if either-treaty would be honored. After the successes of the last fifty years, international law may become increasingly dysfunctional in the first decades of the twenty-first century due to the sheer number of these treaties and the lack of useful, principled, methods to resolve conflicts between them. This Article addresses a particular cause of fragmentation—unresolved conflicts between treaties—and considers how lawyers and policymakers may respond to the challenges posed by <b>treaty</b> proliferation and <b>conflict.</b> I argue that <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts</b> are a key underlying cause of fragmentation and that the current rules are inadequate to provide clear, systematic solutions to <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts.</b> This Article proceeds in five parts. Part I describes <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts</b> in terms of the subject-matter and the structure of the treaties. Part II considers techniques of resolving <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts</b> as alternatives to application of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). Strategies include the drafting of clauses to avoid potential conflicts and the use of interpretive techniques to analyze texts that have already been written. Part III turns to the codification of conflict resolution rules in the VCLT and considers their strengths and weaknesses. Part IV analogizes from other types of textual conflicts, such as conflicts between contracts or between statutes. Part V draws from the previous sections to suggest options in addressing <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts,</b> including: (a) ending the 2 ̆ 2 same subject-matter 2 ̆ 2 rule in assessing whether or not <b>treaties</b> <b>conflict</b> and in the application of conflict resolution rules; (b) increasing the use of purposive interpretation to assess and resolve treaty conflicts; (c) drafting more detailed conflict avoidance clauses in treaties; and (d) increasing the use of a procedure of assurance to determine the intention of a state that has ratified <b>conflicting</b> <b>treaties.</b> While there is no single solution to this complex dilemma, there are ways to minimize some of the unwanted effects of the proliferation of treaties. Part V also broadens the focus from these specific recommendations and considers the implications of the preceding discussion on the status of international law as a coherent legal system...|$|R

40|$|The early International Law Commission {{does not}} occupy a heroic role inour imaginations. Its work draws tepid praise, if any, and is {{evaluated}} simply {{in terms of}} its successes or not in codifying and progressively developing international law. This article calls attention to the more subtle project of strengthening international law which guided the Commission’s work. It argues that this project was informed by an appreciation of the politics of international law and was founded on liberal and constructivist assumptions. To illuminate this project, it examines the Commission’s work on <b>treaty</b> <b>conflict</b> in the course of drafting the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Commission, the article points out, stands apart from much mainstream commentary in giving active consideration to the most intractable forms of <b>treaty</b> conflict: <b>conflicts</b> between <b>treaties</b> with non-identical parties and deliberately created <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Its response to such conflicts, {{in the form of the}} much-criticised Article 30, reveals the combination of philosophy, anxiety, politics and strategy that shaped international law at the start of the modern post-war era...|$|R
40|$|Treaties are {{contractual}} {{instruments that}} may provide special rules of priority {{in case they}} <b>conflict</b> with other <b>treaties.</b> When a treaty does not provide such rules, however, priority {{is determined by the}} rules of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) and/or general principles of law. This article argues that both the VCLT and general principles of law do not provide an adequate solution to <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts.</b> It suggests that the solution to <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts</b> rests in a value-oriented reading of international law and the norms incorporated in treaties. Norms represent values and values represent interests or benefits for which international society requires protection. <b>Conflicts</b> of <b>treaty</b> norms are, therefore, conflicts of values that courts and dispute settlement bodies resolve by ordering a hierarchy of competing interests and protecting the most important interests in a given context...|$|R

40|$|All too often, a State’s {{obligation}} {{to protect the}} health and safety of its citizens is hampered by the rights of foreign investors under investment treaties, usually enshrined in arbitration clauses. States compete for foreign investment with the perception that it will accelerate their economic development. However, the realisation of this goal is increasingly eroded by disputes that pit the host States’ sovereign duty to regulate businesses in the public interest against foreign companies’ treaty rights to protect their investments. Moreover, international investment law often conflicts inescapably with human rights law, environmental law, and EU law, all of which are also primarily premised on treaties. Great normative ambivalence ensues, posing serious challenges to the legitimacy and utility of the investor-State arbitral system. Approaching these challenges from the perspective of <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts,</b> this book is the first to focus on the interaction between international investment law and other systems of international law. In the process the author takes a giant step towards determining a hierarchy of <b>conflicting</b> <b>treaty</b> norms and establishing a legitimacy threshold for the investor-State arbitral system. The book raises every relevant salient issue, including the following: – flexibility in the amount of compensation payable to foreign investors; – implications of including non-investment provisions in investment treaties; – efficacy of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties rules on treaty interpretation; – legal bases for the interaction of investment and non-investment treaties; and – the ECJ on EC Treaty/TFEU investment <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Offering interpretive methodologies, remedial mechanisms, and legally and practically plausible paradigms that investor-State tribunals can use in their adjudicative techniques, the author argues that the solution to the legitimacy crisis of the investor-State arbitral system lies in the taking up and resolution of the issue of <b>treaty</b> <b>conflicts</b> by the tribunals themselves. With its value-oriented reasoning, this book not only effectively addresses issues pertaining to the system’s legitimacy but also develops concrete substantive rules of international investment law that are coherent with other parallel systems existing within international law. It will be of inestimable value to investment arbitrators, cross-border investors, States parties to investment treaties, foreign investment policy makers, and parties concerned with a variety of legal areas, including arbitration, human rights, environmental law, and international trade...|$|R

For the former the Constitution is supreme, whereas for the latter the Treaties are supreme.
