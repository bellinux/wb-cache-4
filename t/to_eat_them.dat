5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. He noted that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them.</b> He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E

5|$|Tuatara {{feature in}} a number of {{indigenous}} legends, and are held as ariki (God forms). Tuatara are regarded as the messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them.</b> Tuatara also indicate tapu (the borders of what is sacred and restricted), beyond which there is mana, meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed. Māori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards, some of which may represent tuatara, near their genitals. Today, tuatara are regarded as a taonga (special treasure).|$|E

5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green peas and green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested. Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, usually by boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them</b> is in curries. They can also be processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, but as they easily become waterlogged are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Norton played Mike Shiner, a prickly Broadway {{actor in}} the black comedy film Birdman and was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the role. On February 20, 2014, {{it was announced that}} Norton was directing Motherless Brooklyn. In June 2014, Norton's Class 5 Films and RatPac Entertainment acquired the film rights to the non-fiction article American Hippopotamus, by Jon Mooallem, about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Major Frederick Russell Burnham, Captain Fritz Joubert Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import hippopotami into the Louisiana bayous and persuade Americans <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them.</b> The film highlights the rivalry between Burnham and Duquesne, two famous spies who had been under orders to assassinate each other.

5|$|Suddenly, Kabandha {{appeared}} before them. The demon blocked {{the path of}} the brothers, who tried to escape by taking a different route, but were finally caught by Kabandha. The demon grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left. Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha's clutches, Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita, leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the demon. Rama consoled him. Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger. At this time, Lakshmana realized that the strength of the demon lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon's hands. Annoyed by the brothers' conversation, Kabandha decided <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them</b> at once and drew them closer to his mouth. The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the demon, who fell down with a mighty roar.|$|E

5|$|When {{foraging}} for plants, bears choose <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them</b> at {{the stage}} when they are at their most nutritious and digestible, typically avoiding older grasses, sedges and leaves. Hence, in more northern temperate areas, browsing and grazing is more common early in spring and later becomes more restricted. Knowing when plants are ripe for eating is a learned behaviour. Berries may be foraged in bushes or at the tops of trees, and bears try to maximize the number of berries consumed versus foliage. In autumn, some bear species forage large amounts of naturally fermented fruits, which affects their behaviour. Smaller bears climb trees to obtain mast (edible reproductive parts, such as acorns). Such masts can be {{very important to the}} diets of these species, and mast failures may result in long-range movements by bears looking for alternative food sources. Brown bears, with their powerful digging abilities, commonly eat roots. The panda's diet is over 99% bamboo, of 30 different species. Its strong jaws are adapted for crushing the tough stems of these plants, though they prefer to eat the more nutritious leaves. Bromeliads can make up to 50% of the diet of the spectacled bear, which also has strong jaws to bite them open.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the {{military}} has experimented with new assault ration prototypes, such as the First Strike Ration and the HOOAH! Bar, designed with elite or specialized forces in mind. Lighter than the typical MRE, they require no preparation and allow servicemembers <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them</b> while traveling. In July 2009, 6,300 dairy shake packets of varying flavors were recalled due to evidence of Salmonella contamination.|$|E
25|$|During the winter, belugas {{commonly}} become {{trapped in}} the ice {{without being able to}} escape to open water, which may be several kilometres away. Polar bears take particular advantage of these situations and are able to locate the belugas using their sense of smell. The bears swipe at the belugas and drag them onto the ice <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them.</b> They are able to capture large individuals in this way; in one documented incident, a bear weighing between 150 and 180kg was able to capture an animal that weighed 935kg.|$|E

25|$|The owls' diet {{generally}} {{reflected the}} communities of small animals in the area, taking prions (small seabirds) where they lived near colonies, Coenocorypha snipe, kākāriki and even large earthworms. Once Pacific rats were introduced to New Zealand and began {{to reduce the number}} of native prey items the laughing owl was able <b>to</b> switch <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> <b>them</b> instead.

25|$|Another version tells {{that two}} Sioux boys wandered {{far from their}} village when Mato the bear, a huge {{creature}} that had claws the size of tipi poles, spotted them, and wanted <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them</b> for breakfast. He was almost upon them when the boys prayed to Wakan Tanka the Creator to help them. They rose up on a huge rock, while Mato {{tried to get up}} from every side, leaving huge scratch marks as he did. Finally, he sauntered off, disappointed and discouraged. The bear came to rest east of the Black Hills at what is now Bear Butte. Wanblee, the eagle, helped the boys off the rock and back to their village. A painting depicting this legend by artist Herbert A. Collins hangs over the fireplace in the visitor's center at Devils Tower.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins show {{various types}} of playful behavior, often {{including}} objects, self-made bubble rings, other dolphins or other animals. When playing with objects or small animals, common behavior includes carrying the object or animal along using {{various parts of the}} body, passing it along to other members of the group or taking it from another member, or throwing it out of the water. Dolphins have also been observed harassing animals in other ways, for example by dragging birds underwater without showing any intent <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them.</b> Playful behaviour that involves another animal species with active participation of the other animal can also be observed however. Playful human interaction with dolphins being the most obvious example, however playful interactions have been observed in the wild with a number of other species as well, such as humpback whales and dogs.|$|E
25|$|Uglúk was the deep-voiced {{captain of}} the Uruk-hai band that {{attacked}} the Fellowship at Amon Hen and captured Merry and Pippin. The Uruk-hai were accompanied by contingents of Orcs from Mordor and Moria, but Uglúk and his fellow Isengarders claimed credit for killing Boromir. He defended Merry and Pippin from Moria Orcs who wanted <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them,</b> citing orders to bring the Hobbits to Saruman in good health. He also objected to accusations of cannibalism made by Grishnákh, {{the leader of the}} Mordor contingent. When Grishnákh returned with two or three dozen other Mordor Orcs, Uglúk gullibly accepted their offer of help at face value. Uglúk was usually effective at instilling discipline, although this once required beheading a few Moria dissenters. He and the combined bands were tracked by Éomer's band of Rohirrim on their way to Isengard until, near the eaves of Fangorn forest, they were surrounded and annihilated, Uglúk being slain by Éomer personally.|$|E

50|$|Food washing {{has been}} {{observed}} in non-human primates including macaques and capuchins. The primates will sometimes wash their sandy fruits and foods prior <b>to</b> <b>eating</b> <b>them.</b> This act {{has been described as}} an example of protoculture. Wedge-capped capuchins were shown to wash sandy food in four spontaneous occasions in both captive and wild populations. Urbani found that food washing was a response to certain circumstantial problems and not through imitation or learning, as argued in studies of other species.|$|R
25|$|On {{the first}} night of the quest, the entire company is {{captured}} by three trolls, who plan <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them.</b> However, Gandalf arrives, imitating the trolls' voices and causing them to fight amongst themselves until the sun rises, which turns them to stone. As Bilbo searches for supplies in their cave, he meets an injured elf, Lianna (Jennifer Hale), who he assists by finding her healing potion. He also finds a dagger, which he calls Sting. The party then move on to the Elven city of Rivendell, where Elrond tells them of a secret entrance into the Lonely Mountain. They then head to the Misty Mountains. During the night, they are attacked by goblins, and Bilbo is knocked unconscious. He awakens alone and lost. As he wanders through the underground passages, he finds a ring, and encounters a creature named Gollum (Daran Norris). Gollum makes a deal with Bilbo; they will play a game of riddles. If Gollum wins, he will eat Bilbo, but if Bilbo wins, Gollum will show him the way out. Bilbo wins the game, and Gollum says he must get something before he can lead Bilbo out. He then realizes his ring is gone. Bilbo puts the ring on and discovers it makes its wearer invisible. An infuriated Gollum runs to the exit to try to stop Bilbo leaving, unwittingly leading the invisible Bilbo out. He reunites with the dwarves and Gandalf, but the party are then attacked by a groups of goblins and wargs. They climb to the tops of the trees, and are rescued by a band of eagles, who drop them off near Mirkwood Forest.|$|E

One of Low's most noted episodes of cruelty followed: in his rage, he slashed off the Portuguese captain's lips with a cutlass, broiled them, and forced the victim <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them</b> while still hot.

500|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter, first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1912. The tale is about a badger called Tommy Brock and his arch enemy Mr. Tod, a fox. Brock kidnaps the children of Benjamin Bunny and his wife Flopsy, intending <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them,</b> and hides them in an oven in the home of Mr. Tod. Benjamin and his cousin Peter Rabbit have followed Tommy Brock in an attempt to rescue the babies. [...] When Mr. Tod finds Brock asleep in his bed, he determines {{to get him out of}} the house. [...] His initial attempt fails, and the two eventually come to blows. [...] Under cover of the fight, the rabbits rescue the baby rabbits.

The tale is critically considered one of Potter's [...] "most complex and successful in plot and tone." ...|$|E
500|$|Britten Austin tempers his {{praise for}} Bellman's realism with the {{observation}} that the effects are chosen to work in song, rather than to be strictly correct or even possible. Thus in Epistle 72, [...] "Glimmande Nymf", the memorable rainbow with its glowing colours [...] "of purple, gold and green" [...] is seen after nightfall. He comments [...] "Never mind. It is a beautiful scene, even if its chronology calls for much poetic license." [...] Or in Epistle 80, [...] "Liksom en herdinna", the farmer is for some reason going to or coming from market on a Sunday, when the market would be closed; and his cart [...] "heavy on staggering wheel" [...] must have been absurdly full if it contained chickens, lambs, and calves all at once. But {{it had to be}} a Sunday to allow Ulla Winblad to step out of her swaying chaise, on an outing from the city. Britten Austin remarks that [...] "until such solecisms are actually pointed out, one does not even notice them." [...] It is the same with the meals, which would cause [...] "terrible indigestion" [...] if the listener actually had <b>to</b> <b>eat</b> <b>them,</b> but [...] "as a feast for mind, eye and ear they are highly satisfactory", the imagination filled with [...] "all the poetic wealth" [...] that Bellman provides.|$|E

50|$|Salteñas are juicy, like a stew in a pastry. The {{juiciness}} {{is achieved}} by making a stew {{out of all the}} ingredients and adding gelatin, so that the stew hardens in the refrigerator, and then slowly melts when they are baked.
