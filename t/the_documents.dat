5|$|In 1990, {{after being}} sued for libel by the Church of Scientology, Steven Fishman, {{a former member}} turned critic, offered {{a large amount of}} the group's highly {{confidential}} teachings in court. <b>The</b> <b>documents,</b> contained in {{what is known as the}} Fishman Affidavit, included detailed accounts of the church's space opera narratives. This material was subsequently posted on alt.religion.scientology and a website of Dutch journalist Karin Spaink. The church filed suits against those who posted <b>the</b> <b>documents,</b> claiming copyright violations. Lengthy court battles ensued, but the church was unable to prevent the materials' dissemination over the internet.|$|E
5|$|Many years later, {{the abbey}} is visited by Monsignors Aguerra (God's Advocate) and Flaught (the Devil's Advocate), the Church's {{investigators}} {{in the case}} for Leibowitz's sainthood. Leibowitz is eventually canonized as Saint Leibowitz – based partly on the evidence Francis discovered in the shelter – and Brother Francis is sent to New Rome to represent the Order at the canonization Mass. He takes <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> found in the shelter, and an illumination of one of <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> on which he has spent years working, {{as a gift to}} the Pope.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} final {{contract}} with delle Croci was in 1516 whereas Cairano was definitively dead in 1517: if Cairano indeed worked on the monument, it can be deduced from <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> {{that he would not}} have had sufficient time to finish it completely within the period, and consequently a large part of it must have been done before this date. This means admitting Cairano's involvement prior to 1516, which is not attested in <b>the</b> <b>documents.</b> Indeed, the same contract of 1516 asserts that the work was incomplete when installed in the church; it is unknown what its condition was at the time; and the remains of Bernardino Martinengo were already housed in it from the previous year. The implication is that the progress on the monument may have been near completion, at least in the structure and architectural components. The incompleteness alluded to in <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> of 1516 likely refer to the decorative inserts of various types, including the bronzes definitively due to della Croci.|$|E

5|$|On 18 February 2016, the INR in Warsaw {{announced}} it had seized {{a package of}} original documents that allegedly proved Wałęsa was a paid Communist informant. <b>The</b> <b>documents</b> dated from the period 1970–1976; they were seized from {{the home of a}} recently deceased former interior minister, General Czesław Kiszczak.

5|$|Once leave is granted, an {{applicant}} {{moves on to}} the second stage and applies for a prerogative order by filing in the High Court a document called a summons within the legal proceedings already started earlier. This must be done between eight and 14 days after leave {{to do so is}} granted by the Court; beyond that, the leave lapses. The applicant must serve the ex parte originating summons, the statement, the supporting affidavit, the order granting leave, and the summons by which the prerogative order is actually applied for, on all persons directly affected. Where the application relates to court proceedings and is intended to compel the court or a court official to do an act relating to the proceedings, or to quash the proceedings or any order made in them, <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> must be served on the registrar of the court and the other parties to the proceedings. <b>The</b> <b>documents</b> must also be served on the judge if his or her conduct is being objected to. If the Court is of opinion that any person who ought to have been served with <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> has not been served, the Court may adjourn the hearing on such terms as it may direct in order that <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> may be served on that person.|$|E

5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. <b>The</b> <b>documents</b> included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before joining them himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Rejewski {{ran into}} {{difficulties}} {{due to the}} large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxième Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. <b>The</b> <b>documents,</b> procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> were given to Rejewski. They enabled him {{to reduce the number of}} unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector.|$|E

5|$|Edwards {{then tried}} to change the deal with Dart. Instead of {{dividing}} the smuggled slaves between the two men, Edwards tried to keep all the slaves and instead repay the money Dart had advanced him, with some interest. Dart sued, and at the trial in March 1839 Edwards offered two forged documents claiming that Dart had sold {{his interest in the}} slaves to Edwards. In forging <b>the</b> <b>documents,</b> Edwards originally secured Dart's signature on a document written in a type of ink that could later be chemically removed. After Dart signed the document, Edwards then removed the original wording of the document and substituted a deed selling Dart's interest in the land and slaves. <b>The</b> <b>documents</b> were determined to be forgeries and on April 2, 1840, Dart was awarded $89,000.
