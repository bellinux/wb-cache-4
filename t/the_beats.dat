5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>Beats,</b> Gary Snyder and Allen Ginsberg in {{particular}} {{were influenced by}} the Imagist emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry. William Carlos Williams was another who had a strong effect on the Beat poets, encouraging poets like Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg's Howl (1955).|$|E
5|$|Endtroducing..... {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, who praised DJ Shadow's {{approach to}} sampling and <b>the</b> <b>beats</b> he created from samples.

The album {{is considered to be}} a landmark work in the instrumental hip hop movement, with DJ Shadow's innovative sampling techniques and arrangements influencing other producers to create similar sample-based works. Endtroducing..... has since appeared in several publications' lists of the decade's greatest albums.|$|E
5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where <b>the</b> <b>beats</b> in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improved method for simulating and modifying <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> effect in piano tones. <b>The</b> <b>beating</b> effect is an audible phenomenon, which is characteristic to the piano, and, hence, {{it should be}} accounted for in realistic piano synthesis. The proposed method, which is independent of the synthesis technique, contains a cascade of second-order equalizing filters, where each filter produces <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> effect for a single partial by modulating the peak gain. Moreover, the method offers a way to control <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> frequency and <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> depth, {{and it can be}} used to modify <b>the</b> <b>beating</b> envelope in existing tones. The results show that the proposed method is able to simulate <b>the</b> desired <b>beating</b> effect. 1...|$|R
5|$|In {{connection}} with his {{background as a}} musician, Lee founded the record label Monster Music in 1999, signing Van Morrison's daughter Shana. Monster created numerous divisions as it diversified into other products, such as Monster Performance Car, Monster Game, Monster Photo and Monster Computer. By 2003, Monster produced more than 1,000 products, including power cords, gaming accessories and cooling products. According to a 2005 USA Today article, Lee and his company were developing furniture with high-end electronics built-in, wireless products to replace audio cords and a user interface to consolidate the consumer's control of their electronics. Lee and his son worked with Dr. Dre to collaborate on <b>the</b> <b>Beats</b> brand of headphones, which was later acquired by Apple for $3 billion in 2014. According to Business Insider, Beats Electronics denies that Monster {{had a role in}} the design of the headphones. Lee said Beats had no engineers on staff and it spent millions in research and development to get the product started, but that their contract was poorly constructed, giving all the intellectual property to Beats when it wasn't renewed.|$|E

50|$|It is the {{new system}} of Beat service adopted by Karnataka Police with an aim to {{introduce}} technology for ensuring accountability and efficiency. The system uses radio frequency based technology to perform beat service, wherein {{in place of the}} Point books in <b>the</b> <b>Beat</b> area, an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Tag is installed; the RFID Tag contains a microchip with a unique identifier stored on it. This unique identifier can only be read using a RFID Reader which operates at a similar frequency. The information regarding <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> constables performing <b>the</b> <b>beat,</b> <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> no to which it should be used for <b>beat</b> service, <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> point locations to be visited is fed into it before assigning it to <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> constable and deployed. <b>The</b> <b>beat</b> constables carry <b>the</b> reader to <b>the</b> <b>beat,</b> read <b>the</b> unique ids from <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> point location, complete <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> and return <b>the</b> reader to the Station House Officer with a detailed report along with it. The SHO will download the contents from the reader which is basically the date and time of visit to a beat point along with name and designation of the person who visited <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> points.The system ensures physical presence of the police personnel on beat which itself is a deterrent for unlawful activities. Also the system keeps track of manpower utilization and assists the SHO in devising strategies for crime prevention and monitoring of human resources. The e-beat application provides various reports which assist the SHO in keeping track of the offences and correlate with <b>the</b> <b>beat</b> performance and crime occurrence.|$|R
