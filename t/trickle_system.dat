Thus, wastewater produced requires treatment prior to dispose of. Recent researches showed effective results of treating the wastewater by using white rot fungi. There was evidence that 90 % of decolorization could be achieved, thus this treatment is being studied extensively. However, its application in an industry scale has not developed yet. In this study, pilot plant scale bioreactors were used to observe the best support configuration and modus operandi. It is expected that {{the outcome of this}} research will contribute a significant step toward treating textile wastewater using fungal based bioreactors. An Indonesian white rot fungi namely Marasmius sp. grown on palm oil fibers was used throughout this study. The operation variables were support configurations, i. e. 2 and 3 beds, and modus operandi, i. e. <b>trickling</b> and immersion <b>systems.</b> Samples were analysed with a spectrophotometer to examine color intensity, Bradford assay to examine protein concentration, as well as ABTS assay to examine laccase activity.

40|$|Irrigation {{science in}} recent years has been driven largely by the {{technology}} requirements of large schemes where production would be impossible without irrigation. In these schemes the aim is often to remove water as a constraint to production, whereas in many sugar producing areas of Australia there is insufficient irrigation water to supplement rainfall fully and yields are often limited by water. Irrigation strategies developed for full irrigation systems may not always apply to supplementary systems with limited water. Drawn together in this paper are the results of replicated field trials, crop simulations and investment analysis to consider the long term benefits of installing and implementing supplementary irrigation in the Mackay and Atherton regions of Queensland, Australia. Large yield responses were obtained from relatively small but well-timed applications of water in two field experiments. Some of these responses were nearly as high as the theoretical maximum for the areas concerned. Mean response to irrigation simulated with the APSIM-Sugarcane model was similar to mean measured response. Simulations were then conducted to predict yearly fluctuations in yield response to supplementary irrigation applied in a variety of ways including winch, centre pivot and trickle irrigation systems, different scheduling options, different water allocations, different crop classes and diffcrent soils. Many of these options affected yield response probability and some had a profound effect on the financial investment feasibility of supplementary irrigation.

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to determine water and salt distribution patterns in a soil irrigated by pairs of double-chamber, perforated polyethylene tubes. The study consisted of two experiments: a water distribution experiment and a salt distribution experiment. Both experiments were conducted at the same site with experimental plots having two perforated lines 9 m long, spaced 0. 60 m. The tubing had outer orifices 0. 5 mm in diameter spaced 0. 30 m along the tubes. The water distribution experiment consisted of water application to the bare soil for periods of time of 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours. After each test a trench was dug normal to the irrigation tubes and samples were taken to determine soil moisture on a dry weight basis. Moisture profiles are presented for the various tests. The salt distribution experiment was conducted in the Fall of 1973 and repeated in the Spring of 1974. It consisted of four irrigation treatments comprising two irrigation levels and two levels of salt in the irrigation water (327 and 2000 milligrams per liter of salts). Experimental plots were planted with lettuce and soil samples taken after planting and after harvesting the lettuce. Soil samples were analyzed for electrical conductivity of the soil saturation extract, pH, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium and nitrates. Saturation extract conductivity profiles in the soil are presented for different treatments. After planting and after harvest concentrations of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, nitrates and pH values are also shown. Seasonal water application and lettuce yields are presented for both trials Water movement in the soil was 2 to 3 times greater in the horizontal than in the vertical direction. Wetted soil volume showed a high positive correlation with both the volume of water applied and with time of application. Salt accumulation occurred mainly at the soil surface between the irrigation tubes and away from the main root zone of the plants. The surface accumulation was followed by a leached zone. There {{were no significant differences in}} yield among plots receiving different treatments. Seasonal water application was less than half of the seasonal amount of water normally applied for furrow irrigated lettuce in the Tucson area. It was higher than experimental determinations of seasonal consumptive use for lettuce at Mesa, Arizona.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was carried out to {{determinate}} the Possibility of utilization of Karkheh River water for drip irrigation. Regarding climatic conditions of Iran, it is necessary to apply high efficiency irrigation methods particularly for crops with high water requirement. Clogging of droppers is the most important and serious issue that threatens a <b>trickle</b> irrigation <b>system.</b> In the present article, in order to study the potential of Karkheh River as a water source, the water quality of the river was examined in 5 stations along the river in a 30 -year period. To prognosticate the potentiality of carbonate calcium sedimentation and the corrosion in the irrigation equipments, Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) and Ryzner Stability Index (RSL) were used, respectively. The results showed that, based on Wilcox diagram, the water of this river enjoys appropriate quality for agricultural purposes in most cases (with the exception of droughts). The results also showed that the LSI w as positive in all stations and it is possible that droppers clog due to carbonate calcium deposition. While, RSL was in most cases below 6. 8 and there is little possibility of metal parts corrosion in <b>trickle</b> irrigation <b>system.</b> It can be recommended that, regarding limited water sources, downstream lands of this river can be irrigated through <b>trickle</b> irrigation <b>systems</b> with droppers that are less sensitive to clogging in order to prevent from chemically clogging of droppers.

40|$|Water {{crisis is}} an {{important}} issue in arid and semi-arid regions like Iran. The situation has been getting more worse over recent years drought. Hence, there is a growing need to utilize low quality water where freshwater is scarce. In this regard, urban wastewater is a promising source but there are concerns about the environmental and health aspects of using such water. The main problem regarding the performance of <b>trickle</b> irrigation <b>system</b> utilizing wastewater effluents is clogging of the emitters. In this study, field trials at pilot scale were carried out to investigate the hydraulic properties of emitters using two types of water including treated wastewater and groundwater. The <b>trickle</b> irrigation <b>system</b> consisted of three 16 mm lateral tubes placed at 300 mm spacing in the main tube and each lateral tube had 16 emitters at 300 -mm spacing. The designed discharge of the emitters was 4 L/h. The hydraulic properties of the different commercial emitters (micro flapper, long path, turbo plus and Eurokey) were assessed at different time periods. The results indicated that the Eurokey and long path emitters had the maximum and minimum emission uniformity, respectively, when applying wastewater. using groundwater, the Eurokey and turbo plus emitters had the maximum and minimum emission uniformity, respectively, during the initial phase of the study. However, the Eurokey and long path emitters had the maximum and minimum uniformity values, respectively, {{at the end of the}} study.

(Seleg cultivar) grown on sandy loam (Typic Torrifluvents) soil. Three water treatments based upon evaporation (E) from class A pan (50 %E, 100 %E, and 150 %E) were applied using three irrigation systems (bubbler, basin, and trickle). Water distribution was monitored using Neutron probe apparatus to 150 -cm depth. The ECe and SAR of soil paste extract were monitored periodically by collecting soil samples at 15 -cm increment up to 90 -cm depth. The study showed that <b>trickle</b> irrigation <b>system</b> resulted in better soil water conditions leading to higher date palms yield compared to other systems. The soil water storage under irrigation systems ranked as follows: trickle > bubbler > basin. The soil water storage for water treatment plots ranked as follows: 150 %E > 100 %E > 50 %E. Generally, the irrigation with saline water (EC* = 6. 27 dS m- 1, SAR = 10) for 4 years resulted in moving the class of the soil from non-saline to saline soil under bubbler and basin irrigation systems and to sodic (SAR = 12) soil {{in the case of}} <b>trickle</b> irrigation <b>system.</b> The salt accumulation with time was more pronounced with <b>trickle</b> irrigation <b>system</b> compared to other systems, but did not reach the critical level that affect yields of date palms.

40|$|Two models {{describing}} the stripping of volatile organic contaminants (VOCs) {{in an industrial}} <b>trickling</b> filter <b>system</b> are developed. The aim of the models is to investigate the effect of different operating conditions (VOC loads and air flow rates) on the efficiency of VOC stripping and the resulting concentrations in the gas and liquid phases. The first model uses the same principles as the steady-state non-equilibrium activated sludge model Simple Treat, in combination with an existing biofilm model. The second model is a simple mass balance based model only incorporating air and liquid and thus neglecting biofilm effects. In a first approach, the first model was incorporated in a five-layer hydrodynamic model of the trickling filter, using the carrier material design specifications for porosity, water hold-up and specific surface area. A tracer test with lithium was used to validate this approach, and the gas mixing in the filters was studied using continuous CO 2 and O- 2 measurements.

Simulations with this model reveal that changing the air flow rate in the <b>trickling</b> filter <b>system</b> has little effect on the VOC stripping efficiency at steady state.

40|$|The {{increased}} use of trickle or drip irrigation is seen as one way of helping to improve the sustainability of irrigation systems around the world. However, soil water and solute transport properties and soil profile characteristics are often not adequately incorporated {{in the design and}} management of <b>trickle</b> <b>systems.</b> In this paper, we describe results of a simulation study designed to highlight the impacts of soil properties on water and solute transport from buried trickle emitters. The analysis addresses the influence of soil hydraulic properties, soil layering, trickle discharge rate, irrigation frequency, and timing of nutrient application on wetting patterns and solute distribution. We show that (1) trickle irrigation can improve plant water availability in medium and low permeability fine-textured soils, providing that design and management are adapted to account for their soil hydraulic properties, (2) in highly permeable coarse-textured soils, water and nutrients move quickly downwards from the emitter, making it difficult to wet the near surface zone if emitters are buried too deep, and (3) changing the fertigation strategy for highly permeable coarse-textured soils to apply nutrients at the beginning of an irrigation cycle can maintain larger amounts of nutrient near to and above the emitter, thereby making them less susceptible to leaching losses. The results demonstrate the need to account for differences in soil hydraulic properties and solute transport when designing irrigation and fertigation management strategies. Failure to do this will result in inefficient systems and lost opportunities for reducing the negative environmental impacts of irrigation...|$|R

Conversely, AOA were detected in the <b>trickling</b> filter <b>system</b> at 1. 54 x 107 cells/mL. In the activated sludge systems AOA were more abundant than AOB. In the activated sludge system with the higher AOB numbers, AOA abundance ranged from 4. 32 x 106 cells/mL to 1. 77 x 108 cells/mL, and in the activated sludge system with the lower AOB numbers, AOA abundance ranged from 6. 15 x 106 cells/mL to 2. 69 x 108 cells/mL. The high abundance of AOA in the nitrifying refinery wastewater treatment systems suggested that AOA may {{play an important role in}} nitrification in these reactors. However microautoradiography coupled with CARD-FISH (conducted by Dr Marc Muβmann, University of Vienna) indicated that the AOA were not chemoautotrophic ammonia-oxidizers. Assessment of AOA and AOB abundance in relation to ammonia removal in the treatment plants indicated that ammonia removal was consistent with the AOB numbers detected and thus, AOB are probably responsible for most of the nitrification observed and the overall contribution of putative AOA to nitrification in these wastewater treatment plants appears to be relatively minor.
