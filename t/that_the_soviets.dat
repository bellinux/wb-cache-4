5000|$|The initial CIA mistake {{proved to}} be regrettable, however the British would later share {{intelligence}} from Penkovsky with their American allies. For the following eighteen months, Penkovsky supplied {{a tremendous amount of}} information to his British Secret Intelligence Service handlers in Moscow, Ruari and Janet Chisholm, and to CIA and SIS contacts during his permitted trips abroad. Most significantly, he was responsible for arming President John F. Kennedy with <b>the</b> information <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> nuclear arsenal was much smaller than previously thought, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> fueling systems were not fully operational, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> guidance systems were not yet functional.|$|R
5|$|It {{was during}} this period <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> started to assert {{themselves}} in several new theaters of action, in particular through Cuban proxies during the Angolan Civil War starting in 1975 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on containing Communism and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} delays that {{affected}} {{the development and}} deployment of the CF-100 could also affect its successor, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were working on newer jet-powered bombers that would render the CF-100 ineffective, the RCAF began looking for a supersonic, missile-armed replacement for the Canuck even before it had entered service. In March 1952, the RCAF's Final Report of the All-Weather Interceptor Requirements Team was submitted to Avro Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets {{bought an}} example of, and plans for, the {{machinery}} of the later Duca d'Aosta-class cruisers and had some difficulty in adapting the smaller hull for the larger and more-powerful machinery, {{so much so that}} it delayed the start of construction. Another problem was that the Italian design had to be adapted to use the Soviet preference for a mix of longitudinal framing for the hull framing amidships and transverse framing for the ends, while also reinforcing the hull structure to withstand the more-severe weather conditions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> commonly encountered.|$|E

5|$|The {{third stage}} of Zeppelin {{involved}} a delay until 21 May, {{on the basis}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had asked {{for them to be}} synchronised with their own invasion plans. This ran from 21 April until 9 May, when a major revision to the plans (stage four) was introduced. The Twelfth Army and Polish forces would land in Albania and Croatia, bypassing Greece due to mutiny within Allied Greek forces in Africa, with an invasion set in June. A major invasion of Southern France was also added, codenamed Vendetta.|$|E
5|$|To {{add to the}} debate, it was {{becoming}} clear that the missile gap was fictional. The first Corona spy satellite mission in August 1960 put limits on their program {{that appeared to be}} well below the lower bound of any of the estimates, and a follow-up mission in late 1961 clearly demonstrated the US had a massive strategic lead. A new intelligence report published in 1961 reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had no more than 25 ICBMs and {{would not be able to}} add more for some time.|$|E
5|$|Zeus used {{mechanically}} steered radars, {{like the}} Nike SAMs before it, {{limiting the number}} of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not even have to land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did have hundreds of missiles, they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to replace it with a simpler system.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the project's conception, {{newspapers}} were reporting a rumor that the Soviet Union was planning to detonate a hydrogen bomb on the Moon. According to press reports in late 1957, an anonymous source had divulged to a United States Secret Service agent <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> planned to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution by causing a nuclear explosion on the Moon to coincide with a lunar eclipse on 7 November. News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting {{the dark side of the}} terminator—Project A119 would also consider this boundary as the target for an explosion. It was also reported that a failure to hit the Moon would likely result in the missile returning to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{election}} as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper {{to conduct a}} then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess {{the attitudes of the}} Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed that he should have taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian {{embassy in}} Moscow {{learned of the}} Soviets' {{interest}} in a series initially through reading {{an article in the}} Soviet Izvestia newspaper in the winter of 1971–1972. Diplomat Gary Smith, responsible for sport and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union, read <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were looking for a new challenge in ice hockey. Smith met with Izvestia sports editor Boris Fedosov initially, then followed up with a meeting with Soviet hockey boss Andrei Starovoitov. The Soviets divulged that they were ready to play in a series between its national team and Canadian professionals. After the meetings, Canadian ambassador Robert Ford passed the matter to Ottawa to negotiate a series and Hockey Canada was given the task to nail down the terms for a series.|$|E
5|$|The men's tournament {{was first}} {{held at the}} 1920 Summer Olympics and {{integrated}} in the Winter Olympic program starting with the 1924 Winter Olympics. The Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the NHL and other professional leagues {{were not allowed to}} play. Canada dominated the first three decades, winning six of seven gold medals. The Soviet Union first participated in 1956, and overtook Canada as the dominant international team, winning seven of the nine tournaments in which they participated. The only two tournaments <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> failed to win, in 1960 and 1980, were hosted and won by the United States. Other nations to win gold include Great Britain in 1936, Sweden in 1994 and 2006, and the Czech Republic in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly {{released}} to Army Group Don, by Army Group A, the 17th Panzer Division was ordered {{back to its}} original area of concentration, and did not prepare {{to go back to}} Army Group Don until 10 days after it had been asked for. In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces, and seeing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River, Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army. Manstein hoped that the 6th Army would launch an offensive of its own, from the opposite side, upon the receipt of the code signal Thunderclap. Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out, and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket. On 10 December, Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours.|$|E

5|$|For an answer, McElroy {{turned to}} the Re-entry Body Identification Group (RBIG), a {{sub-group}} of the Gaither Committee led by William E. Bradley, Jr. that had been studying the issue of penetrating a Soviet ABM system. The RBIG had delivered an extensive report on the topic on 2 April 1958 which suggested that defeating a Soviet ABM system would not be difficult. Their primary suggestion was to arm US missiles {{with more than one}} warhead, a concept known as Multiple Re-entry Vehicles (MRV). Each warhead would also be modified with radiation hardening, ensuring only a near miss could damage it. This would mean <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> would have to launch at least one interceptor for each US warhead, while the US could launch multiple warheads without building a single new missile. If the Soviets added more interceptors to counter the increased number of US warheads, the US could counter this with a smaller number of new missiles of their own. The cost balance was always in favor of the offense. This basic concept would remain the primary argument against ABMs for the next two decades.|$|E
5|$|Hockey Canada and the Soviet Hockey Federation met in Prague in April 1972 {{during the}} IIHF World Ice Hockey Championships. The two sides {{agreed on the}} terms: four games in Canada, {{to be held in}} Montreal (Montreal Forum), Toronto (Maple Leaf Gardens), Winnipeg (Winnipeg Arena), and Vancouver (Pacific Coliseum) and four games in the Soviet Union, all of them to be held in Moscow at the Luzhniki Ice Palace. The Canadians agreed to hold the series in September and play the games under {{international}} rules. The Canadians agreed to IIHF amateur referees in the Canada part of the series, and European referees in the Moscow games. The refereeing would use the international two referee system, not the one referee, two linemen system in place in the NHL, and, at the time, being introduced into international play. The Canadian side agreed to the terms under the belief that the Canadians would have no difficulty winning under any set of conditions. Joe Kryczka, president of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), who was present at the negotiations, felt however, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> had demanded the concessions for their own benefit, believing that their team was already equal to any NHL team. The NHL later requested dates in October or November but the idea was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Implementing the {{deception}} operation {{did not go}} through entirely without incident. Initially the Soviets were {{kept in the dark}} about Egyptian intentions to go to war. Instead, on October 2, they were told that an Israeli raid was expected. Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service, General Fouad Nassar, informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer, General Samakhodsky, that the raid was expected to be a large-scale attack, coupled with an air strike. Though Samakhodsky appeared at first to believe Nassar's story, it became clear to the Egyptians <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> were suspicious. In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by October 3 reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to go to war on October 3. Promptly, the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt, and both leaders reluctantly agreed. Egyptian commanders were taken completely by surprise, when, beginning late evening on October 4, Soviet experts serving with field units, embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated. By October 5, the evacuation was complete. This incident would be an important factor in convincing the Israelis that war was likely.|$|E
