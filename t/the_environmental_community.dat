25|$|On August 2, 2016, it's been {{revealed}} that the proposed project of constructing a combined expanded convention center attached to an arena and hotel has been revived and that a $1 million feasibility study for a combined arena, hotel and expanded convention center was requested by Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake from the Maryland Stadium Authority and that the Maryland Stadium Authority has approved the study. Funding {{is coming from the}} Maryland Stadium Authority ($126,667), the State of Maryland (an additional $500,000 is available immediately to fund this study), the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore ($30,000), the Greater Baltimore Committee ($30,000), and the City of Baltimore ($313,333). The study will take approximately a year to complete and is expected to be completed and released in Fall 2017. The study will look at having either just a convention center expansion and having a combined expanded convention center attached to a new arena and hotel, the study will look at <b>the</b> <b>environmental,</b> <b>community</b> and traffic impacts of the two proposals and what types of events the new facility will be able to attract, this study will also determine exactly how large the expanded convention center is supposed to be. The new complex will be bounded by Pratt, Charles and Conway Streets. This study will not include construction and budget plans as this is just phase 1, if the state and city elects to move forward after reviewing the results of this study, that second study will put together just partial plans to obtain a cost estimate.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Interest {{groups have}} participated in the American {{political}} system since the signing of the U. S. Constitution. Environmental interest groups, a subsection of the American interest group society, have been especially active in national policies since <b>the</b> proliferation of <b>environmental</b> laws and <b>environmental</b> advocacy in <b>the</b> 1960 s and 1970 s. When environmental laws were passed in the late 1960 s, environmental interest groups were able to affect policy decisions through court action. These laws expanded a citizen's standing to sue and made it possible for environmental groups to use litigation to change environmental policies. Today, we are beginning to see environmental groups impact national policy decisions using alternative strategies in addition to their historically effective litigation options. This thesis examines environmental groups' new roles in national policy-making. Political science models describing how interest groups have affected national policies throughout history, including the iron triangle and issue network models, are discussed. Models describing how environmental groups fit into the policy process after <b>the</b> passage of <b>environmental</b> laws in <b>the</b> late 1960 s and early 1970 s is also included. A case study regarding <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>community's</b> ability to influence the fate of "The Coral Reef Bill" is used to illustrate environmental groups' new strategies and roles. The Coral Reef Bill, introduced in the U. S. House of Representatives in March of 2000, was intended to establish protection and research programs for coral reefs in U. S. waters. The bill was amended in a manner that changed its conservation implications, which raised a great deal of concern among environmental interest groups, specifically marine conservation groups. <b>The</b> <b>environmental</b> (marine conservation) <b>community</b> was instrumental in striking down this undesirable amendment. How <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> interest groups were successful in affecting policy is demonstrative of their new roles in national policymaking. The current and future status of marine legislation, and <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>community's</b> potential role in future legislation, is also discussed...|$|R
