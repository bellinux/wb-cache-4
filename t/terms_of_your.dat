Sometimes I'm wracked with guilt when I needn't be, and that, to me, is left over from my Catholic upbringing. Because in Catholicism you are born a sinner {{and you are a}} sinner all of your life. No matter how you try to get away from it, the sin is within you all the time.|$|E

5000|$|In 1797, {{during the}} battle of Fishguard, British {{commander}} John Campbell, 1st Baron Cawdor, bluffed French invaders into surrendering to his much smaller force.

6000|$|Yes, dearest Mr. Kenyon, we mean, if we can, {{to go to}} Rome in the autumn. It is {{very wrong}} of you not to come too, and the reasons you give against it {{are by no means}} conclusive. My opinion is that, {{whatever}} the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> natural life may be, you would probably have an additional ten years fastened on to it by coming to the Continent, and so I tease you and tease you, as is natural to such an opinion. People twirl now in their arm-chairs, and the vitality in them kindles as they rush along. Remember how pleased you were when you were at Como! Don't draw a chalk circle round you and fancy you can't move. Even tables and chairs have taken to move lately, and hats spin round without a giddy head in them. Is this a time to stand still, even in the garden at Wimbledon? 'I speak to a wise man; judge what I say.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This is his address," [...] {{said the}} lady, rising, and handing him an envelope. [...] "I shall not feel at rest {{until he is}} safely interned. You will not mention my name, of course. It is tragic to be obliged to work against one's friends in the dark.

6000|$|... "You will understand," [...] Jack said, [...] "that {{you will}} be allowed to take your arms solely as a {{protection}} against the peasants, who have been justly enraged by the brutal atrocities <b>of</b> <b>your</b> general. You know well that even could their leaders here obtain from their followers a respect for the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> surrender, <b>your</b> men would be massacred in the first village through which they passed were they deprived of their arms. My friends here are desirous that no stigma of massacre shall rest upon the Spanish honor, and they have therefore agreed to allow your men to keep their arms for purposes of defense on their return march." ...|$|R
50|$|Yes. We {{hear that}} quite a lot.

But to force you to pay for something? I don’t see why not. It may not be a good idea, but I don’t see why it’s unconstitutional.|$|R
6000|$|... "A friend," [...] {{said the}} Prelate, [...] "whose stripes should be {{received}} as benefits.

6000|$|... "No more. It {{is wise to}} be sparing of our pledges, and to say no {{more than}} the {{occasion}} requires.

If not one way, why, then, in another, your wager is lost." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{after many}} a hearty {{struggle}} past, I condescended to be pleased at last. Soon as he said, 'My mistress and my wife!

60|$|My dear Miss Haworth,--I do {{hope you}} have not set us quite on the outside <b>of</b> <b>your</b> heart with the unfeeling and ungrateful. I say 'us' when I ought to have said 'me,' for you have known Robert, and you have not known me, and I am {{naturally}} less safe with you than he is--less safe in your esteem. We should both have gone to inquire after your health {{if he had not}} been attacked with influenza, and unfit for anything until the days you mentioned as the probable <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> remaining in town had passed. I waited till he should be better, and the malady lingered. Now he is well, and I do hope you may be so too. May it be! Bear us in mind and love, for we go away to-morrow to Paris--where, however, we shall expect you before long. Thank you, thank you, for the books. I have been struck and charmed with some things in the 'Companion'--especially, may I say, with the 'Modern Pygmalion,' which catches me on my weak side of the love of wonder. By the way, what am I to say of Swedenborg and mesmerism? So much I could--the books have so drawn and held me (as far as I was capable of being drawn or held, in this chaos of London)--that I will not speak at all. The note-page is too small--the haste I write in, too great.|$|R
