30|$|Flexibility in hybrid {{energy system}} has been studied widely. In [11], a {{hierarchical}} framework was developed for an integrated community energy system, with both operating cost minimization and tie-line power smoothing considered as objectives, and <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> load was used to smooth the tie-line power according to its demand response potential. An integrated optimal power flow method was developed to obtain the optimal set-points of different components. <b>Thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> load, together with battery storage, was also used in [14] for providing micro-grid smoothing services. So far the <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> load was only used as demand side response to service the external grid. <b>Thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> load has characteristics that allow it to solve many other problems, such as to improve the economic performance of a {{hybrid energy system}}.|$|R

A timing device, operatively connected to a valve actuating mechanism, opens the valve for a predetermined length of time at predetermined intervals.

When {{a significant portion of}} a population of <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads is forced to change their on-off state simultaneously, the aggregate power demand of such population presents large, underdamped oscillations, a well-known phenomenon referred to by power utilities as “cold-load pickup”.

5000|$|While the {{majority}} of these pumps mount nearest to the hot water heater and have no adjustable temperature capabilities, a significant reduction in energy can be achieved by using a temperature adjustable <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> circulation pump mounted at the last fixture on the loop. <b>Thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> circulation pumps allow owners to choose the desired temperature of hot water to be maintained within the hot water pipes since most homes do not require [...] degree water instantly out of their taps. <b>Thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> circulation pumps cycle on and off to maintain a user's chosen temperature and consume less energy than a continuously operating pump. By installing a <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> pump just after the farthest fixture on the loop, cyclic pumping maintains ready hot water up to the last fixture on the loop instead of wasting energy heating the piping from the last fixture to the water heater. Often installing a circulation pump at the farthest fixture on hot water circulation loop due to limited available space, cosmetics, noise restrictions or lack of available power. Recent advancements in hot water circulation technology allow for benefiting from temperature controlled pumping without having to install the pump at the last fixture on the hot water loop. These advanced hot water circulation systems utilize a water contacting temperature probe strategically installed at the last fixture on the loop to minimize the energy wasted heating lengthy return pipes. Thermal insulation applied to the pipes helps mitigate this second loss and minimize the amount of water that must be pumped to keep hot water constantly available.|$|R

40|$|To {{study the}} impacts of price {{responsive}} demand on the electric power system requires better load models. This paper discusses the modeling of uncertainties in aggregated <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads using a state queueing (SQ) model. The cycling times of <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> appliances (TCAs) vary with the TCA types and sizes, {{as well as the}} ambient temperatures. The random consumption of consumers, which shortens or prolongs a specific TCA cycling period, introduces another degree of uncertainty. By modifying the state transition matrix, these random factors can be taken into account in a discrete SQ model. The impacts of considering load diversity in the SQ model while simulating TCA setpoint response are also studied. Comment: 9 pages, 19 figures, accepted to IEEE Transactions on Power System...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: During service restoration, {{the power}} level at buses can {{significantly}} {{differ from the}} one presented under steady-state conditions, demanding an amount of electric power {{significantly higher than the}} normal load. Hence, their post-outage behavior must be adequately forecasted in order to permit the development of reliable restoration plans, or to avoid inadequate actions that may lead to a subsequent shutdown of the electric power system. This problem is known in the literature as cold load pick-up and the <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads can be pointed as the main responsible for this behavior. Approach: This study proposes a methodology to model the <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> load behavior during the reenergization process, based on object oriented programming and the physical modeling of individual loads, avoiding the explicitly modeling of the electric distribution feeder. In this context, the load aggregation is also implemented using “feeder” classes in an hierarchical structure. Results: The methodology was tested considering distinct devices distributed along a hypothetical feeder and the results show the impacts of interruption duration and environmental temperature in the load behavior. Conclusion: The Cold-load phenomena can be successfully simulated based on physical parameters of <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads using object-oriented programming, yielding satisfactory results.

40|$|Demand side {{management}} and demand response aim {{to maximize the}} efficiency of the electricity delivery process by exploiting the flexibility of customers. At residential level, demand response can be applied only to a limited number of appliances, through load management, due to user intervention or dedicated automated actions. One category of appliances which concur well with demand response is the <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> appliances. They operate in cycles and maintain the temperature of a process around a set-point and within certain temperature limits. When demand response is applied, the <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> appliance is utilized as an energy buffer and a temporary increase or decrease in power and energy consumption is induced. This work focuses on the application of demand response to the operation of a typical domestic freezer. Real-time predictive control models are developed for this application and are validated during practical experiments...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the possibility of}} providing voltage control-based ancillary services using <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads (TCLs). The idea {{is to change the}} voltage at the point of common coupling in order to control power consumption of the TCLs through time. This allows to utilize {{the most common type of}} loads in the grid to provide ancillary services. These services differ from usual demand response strategies that operate on short to medium time scales. In this paper the authors propose a controller that regulate the power consumption by minimizing the power consumption error signal and by taking physical restrictions into account. Voltage restrictions arise due to the small window of voltage variability about the nominal value of the controlled voltage. In addition, capacitor bank switching interactions with motor and <b>thermostatically</b> <b>controlled</b> loads is discussed. QC 20161213 EU funded FP 7 iTesla projec...|$|R
