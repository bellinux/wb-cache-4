5|$|Following the Wales Test Dixon and the WRU {{continued}} to clash over referee appointments. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> escalated {{to the point}} where Dixon threatened {{to pull out of the}} All Blacks' remaining Welsh fixtures. The WRU responded by threatening to cancel the fixtures if their referee choices were rejected. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> was resolved when the chairman of the RFU, Rowland Hill, got the WRU to accept Gil Evans (a Welshman from Birmingham) as referee for the final three matches.

5|$|It was {{becoming}} clear that federal intervention {{was required to}} settle <b>the</b> <b>dispute,</b> despite the general policy of the Grant administration {{to stay out of}} the affairs of Southern states. The President often expressed annoyance with Southern governors who requested help from federal troops to combat regular waves of election year violence, with little compassion for the issues they faced. Grant and the United States Attorney General, George Henry Williams, issued a joint communique supporting Baxter and ordering Brooks to vacate the capitol. They also referred <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> back to the State Legislature.|$|E

5|$|Randall spent early December {{in conference}} with Tilden while {{committees}} examined the votes from <b>the</b> <b>disputed</b> states. <b>The</b> counts of <b>the</b> <b>disputed</b> ballots were inconclusive, {{with each of}} the states in question producing two sets of returns: one signed by Democratic officials, the other by Republicans, each claiming victory for their man. By January 1877, with the question still unresolved, Congress and President Grant agreed to submit the matter to a bipartisan Electoral Commission, which would be authorized to determine the fate of <b>the</b> <b>disputed</b> electoral votes.|$|R

5|$|By 1948, Croatia and Serbia {{agreed on}} two {{modifications}} of the border—the village of Bapska {{was transferred to}} Croatia, while Jamena {{was turned over to}} Vojvodina. No further changes to the border were agreed upon. A map of the area issued by the Yugoslav People's Army Military-Geographic Institute in 1967 depicts the border along the cadastre-based boundary, corresponding to the Croatian claim in <b>the</b> <b>dispute.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 2011, Serbian diplomats {{made several}} {{requests}} to the EU, asking it to pressure Croatia to resolve <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> before Croatia's accession {{to the union}} {{out of fear that}} it might follow the Slovene example and stall Serbian accession similar to the impasse between Croatia and Slovenia over their border disputes and the subsequent blockade of the Croatian EU accession negotiation process. The request was denied by the EU. Croatian President Ivo Josipović said that <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> was the most contentious issue of Croatia–Serbia relations but added that it should not be difficult to resolve. In 2012, Josipović stated that Croatia should not block Serbia's EU accession over the issue and suggested that <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> should be resolved through arbitration, which is considered to be an acceptable solution by both countries. In 2014, the Croatian ambassador to Serbia reiterated Josipović's stance from 2012. On the other hand, Zoran Milanović, the Prime Minister of Croatia, said that the resolution of the border dispute would be Croatia's condition placed before Serbia in its EU accession negotiations.|$|E
5000|$|The report {{submitted}} by Justice Liberhan {{has come under}} severe criticism for being biased and rhetorical in nature.

5|$|Cagney's last {{movie in}} 1935 was Ceiling Zero, his third film with Pat O'Brien. O'Brien {{received}} top billing, {{which was a}} clear breach of Cagney's contract. This, combined {{with the fact that}} Cagney had made five movies in 1934, again against his contract terms, caused him to bring legal proceedings against Warner Bros. for breach of contract. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> dragged on for several months. Cagney received calls from David Selznick and Sam Goldwyn, but neither felt in a position to offer him work while <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> went on. Meanwhile, while being represented by his brother William in court, Cagney went back to New York to search for a country property where he could indulge his passion for farming.|$|E

5|$|Diệm's {{denial of}} {{governmental}} {{responsibility for the}} incident, and instead blaming members of the Viet Cong insurgency, led to growing discontent among the Buddhist majority. The incident spurred a protest movement by Buddhists against the religious discrimination of Diệm's Roman Catholic-dominated regime. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> {{came to be known}} as the Buddhist crisis, and it provoked widespread and large-scale civil disobedience throughout South Vietnam, persisting throughout May. The objective of the protests was to have Decree Number 10 repealed, and to force the implementation of religious equality. At the time, the United States, the main backer of South Vietnam in the Cold War, had 16,000 military advisers in the country to assist the Army of the Republic of Vietnam in the war against the Vietcong insurgency, which sought to reunify Vietnam under communist rule. Washington wanted <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> with the Buddhists to be resolved quickly so that it would not dampen public morale and detract from the fight against the Vietcong.|$|E
