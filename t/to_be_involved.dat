5|$|For visual course control, flies' optic {{flow field}} is {{analyzed}} {{by a set}} of motion-sensitive neurons. A subset of these neurons is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in using the optic flow to estimate the parameters of self-motion, such as yaw, roll, and sideward translation. Other neurons are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> in analyzing the content of the visual scene itself, such as separating figures from the ground using motion parallax. The H1 neuron is responsible for detecting horizontal motion across the entire visual field of the fly, allowing the fly to generate and guide stabilizing motor corrections midflight with respect to yaw. The ocelli are concerned in the detection of changes in light intensity, enabling the fly to react swiftly to the approach of an object.|$|E
5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> {{in the majority}} of cases, either directly or indirectly.

These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
