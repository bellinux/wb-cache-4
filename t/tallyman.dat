40|$|Although {{there has}} been a {{tremendous}} amount of past and future development in the James Bay region of northern Canada, {{there has been}} very little empirical research that examined the impact of economic development on Cree <b>tallymen,</b> who are the senior grassroots managers of this vulnerable ecosystem. This oversight is particularly important because the region is currently facing the possibility of additional large-scale hydroelectric development and there is no existing baseline information on past impacts on Cree <b>tallymen.</b> In addition, <b>tallymen</b> continue to have important cultural significance to the Cree Nation and also broader significance to the field of sustainable management. This article attempts to fill this gap by providing ethnographic research on the impact of past development on Cree <b>tallymen</b> from the perspectives of the <b>tallymen</b> themselves. The author also draws implications for environmental impact assessments in the region and, more broadly, for the future study of ecologically embedded managers such as the Cree <b>tallymen...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} nature of Wemindji Cree {{territorial}} identity. It uses a mixed methods approach combining qualitative geographic information systems (GIS) and ethnography. GIS was used to categorize a database of Wemindji Cree place names within local and traditional naming systems. The resulting maps produce a picture of Wemindji Cree life as a 'view from nowhere' disconnected from lived life on the ground. Participant observation of life in Wemindji, especially amongst <b>tallymen</b> (trapline bosses), over two seasons provided an ethnography of Cree life both in town and on the land. The situated perspective 'on the ground' offers specifics of daily life that revolve around maps. Inscriptions such as maps have been incorporated into the everyday lives of <b>tallymen,</b> who are respected leaders in Wemindji. Rundstrom's categories of inscribing (written) versus incorporating (oral) cultures were found to elude mutual exclusivity. Wemindji Cree are a residually oral culture with a dependence on maps necessitated by the tracking and discussion of incursions from state-industrial interests in trapline territories and {{by the need to}} commemorate traditional life on the land. Maps are thus necessary but not sufficient for explaining Wemindji Cree territorial identity. Ethnographic depth was included to round out strictly inscribed accounts of identities demonstrated to revolve to a great extent around the leadership of the <b>tallymen.</b> A balance of inscribed (through GIS maps) and embodied (through ethnography) accounts of Wemindji Cree life as lived through movement, wayfaring and the business of life both in town and on the land, helped produce the resulting ethnogeographic account of Wemindji Cree life and territorial identity...|$|R
40|$|As the {{millennium}} ends, ecological damage continues at an unprecedented {{rate and the}} need for sustainable management is evident. Yet managers often lack a practical template [...] how do they "walk the talk" of sustainability? There are not many concrete examples. However, the management practices of indigenous peoples can provide important concrete insights into the practice of sustainable management. Using ethnographic data collected on the Cree <b>tallymen</b> of eastern James Bay (subarctic Canada), this paper provides empirical data on a First Nations approach to sustainable management and explores "traditional ecological knowledge" (TEK) as an indigenous management system that has successfully avoided ecological collapse. Perhaps most critically, research findings indicate that a TEK-based management approach is both socially and ecologically embedded. In turn, the embeddedness of TEK gives rise to a number of key principles for sustainable management: (i) humble pragmatism, (ii) a fundamental commitment to social and ecological reciprocity, and (iii) managerial leadership is based on ecological legitimacy gained through TEK. TEK also emphasizes the {{need to learn how to}} manage sustainability from outside the organization's four walls. As {{the millennium}} draws near, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) may provide a powerful template for a sustainable future...|$|R
