25|$|Margaret Duley (1894–1968) {{was arguably}} Newfoundland's first novelist {{to gain an}} {{international}} audience. Amongst her works are The Eyes of the Gull (1936), Cold Pastoral (1939} and Highway to Valour (1941). Subsequent important novelists include Harold Horwood, who wrote <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Will</b> Be Sunday (1966) and White Eskimo (1972), and Percy Janes, author of House of Hate (1970).|$|E
500|$|Calderón {{argued that}} if he had not acted, Mexico would have become a [...] "narco-state," [...] where the drug {{trafficking}} organizations impose law at their will. [...] "I am sure that the Mexicans of <b>tomorrow</b> <b>will</b> remember these days as the moment when the country took the decision to defend itself, with all its force, against a voracious criminal phenomenon of translational dimensions," [...] Calderón said on 20 November 2012 at a ceremony for fallen soldiers. His successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, has pledged to continue the fight, but plans to adjust the strategy to reduce the level of violence.|$|E
500|$|That evening, Wellesley College neuroscientist Bevil Conway {{gave some}} {{comments}} on the phenomenon to Wired reporter Adam Rogers. Before they hung up, Rogers warned him, [...] "your <b>tomorrow</b> <b>will</b> not be the same". Conway thought the reporter was exaggerating, saying, [...] "I didn't appreciate {{the full extent of}} what was about to happen. Not even close." [...] Rogers's story eventually got 32.8 million unique visitors. Meanwhile, when Conway woke up the next morning, his inbox had so many emails about the dress that at first, he thought his email had been hacked, until he saw that the bulk were interview requests from major media organisations. [...] "I did 10 interviews and had to have a colleague take my class that day," [...] said Conway.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of the band's {{previous}} albums Almost There and Spoken For, MercyMe was given [...] "significantly" [...] more resources to develop their next record by their record label, INO Records. Although they decided not to alter their Christian approach to songwriting, live performances, and interviews, they opted to work with outside songwriters on the album, employed the London Symphony Orchestra to play strings on several tracks, and added a sixth member to the band, guitarist Barry Graul. Additionally, MercyMe wrote and recorded the music for Undone before they wrote any of the lyrics. Lead singer Bart Millard noted that by using this method, instead of his lyrics swaying the musical elements of the song, the music acted as [...] "a canvas with which to write [...] ". He elaborated that [...] "We’ve been making records for 10 years, so anything that sparks creativity... is very much welcomed". The title of the album was inspired by [...] "the unexpected twists and turns in the band's journey"; Millard commented that [...] "We had our plans for {{what we were going to}} do; but when the bigger picture happened, all of our plans came unraveled. We don’t know what <b>tomorrow</b> <b>will</b> hold. When you make your own plans, you suddenly find yourself undone; and that’s exactly where God wants us in the first place".|$|E
2500|$|... "1967 {{marked the}} opening of the St. John's Arts and Culture Centre and the first all-Canadian Dominion Drama Festival. Playwrights across Canada began writing, and this {{explosion}} was also felt in Newfoundland and Labrador. Subregional festivals saw Newfoundland plays compete - Wreakers by Cassie Brown, <b>Tomorrow</b> <b>Will</b> Be Sunday by Tom Cahill, and Holdin' Ground by Ted Russell. Cahill's play went on to receive top honours and a performance at Expo 67 in Montreal. [...] Joining Brown and Cahill in the seventies were Michael Cook and Al Pittman, both prolific writers".|$|E
2500|$|In 1886, Koyle heard {{a sermon}} on gaining a {{testimony}} through manifestations, so he prayed {{to gain a}} testimony. That night, he dreamed of a lost cow in a field that had an injured horn which poked its own eye. A voice asked him, [...] "If you find your cow at this place <b>tomorrow,</b> <b>will</b> {{you believe that the}} Restored Gospel is true?" [...] He responded yes, and that morning he reportedly saw the injured cow just as the voice had told him. Historian Kevin Cantera compared the Dream Miners' views of this experience with traditional LDS views of Joseph Smith's First Vision.|$|E

2500|$|The machine {{releases}} all of {{the lawn}} gnomes and they erupt onto the beach. The beach goers flee in panic of [...] "gnomeageddon" [...] and the beach is destroyed. Candace does not realize this as {{she is trying to}} convince her mother not to come in and ruin her good time, so when she tries to justify the beach's existence, she finds nothing but their normal backyard. Candace is depressed, but the boys find the day to be a successful one. Candace is helped inside by Isabella and Linda. At the end, the DJ from the beginning congratulates Phineas and Ferb and also says that <b>tomorrow</b> <b>will</b> be hot and sunny too, but then Ferb adds [...] "with a slight chance of scattered lawn gnomes", to which Phineas (and probably a lot of viewers) laughs. Then there is a zoom-out and the gnomes that crashed into the Flynn-Fletcher household roof are seen.|$|E
2500|$|Political infighting with career Ford executives, notably Lee Iacocca, {{led to his}} {{dismissal}} from Ford on September 11, 1969. Reportedly, Henry Ford II sent Ford's {{vice president}} for public relations, Ted Mecke, to Knudsen's home the previous night to inform {{him that he would}} be fired, telling Knudsen that [...] "Henry sent me here to tell you that <b>tomorrow</b> <b>will</b> be a rough day at work." [...] When Ford made the decision official the next day, Bunkie said [...] "I'm shocked" [...] to which Ford replied, [...] "I imagine you would be." [...] Noted for his laconic replies to difficult questions, Mr. Ford told the media [...] "Things just didn't work out", but later reports indicated many career Ford executives allied themselves with Iacocca and were working against Knudsen. His dismissal led to a widely circulated witticism in Ford circles as the hallmark phrase of Henry Ford I, [...] "History is bunk", was turned around to [...] "Bunkie is history".|$|E
