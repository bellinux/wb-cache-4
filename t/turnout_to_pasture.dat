40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of supplementary concentrate feeding level (Low, LC; High, HC) to grass silage and/or turnout date to pasture in spring (Early, ET; Late, LT) for a second grazing season on performance to slaughter of spring-born, weaned beef calves (n = 188). Experiment 1 comprised of two concentrate levels (0. 5 and 1. 5 kg/day). Experiment 2 comprised of two turnout dates (19 March, 9 April). Experiment 3 comprised of two concentrate levels (0. 5 kg and 2. 0 kg/day) and two turnout dates (22 March, 12 April). In Experiment 1, live-weight gain during the indoor winter period was 25 kg higher (P 0. 05) total live-weight gain for both treatments. In Experiment 2, live weight at <b>turnout</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture</b> was 11 kg lower (P 0. 05), subsequently. In Experiments 1 and 2, live-weight gain during the finishing period and carcass weight, conformation and fat scores did not differ (P > 0. 05) between the treatments. In Experiment 3, at <b>turnout</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture,</b> HC were 35 kg heavier (P 0. 05) between the concentrate levels, whereas they were higher (P < 0. 05) for ET than LT. Economic and stochastic analysis of Experiment 3 indicated that, in the context of whole-farm systems, (i) feeding HC was dependent on date of sale such that only where progeny were sold at the start of the second grazing season, net farm margin (NFM) was increased, (ii) ET only increased NFM where progeny were retained through to finish and, (iii) taking progeny through to finish was more profitable than selling earlier in the animals’ lifetime. In conclusion, subsequent compensatory growth at pasture diminishes the growth and economic advantage from concentrate supplementation or early <b>turnout</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture,</b> of young late-maturing cattle. peer-reviewe...|$|E

Pasture infectivity was consistently higher in control pastures and there was a sixfold difference between treatment (56 L 3 /kg) and control (358 L 3 /kg) pastures by the time of winter housing on October 18. This study confirmed earlier studies in northern USA demonstrating the value of two strategic treatments in achieving significant increases in weight gains and hastening the time of first breeding by one to three months at a saving of $ 40 to $ 140 per heifer. This dosing strategy was a satisfactory method of parasite control without undue selection for drug resistance. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} 2 {{prophylactic}} treatments with albendazole (7. 5 mg/kg) was evaluated in Ohio, USA, in 2 groups of Holstein dairy replacement heifers treated 3 and 6 weeks after <b>turnout</b> <b>to</b> spring <b>pasture</b> on May 2, 1983. The lightweight {{group consisted of}} twelve 7 - to 9 -month-old heifers with a mean initial weight of 201. 1 kg. The heavyweight group consisted of ten 11 - to 15 -month-old heifers with a mean weight of 319. 4 kg. Within each group, the heifers were paired by initial weight, and one member of each pair was randomly assigned to the treatment group. Each of the 4 resulting groups grazed separate, contaminated pastures (mainly Haemonchus, Ostertagia and Cooperia) until winter housing on Oct 31, 1983. The albendazole-treated, lightweight heifers had bodyweight gains 28. 9 % greater {{than those of the}} control heifers at the end of 23 weeks (P< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference in}} gain for the treated heavyweight heifers, which had a lower feeding rate/kg of bodyweight than did the lightweight heifers. At the end of the study, there was a 7 -fold difference in mean pasture L 3 counts between treatment (1303 L 3 /kg) and control (9153 L 3 /kg) replicates. It is concluded that it is desirable to treat all heifers in northern regions during their first spring at pasture. ...|$|R

40|$|Grassland are {{now being}} {{acknowledge}} for their multifunctional role. However the intensification of livestock production {{has led to a}} decrease in grassland use. In the production of the french cheese named Roquefort many farmers have abandoned natural grassland use to feed the milking ewes. This trend is less pronounced in few farmers' group wishing reduction in farm input and environemental impact while using the grassland. In order to maintain the level of the milk production the farmers have to innovate in new grazing systems and <b>turnout</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture</b> practices. Designing new grazing practices requires understanding of links between the animal feeding and grassland management. To develop the necessary knowledge we have built a research project involving farmers. This project study has focused on the benefits from the large diversity of cultivated providing more flexibility in the farm management. We have conducted 20 -farmers's interviews to have an insight into the grassland and herd management's practices, and milk production results. A multivariate analysis has permitted to define 5 patterns of <b>turnout</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture</b> managements. For each pattern we have described a different milking curve for two-first months of pasture. The milking curves are based on the milk level and the milk persistency. The main results report on links between feeding practices and milk production. Further analysis of the different patterns could identify the predisposing factors of the milk persistency. We have showed that some practices such as large diversity of grazing grassland use are favorable for maintaining the high level of milk production. The two main conclusions are firstly the traditional feeding system can be used to the levels of milk production. Secondly, the livestock intensification needs protein supply use combined with the large diversity of cultivated grassland. These points can be easily applied while advising farmers...|$|E

40|$|Milk {{yield and}} pre-weaning calf {{performance}} of spring-calving Charolais (C) and Beef × Holstein-Friesian (BF) cows was compared over 3 experiments. Cows were individually offered a restricted allowance of grass silage pre partum in Experiments 1 and 2 and ad libitum silage in Experiment 3. In all three experiments cows received silage to appetite {{for the first}} 34 (s. d. 16. 2) days of lactation. In Experiments 1 and 2, cows and calves were grazed together during the subsequent grazing seasons. The daily milk yield of C cows was significantly lower from parturition until <b>turnout</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture</b> (1. 8 to 2. 5 kg/day lower) and subsequently at pasture (4. 5 and 3. 1 kg/day lower in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively) than that of BF cows. Calves from C cows consumed more (P < 0. 01) concentrate creep feed during the indoor period than calves from BF cows. Compared to calves from BF cows, pre-weaning daily live-weight gain was lower for calves from C cows in Experiments 1 (P < 0. 05) and 2 (P = 0. 06). The pre-weaning growth response per 1 kg increase in milk yield was greater for calves from C cows than those from BF cows. In conclusion, compared to BF cows the milk yield of C cows was lower resulting in increased calf concentrate intake indoors and lower pre-weaning calf daily live-weight gains. peer-reviewedTeagasc Walsh Fellowship Programm...|$|E

40|$|L'éleveur doit en {{permanence}} concilier 2 objectifs contradictoires : maximiser l'ingestion et les performances animales individuelles, et maîtriser la hauteur d'herbe résiduelle. Pour gérer au mieux le pâturage, il est utile de connaître les répercussions de la hauteur et du rythme d'exploitation sur la repousse et la composition morphologique du couvert. Un essai conduit pendant 2 ans met en évidence que, après des coupes moyennes à hautes, la repousse est rapide et la sénescence précoce des limbes impose une exploitation à un rythme rapide (2 semaines environ). Mais après des coupes rases, la prairie repousse lentement et son entrée en sénescence est retardée, ce qui permet d'allonger l'intervalle entre exploitations d'une semaine. Ce mode d'exploitation ras génère peu de tiges, de gaines et de sénescence, et préserve la qualité des repousses. Le taux de défoliation, intégrant les hauteurs du couvert à l'entrée et à la sortie des animaux, {{permet de}} situer la fin du pâturage en préservant les performances animales. Un rapport limbes/gaines élevé assure les meilleures productions animales. Good grazing management requires {{the knowledge of}} the effects of cutting height and cutting rate on the regrowth and the morphological make-up of the sward. A trial carried out for 2 years showed that the harvested production was significantly larger when the cutting frequence was low, especially with close (3 cm) cuts. The residual biomass of culms varied from 878 to 2280 kg DM/ha when the cutting height increased from 3 to 9 cm; delayed cuttings magnified these differences. Besides, Perennial Ryegrass, when cut frequently, gave few ears; with delayed cuts, the number of ears was linked directly to the cutting height. After medium-low or high cuts, regrowth was fast and early senescence of the blades dictated a frequent cutting rate : intervals of 2 weeks in spring, of 20 days at the end of summer. On the contrary, after close cuts, regrowth was slow, and the beginning of senescence delayed, so that the intervals between cuts could be lengthened by one week. This type of management with close cuts created few ears, few sheaths, and little senescence, and the quality of aftermaths was preserved. In successive grazings, the animals ate that part of the herbage which was above the residual height of the previous cycle; the herbage thus ingested had a good digestibility. A high blade/sheath ratio leads to the largest animal yields. The defoliation rate, which takes into account the residual height and the sward height at <b>turnout</b> <b>to</b> the <b>pasture,</b> indicates when the grazing should be ended if the animal performances are to be preserved...|$|R

Journal of Agricultural Science, 136, 89 - 98. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that protein sources which are primarily degraded in the rumen such as rapeseed meal or soyabean meal may be as effective as a less rumen degradable protein source such as fishmeal in supporting higher levels of animal performance in young steers fed on grass silage. However, the response to type of protein supplement is likely to be influenced by the composition of the basal diet. This study has examined the effect of supplementing silages prepared from early (EH) and late (LH) harvested grass with two protein sources of differing rumen degradability, rapeseed meal (RSM) and fishmeal (FM) or a mixture of the two (M), thus creating eight experimental diets of LH, LHRSM, LHFM, LHM, EH, EHRSM, EHFM and EHM. Silage was offered ad libitum and supplements were included at 100 g fresh weight/kg silage DM intake. The RSM and M diets were made isonitrogenous with FM diets by the addition of urea. Animals remained on diets for 18 weeks and liveweights were monitored for a further 13 weeks while the animals were at pasture. Dry matter (DM) intakes and liveweight gains were higher with EH than with LH silage (P < 0 ? 001). Response to type of protein supplement was dependent on silage quality. On LH silage, higher intakes were noted on FM and M (82 ? 4 and 82 ? 8 g DM/unit metabolic liveweight/day, respectively) relative to silage only (75 ? 8 g DM/unit metabolic liveweight/day) and this contributed towards higher liveweight gains (P < 0 ? 01). Liveweight gains tended to be higher on LH silage supplemented with FM compared to RSM (0 ? 76 v. 0 ? 67 kg/day, respectively, P = 0 ? 08). In comparison, on EH silage, relative to EH unsupplemented, the intake was highest on M (89 ? 2 v. 96 ? 6 g DM/unit metabolic liveweight/day), but liveweight gains were not significantly different between supplements. On <b>turnout</b> <b>to</b> <b>pasture,</b> those animals fed on silage alone exhibited compensatory growth (P < 0 ? 025) with the result that those fed on LH silage only grew faster and achieved the same liveweight after 13 weeks at grass as those supplemented with RSM or M. There was a tendency for those fed on FM to maintain an advantage in liveweight after the period at pasture. On EH silage, {{at the end of the}} grazing period no significant differences in liveweight existed between the different supplements and on average were 23 kg heavier than EH silage unsupplemented. In conclusion, silage type (stage of harvest and quality) and protein supplementation influenced animal performance. On late harvest and poorer digestibility silage, there was some indication that feeding fishmeal was better than rapeseed but this was less evident on early harvest and higher digestibility silage. However, considering the price differential between these two supplements and small difference in animal performance it is concluded that rapeseed meal is as effective as fishmeal when used as a protein supplement for growing cattle fed on grass silage.
