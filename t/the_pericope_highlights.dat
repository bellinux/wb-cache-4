40|$|Scholars have {{examined}} several motifs in Luke 2 : 22 - 35, the 2 ̆ 2 Presentation 2 ̆ 2 of the Gospel of Luke. However, scholarship scarcely has treated {{the theme of}} nomos, the Septuagintal word Luke uses as a translation of the Hebrew word Torah. Nomos is mentioned {{four times in the}} Presentation narrative; it also is a word in Septuagintal Isaiah to which the metaphor of light in Luke 2 : 32 alludes. In 2 : 22 - 32 [...] a pivotal piece within Luke-Acts [...] nomos relates to several themes, including ones David Pao discusses in his study on Isaiah 2 ̆ 7 s portrayal of Israel 2 ̆ 7 s restoration, appropriated by Luke. My dissertation investigates, for the first time, the Septuagintal Isaian use of nomos in this pericope. My thesis is that Luke 2 ̆ 7 s use of nomos in <b>the</b> Presentation <b>pericope</b> <b>highlight</b> 2 ̆ 7 s Jesus 2 ̆ 7 identity as the Messiah who will restore and fulfill Israel. Methodologically, I use intertextual narrative interpretation. In Chapter One, I examine Luke 2 ̆ 7 s transitional, dual use of nomos in <b>the</b> <b>pericope.</b> This includes Luke 2 ̆ 7 s use of nomos {{on the surface of the}} text, and his allusive appropriation, in Luke 2 : 32, of nomos in the LXX-Isaiah. In Chapter Two I discuss in greater depth an overriding theme of Luke-Acts [...] the new exodus [...] and the Isaian motif of the restoration and fulfillment of Israel which establishes and informs this theme. I outline the process of Israel 2 ̆ 7 s restoration, including the role of Septuagintal Isaian nomos within it. In my discussion, I critique David Pao 2 ̆ 7 s six themes of the restoration of Israel. I argue that Luke 2 : 32 alludes to nomos, situated within a Davidic context and integral to Isaiah 2 ̆ 7 s motif of the restoration and fulfillment of Israel. I show that, consequently, this Lukan allusion discloses Jesus as the Servant Messiah who restores Israel and offers salvation to the Gentiles. Chapter Three addresses the influence of dikaiosune of the LXX-Isaiah on Luke 2 ̆ 7 s appropriation of nomos. In conclusion, I present the results of this study. Additionally, I address methodological implications of intertextual analysis, and of interpretation of the Book of Isaiah at the turn of the era...|$|R

40|$|THE EXPRESSION OF REFLEXIVITY IN THE PERICOPES OF JOKŪBAS MORKŪNAS’ POSTIL Summary The article compares {{certain aspects}} of the {{expression}} of reflexivity in <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> of Morkūnas’ Postil with the equivalents of the Polish original – Rej’s Postil – and Baltramiejus Vilentas’ Gospels and Epistles, used by Morkūnas. The review of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> of Morkūnas’ text resulted in finding 202 reflexive pronoun structures. In most cases the expression of reflexivity is non-Lithuanian when non-reflexive pronouns are used for the first and second person. About one third of these structures do not coincide with the corresponding structures used by Rej in his Postil, but almost all coincide with the text of Vilentas’ Gospels and Epistles. This confirms earlier statements that Morkūnas took the major­ity of <b>the</b> texts of <b>pericopes</b> from Vilentas. Altogether it should be observed, that the language of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> of Rej’s Postil in terms of the expression of reflexivity is better than the language of <b>the</b> <b>pericopes</b> of <b>the</b> Postil by Morkūnas. </p...|$|R
