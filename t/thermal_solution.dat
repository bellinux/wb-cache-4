40|$|A strategic, technical, and {{organizational}} {{examination of the}} customer enabling effort at Intel Corporation was undertaken. The context {{of this study was}} the launch of the first boxed mobile processor in the company's history. The technical component of the work consisted of the design and development of a <b>thermal</b> <b>solution</b> to complement the boxed processor. The organizational component involved an examination of the way the team was structured to execute the project. The strategic component looked at the effect of the enabling effort on the mobile computing industry at large. Thermal solutions that met the technical specifications of the boxed mobile processor were successfully designed and prototyped. The implication of a specific <b>thermal</b> <b>solution</b> design on the level of standardization of the notebook computer platform is discussed. The conclusion is that the level of standardization in the industry is already high and is unlikely to be influenced by the boxed mobile processor.

40|$|Hy-Tech <b>Thermal</b> <b>Solutions,</b> LLC, of Melbourne, Florida, is {{producing}} {{a very complex}} blend of ceramic vacuum-filled refractory products designed to minimize the path of hot air transfer through ceilings, walls, and roofs. The insulating ceramic technology blocks the transfer of heat outward when applied to paint on interior walls and ceilings, and prevents the transfer of heat inward when used to paint exterior walls and roofs, effectively providing year-round comfort in the home. As a manufacturer and marketer of <b>thermal</b> <b>solutions</b> for residential, commercial, and industrial applications, Hy-Tech <b>Thermal</b> <b>Solutions</b> attributes its success to the high performance insulating ceramic microsphere originally developed from NASA thermal research at Ames Research Center. Shaped like a hollow ball so small that {{it looks as if}} it is a single grain of flour to the naked eye (slightly thicker than a human hair), the microsphere is noncombustible and fairly chemical-resistant, and has a wall thickness about 1 / 10 of the sphere diameter, a compressive strength of about 4, 000 pounds per square inch, and a softening point of about 1, 800 C. Hy-Tech <b>Thermal</b> <b>Solutions</b> improved upon these properties by removing all of the gas inside and creating a vacuum. In effect, a 'mini thermos bottle' is produced, acting as a barrier to heat by reflecting it away from the protected surface. When these microspheres are combined with other materials, they enhance the thermal resistance of those materials. In bulk, the tiny ceramic 'beads' have the appearance of a fine talcum powder. Their inert, nontoxic properties allow them to mix easily into any type of paint, coating, adhesive, masonry, or drywall finish. Additionally, their roundness causes them to behave like ball bearings, rolling upon each other, and letting the coatings flow smoothly. When applied like paint to a wall or roof, the microsphere coating shrinks down tight and creates a dense film of the vacuum cells. The resulting ceramic layer improves fire resistance, protects from ultraviolet rays, repels insects such as termites, and shields from the destructive forces of nature...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{encouraging}} {{experimental results}} on neutrino mixing parameters prompt further investigation on SO(10) -inspired leptogenesis {{and on the}} associated strong <b>thermal</b> <b>solution</b> that has correctly predicted a non-vanishing reactor mixing angle, it further predicts sin δ ≲ 0, now supported by recent results at ∼ 95 % C. L., normally ordered neutrino masses and atmospheric mixing angle in the first octant, best fit results in latest global analyses. Extending a recent analytical procedure, we account for the mismatch between the Yukawa basis and the weak basis, that in SO(10) -inspired models is described by a CKM-like unitary transformation VL, obtaining a full analytical solution that provides useful insight and reproduces accurately all numerical results, {{paving the way for}} future inclusion of different sources of theoretical uncertainties and for a statistical analysis of the constraints. We show how muon-dominated solutions appear for large values of the lightest neutrino mass in the range (0. 01 – 1) eV but also how they necessarily require a mild fine tuning in the seesaw relation. For the dominant (and untuned) tauon-dominated solutions we show analytically how, turning on VL ≃ VCKM, some of the constraints on the low energy neutrino parameters get significantly relaxed. In particular we show how the upper bound on the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle in the strong <b>thermal</b> <b>solution</b> gets relaxed from θ 23 ≲ 41 ° to θ 23 ≲ 44 °, an important effect {{in the light of the}} most recent NOνA, T 2 K and IceCube results...|$|E

It is found that the local heat transfer coefficients in the finless design are up to 300 % greater than those achieved at the same Reynolds number using conventional boundary layer theory. The additional benefits in terms of sustainability of the approach are also highlighted. Copyright © 2011 by ASME...|$|R
