5|$|The Sunda slow loris may {{fit into}} the monogamous single male/single female social system, though are mainly known to be solitary. One study showed only 8% of the species' active time was spent near other individuals. Where home ranges overlap, spatial groups are formed. These groups consist of one male, one female and up to three younger individuals. The {{interactions}} between <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> largely friendly; they include allogrooming, following, pant-growling, and click-calling, although social behaviors only make up around 3% of the activity budget. When it comes into contact with conspecifics from other home ranges there is usually no reaction as home ranges are not defended. In captivity however, it can be aggressive with other individuals. Males have shown antagonistic behaviors such as attacks, pursuits, threats, assertion, fighting, and subordination. The fighting often results in serious injury. Despite this, they {{are known to be}} generally sociable in captivity, with allogrooming being the most common social behavior.|$|E

25|$|According to Cloninger’s model, {{the early}} life onset of neuropsychiatric {{disorders}} lead to personality disorders, with individuals having low RD scores.

Cloninger had predicted from his biosocial theory that individuals {{most at risk}} of aggressive, antisocial behavior, will be those with lower RD scores and <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> equated with the primary psychopaths who show aloofness and social detachment. Particular research conducted on childhood behavior has tested this theory and researchers have shown that children with lower RD scores have more of an anti-social profile as defined in the DSM, and are at highest risk for early onset of frequent delinquent behavior.|$|E

25|$|Studies on {{perpetrators}} {{of domestic violence}} find that abusers have high rates of psychopathy, with the prevalence estimated to be at around 15-30%. Furthermore, the commission of domestic violence is correlated with Factor 1 of the PCL-R, which describes the emotional deficits and the callous and exploitative interpersonal style found in psychopathy. The prevalence of psychopathy among domestic abusers indicate that the core characteristics of psychopathy, such as callousness, remorselessness, {{and a lack of}} close interpersonal bonds, predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse, and suggest that the domestic abuses committed by <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> callously perpetrated (i.e. instrumentally aggressive) rather than a case of emotional aggression and therefore may not be amenable to the types of psychosocial interventions commonly given to domestic abuse perpetrators.|$|E
