5|$|Spectra of excited {{states can}} be used to analyze the atomic {{composition}} of distant stars. Specific light wavelengths contained in the observed light from stars can be separated out and related to the quantized transitions in free gas atoms. <b>These</b> <b>colors</b> can be replicated using a gas-discharge lamp containing the same element. Helium was discovered in this way in the spectrum of the Sun 23years before it was found on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Various cadmium salts {{are used}} in paint pigments, with CdS as a yellow pigment being the most common. Cadmium {{selenide}} is a red pigment, commonly called cadmium red. To painters who work with the pigment, cadmium provides the most brilliant and durable yellows, oranges, and reds — {{so much so that}} during production, <b>these</b> <b>colors</b> are significantly toned down before they are ground with oils and binders or blended into watercolors, gouaches, acrylics, and other paint and pigment formulations. Because these pigments are potentially toxic, users should use a barrier cream on the hands to prevent absorption through the skin even though the amount of cadmium absorbed into the body through the skin is reported to be less than 1%.|$|E

5|$|Earlier, at the Sibiu Conference of 26 April/8 May 1848, Transylvanian revolutionaries {{had also}} adopted a blue-white-red {{national}} flag (vertical, {{according to the}} memoirs of George Bariţ). It was emblazoned with the words “VIRTUTEA ROMANĂ REÎNVIATĂ” (“ROMAN VIRTUE RESURRECTED”). A number of contemporary sources attests <b>these</b> <b>colors</b> (including the Blaj newspaper Organul naţionale and Alexandru Papiu Ilarian’s Istorie a românilor din Dacia superioară). They had a twofold significance: their importance in Romanian costume and their union of the Transylvanian principality’s old colors (blue and red) with the white symbolizing peace. It appears that the two specimens with blue-yellow-red stripes preserved today at the National Museum of Romanian History were made later to commemorate the events at Blaj; yellow replaced white {{as a symbol of}} Romanian Transylvanians’ desire to join Romania.|$|E
5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that spiders' coloration is camouflage that helps them to evade their major predators, birds and parasitic wasps, {{both of which have}} good color vision. Many spider species are colored so as to merge with their most common backgrounds, and some have disruptive coloration, stripes and blotches that break up their outlines. In a few species, such as the Hawaiian happy-face spider, Theridion grallator, several coloration schemes are present in a ratio that appears to remain constant, and this may {{make it more difficult for}} predators to recognize the species. Most spiders are insufficiently dangerous or unpleasant-tasting for warning coloration to offer much benefit. However, a few species with powerful venoms, large jaws or irritant hairs have patches of warning colors, and some actively display <b>these</b> <b>colors</b> when threatened.|$|E
25|$|In Nigeria, devotees {{typically}} wear red {{and white}} clothing, as <b>these</b> <b>colors</b> represent that particular Mami’s dual nature. Igbo iconography, red represents such qualities as death, destruction, heat, maleness, physicality, and power. In contrast, white symbolises death, but also can symbolize beauty, creation, femaleness, new life, spirituality, translucence, water, and wealth. This regalia may also include a cloth snake wrapped about the waist. The Mami Wata shrines may also be decorated in <b>these</b> <b>colors,</b> and items such as bells, carvings, Christian or Indian prints, dolls, incense, spirits, and remnants of previous sacrifices often adorn such places.|$|E

25|$|Copper {{goes through}} a natural {{oxidation}} process that forms a unique protective patina on the metal. The surface of the metal undergoes a series of color changes: from iridescent/salmon pinks to oranges and reds interspersed with brassy yellows, blues, greens and purples. As the oxide thickens, <b>these</b> <b>colors</b> are replaced by russet and chocolate browns, dull slate grays or blacks, and finally to a light-green or blue-green.|$|E
25|$|The 1976 {{formula is}} the first color-difference formula that related a {{measured}} to a known set of CIELAB coordinates. This formula has been succeeded by the 1994 and 2000 formulas because the CIELAB space {{turned out to be}} not as perceptually uniform as intended, especially in the saturated regions. This means that this formula rates <b>these</b> <b>colors</b> too highly as opposed to other colors.|$|E
25|$|The University {{initially}} adopted {{black and}} gold as its official school colors {{in response to}} the growing popularity of intercollegiate athletics and the need to differentiate teams, but when it was discovered that several other schools had the same colors, <b>these</b> <b>colors</b> were quickly dropped in favor of royal purple and gold in 1879.

25|$|Unshielded {{twisted pair}} (UTP) cables {{are found in}} many Ethernet {{networks}} and telephone systems. For indoor telephone applications, UTP is often grouped into sets of 25 pairs according to a standard 25-pair color code originally developed by AT Corporation. A typical subset of <b>these</b> <b>colors</b> (white/blue, blue/white, white/orange, orange/white) shows up in most UTP cables. The cables are typically made with copper wires measured at 22 or 24 American Wire Gauge (AWG), with the colored insulation typically made from an insulator such as polyethylene or FEP and the total package covered in a polyethylene jacket.|$|E
25|$|In {{states that}} do not enforce {{specific}} rules about green, yellow or white lights, <b>these</b> <b>colors</b> are often used by entities like private security companies which may be ineligible to use blue or red lights but need emergency lights for traffic and site visibility. Security vehicles generally use their lights on private property, in addition some security vehicles are off-road only such as ATV and Golf cart type vehicles. and in most jurisdictions security vehicles are generally not allowed a ‘courtesy’ or ‘emergency’ status on public roads.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally {{the party}} had no {{consistent}} color identity. After the 2000 election, the color red became associated with Republicans. That election night, for the first time, {{all of the major}} broadcast networks used the same color scheme for the electoral map: states won by Republican nominee George W. Bush were colored red, and states won by Democratic nominee Al Gore were colored blue. Although the assignment of colors to political parties is unofficial and informal, the media has come to represent the respective political parties using <b>these</b> <b>colors.</b> The party and its candidates have also come to embrace the color red.|$|E
25|$|Type S: Three {{variations}} {{were seen}} on Ki-84s; S1 – Dark green upper surfaces, with light gray/green lower surfaces. S2 – The light gray/green {{on the lower}} surfaces {{was replaced by a}} pale blue/gray. <b>These</b> <b>colors</b> were often applied on an unprimed airframe; because of this and the poor adhesion of Japanese paints in the later years of the war this scheme often weathered quickly, with large patches of natural metal being visible (see photo of 85 Hiko-Sentai Ki-84 on a Korean base). S10 – The upper surfaces were left in a red/brown primer with the under surfaces in natural metal. The black anti-glare panel was optional.|$|E
25|$|Other colors {{have been}} {{developed}} from this initial base set, {{with varying degrees of}} popularity and recognition. In 1989 a cinnamon breeding programme was started in the Netherlands; the first fawn kitten was born in 1998. Cinnamon, fawn, caramel, and apricot Burmese have also been developed in New Zealand, as have tortoiseshell variants of all <b>these</b> <b>colors.</b> A new colour mutation has arisen in Burmese lines being bred in New Zealand and an experimental breeding programme began in 2007. The colour is called russet and appears {{to be the result of}} the dark pigment in the cats' coats fading as they grow, while paler orange pigment remains.|$|E
