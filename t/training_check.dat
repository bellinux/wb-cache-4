He {{estimated}} that, prior to working for United, he had accrued at least 1,400 hours of flight time with the Air National Guard. His total DC-10 time with United was 3,000 hours, of which 2,000 hours were accrued as a second officer, 1000 hours as a first officer, and 79 hours as a captain.|$|E
5000|$|As {{investigators}} {{checking the}} flight {{history of the}} captain, {{it was revealed that}} the captain, his performance, during his simulator <b>training</b> <b>check</b> flights, remained almost the same. He could not safely handle these training exercises during critical phases of takeoff / just after takeoff without briefing to achieve the satisfactory performance level in these mandatory exercises. The report also stated that the captain was [...] "lack of confident". Investigators also revealed that the captain lacked the required proficiency level / skill to independently handle the aircraft operations with single engine during critical phases of flight.|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to understand the concept of mental illness in society and its prevalence. One in four people experience a mental health problem, that can lead to social exclusion, which can have devastating effects on self worth, loneliness, no prospect of training for a job or hope of a future in meaningful employment and at worst a sense of hopelessness. Fortunately, it is no longer assumed that people with a severe mental health problem cannot recover, and the reintegration of people with a mental illness back into society is now seen as so vital that mental health services have introduced a recovery and rehabilitation agenda focusing on social outcomes. These social outcomes are achieved through a variety of interventions which can help to build a person's social skills. The interventions are based around social skills such as; learning activities, self help, home maintenance, education, vocational training, leisure activities and skills to cope with community living. Modern treatments have been developed within mental health services {{to move away from the}} medical model of care with its high use of medication to a social model of care, with the use of therapeutic treatments and interventions, that are given to encourage the process of recovery. The Health of the Nation Outcome Scales (HoNos) have been developed to monitor an improvement in social function and to provide a standardised assessment tool to be used by all mental health practitioners. Development and testing over three years resulted in an instrument with 12 items measuring behaviour, impairment, symptoms and social functioning. Assessment is a key role during episodes of care in mental healthcare providers, starting on admission to the service, this serving as a baseline against which subsequent assessment can be compared. It is therefore important to ensure that HoNos is being used properly and timely. Within this project, an evaluation of how interventions to build social skill and treatments were received/ or provided in six mental health providers was carried out. Additionally, an assessment of HoNos was undertaken. The statistical package SPSS was used which enabled descriptive analysis and cross tabulation of the data and the results showed large variations between the qualified stafTs response and the patients' response and also a marked difference between the providers. Results show that providers need to discuss the results, ensure all qualified staff undergo HoNos <b>training,</b> <b>check</b> if any patients should be accessing different treatments and ensure that the Electronic Patient Explorer (EPEX) data base is completed appropriately. This research has shown a measured improvement in social function for a person with a mental health problem, within the six mental health providers, is essential to tackle social exclusion and reintegration into society...|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to classic train protection systems {{where most of}} the safety measures are built into the rail infras-tructure, future versions of the European railway safety system ERTMS (European Railway Traffic Management System) require <b>trains</b> to <b>check</b> their own safety. One of the safety measures is the <b>train</b> integrity <b>check,</b> which checks whether all carriages are still in the <b>train.</b> The <b>check</b> has to be completed in a certain amount of time. This paper presents an overview for communication in such an integrity system, based on a wireless sensor network (WSN). Because a WSN with nodes in each carriage has a linear structure, existing communication protocols which assume a mesh-like topology do no suffice. Simulation shows that the proposed communication is feasible and has the necessary (soft) real-time properties to complete an integrity check in time. The protocol, based on the IEEE 802. 15. 4 network stack, is implemented and tested by Strukton. I...|$|R

50|$|When {{changing}} between most {{forms of}} transport (e.g. from bus to bus, bus to tram, bus to train), the user must check out when leaving the first vehicle and check in when entering the second vehicle.

But this is exceptional: for example, failing to check out then in again at a change of tram will cause you to pay the whole deposit (currently €4) rather than the actual fare for your journey (further explained below).|$|R

30|$|The {{greatest}} {{benefit of}} our proposed method {{is that it}} creates high-precision entity extractors for the Person and Organization categories. These extracted entities will make a highly reliable training set for machine learning algorithms to learn the extraction rules for the two categories, and thus improve the extraction quality (F measure) of all two extractors. The number of documents needed for training is usually very large and would require hundreds of hours from each analyst involved. Specialists’ time is not only very expensive but also often difficult to find. Thus, eliminating specialists’ time to train systems not only results in huge cost savings and but also increases specialists’ efficiency as they spend their time performing their job by using and interpreting the outcome of NER systems, instead of <b>training,</b> <b>checking</b> outcomes, and correcting errors. Improvement in precision in extraction of entities improves the precision of entity relationship extraction, thus minimizing the system users’ time spent on searching through graphs and fixing faulty relationships.|$|R
