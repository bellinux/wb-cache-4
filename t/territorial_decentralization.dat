40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on determinants of healthcare expenditure for the period 1998 to 2007. The methodology combines searches in the MesH database of PubMed with the search in the principal journals of Health Economics. 20 primary studies were found that met the criteria for inclusion. No single pattern of results is clearly identified. Among the 20 articles, four consider income to be the principal determinant of healthcare expenditure, two of them jointly with population ageing. Six highlight population ageing, as against six others that emphasize the proximity to death. The remaining six do not focus on a specific variable, or focus on another variable, e. g. technological progress or <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralization.</b> 11 of the 20 articles calculate the income elasticity of demand, only two of them obtaining a value greater than 1, thus cataloguing healthcare expenditure as a luxury good. There is, therefore, no unanimity in the variables and econometric regressions of healthcare expenditure in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. No solid empirical evidence exists that population ageing {{is one of the}} principal determinants of healthcare expenditure, and factors such as technological progress, closeness to death and <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralization</b> of healthcare are increasingly seen as important in the development of explanatory models of healthcare expenditure. ...|$|E

40|$|Political {{decentralization}} along territorial {{lines is}} emerging as {{a key element in}} contemporary civil war settlements. In Bosnia, the Dayton Agreement rests on a new federal structure to build the peace. In Kosovo, the Western powers used force against Serbia ostensibly to restore regional autonomy for the ethnic Albanians. In the Philippines, state leaders experimented with territorial autonomy as a solution to the decades-old conflict in Mindanao. And in Ethiopia, the Peoples ' Revolutionary Democratic Front established an ethnically-based federal structure after assuming power from the hegemonic regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam. <b>Territorial</b> <b>decentralization</b> now appears to be an institution of first resort for domestic or international actors in their attempts to bring peace to war-torn societies. 2 <b>Territorial</b> <b>decentralization</b> is supported by peacemakers because it recognizes the political and spatial realities on the ground, especially the division of territory won on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. By granting each group a state-within-a-state, peacemakers aim to mitigate fears of political exploitation and inter-group violence and, at least in part, to satisfy local demands for cultural and religious autonomy. At the same time, decentralization maintains existing external borders, and thus does not challenge the principle of territorial integrity central to contemporary notions of sovereignty (see Zacher 2001). In short, decentralization is believed to address the political insecurities and desire for self-determination that lead to conflict while respecting the principle that, if at all possible, sovereignty should not be dismantled. 1 We are grateful to Philip G.

40|$|The present text {{seeks to}} {{identify}} map {{and analyze the}} processes of territorial occupation by sugarcane production in Brazil {{since the end of}} the 1940 's. The study is based on historical data of regional and state sugar and ethanol production. During this period, three expansion events took place. Brazilian sugarcane production started in the Northeast region, occupying the humid coastal areas and sparse humid spots in the interior. Therefore, northeastern Brazil can be considered the country's first sugarcane production area and its inward migration was the crop's first expansionist drive. In the second expansion the crop moved to the Southeast region, in the 1950 s. Sugarcane crop data for 1978 / 79 and 2006 / 07 show two distinct movements, directly linked to each other: on the one hand, the continuous process of sugarcane <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralization</b> and, on the other, sugarcane expansion into areas previously occupied by grain crops, specially soybeans. This was a new territorial expansion, now in direction of Brazil's Mid-West. This is understood as the third expansionist movement. A fourth and still tentative movement can be detected towards the North region. Sugar and ethanol production represents a traditional and oligarchic sector in Brazil; its expansion is accompanied by the concentration business ownership, under way in the ethanol industry, which is tending to come under the control of large, multinational agribusiness companies and the international financial capita...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{subsidiarity}} is {{introduced in the}} context of the European Union by the Maastricht Treaty [1991]. That treaty laid the foundations for the Europe of the future. However, the notion is much older as it is deeply rooted in the Christian-Democratic ideology, notably Roman Catholic religion. It has been applied to the various denominations in The Netherlands, which were institutionalized for years in pillars. The elites at the top of these pillars pursued a politics of accommodation that explains, at least partly, the relative stable political situation. The consequences were important since The Netherlands is a country in which public and private organizations contribute to the realization of the welfare state. Besides, it is also a country in which local government takes an important share in the implementation of public tasks. Ideologically subsidiarity, sovereignty in the private domain and functionally and <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralization</b> found each other. The result was a relatively small central government, a strong decentralized government and strong social organizations. The question may be raised what happened with the principle of subsidiarity since the outcome in the Netherlands is rather centralization than decentralization. In addition, one may question what can be learned from the Dutch experience for the process of European integration. In this paper we address the question to what extent the developments in The Netherlands have their parallel in the European context. We conclude that concepts like subsidiarity are a device for a strong society with a relatively weak center and decentralized governments...|$|E

This study allowed us to conclude that the specific nature of municipal museums decisively influence the educational work developed in these institutions because, first, the creation of a municipal museum is essential for the enhancement and safeguarding of local heritage. In this way the museum is like an educational entity. Secondly the <b>territorial</b> <b>decentralization</b> reflected in the diversity of heritage areas is, in turn, an obstacle to the small teams of educational services and becomes imperative to think about their organization. Thirdly it is clear the lack of training activities in the area of public assessment and the lack of assessment practices for education services. The introduction and development of assessment tools are critical to the development of educational quality. Fourthly it was noted that the "resignation" set of responsibilities in the educational mission by the guardianship, leads the museum as an institution of education, giving priority to the work with schools. Fifth the demanding schedule of cultural museums do not allow the implementation of initiatives based on other methodologies, although to the Patrimonial Education - aim here as a "solution" to establish partnerships with local community groups.
