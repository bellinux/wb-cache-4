5|$|Cleveland {{introduces}} his Jamaican cousin Madame Claude to Peter, Joe, and Quagmire {{saying she}} is a psychic. Cleveland offers to have her read their palms and determine past lives they have had. Madame Claude then determines that Joe was once an octopus whose tentacles were bitten off by a shark, and Quagmire was Jack the Ripper. When Claude reads Peter's palm, she discovers that he was Griffin Peterson, the supposed founder of Quahog where the previously-mentioned history of Quahog was a myth. Most of the episode follows the story of <b>this</b> <b>past</b> life, the main characters therein having the appearance of regular Family Guy characters.|$|E

So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E

He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E
5|$|On December 11, 2015, Albrecht {{announced}} he would sit {{out the rest of}} the season for the 2015–16 Wolverines team due to injuries. He will concentrate on his continued recovery and the rehabilitation process following bilateral hip surgery <b>this</b> <b>past</b> summer. During his career at Michigan, Albrecht played in 115 career games, and was named Michigan's co-MVP during the 2014–15 season, after starting 18 of 31 games and posting a career-best 7.5 points per game, while battling hip problems. On March 29, Albrecht announced that he would use the graduate transfer option to play a fifth year at another school. On April 1, head coach John Beilein decided not to restrict Albrecht or teammate Ricky Doyle from transferring to schools within the Big Ten if they desired to do so. By April 18, Albrecht was considering interest from home state Big Ten programs Purdue and Indiana as well as Wichita State, Texas A, Syracuse, USC, and Milwaukee (where Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan had just taken over as head coach).|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} between X-rays and gamma rays {{has changed in}} recent decades. Originally, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by X-ray tubes almost invariably had a longer wavelength than the radiation (gamma rays) emitted by radioactive nuclei. Older literature distinguished between X- and gamma radiation {{on the basis of}} wavelength, with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10−11 m, defined as gamma rays. Since the energy of photons is proportional to their frequency and inversely proportional to wavelength, <b>this</b> <b>past</b> {{distinction between}} X-rays and gamma rays can also be thought of in terms of its energy, with gamma rays considered to be higher energy electromagnetic radiation than are X-rays.|$|E
25|$|For many years, Compton {{was a much}} sought-after suburb for {{the black}} middle class of Los Angeles. <b>This</b> <b>past</b> affluence is {{reflected}} in the area's appearance—Compton's streets are lined with relatively spacious and attractive single family houses. However, several factors have contributed to Compton's gradual decline. One of the most significant factors was a steady erosion of its tax base, something that was already sparse due to limited commercial properties. In later years, there were middle-class whites who fled to the newly incorporated cities of Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Paramount and Norwalk in the late 1950s. These nearby communities remained largely white early on despite integration. This white middle class flight accelerated following the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|E

25|$|The College of Engineering {{is home to}} six {{academic}} {{departments and}} three degree programs focused on challenges associated with sustainability, energy, {{health care and the}} environment. The faculty includes 30 named professors, six National Academy of Engineers members, 36 NSF career award winners and 11 University teaching award recipients. Initiatives led by college faculty include 14 college-based research centers and six university-based research centers. Annual research expenditures exceeded $55M <b>this</b> <b>past</b> year, representing over 40 percent of total University research dollars. The new Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Laboratory (ISE Lab) brings 194,000 sq. ft. of new research and teaching space to the campus. Additionally, the university's planned Science and Technology Campus will expand university-based research and shared research undertaken with corporate partners. Strategic partnerships with industry, government and academic institutions complement these initiatives, expanding the college's reputation and reach, and cultivating a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration, leadership and entrepreneurship among future engineers.|$|E
25|$|Lyon {{played a}} total of six {{friendly}} matches. Lyon opened up their pre-season on 12 July with a 3–2 victory over Nîmes in Albertville, near Tignes, the location of Lyon's pre-season camp. A week later, on 19 July, they traveled away to Bucharest to face Rapid București, which resulted in a 2–1 loss. They then took a trip to Belgrade to play against Partizan on 23 July. Lyon came out with a positive result, beating the Serbian side 3–1 with goals from Karim Benzema and Sidney Govou. They followed that victory up with another as they cruised to a 3–0 victory over Ligue 1 side Nancy in nearby Villefranche-sur-Saône. Their last friendly in the month of July would in turn be a 0–1 defeat to AS Monaco on July 29 in Annecy. Their final friendly match was the annual Trophée des Champions match. Since Lyon won both the league and the Coupe de France, they faced the club that finished in second place in Ligue 1 <b>this</b> <b>past</b> season, Bordeaux. The match was played on 2 August at Bordeaux's ground, the Stade Chaban-Delmas. After 90 minutes without a goal, Bordeaux defeated Lyon 5–4 on penalties to earn their first Trophée des Champions title, ending Lyon's streak of six-straight Trophée des Champions titles.|$|E
