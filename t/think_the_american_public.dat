5000|$|June 9 [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> {{knows the}} extent or knew {{the extent to}} which they were being surveilled and their data was being collected. ... I think we ought to reopen the Patriot Act and put some limits on the amount of data that the National Security (Agency) is collecting. ... It ought to remain sacred, and there's got to be a balance here. That is what I'm aiming for. Let's have the debate, let's be transparent, let's open this up." ...|$|E
5000|$|The albums Mink DeVille {{recorded}} for Atlantic sold well in Europe {{but not in}} the United States. Explained Kenny Margolis, who played piano and accordion in DeVille's early 1980s bands, [...] "I don’t <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> had a chance to experience him because in America at that time you had MTV telling you what to like. Europe had not had MTV at that point and they were very open to different music." [...] DeVille said about his years with Atlantic Records, [...] "Ahmet Ertegün and I got along, but we never got anything done." ...|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, rumors {{circulated}} at {{that time}} that Lewis was gay, and though Lewis denied the rumors, they probably hurt his marketability as well. Lewis' physical appearance at the Games, with a flattop haircut and flamboyant clothing, added fuel to the reports. [...] "It doesn't matter what Carl Lewis's sexuality is," [...] high jumper Dwight Stones said. [...] "Madison Avenue perceives him as homosexual." [...] Coca-Cola had offered a lucrative deal to Lewis before the Olympics, but Lewis and Douglas turned it down, confident that Lewis would be worth more after the Olympics. But Coca-Cola rescinded the offer after the Games. Nike already had Lewis under contract for several years, despite questions about how it affected his amateur status, and he was appearing in Nike television advertisements in print and on billboards. Nike was faced with Lewis' new negative image and dropped him after the Games. [...] "If you're a male athlete, I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public</b> wants you to look macho," [...] said Don Coleman, a Nike representative. [...] "They started looking for ways to get rid of me," [...] Lewis said. [...] "Everyone there was so scared and so cynical they {{did not know what to}} do." [...] (Lewis and Nike eventually did split, and Lewis signed an endorsement deal with Mizuno.) Lewis himself would lay the blame on some inaccurate reporting, especially the [...] "Carl bashing," [...] as he put it, typified by a Sports Illustrated article before the Olympics.|$|E
