500|$|In April 1998, {{three years}} after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under {{criticism}} for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in Cendant, which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in the Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah, Kentucky, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the [...] "increasingly violent world many American children enter when they sit down {{in front of a computer}} screen". Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>children.</b> We know that our membership would not want us to do that." [...] The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California, Ohio and Texas.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} the sociodemographic variables, intelligence levels, psychiatric disorders, and suicide risks of sexually abused children and adolescents who were referred for forensic examination <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> and adolescent psychiatry outpatient clinic. Method: Forensic reports of 157 children and adolescents aged 3 - 17 years who had been referred <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>child</b> psychiatry outpatient clinic between July 2011 - June 2012 were examined retrospectively. Results: Of 157 sexually abused cases, 83. 4 % were girls and 16. 6 % were boys. The psychiatric diagnosis rate {{at the time of}} admission to hospital was 87. 9 %. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (36. 9 %) was the most common psychiatric diagnosis among the victims. 22 patients (14 %) had attempted suicide after the sexual abuse. Forced vaginal-anal or oral penetration, depressive disorder, and PTSD significantly increased the risk of suicide attempts. (in order OR: 3. 24, 4. 05, 6. 78, p= 0. 045, 0. 03, 0. 004 respectively). Conclusion: Most of the sexual abused children had psychiatric disorders. The most common disorder was PTSD.

[...] In many cases, this will involve partnerships with other countries.″ Nevertheless, in the same speech, in a bid to emphasise the legality of military actions undertaken by the U.S., noting that Congress had authorised the use of force, he went on to say, ″Under domestic law, and international law, the United States is at war with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their associated forces.
