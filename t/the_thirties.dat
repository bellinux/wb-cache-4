5|$|The {{last round}} of matches, {{featuring}} {{all three of}} the teams that had qualified for finals day, determined who went directly to the final, and who would face off first in the semi-final. The Southern Vipers faced the Loughborough Lightning, and batting first a team effort saw them reach 156 for 4; Bates scored 38, Sara McGlashan got 34* and Lydia Greenway 29. Despite scores in <b>the</b> <b>thirties</b> from Perry and Evelyn Jones, a strong bowling performance from the Vipers, in which Linsey Smith and Brindle each took three wickets, saw them to victory by 59 runs. That victory guaranteed the Vipers a place in the final, while the Loughborough Lightning had to face Western Storm in a semi-final. The result of the other match that day was of no consequence to the tournament; Beth Mooney scored 56 runs for the Yorkshire Diamonds, who scored 118 runs. Anya Shrubsole finished the match with five wickets for the Western Storm, taking a four–wicket maiden in the final over of the match. Storm opening batsmen Taylor and Priest shared a 101-run partnership to take their side to the brink of victory before being dismissed from subsequent deliveries, but despite two further wickets, the Storm won by six wickets with 21 balls remaining.|$|E
5000|$|With Spartan support, <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> {{established}} {{an interim government}} in Athens. <b>The</b> <b>Thirty</b> were concerned with the revision and/or erasure of democratic laws inscribed on {{the wall next to}} the Stoa Basileios. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> reduced <b>the</b> rights of Athenian citizens in order to institute an oligarchical regime. <b>The</b> <b>Thirty</b> appointed a council of 500 to serve the judicial functions formerly belonging to all the citizens. However, not all Athenian men had their rights removed. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> chose 3,000 Athenian men [...] "to share in the government". These hand-selected individuals had the right to carry weapons, to have a jury trial, and to reside within city limits. The list of the selected 3,000 was consistently revised. Although little is known about these 3,000 men - for a complete record was never documented - it is hypothesised that <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> appointed these select few as the only men <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> could find who were devotedly loyal to their regime. The majority of Athenian citizens did not support the rule of <b>the</b> <b>Thirty.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Thirty</b> Tyrants' brief reign was {{marred by}} {{violence}} and corruption. In fact, historians {{have argued that the}} violence and brutality <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> carried out in Athens was necessary to transition Athens from a democracy to an oligarchy. However, the violence produced an unanticipated paradox. The more violent <b>the</b> <b>Thirty's</b> regime became, <b>the</b> more opposition they faced. The increased level of opposition ultimately resulted in the upheaval of <b>the</b> <b>Thirty's</b> regime by Thrasybulus' rebel forces. After the revolution, Athens needed to decide the best way to govern the liberated city-state and to reconcile the atrocities committed by <b>the</b> <b>Thirty.</b> It was decided that all {{of the members of the}} selected 3,000 were given amnesty except for <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> themselves, <b>the</b> Eleven, and the ten who ruled in Piraeus. After the revolution that overthrew <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> Tyrants, Athens and her citizens struggled to reconcile and rebuild.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Thirty</b> is a {{group of}} warrior priests formed by the Source priest Dardalion during the Vagrian {{invasion}} who, after seeing so many of his brothers murdered, realizes that such evil cannot be fought with love. Twenty-nine other priests agree with him and so <b>The</b> <b>Thirty</b> is formed, utilising powers of the mind and spirit as well as physical weapons in their struggle. When fighting the Dark Brotherhood on the spirit plane <b>The</b> <b>Thirty</b> discover they can form into The One, a single entity that is greater than the combined power of <b>the</b> <b>Thirty,</b> however this intoxicating new super-entity quickly becomes a danger to their individuality and is abandoned. <b>The</b> <b>Thirty</b> fight during <b>the</b> battle of Dros Purdol and when the Vagrians finally break through the gates, the remaining members of <b>The</b> <b>Thirty</b> are slaughtered as they focus their powers on protecting Waylander to the last; Only Dardalion survives his wounds and later forms a second <b>Thirty.</b> Dardalion leads <b>the</b> second <b>Thirty</b> to protect <b>the</b> Nadir Wolfshead tribe from the vast Gothir army.

25|$|As {{with many}} of the issues {{surrounding}} Socrates’ conviction, the nature of his affiliation with <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of <b>the</b> <b>Thirty,</b> many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that “Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the Pythagoreans who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.” Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates’ contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in <b>the</b> <b>Thirty’s</b> bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for <b>the</b> <b>Thirty’s</b> cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of <b>the</b> expatriate <b>Thirty.</b> Socrates did oppose the will of <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> on a few specific occasions. Plato’s Apology has the character of Socrates describe one such instance. He says that <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that <b>the</b> <b>Thirty</b> could execute him. Socrates simply did not answer this order, while the other four men did go to Salamis to get Leon.|$|R
