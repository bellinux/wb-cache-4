40|$|The <b>traction</b> <b>characteristic</b> of an {{electric}} vehicle is the main characteristic of mechanical system that reflects its key performance indicators. Implementation of the <b>traction</b> <b>characteristic</b> is based on controlling angular speed and torque of electric traction motor in an automatic control system. The static mechanical characteristic of {{an electric}} traction motor in an automatic control system {{is the most important}} characteristic that determines weight, size and operating characteristics {{of an electric}} traction motor and serves as the basis for design. The most common variants of constructive implementation of a traction electric drive are analyzed, and a scheme is chosen for further design. Lagrange’s equation for electric mechanical system with one degree of freedom is written in generalized coordinates. In order to determine the generalized forces, elementary operation of all moments influencing on a moving car has been calculated. The resulting equation of motion of the electric vehicle corresponding to the design scheme, as well as the expressions for calculation of characteristic points of static mechanical <b>characteristics</b> of <b>traction</b> motor (i. e. the maximum and minimum time, minimum power) are obtained. In order to determine the nominal values of the angular velocity and the power of electric traction motor, a method based on ensuring the movement of the vehicle in the standard cycle has been developed. The method makes it possible to calculate characteristic points of the mechanical characteristic with the lowest possible power rating. The algorithm for calculation of mechanical characteristics of the motor is presented. The method was applied to calculate static mechanical characteristic of an electric traction motor for a small urban electric truck. </p...|$|R

CONTACT, which is based on Kalker’s Theory, is able to describe these unsteady effects for low creepages (there are adhesion and slip at the same time) but it is unsuitable for Multi Body System (MBS) simulations due to its high computational effort.

50|$|With the DAF 600 - 55 each {{rear wheel}} was {{propelled}} individually {{by a pair}} of conical drums and drive belt with the effect of a limited slip differential: if a drive wheel on slippery road revs up, the other wheel can still transfer the full torque. This results in unusually good <b>traction</b> <b>characteristics,</b> which were also a reason for successes of the DAFs in rallies. There were several disadvantages that accompanied the lack of a true differential gear. Although each belt could settle (independent of the other) into its optimum position, thus allowing for wheel speed variation, the system was slow to operate and depended on the pulleys being turned. This led to rapid tire wear and placed stress on other transmission components. Snapped drive shafts were common. Low speed handling in icy conditions was interesting as the system tended to drive the car forward against the influence of the steered wheels. Later cars, the 46, 66 and Volvo variants were fitted with a differentially geared axle. A version with a differential was developed by Williams in the 1993 Williams FW15C CVT Formula One car, but it was banned before being raced. In testing there were problems with the heat production.|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, {{thanks to}} new torque-converter {{developments}} with improved <b>traction</b> <b>characteristics,</b> (approaching the start-up traction) a two-converter transmission {{was designed to}} replace the previously used three-converter transmission. And even today, torque-converters are still being improved, although they have reached an advanced stage. Modern computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can now provide engineers with detailed information on the flow-patterns inside a rotating turbine wheel. Here, the oil-filled circuit in which the turbine turns is portrayed as computerized grid showing the flow characteristics at each grid intersection. For each of these points, the flow volume, speed, and pressure can be calculated. Later during the analysis phase, a three dimensional model of the circuit's flow pattern can be viewed and flow disruptions which reduce the converter's efficiency can be identified, such as: eddies, surface turbulence and mis-directed fluid-flows along the turbine wheel. In addition, aside from visualizing these flow disruptions engineers can also use CFD to calculate the resultant loss in converter efficiency. In the end, the relationship between changes in a converter circuit's flow-patterns and the efficiency of a torque-converter can then {{be used to identify}} potential improvement areas. To a large extent, the predicted values match well with the actual operational measurements, although some differences do occur due to the use of time-saving simplified simulations. Still, CFD allows the optimization of existing converters as well as the development of new virtual-converter types via computer. Afterwards the building of a prototype and the verification of the actual performance results concludes the development phase.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the application features of traction induction electric motors in transmissions of vehicles. It shows {{that one of}} important stages in their designing is to choose the number of poles. In traction electric drives engines with the raised number of poles without comprehensive assessment of such solution are often applied. The paper investigates dynamic and power characteristics of the multi-polar traction asynchronous engine (TAE) designed and made for using in the individual electric drive of heavy-load wheeled cars. The basic functional elements of the model to simulate the electric drive in Matlab environment with the Simulink and SimPower Systems applications in the structure with vector control are described, and the simulation modeling results of its dynamic mechanical characteristics are provided. It is established that because of increased alternating frequency of currents of the multi-polar engine {{in the range of}} high speeds there is an excessive decrease in the torque and the requirement for constancy of the target capacity, corresponding to the specified <b>traction</b> <b>characteristic</b> is not fulfilled. It is a consequence of the waveform distortion of engine phase current in the range of high speeds because of incapability of the power source to compensate an increasing EMF of movement as the speed continues to grow. The paper studies the influence of increased current frequencies on the additional losses in the engine. The analysis of electromagnetic field penetration depth in the copper conductor of stator winding at high frequency allowed us to establish a significant skin – effect. The quantitative assessment is given to this phenomenon by results of numerical calculation of electromagnetic field distribution in a stator groove. Significant increase in additional losses in the engine is established, and estimates of flow loss extent because of damping actions of eddy currents in the laminated steel of stator at increased frequencies are given. The alternative option of the traction asynchronous engine with the improved characteristics is proved. The attained results can be used to design the traction electric drives of vehicles based on the asynchronous engines. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} aimed at {{improving}} <b>traction</b> control <b>characteristics</b> for wheel loaders and haulers. At present, drivers of these machines can choose between open or closed differentials but often they prefer to lock the differentials, thus distributing the torque equally between the wheels and thereby almost always avoiding wheel slip. However, locked differentials cause increased wear of the driveline, increased fuel consumption and greater tyre wear. Therefore it is worthwhile to investigate other solutions such as limited slip differentials or differentials with a clutch where the torque is distributed as necessary among the driving wheels.

As the running resistance of present freight trains in Serbia and Montenegro has not been investigated, the Serbian Railways and the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Institute of Transportation CIP, took the initiative to investigate this matter. Miscellaneous formulas of running resistance used in Serbia and Montenegro and other countries gave considerably different results when they were applied to a mixed freight train of the same consist. So, they could not be considered reliable for the average mixed freight train in use at the JZ (Serbian Railways).

40|$|Balancing {{between the}} {{provision}} of high quality of service and running within a tight budget {{is one of the}} biggest challenges for most metro railway operators around the world. Conventionally, one possible approach for the operator to adjust the time schedule is to alter the stop time at stations, if other system constraints, such as <b>traction</b> equipment <b>characteristic,</b> are not taken into account. Yet it is not an effective, flexible and economical method because the run-time of a train simply cannot be extended without limitation, and a balance between run-time and energy consumption has to be maintained. Modification or installation of a new signalling system not only increases the capital cost, but also affects the normal train service. Therefore, in order to procure a more effective, flexible and economical means to improve the quality of service, optimisation of train performance by coasting point identification has become more attractive and popular. However, identifying the necessary starting points for coasting under the constraints of current service conditions is no simple task because train movement is attributed by a large number of factors, most of which are non-linear and inter-dependent.
