50|$|An example:The {{allowance}} {{per inch}} of diameter usually ranges from 0.001 inch to 0.0025 inch (0.1-0.25%), 0.0015 inch (0.15%) being a fair average. Ordinarily the allowance per inch decreases as the diameter increases; thus the <b>total</b> <b>allowance</b> for {{a diameter of}} 2 inches (50.8 mm) might be 0.004 inch (0.102 mm, 0.2%), whereas for a diameter of 8 inches (203.2 mm) the <b>total</b> <b>allowance</b> might not be over 0.009 or 0.010 inch (0.23 or 0.25 mm, i.e. 0.11-0.12%). The parts to be assembled by forced fits are usually made cylindrical, although sometimes they are slightly tapered. Advantages of the taper form are: the possibility of abrasion of the fitted surfaces is reduced; less pressure is required in assembling; and parts are more readily separated when renewal is required. On the other hand, the taper fit is less reliable, because if it loosens, the entire fit is free with but little axial movement. Some lubricant, such as white lead and lard oil mixed to the consistency of paint, should {{be applied to the}} pin and bore before assembling, to reduce the tendency toward abrasion.|$|E
40|$|Most {{previous}} cap {{and trade}} programs have distributed emission allowances for free to incumbent producers. However, in the electricity sector the value of CO 2 allowances may be far in excess of costs to industry and giving them away to firms diverts allowance value from other purposes. Using a detailed simulation model, this paper shows that compensation to firms losing asset value under a climate {{cap and trade}} policy can be achieved for {{a small fraction of}} <b>total</b> <b>allowance</b> value, if targeted carefully. However, the economic efficiency cost of providing incremental compensation to reach the fully compensated level is many multiples of that incremental compensation. These considerations might move policymakers away from free allocation of CO 2 emission allowances in the electricity sector. © 2008 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management. ...|$|E

40|$|Policies to cap {{emissions}} of carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the U. S. economy could pose significant costs on the electricity sector, which contributes roughly 40 percent of total U. S. CO 2 emissions. Whether producers or consumers bear the cost of this regulation depends on whether generators are subject to costof-service regulation or sell power at market-determined prices. Using a detailed simulation model of the electricity sector, we examine one recent, relatively modest proposal that would create a pool of tradable emissions allowances with a net present value that sums to $ 141 billion (1999 $). The limit on CO 2 emissions would cause a cumulative loss in market value of $ 50 billion at affected facilities; however, another group of facilities would gain $ 41 billion in value, and harm measured at the industry level would be just $ 9 billion, or 6 percent of <b>total</b> <b>allowance</b> value. Firms own a portfolio of facilities, and firms that are negatively affected would suffer a loss summing to $ 14 billion. Other firms would gain $ 5 billion in value, while consumers would incur a loss approximately 8 times as great as that of industry. The initial distribution of a portion of the valuable emissions allowances represents a significant potential source of compensation, but it is easy for the compensation to fail to reach those who bear the burden of costs. Free allocation also has substantial efficiency costs, raising the social cost of a policy tha...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 An {{investigation}} {{was conducted on}} parental influence on adolescent's consumer activities in Malaysia. A total of 4287 Form Four students from 32 randomly selected schools, with 80 percent of their parents, participated in this study. A majority of the adolescents were staying with parents in rural areas. The adolescents received some allowance and reported performing consumer roles. Chi square tests were conducted to determine parent-adolescent behavioral overlap and congruity of response. Adolescents tend to behave {{in a manner similar}} to their parents; both parent and adolescent perceptions pertaining to their interaction about consumption were congruent. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine factors significantly influencing adolescent-parent interaction about consumption and adolescent consumer activism. Parents income, number of siblings, and interval between allowances had a negative influence on adolescent-parent interaction about consumption. Sibling ranking, parental perception of the adolescent-parent interaction, and parent reported consumer practices had a positive influence on this dependent variable. Variance in consumer activism was significantly explained by the index of amenities, adolescent's age, <b>total</b> <b>allowance</b> received by the adolescent, adolescent-parent interaction, parent reported consumer practices and father's occupation. The results indicated that adolescents whose parent performed effective consumer practices tended to perform more of the socially desirable consumer behaviors.

40|$|The {{allocation}} of permits {{is an important}} design aspect of an emissions trading scheme. Traditionally, governments have favoured the free {{allocation of}} greenhouse gas permits based on individual historical emissions (‘grandfathering’) or industry benchmark data. Particularly in the EU, the free allocation of permits has proven complex and inefficient and the distributional implications are politically difficult to justify; auctioning emissions permits has therefore become more popular. The EU is now moving to auction more than 50 per cent of all permits in 2013, and in the US the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) has begun auctioning more than 90 per cent of <b>total</b> <b>allowances.</b> Another {{case in point is}} the Australian proposal for a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS), which provides for auctioning a significant share of total permits.

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} dynamic general {{equilibrium}} model of the U. S. economy to address the federal cap-and-trap issue. The model’s unique treatment of capital dynamics permits {{close attention to the}} impacts of alternative policies on industry profits. We find that freely allocating a relatively small fraction of the emissions allowances generally suffices to prevent profit losses among the eight industries that, without free allowances or other compensation, would suffer the largest percentage losses of profit. Under a wide range of cap-and-trade designs, freely allocating less than 15 percent of the <b>total</b> <b>allowances</b> prevents profit losses to these most vulnerable industries. Allocating 100 percent of the allowances substantially overcompensates these industries, in many cases causing more than a doubling of profits. These results indicate that profit preservation is consistent with substantial use of auctioning and the generation of considerable auction revenue. GDP costs of cap and trade depend critically on how such revenues are used. When these revenues are employed to finance cuts in marginal income tax rates, the resulting GDP costs are about 33 percent lower. On the other hand, when the auction proceeds are returned to the economy in lump-sum fashion, the potential costadvantages of auctioning are not realized. cap-and-trade, environmental legislation, greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a production model involving a manufacturer that uses two different technologies, the green {{technology and the}} standard technology. The green product produced by the green technology {{can be used as}} a substitute for the traditional product produced by the standard technology, but not vice versa. Three models are considered. The first model concerns with product substitution only and serves as a benchmark model for the next two models, the carbon emission allowance model and the carbon emission trading model. The second model extends the product substitution model by imposing an upper limit on the <b>total</b> carbon emission <b>allowance</b> for each firm. The third model extends the second model to cater for carbon emission trading. For the carbon emission allowance model, analytical result shows that the optimal production quantity of any product depends on both its <b>total</b> carbon emission <b>allowance</b> quota and its unit carbon emission profit, and the effect of substitution improves the service level, the expected profit of the manufacturer, and the green of product mix. For the carbon emission trading model, analytical result shows that whenever the production quantity of any product is optimal, the marginal profit of production (i. e. the additional profit obtained by producing an extra item) should be equal to the unit price of carbon emission trading within the market. Moreover, the optimal policy of either model reduces the total amount of carbon emission, thus producing less pollution to the environment. Lastly, the optimal profits obtained by using the carbon emission trading model are larger than the corresponding optimal profits obtained by using the carbon emission allowance model.
