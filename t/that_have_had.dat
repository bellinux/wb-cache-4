5|$|Although The Volcano is {{estimated}} to have last erupted 150years ago, {{it is one of}} the five volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province that have recorded seismicity since 1985. Others include Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events) and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are probably active, with significant potential hazards. The seismic activity corresponds both with some of Canada's recently formed volcanoes and with persistent volcanoes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> major explosive activity throughout their history, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
5|$|Between two {{and five}} solar eclipses occur every year, {{with at least}} one per eclipse season. Since the Gregorian {{calendar}} was instituted in 1582, years <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> five solar eclipses were 1693, 1758, 1805, 1823, 1870, and 1935. The next occurrence will be 2206. On average, there are about 240 solar eclipses each century.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of its history the Oregon Supreme Court has made a number {{decisions}} as the highest court in Oregon. These cases cover {{a wide range of}} topics from the constitutionality of various ballot measures to contract law to torts and even to the location of the capital when Oregon was still a territory. Although small in comparison to the total number of cases the court has decided, some cases have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court. Below are some of the cases <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> scholarly discussion, some of which were later decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Rehabilitation is {{available}} to some confiscated slow lorises. Organizations such as the International Animal Rescue (IAR) run sanctuaries that offer lifelong care to slow lorises <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> their teeth removed, while also providing education and awareness programs to local people to help end domestic trade. By collaborating with authorities, healthy slow lorises are released back into the wild. However, identification is critical because authorities still manage all slow lorises {{as if they were}} from one species, resulting in species being released into the wrong locations and increasing confusion in taxonomy and conservation.|$|E

5|$|Short-period comets have orbits lasting {{less than}} two hundred years. Long-period comets have orbits lasting {{thousands}} of years. Short-period comets are thought to originate in the Kuiper belt, whereas long-period comets, such as Hale–Bopp, are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. Many comet groups, such as the Kreutz Sungrazers, formed from the breakup of a single parent. Some comets with hyperbolic orbits may originate outside the Solar System, but determining their precise orbits is difficult. Old comets <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> most of their volatiles driven out by solar warming are often categorised as asteroids.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of all Pacific typhoons <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{their names}} retired by the Japan Meteorological Agency. A total of 38typhoon names have been retired since the start of {{official}} tropical cyclone naming in the western North Pacific Ocean in 2000. Tropical cyclone names are retired by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in a meeting in January or February. Those typhoons that have their names retired tend to be exceptionally destructive storms. Several names were removed or altered naming list for various reasons other than retirement. Collectively, retired typhoons have caused over $68billion in damage (USD), as well as over 12,000deaths.|$|E

5|$|Wild tigers <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> {{no prior}} contact with humans {{actively}} avoid interactions with humans. However, tigers cause more human deaths through direct attack {{than any other}} wild mammal. Attacks are occasionally provoked, as tigers lash out after being injured while they themselves are hunted. Attacks can be provoked accidentally, as when a human surprises a tiger or inadvertently comes between {{a mother and her}} young, or as in a case in rural India when a postman startled a tiger, used to seeing him on foot, by riding a bicycle. Occasionally tigers come to view people as prey. Such attacks are most common in areas where population growth, logging, and farming have put pressure on tiger habitats and reduced their wild prey. Most man-eating tigers are old, missing teeth, and unable to capture their preferred prey. For example, the Champawat Tiger, a tigress found in Nepal and then India, had two broken canines. She was responsible for an estimated 430 human deaths, the most attacks known to be perpetrated by a single wild animal, {{by the time she was}} shot in 1907 by Jim Corbett. According to Corbett, tiger attacks on humans are normally in daytime, when people are working outdoors and are not keeping watch. Early writings tend to describe man-eating tigers as cowardly because of their ambush tactics.|$|E
