40|$|AbstractAirline {{transportation}} frequently has to {{deal with}} disruptions, like <b>technical</b> <b>breakdowns</b> or bad weather conditions. Resulting delays often lead to additional delays, due to interdependencies between different resources such as aircraft or crews. In the following schedules may become infeasible during the day of operations. This forces the operations control to recover those schedules by mostly expensive actions. Regarding this difficulty robust scheduling deals with the construction of schedules that are less affected by disruptions, e. g. by increasing delay tolerance or providing possibilities for low-cost recovery actions. Robustness consists of two aspects, stability and flexibility. Stability describes the degree of the ability of a schedule to remain feasible and cost efficient under different operational environments without major modifications. In contrast, flexibility is the ability of a schedule to be adapted to changing environments in operations at low costs. However, increasing robustness accompanies with an increase of the planning costs. Thus a main goal of robust scheduling is its efficiency. In this context a method is efficient, if it obtains a high increase of robustness for a low increase of costs. In this paper we present a stochastic optimization model with respect to swapping opportunities of crews. We propose a run-time saving solution approach to integrate flexibility indicators into a column generation framework with a constraint generation extension. In order to realistically evaluate the robustness of the schedules we use a scenario based simulation model with enabled recovery actions for a realistic evaluation. The results show that the approach allows us to generate crew schedules with higher flexibility degrees at low increase of the planned costs in comparison with cost-efficient schedules...|$|R

There were 93 nurses (19 national and 74 expatriate nurses) who answered modified questionnaires to the aims of our prospective and descriptive correlational study. Our results show that most nurses involved in the study (national and expatriate) experienced a mild level of stress (79 % and 68 %, respectively) and moderate level of burnout (42 % and 38 %, respectively). The most common stressor among the national nurses was <b>technical</b> <b>breakdowns</b> of machines (15. 9 %) and that among expatriates was job insecurity (16. 9 %).

At the end of 1920 parts of the track along Line 2 had to be replaced due to the use of defective parts during the years of parts shortages. From 1921, the route taken by Line 3 was shortened again, no longer going {{all the way to the}} Cemetery. On 27 June 1923, the [...] "L.B.I.H.i.T." [...] opened a new line, identified as [...] "Line 0". This was a ring line round the central part of Innsbruck, sharing track with existing lines and opened in response to demands from the city council for a permanent uninterrupted tram connection from the main station to the city centre. However, for some reason the line was not a success and two months later services on Line 0 were withdrawn, and alternative options were considered. Line 0 services returned on 1 May 1924, but the subject of the ring route continued to generate disagreement, and there followed further withdrawals and restorations of the service. 1924 was also the year in which Line 1 - once known as the Saggen branch line - was extended and integrated with Line 3, reducing the need for people to change trams. In 1925, Line 5 was introduced which partly compensated for the withdrawal (again) of the Line 0 service, and in this year it was also possible to return Line 2 to operation, briefly, before the frequency of <b>technical</b> <b>breakdowns</b> led to it being suspended again.

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 With current energy demands {{globally}} and locally, {{nuclear energy}} {{remains one of}} the top competitors for cleaner and sustainable energy. The nuclear industry requires more inherent safety and proliferation resistance in reactor design. Thorium has therefore been identified as a possible fuel for future nuclear reactors that can comply with these requirements. However current extraction techniques are expensive, time consuming and generate large quantities of hazardous waste. A possible alternative to conventional solvent extraction of thorium is SFE (Supercritical Fluid Extraction). A monazite sample from the Steenkampskraal mine was investigated using SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) analysis methods to determine the distribution of thorium in the grains that could potentially complicate the effectiveness of the SFE extraction method if zoning is present. The results show a homogeneous distribution with no discernable zonation in the grains. The concentration of Th, Ce and Nd was determined by quantitative MPA (Micro Probe Analysis). The results obtained from the MPA point analysis on several grains show average Th, Ce and Nd concentrations of 6. 5 wt. %, 24. 1 wt. % and 9. 7 wt. % respectively. The extraction of Th+ 4 from a filter paper was conducted to verify the extraction procedure and extractability of transition elements employing SFE. The extraction was conducted using supercritical CO 2 and methanol as co-solvent with TBP (Tributyl Phosphate) and HFA (Hexafluoroacetylacetone) added in situ as chelates. ICP-MS results for the Th+ 4 extraction procedure showed extraction efficiency of 53 % compared to 83 % in literature (Kumar et al. 2009). This marked difference in extraction efficiency is attributed to ineffective trapping methods employed and lack of prior maintenance and support on the extraction apparatus. Subsequently all further extracted samples of Th from monazite were tested using XRF analysis methods. Due to the lack of prior maintenance on the extraction apparatus several <b>technical</b> <b>breakdowns</b> were encountered and addressed from a mechanical engineering standpoint. The operational effectiveness of the modified apparatus was verified through the extraction of marula seed oil and compared with another supercritical fluid (SF) extractor to show 50 % extraction efficiency in each case. A review of the literature indicated that the crystal chemical requirements for substitution of trivalent (Ce+ 3) for tetravalent (Th+ 4) may be fulfilled during SFE processes. Experimental substitution extractions were conducted by addition of different chelates and were conducted by subjecting the monazite samples to 20 MPa pressure for 180 min static flow and 10 min continuous flow extraction times with a CO 2 flow rate of 2 mL/min with 10 % co-solvent flow rate. The results of the two sets of substitution extractions namely α and β show no clear indication of Th extraction. The maximum theoretical efficiency obtainable under current extraction equipment limitations was calculated as 12 %. The XRF analysis error margin was given by the analytical laboratory as 10 %. The literature has shown the substitution of trivalent cations for tetravalent cations in the monazite structure to be a valid reaction mechanism. The experimental results showed little or no success in extracting thorium from monazite. In order to prove the practical feasibility of thorium extraction several changes to the experimental operating conditions is required. Master...|$|R
40|$|The {{society of}} today is highly {{dependent}} on technical infrastructures. Several incidents around the world the last decades have clearly highlighted the major effects <b>technical</b> infrastructure <b>breakdowns</b> have on life, health and economy of society. The vulnerabilities inherent in our technical infrastructures must be addressed in a proactive manner; it is not feasible to wait for major incidents to highlight them. What further exaggerates the complexities of technical infrastructures {{is that they are}} highly interconnected and mutually dependent of each other. Disturbances in one infrastructure can thus easily spread and influence the function of several other infrastructures, leading to widespread consequences for society. In order to proactively and properly manage technical infrastructures, different types of risk and vulnerability analyses give valuable input. The aim of thesis is to develop a modelling approach and methods for such analyses, with focus on identifying technical infrastructure vulnerabilities. The presented modelling approach is based on dividing the model of the technical infrastructure into one structural and one functional part, enabling the analysis of interdependent technical infrastructures for both structural and functional strains. The methods for vulnerability analysis have three perspectives, in order to comprehensively address the complexities of vulnerabilities from different viewpoints: global vulnerability analysis, critical component analysis and geographical vulnerability analysis. As the resilience of technical infrastructures depends critically on the restoration capacities of supporting actors, a method addressing this is also presented. The focus of the presented methods is on vulnerability analysis of technical infrastructures, but their use in wider context of risk and vulnerability management is also addressed. Empirical studies of electrical distribution systems and a railway system, consisting of seven interdependent subsystems, have been carried out to demonstrate the proposed modelling approach and the applicability and validity of the methods to address the complexities associated with identifying vulnerabilities of interdependent socio-technical infrastructures. It is concluded that the proposed research gives a valuable foundation for input to proactive policy- and decision-making of technical infrastructure risks and vulnerabilities...|$|R
