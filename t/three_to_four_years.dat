5|$|Home {{propagation}} is best {{performed by}} using offset bulbils. Commercially, only cultivars that produce {{at least three}} bulbils on the mother bulb are used for this form of propagation. Plants grown from this method take <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> to bloom.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{seasonal}} high rainfall in the Shinano's watershed {{the fertile}} farmlands on the Niigata plain {{were subjected to}} flooding every <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> which destroyed crops, particularly rice, and villages. Attempts from local residents to secure funding to build a diversion channel began in the mid-early eighteenth century, during the Kyōhō era. Government support was not secured until {{the early twentieth century}} following severe flooding and inundation in 1896.|$|E

5|$|As {{with most}} small birds, {{mortality}} {{in the first}} year of life is high, but adults aged <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by stoats, weasels and crows such as the European magpie, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey, particularly the sparrowhawk. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.|$|E

5|$|Solitary {{places are}} the best venues for yoga. A matha (hut) in a forest is ideal, but any private place that is free from distractions, high winds or intense {{sunshine}} is a good location for yoga. Either a pad made of kusha grass or a solid ground with deer skin mat on it, is desirable. Yoga can be learned, {{with the help of}} a teacher, within three to four months if practiced six times a day. If frequent practice is not possible, yoga can be mastered over a period of <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5000|$|I {{have a broad}} {{question}} for the minister. Does he really believe in science {{and the implications of}} scientific inquiry? I have a more specific question that will put a fine point on it. There is a vast bunch of science out there that says that life was created on this planet <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> billion <b>years</b> ago, and there are other theories. Does the minister believe that life was created on this planet through evolution <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> billion <b>years</b> ago or does he subscribe to a different theory?

50|$|When {{the school}} was first founded in September 1990, it had 23 students, {{including}} 16 kindergarten students and 7 students in grades 1 through 4. In December 1990 the enrollment increased to 30 students. Around 1990, when {{the school was}} first established, {{most of the students}} were born in Japan. The parents typically resided in the United States for <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>year</b> periods before taking themselves and their families back to Japan. Most of the parents worked for Japanese companies, and they wanted their children to easily adjust to the Japanese educational system upon their return to Japan.|$|R
5|$|The length time {{in which}} {{offspring}} stay with their mother varies, though it can last until the female's next calving. Likewise, calves may suckle for only a month or {{as long as a}} year. Females become sexually mature when they are four years old, while males become mature at four or five years. Spermatogenesis in male giraffes begins at <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of age. Males must wait until they are at least seven years old to gain the opportunity to mate.|$|E
5|$|The merger {{led to a}} {{clash of}} two {{organisational}} cultures. While VAT had a flat organisation, open communication among its workforce and a spirit of togetherness, SAT's organisation was strictly hierarchical. The division of portfolios between Karis and Hämeenlinna was changed after the merger. Lorry production was gradually concentrated at Karis and Sisu-Hämeenlinna focused on producing mobile cranes, bus chassis, terminal tractors and military vehicles. Former VAT personnel had to increase production of the new portfolio and simultaneously adopt new processes, so it was <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> before the Hämeenlinna factory could deliver results in line with its capacity.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is highly flexible. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become sexually mature {{at the age of}} <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> while females can conceive at just one year of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. Though there is no fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. The calves are weaned at eight to nine months of age.|$|E

5|$|Dwindling party {{membership}} created {{many problems}} for Quisling, especially financial ones. For {{years he had}} been in financial difficulties and reliant on his inheritance, while increasing numbers of his paintings were found to be copies when he tried to sell them. Vidkun and his brother Arne sold one Frans Hals painting for just four thousand dollars, believing it to be a copy and not the fifty-thousand-dollar artwork they had once thought it to be, only to see it reclassified as an original and revalued at a hundred thousand dollars. In the difficult circumstances of the Great Depression, even originals did not raise as much as Quisling had hoped. His disillusionment with Norwegian society was furthered by news of the planned constitutional reform of 1938, which would extend the parliamentary term from <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> with immediate effect, a move Quisling bitterly opposed.|$|E
5|$|Kiger Mustangs {{are most}} often dun in color, {{although}} they are found in other solid colors. Compact and well-muscled in appearance, their coloration and phenotype make them {{some of the most}} desired by private buyers when horses are removed from the feral herds. The BLM rounds up the horses from the two herd management areas every <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> and auctions excess horses to the public, returning horses to public lands that meet the desired coloration and phenotype and sometimes exchanging horses between the two herds to maintain genetic diversity. Horses in private ownership may be registered in several breed associations, the largest and oldest being the Kiger Mesteño Association, established in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is serotinous—it accumulates a canopy seed bank that is released only in response to fire—so populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants take <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> to reach flowering after a bushfire.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Bridge Telerate {{was sold}} to MoneyLine Network {{as part of the}} Bridge Information Systems {{bankruptcy}} proceedings for just $10 million. As part of the deal, MoneyLine reached an agreement with Reuters for the collection and aggregation of market data and other services for a <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>year</b> transition period. It also reached an agreement with SAVVIS Communications Corporation for network services, so that it could continue to offer Telerate services. The business was renamed MoneyLine Telerate. However, the relationship with Reuters was troublesome and would lead to a major dispute with Reuters in 2003 when Reuters threatened to cut Telerate's data feeds, which was only narrowly avoided.|$|R
50|$|Some {{nutritional}} {{experts believe}} that early hominids evolved into eating meat {{as a result of}} huge climatic changes that took place <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> million <b>years</b> ago, when forests and jungles dried up and became open grasslands and opened hunting and scavenging opportunities.|$|R

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, Banksia caleyi {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.caleyi belongs to the reseeder group. In the wild, seedlings take at least <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> to reach flowering after bushfire. Non-patchy fires occurring at intervals of less than seven years may wipe out local populations of reseeders.|$|E
5|$|Under the Maryland Constitution of 1776, the Governor {{was chosen}} for one-year terms by both houses of the General Assembly. An 1838 {{constitutional}} amendment allowed voters to elect the Governor to three-year terms from one of three rotating gubernatorial districts: eastern, southern, and western. At each election, only voters from a single gubernatorial election district selected the Governor. The Maryland Constitution of 1851 lengthened the Governor's term of office from <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years,</b> which brought elections for Governor in line with elections for Federal offices that occur only in even years. Finally, the Constitution of 1864 eliminated the rotating gubernatorial election districts and, since the election of 1868, the Governor has been elected by all the voters of the state.|$|E
5|$|With some exceptions, {{most notably}} the unparalleled 22-year tenure of John Kourkouas, or in times of {{domestic}} instability, Domestics were changed on the average every <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>years.</b> During the 10th century, the Domesticate of the Schools was dominated {{by members of the}} Phokas family, which produced six holders of the office. Their attempts to monopolize the office led a series of emperors, concerned over the power of the military aristocracy, to entrust the potentially over-powerful office to non-military court officials, including—especially {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, before the military aristocracy reasserted its authority—to eunuchs, even though this was in theory forbidden, with the alternate office of stratopedarches having been created for this purpose.|$|E
