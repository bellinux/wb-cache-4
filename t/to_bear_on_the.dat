5|$|However, another {{obstacle}} arose {{with the}} Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in}} a boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western World, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli, however, realised that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the athletes to fight for their right to compete.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{was forced}} to change his plans. Longstreet would command Pickett's Virginia {{division}} of his own First Corps, plus six brigades from Hill's Corps, in {{an attack on the}} U.S. II Corps position at the right center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Prior to the attack, all the artillery the Confederacy could bring <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> U.S. positions would bombard and weaken the enemy's line.|$|E
5|$|On Russell's Top the Auckland Mounted Rifles {{were in a}} {{precarious}} position; their trenches were still far from being fully constructed, and three saps heading towards The Nek {{had yet to be}} joined up. The 19th Division, using hand grenades, attacked the New Zealanders' position in three waves. The Wellington Mounted Rifles to the north were able to bring their machine-guns <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> attackers. The flanking fire caused devastation amongst the Turkish ranks. At the same time the Aucklands charged them in a counter-attack, forcing the survivors to withdraw.|$|E

This position shows the rudder locked into a 20° port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the aft turrets 'X' and 'Y' <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> German ships.|$|E
5|$|With {{discipline}} breaking down, Spartacus {{turned his}} forces around and brought his entire strength <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> oncoming legions. In this last stand, the Battle of the Siler River, Spartacus' forces were finally routed completely, {{with the vast}} majority of them being killed on the battlefield. All the ancient historians stated that Spartacus was also killed on the battlefield. However, his body was never found.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} first night, {{indirect}} fire had again {{played a crucial role}} in the defence, with the New Zealand gunners firing another 5,700 rounds (out of a divisional total of 9,500 rounds) in support of the Australians and the US Marines. Dug-in to the east, 16 RNZA had been forced to fire with minimum crest clearance over the Australian lines in order to bring effective fire <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> assaulting Chinese from their 25-pounders. Using both variable time proximity and time-set fuses, the New Zealand gunners used air bursts to break up the Chinese assaults, causing heavy casualties. Despite the risk of causing casualties among their own soldiers no serious casualties were incurred by the Australians, although one suffered a broken shoulder after a brass nose cone from a faulty time-of-flight fused shell exploded over his position. High explosive was also provided by C Company's 60mm mortar which operated against the Chinese in no man's land despite being exposed and unprotected from fire, while the mortars also provided battlefield illumination which had allowed the Australian riflemen and machine-gunners to bring accurate fire <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chinese crossing 2 RAR's front to attack Hills 111 and 121. The Chinese had suffered heavily during the fighting, with over 300 dead counted in front of Hill 111 alone. Throughout the following day the Australians observed a steady stream of Chinese casualties evacuating Hill 111 and crossing the paddy fields on the left flank. Later, a group of 20 armed Chinese had also attempted to withdraw but were engaged by the 2 RAR Anti-Tank Platoon, resulting in at least six casualties. In the area held by the US 1st Marine Division, Chinese shelling continued sporadically, while at 13:30 the US 1st Marine Regiment assumed operational control of the right sector.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages the Bishop of Rennes had the {{privilege}} of crowning the dukes of Brittany in his cathedral. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> occasion of his first entry into Rennes it was customary for him <b>to</b> be <b>borne</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulders of four Breton barons.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Dubourdieu, Captain Péridier on Flore ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The {{battered}} Favorite led with an attempt to round Amphion and rake her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention. The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to wear, turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion {{and as a result}} the squadron's formation became disorganised. Favorite, which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi Arabia women's {{national}} football {{team would be}} the national team representing the kingdom in inter{{national football}}. However, the team does not yet exist because of influence of religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, systematic discrimination against women's sport, and active opposition of political leaders and sport administrators. International pressure has come <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> country to field a women's team, and FIFA now allows the hijab to be worn in competition. A meeting at the College of Business Administration in Jeddah {{was seen as a}} possible first step in a team eventually being created.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} {{classification of}} birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about {{the relationships between the}} orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E

Throughout the siege, the Battery lost two killed and six wounded.|$|R
5|$|Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and {{the valley}} itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense {{fighting}} flagged {{with the onset}} of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions. The plebiscite was never held, and on 26 January 1950, the Constitution of India came into force in Kashmir, but with special provisions made for the state. India did not, however, secure administrative control over all of Kashmir. The northern and western portions of Kashmir came under Pakistan's control in 1947, and are today Pakistan-administered Kashmir. In the 1962 Sino-Indian War, China occupied Aksai Chin, the north-eastern region bordering Ladakh, which it continues to control and administer.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish {{forces had}} {{performed}} diversionary {{attacks on the}} outskirts of the city on two consecutive nights in order to tire the defenders, and at midnight on February 11, 1659, the main attack commenced. The main spearhead of the Swedish forces attacked from south of St. Jørgens lake with the King himself in overall command. A hundred cannons on Slotsholmen were brought <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Swedish attackers with fast and accurate fire. The two attacking divisions advanced nevertheless, led by general-major Fabian von Fersen and general-major Johan von Essen. They reached the outer palisades on the ice, which were quickly breached, but the Swedes were immediately stopped by holes in the ice that the Danes had cut. The bridges they had brought were not long enough after the ice moats had been widened with the help of Dutch marines. Caught on the ice, the Swedes were in the open and subject to heavy fire. Longer bridges were eventually brought, and the attack continued towards the city walls. The battle was ferocious, with the attackers desperately trying to establish a bridgehead on the walls. But in the end, the defenders were successful and the Swedes were thrown back.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter of figure 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E
50|$|After the Second World War came reconstruction. Municipal councils at {{the time}} quickly {{recognized}} the importance of a “growing” village. As early as the 1960s, new building zones were being laid out. At the same time, efforts were brought <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> modernizing <b>the</b> village centre and building a multipurpose hall, the Soonblickhalle, which was dedicated in 1979.|$|R

5|$|The {{team had}} {{originally}} {{wanted to create}} the game's boss battles in-house around the game's similar elements of player choice, with their initial design inspired by the boss fights in Metal Gear Solid. As the development on the story and gameplay framework took priority, boss battles became less and less of a focus. It eventually reached a point when the main development team could not complete them {{in time for the}} game's release. The team contemplated cutting them, but that would have negatively impacted the story and other areas of the game's design. In the end, development of the boss battles was outsourced to Grip Entertainment. Having been given access to the game's engine, Grip Entertainment were given the task of creating the boss battles and incorporating them into the framework of Human Revolution. For this, they needed to incorporate their own technology into the system, working from Eidos' specifications while bringing their own development style <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> project. They also attempted to balance the boss fights' action-focused approach with the other elements within Human Revolution so it would be accessible to all players.|$|E

25|$|With Japan's economy {{driven by}} its {{high rates of}} reinvestment, this crash hit {{particularly}} hard.
