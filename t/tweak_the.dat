5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team {{to add more}} details to the character designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right analog stick. In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 2004, Jagannadh met Mahesh Babu at the Taj Hotel in Hyderbad {{to outline}} the film's plot. It {{told the story}} of Uttam Singh, an {{undercover}} police officer, infiltrating a mafia gang as a criminal, with the intention of killing its kingpin. Mahesh liked the script but suggested Jagannadh <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> script's backdrop to suit the Telugu-speaking peoples' sensibilities. Jagannadh agreed and also replaced the existing title with Pokiri. Mahesh wanted the film's production to begin in 2005 allowing him to complete his current commitments. While he waited for Mahesh, Jagannadh directed Akkineni Nagarjuna in Super (2005). While reworking the script, Jagannadh took inspiration from Marana Mrudangam (1988) and State Rowdy (1989). Pokiri was produced jointly by Jagannadh and Manjula Ghattamaneni's production companies, Vaishno Academy and Indira Productions respectively, on a budget of 100120 million.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{developers}} planned to only upgrade the graphics and <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> gameplay. However, as development was {{getting closer to}} completion, Capcom started making more substantial changes in the game. For example, the inventory was expanded so that players could carry a standard item like Jill's lock picking, while defense items, which were initially {{not going to be}} separated from the main inventory, were introduced to make the game a bit easier than the original Resident Evil. The developers originally planned to make all enemies invisible but the idea was ultimately discarded because it would have made the remake very different from the original game. However, they designed the zombies so that they could come back to life {{a certain amount of time}} after they are killed. The developers also added new areas for the player to explore, changed most of the puzzle designs, and included a new control scheme called Type C where players move their characters by pressing the R button of the GameCube controller and steer them with the analog stick. Another addition is the subplot involving the character Lisa Trevor, which was cut from the original game. Instead of using adjectives to describe difficulty levels, Mikami deliberately decided to have unique questions so that the player would pick the hard one.|$|E

25|$|Clausen {{argued that}} the poem, were one to remove lines 1–3 and 58–9, would read much like an epithalamium, or a poem written {{specifically}} for a bride {{on the way to}} her marital chamber. However, the addition of the aforementioned lines changes the sense of the poem, making it pastoral. Thus, Clausen claims that Virgil himself added these new lines to <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> poem and make it suitable for inclusion in the Eclogues.|$|E
25|$|After the Hulk had {{suffered}} brain damage upon being {{shot in the}} head by the Order of the Shield- the assassin having been carefully trained to target Bruce at just the right part of the brain to incapacitate him without triggering a transformation- Iron Man used the Extremis to cure the Hulk. This procedure also increased Banner's mental capacity, which gave him the intelligence to <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> Extremis virus within him and unleash a new persona for the Hulk: the super-intelligent Doc Green.|$|E

25|$|In 1908, he {{organized}} {{a group of}} 70 founders to contribute $1,000 each, and the National Golf Links of America opened for play in 1909. Many of the holes were his versions of famous holes from British courses, a pattern he would repeat on later courses. Macdonald would <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> course {{for the rest of}} his life, altering every hole somewhat over the next 30 years. The course hosted the inaugural Walker Cup in 1922, and is considered a landmark of golf architecture even today. In 2005, Golf Digest ranked it the #9 course in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the basic}} {{concept of the}} strip is simple, Herriman always found ways to <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> formula. Ignatz's plans to surreptitiously lob a brick at Krazy's head {{sometimes}} succeed; other times Officer Pupp outsmarts Ignatz and imprisons him. The interventions of Coconino County's other anthropomorphic animal residents, and even forces of nature, occasionally change the dynamic in unexpected ways. Other strips have Krazy's imbecilic or gnomic pronouncements irritating the mouse {{so much that he}} goes to seek out a brick in the final panel. Even self-referential humor is evident—in one strip, Officer Pupp, having arrested Ignatz, berates Herriman for not having finished drawing the jailhouse.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{definition}} of a PostBQP circuit family is one with two outbit qubits P (postselection) and Q (output) with a single measurement of P and Q at the end such that the probability of measuring P=1 has nonzero probability, the conditional probability Pr≥2/3 if the inputx is in the language, and Pr≥2/3 if the input x {{is not in the}} language. For technical reasons we <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> {{definition of}} PostBQP as follows: we require that Pr≥2n'c for some constant c depending on the circuit family. Note this choice does not affect the basic properties of PostBQP, and also it can be shown that any computation consisting of typical gates (e.g. Hadamard, Toffoli) has this property whenever Pr>0.|$|E

25|$|The most {{sensitive}} pigment, rhodopsin, has a peak response at 500nm. Small {{changes to the}} genes coding for this protein can <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> peak response by a few nm; pigments in the lens can also filter incoming light, changing the peak response. Many organisms are unable to discriminate between colours, seeing instead in shades of grey; colour vision necessitates a range of pigment cells which are primarily sensitive to smaller ranges of the spectrum. In primates, geckos, and other organisms, these {{take the form of}} cone cells, from which the more sensitive rod cells evolved. Even if organisms are physically capable of discriminating different colours, this {{does not necessarily mean that}} they can perceive the different colours; only with behavioural tests can this be deduced.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{ingredients}} are fictional, mixing them together creates nonfictional cocktails as well, {{such as the}} Piledriver or Blue Fairy. To add additional variety, patrons at the bar may ask for single, multiple, or one large drink; these drinks can be served either aged or with ice. Players must also pay attention to infer what patrons actually want, which may be {{different from what they}} order. For example, a character might be feeling depressed and ask for a sweet drink, though the player instead giving them a shot of alcohol to help them forget their troubles would have a better effect. Alternately, the player may {{be able to make a}} character happy by talking to them instead of letting them feed on their alcoholism. At various points, the player can also <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> customer's drink, such as adding Karmotrine to a cocktail that was previously non-alcoholic. In these ways, the player creates new scenarios as they advance in the game.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, to {{rationalize}} sensory dominance, Gori et al. (2008) advocates {{that the brain}} utilises the most direct source of information during sensory immaturity. In this case, orientation is primarily a visual characteristic. It can be derived directly from the object image that forms on the retina, irrespective of other visual factors. In fact, data shows that a functional property of neurons within primate visual cortices' are their discernment to orientation. In contrast, haptic orientation judgements are recovered through collaborated patterned stimulations, evidently an indirect source susceptible to interference. Likewise, when size is concerned haptic information coming from positions of the fingers is more immediate. Visual-size perceptions, alternatively, have to be computed using parameters such as slant and distance. Considering this, sensory dominance is a useful instinct to assist with calibration. During sensory immaturity, the more simple and robust information source {{could be used to}} <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of the alternate source. Follow-up work by Gori et al. (2012) showed that, at all ages, vision-size perceptions are near perfect when viewing objects within the haptic workspace (i.e. at arm's reach). However, systematic errors in perception appeared when the object was positioned beyond this zone. Children younger than 14 years tend to underestimate object size, whereas adults overestimated. However, if the object was returned to the haptic workspace, those visual biases disappeared. These results support the hypothesis that haptic information may educate visual perceptions. If sources are used for cross-calibration they cannot, therefore, be combined (integrated). Maintaining access to individual estimates is a trade-off for extra plasticity over accuracy, which could be beneficial in retrospect to the developing body.|$|E
50|$|Since {{shifting}} to AC, KTDY has <b>tweaked</b> <b>the</b> format {{back and forth}} from mainstream AC to oldies-based Soft AC in the early 1990s to Hot AC in 1998, then back to mainstream AC in 2000.|$|R

500|$|After {{the success}} of Karan's debut film, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), he began work on a story dealing {{with the concept of}} [...] "generations". The idea {{initially}} revolved around two daughters-in-law. However, on the advice of filmmaker Aditya Chopra, who thought that the male characters would be too weak, Karan decided to <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> story-line to make it the story of two brothers.|$|E
500|$|An article {{published}} in People's Daily, China's top state newspaper, accused the United States and NATO of flouting international law and fanning terrorism. Simultaneously, many Chinese scholars, analysts and members of leading think tanks also expressed strong criticism of NATO's attack. A former spokesperson for the US state department said China, which is a close ally of Pakistan, [...] "sees this as a target of opportunity, both to <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> US and to subtly suggest to Pakistan that if it really sours of {{its relationship with the}} US, it has an alternative".|$|E
500|$|Both Seeley and Norton are {{writers as}} well as artists, so each contributed to {{character}} designs and plot ideas. When promoting the series prior to release, Norton described Revival as the closet collaboration he had ever worked on. One character in particular, Em Cypress, had been {{a work in progress}} for nearly 20 years. She began as a sketch Seeley did in 1996 and was heavily influenced by The Crow. [...] He continued to <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> character over the years, and a version of her was pitched to Tokyopop for an Original English Language manga in 2005. He also considered using her in Hack/Slash, but that version eventually became Acid Angel.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, Marshall Fritz, {{founder of}} Advocates for Self-Government, <b>tweaked</b> <b>the</b> chart and added ten {{questions}} - {{which he called}} the World's Smallest Political Quiz - which enabled people to plot their political beliefs on the chart.|$|R

500|$|In November 2010, {{during the}} Asian Games held in China, the Singaporean men's water polo team's swim trunks came under {{controversy}} for inappropriately displaying {{elements of the}} Singaporean Flag. [...] Critics deemed the garment insulting and an embarrassment to the country, with the crescent moon positioned in {{the centre of the}} brief, directly over the crotch area. [...] The garment had been designed by the team itself but had not received prior approval from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts. [...] However, even after the controversy came to light, the team was still able to continue wearing it as competition rules did not permit changing a team's uniform midway through the Games. [...] The team was apologetic over the blunder and promised to <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> design after that competition.|$|E
500|$|InKredulous is {{a comedy}} panel quiz show, {{inspired}} by {{shows such as}} Mock the Week, Have I Got News for You, and The News Quiz, featuring a variety of guests from the skeptic community. In the pilot episode, host Andy Wilson described it as [...] "the quiz show where we satirically examine news stories, websites, events and personalities who will <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> spider sense of our sceptical listeners and delicous looking panelists." [...] The first episode was released on 8 February 2010. Hosts of other podcasts are frequently guests, including Steven Novella of The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe, Robin Ince of Infinite Monkey Cage, George Hrab of Geologic, Brian Dunning of Skeptoid, Kylie Sturgess of Token Skeptic, Ross Blocher and Carrie Poppy of Oh No, Ross and Carrie!, and others.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Clarkson explains that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] is [...] "about the dipstick who completely screwed up and now is unhappy and you're happy." [...] She also considered the song {{as one of her}} favorites that she once intended to name Breakaway after the song. Critics speculated that the song reflects Clarkson's break-up with David Hodges, an ex-member of Evanescence. According to MTV, the song was originally written prior to the break-up. Nonetheless, Clarkson decided to <b>tweak</b> <b>the</b> song lyrics after breaking up with Hodges to express her emotional pain. Clarkson also said that the song almost did not make it into the album. She explained, [...] "It had different lyrics in the beginning [...] I ended up calling Luke , the writer, and we did a totally different song to it. It's now my favorite song on the record. Crappy relationships [...] a good song." ...|$|E
