5|$|Changeling is a 2008 American mystery thriller film directed, co-produced {{and scored}} by Clint Eastwood and written by J. Michael Straczynski, that explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, {{political}} corruption, mistreatment {{of mental health}} patients, and <b>the</b> <b>repercussions</b> of violence. The script was based on real-life events, specifically the 1928 Wineville Chicken Coop Murders in Mira Loma, California. The film stars Angelina Jolie as a woman reunited with a boy whom she immediately realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate this {{to the police and}} city authorities, she is vilified as delusional, labeled as an unfit mother, and then confined to a psychiatric ward.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the 1946 {{championship}} game, Bell {{was notified}} that Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock of the New York Giants had been implicated in a bribing scandal. Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes was suspended. At the next NFL owners' meeting, Bell was worried <b>the</b> <b>repercussions</b> from this event would lead to his firing. However, he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year. Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring is {{featured}} in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being during the Prague Spring. It follows <b>the</b> <b>repercussions</b> of increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police {{control of the}} population. A film version was released in 1988. The Liberators, by Viktor Suvorov, is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, {{from the point of}} view of a Soviet tank commander. Rock 'n' Roll, a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 Velvet Revolution. Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir Under a Cruel Star with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.|$|E
30|$|In our study, we {{compared}} <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects for Tokyo and Kyoto {{in terms of}} domestic tourist expenditure using an IR-WIO approach. As mentioned in Sect.  1, the advantage of using an IR-WIO analysis to analyze <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects of consumption in a specific region is that economic and environmental effects, such as waste generation, transportation, and landfilling, can be considered simultaneously.|$|R
30|$|First, {{the impacts}} were {{compared}} {{from an economic}} perspective. <b>The</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects on <b>the</b> production value attributed to consumption by domestic tourists were approximately 434 billion yen in Tokyo and 260 billion yen in Kyoto. Considering that the direct effects of tourism in Tokyo were {{twice as large as}} those in Kyoto, <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects on <b>the</b> production value in both regions were relatively similar. <b>The</b> value-added <b>repercussion</b> effects amounted to approximately 276 billion yen in Tokyo and approximately 108 billion yen in Kyoto.|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we compare}} <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects in Tokyo and Kyoto of the {{domestic}} tourist expenditures described in Sect.  3. As shown above, consumption by domestic tourists staying overnight in Kyoto Prefecture {{is less than half}} that for Tokyo. We considered the disparity in magnitude of the economic activities of the two prefectures when we investigated and compared <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects induced by tourist consumption in Tokyo and Kyoto.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>repercussions</b> {{from the}} Rapid Wien ties {{followed}} Celtic into the 1985–86 European Cup Winners' Cup campaign. The first round saw them pitted against old foes Atlético Madrid. Mo Johnston's headed goal from a Davie Provan cross and Pat Bonner's late penalty save from Rubio secured a 11 draw away in Madrid, putting Celtic {{in a good}} position to win the tie. The second leg in Glasgow, however, was played in front of an empty stadium as punishment for the fans' behaviour the previous season in the replayed game against Rapid. In the unreal atmosphere of playing behind closed doors, Celtic toiled and lost 21 for another early European exit.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{accident}} {{did not result}} in a large number of deaths, it exposed major stewardship shortcomings of the privatised national railway infrastructure company Railtrack. Reports found {{there was a lack of}} communication and some staff were not aware of maintenance procedures. Railtrack subsequently went into administration and was replaced by Network Rail. The aftermath of {{the accident}} saw widespread speed limit reductions throughout the rail network and a tightening of health and safety procedures, <b>the</b> <b>repercussions</b> of which were still felt up to 15 years later. In 2005, both Network Rail and the contractor Balfour Beatty were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws.|$|E
5|$|The show begins {{after the}} brutal Cardassian {{occupation}} of the planet Bajor. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a Cardassian built space station, Deep Space Nine, near Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the show discover a uniquely stable wormhole that provides immediate access to the distant Gamma Quadrant making Bajor and the station {{one of the most}} strategically important locations in the galaxy. The show chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander (later Captain) Benjamin Sisko, played by Avery Brooks, and Major (later Colonel) Kira Nerys, played by Nana Visitor. Recurring plot elements include <b>the</b> <b>repercussions</b> of the Cardassian occupation of Bajor, Sisko's spiritual role for the Bajorans as the Emissary of the Prophets, and in later seasons a war with the Dominion.|$|E
30|$|Kyoto is {{also well}} known as the birthplace of many forms of Japanese cuisine, which is another {{enticement}} that draws visitors to the city. In such an urban tourist environment, the primary industrial sectors that are stimulated by tourist consumption are restaurants and hotels, which primarily generate food, paper, and plastic wastes. In this study, since we sought an appropriate method for estimating <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects of visitor consumption in an urban tourist setting, we were drawn to the study by Tsukui et al. (2017), which investigated <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects of consumption by domestic tourists in Tokyo and Kyoto using an interregional WIOA. We then adopted the same basic analysis method in order to investigate <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects of consumption by visitors from China, Taiwan, and Korea.|$|R

5|$|When the French colonized Madagascar in 1896, initial Betsimisaraka {{satisfaction}} {{with the fall of}} the Merina government rapidly evolved into displeasure with French control. This led to an uprising the same year among Betsimisaraka, particularly including the bandits and other outlaws who had long been living according to their own law in the eastern rainforests; the movement extended to the broader Betsimisaraka population, who mounted a strong resistance to French rule between 1897-1899. These efforts were eventually subdued. After regaining control, the French colonial authority took steps to address <b>the</b> <b>repercussions</b> of historical subjugation of the Betsimisaraka by the Merina kingdom, providing increased access to basic education as well as opportunities for paid labor at plantations, but often on former Betsimisaraka land that the French authorities had forced local inhabitants to relinquish to colonists.|$|E
5|$|Modeste and Impérieuse were {{high-quality}} modern {{ships and}} were both immediately recommissioned into the Royal Navy, Modeste {{with the same}} name and Impérieuse as HMS Unite as there was already a ship with a similar name in service. <b>The</b> <b>repercussions</b> of this operation were severe however. Gell, acting on instructions from Hood, had violated Genoese neutrality in a deliberate attempt to intimidate the pro-Republican faction in the city, but their actions were readily seized upon by French propagandists such as Nicolas Ozanne, who portrayed the raid as a massacre of unarmed sailors in print form. The Genoese government broke off diplomatic relations with Britain, permitting only French ships to enter the harbour. The British instituted a blockade, {{and as a result}} the 5,000 Austrian reinforcements destined for Toulon were unable to embark. Drake and all British inhabitants of Genoa were expelled, and Gell initiated a blockade of the city, seizing neutral merchant shipping destined for the port. Three ships were stationed at Leghorn to watch the more quiescent Tuscan government, including the Royalist Scipion. On 26 November, Scipion, which was carrying 150 prisoners taken in the raid on Genoa, caught fire, possibly the result of arson, and was destroyed, although other accounts suggest that a barrel of brandy was ignited accidentally by a candle. The blaze killed 390 of the Royalist crew, many of whom were classed as unfit for duty.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergency}} room {{is filled with}} victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is admitted in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they {{come to the conclusion that}} even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties, in order to perform surgery on a deer, once again letting her emotional involvement interfere with her career. Meredith and Shepherd discuss <b>the</b> <b>repercussions</b> of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings.|$|E

30|$|As the {{economic}} importance of tourism increases, {{it is important}} to consider the effects that tourism has on the environment in the affected regions of the country. In our study, we selected two popular tourist destinations in Japan, Tokyo and Kyoto, for our case studies on <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects induced by {{the economic}} and environmental activities of visitors. As waste generation and landfilling are two of the most important environmental loads in Japan, a regional waste input–output approach was considered to be an effective method for evaluating these issues. The estimated direct effects of visitors’ consumption activities in Tokyo and Kyoto amounted to approximately 434 billion yen and 209 billion yen, respectively. The tendencies of visitor consumption in both prefectures were similar, as were <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects on <b>the</b> production value, which accounted for approximately 434 billion yen and approximately 260 billion yen in Tokyo and Kyoto, respectively. Value added amounted to 276 billion yen in Tokyo and approximately 108 billion yen in Kyoto. Waste generation induced by tourists in Kyoto accounted for approximately 22, 690  t, which was similar to that induced in Tokyo at 20, 655  t. Regarding <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effect of <b>the</b> area of landfill consumption, Kyoto tourists consumed 1479  m 2 of landfill in contrast to 7369  m 2 in Tokyo. The results of our study reveal the importance of considering the regional characteristics of the target region when conducting environmentally sound campaigns directed at stimulating tourism.|$|R

30|$|Metropolitan regions, {{which are}} {{typically}} planned without considering aspects related to sustainability, tend {{to depend on}} neighboring regions for their waste treatment, particularly for the disposal of solid waste in landfills. <b>The</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects of consumption in metropolitan regions may bring about economic benefits. However, quantitative assessments of the interregional relationships between the metropolitan areas and the other regions are {{necessary in order to}} clarify whether the undesirable environmental loads incurred by the surrounding regions are outweighed by economic benefits. In this study, we clarified <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects of consumption by metropolitan residents on production and environmental loads by examining the utilization of landfill sites in these other regions using interregional waste input–output (IRWIO) analysis. Specifically, we investigated the effects of consumption activities in Tokyo, and compiled an IRWIO table for Tokyo in the year 2000. Using this table, we then estimated the effects of landfill utilization in Tokyo and other regions, as well as the associated induced economic and environmental impacts. The results showed that consumption in Tokyo induced limited economic benefits and large-scale utilization of landfills in other regions. Although consumption by Tokyo residents induced an increase in the recycling of municipal solid waste (MSW), thus reducing the amount of waste to be treated in other regions, the total amount of induced landfill volume was 1.7 million cubic meter, which is 2.4 times greater than that of Tokyo. The results quantitatively clarified <b>the</b> <b>repercussion</b> effects associated with consumption by residents in metropolitan areas and illustrated the importance of sustainable waste management to stakeholders, particularly those in metropolitan regions.|$|R
