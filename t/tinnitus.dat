5|$|Large {{doses of}} salicylate, a {{metabolite}} of aspirin, cause temporary <b>tinnitus</b> (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via {{the action on}} arachidonic acid and NMDA receptors cascade.|$|E
5|$|Never {{well off}} and {{struggling}} to make ends meet, he also suffered since youth from chronically bad health, including gout and <b>tinnitus.</b> His health first began to deteriorate during his time in Paris, where the dank climate and unsanitary environment {{did not agree with}} him.|$|E
5|$|The ear may be {{affected}} by disease, including infection and traumatic damage. Diseases of the ear may lead to hearing loss, <b>tinnitus</b> and balance disorders such as vertigo, although many of these conditions may also {{be affected}} by damage to the brain or neural pathways leading from the ear.|$|E
5|$|A {{few times}} during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of <b>tinnitus</b> is heard. This sound {{generally}} coincides {{with the death of}} a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency. In this way, then, the loss of the tones is symbolic of the loss of the characters.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Who {{performed}} Quadrophenia with parts {{played by}} Vedder and Tom Meighan at the Royal Albert Hall {{as part of}} the Teenage Cancer Trust series of 10 gigs. A planned tour for early 2010 was jeopardised by the return of Townshend's <b>tinnitus.</b> He experimented with an in-ear monitoring system that was recommended by Neil Young and his audiologist.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tinnitus</b> is not {{a disease}} but a symptom that can result {{from a number of}} {{underlying}} causes. One of the most common causes is noise-induced hearing loss. Other causes include: ear infections, disease of the heart or blood vessels, Ménière's disease, brain tumors, emotional stress, exposure to certain medications, a previous head injury, and earwax. It is more common in those with depression.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tinnitus</b> is {{the hearing}} of sound when no {{external}} sound is present. While {{often described as}} a ringing, it may also sound like a clicking, hiss or roaring. Rarely, unclear voices or music are heard. The sound may be soft or loud, low pitched or high pitched and appear {{to be coming from}} one ear or both. Most of the time, it comes on gradually. In some people, the sound causes depression, anxiety, or concentration difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Negus {{served in}} the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) with the British Expeditionary Force for the first 18 months of the war. He {{initially}} deployed with the 1st General Hospital, then saw action in the trenches {{on the front line}} with a machine-gun battalion at the First Battle of Ypres. The effects of explosives during this period left him with <b>tinnitus.</b> This was followed by a period serving on hospital barges. In 1916, Negus, still with the RAMC, was posted to the 3rd (Lahore) Division (part of the British Indian Army) and took part in the Mesopotamia Campaign. As one of those who had deployed to the Western Front in the opening months of the war, he was later awarded the Mons Star. His service in the RAMC ended in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of IIH is headache, which occurs {{in almost all}} (92–94%) cases. It is {{characteristically}} worse in the morning, generalized in character and throbbing in nature. It {{may be associated with}} nausea and vomiting. The headache can be made worse by any activity that further increases the intracranial pressure, such as coughing and sneezing. The pain may also be experienced in the neck and shoulders. Many have pulsatile <b>tinnitus,</b> a whooshing sensation in one or both ears (64–87%); this sound is synchronous with the pulse. Various other symptoms, such as numbness of the extremities, generalized weakness, loss of smell, and loss of coordination, are reported more rarely; none are specific for IIH. In children, numerous nonspecific signs and symptoms may be present.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (<b>tinnitus),</b> nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{research}} {{has looked at}} the <b>tinnitus</b> distress reaction (TDR) to account for differences in <b>tinnitus</b> severity. These findings suggest that at the initial perception of <b>tinnitus,</b> conditioning links <b>tinnitus</b> with negative emotions, such as fear and anxiety from unpleasant stimuli at the time. This enhances activity in the limbic system and autonomic nervous system, thus increasing <b>tinnitus</b> awareness and annoyance.|$|E
25|$|Persistent <b>tinnitus</b> {{may cause}} anxiety and depression. <b>Tinnitus</b> {{annoyance}} is more {{strongly associated with}} psychological condition than loudness or frequency range. Psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances and concentration difficulties are common in those with strongly annoying <b>tinnitus.</b> 45% of people with <b>tinnitus</b> have an anxiety disorder {{at some time in}} their life.|$|E
25|$|Pulsatile <b>tinnitus</b> can be {{a symptom}} of {{intracranial}} vascular abnormalities and should be evaluated for irregular noises of blood flow (bruits). Some people experience a sound that beats in time with their pulse (pulsatile <b>tinnitus,</b> or vascular <b>tinnitus).</b> Pulsatile <b>tinnitus</b> is usually objective in nature, resulting from altered blood flow, increased blood turbulence near the ear (such as from atherosclerosis, venous hum, {{but it can also}} arise as a subjective phenomenon from an increased awareness of blood flow in the ear. Rarely, pulsatile <b>tinnitus</b> may be a symptom of potentially life-threatening conditions such as carotid artery aneurysm or carotid artery dissection. Pulsatile <b>tinnitus</b> may also indicate vasculitis, or more specifically, giant cell arteritis. Pulsatile <b>tinnitus</b> may also be an indication of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.|$|E
25|$|Another {{relevant}} parameter of <b>tinnitus</b> is residual inhibition, {{the temporary}} suppression and/or disappearance of <b>tinnitus</b> following {{a period of}} masking. The degree of residual inhibition may indicate how effective <b>tinnitus</b> maskers would be as a treatment modality.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{psychological}} processes related to <b>tinnitus</b> involves measurement of <b>tinnitus</b> severity and distress (i.e. {{nature and extent}} of tinnitus-related problems), measured subjectively by validated self-report <b>tinnitus</b> questionnaires. These questionnaires measure the degree {{of psychological}} distress and handicap associated with <b>tinnitus,</b> including effects on hearing, lifestyle, health and emotional functioning. A broader assessment of general functioning, such as levels of anxiety, depression, stress, life stressors and sleep difficulties, is also important in the assessment of <b>tinnitus</b> due to higher risk of negative well-being across these areas, which may be affected by and/or exacerbate the <b>tinnitus</b> symptoms for the individual. Overall, current assessment measures are aimed to identify individual levels of distress and interference, coping responses and perceptions of <b>tinnitus</b> in order to inform treatment and monitor progress. However, wide variability, inconsistencies and lack of consensus regarding assessment methodology are evidenced in the literature, limiting comparison of treatment effectiveness. Developed to guide diagnosis or classify severity, most <b>tinnitus</b> questionnaires have also been shown to be treatment-sensitive outcome measures.|$|E
25|$|Spontaneous otoacoustic {{emissions}} (SOAEs), {{which are}} faint high-frequency tones that are {{produced in the}} inner ear and {{can be measured in}} the ear canal with a sensitive microphone, may also cause <b>tinnitus.</b> About 8% of those with SOAEs and <b>tinnitus</b> have SOAE-linked <b>tinnitus,</b> while the percentage of all cases of <b>tinnitus</b> caused by SOAEs is estimated at about 4%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinnitus</b> affects 1015% of people. About a {{third of}} North Americans over 55 {{experience}} <b>tinnitus.</b> <b>Tinnitus</b> affects one third of adults {{at some time in}} their lives, whereas ten to fifteen percent are disturbed enough to seek medical evaluation.|$|E
25|$|The best {{supported}} {{treatment for}} <b>tinnitus</b> {{is a type}} of counseling called cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which can be delivered via the internet or in person. It decreases the amount of stress those with <b>tinnitus</b> feel. These benefits appear to be independent of any effect on depression or anxiety in an individual. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) also shows promise in the treatment of <b>tinnitus.</b> Relaxation techniques may also be useful. A clinical protocol called Progressive <b>Tinnitus</b> Management for treatment of <b>tinnitus</b> has been developed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.|$|E
25|$|Subjective <b>tinnitus</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} type of <b>tinnitus.</b> It can have many possible causes, but most commonly it results from hearing loss. A frequent cause of subjective <b>tinnitus</b> is noise exposure that damages hair cells in the inner ear. Subjective <b>tinnitus</b> can only be heard by the affected person and is caused by otological and / or neurological conditions, including those triggered by infections or drugs.|$|E
25|$|Evaluation of <b>tinnitus</b> {{will include}} a hearing test (audiogram), {{measurement}} of acoustic parameters of the <b>tinnitus</b> like pitch and loudness, and psychological assessment of comorbid conditions like depression, anxiety, and stress {{that are associated with}} severity of the <b>tinnitus.</b>|$|E
25|$|A 2015 review, {{examining}} whether CI implantation {{to treat}} people with bilateral hearing loss had any effect on <b>tinnitus,</b> found the quality of evidence to be poor, and the results variable: overall total <b>tinnitus</b> suppression rates varied from 8% to 45% of people who received CI; decrease of <b>tinnitus</b> was seen in 25% to 72%, of people; for 0% to 36% {{of the people there}} was no change; increase of <b>tinnitus</b> occurred in between 0% to 25% of patients; and in between 0 - 10% of cases, people who didn't have <b>tinnitus</b> before the procedure, got it.|$|E
25|$|Acoustic {{qualification}} of <b>tinnitus</b> {{will include}} measurement of several acoustic parameters like frequency {{in cases of}} monotone <b>tinnitus</b> or frequency range and bandwidth in cases of narrow band noise <b>tinnitus,</b> loudness in dB above hearing threshold at the indicated frequency, mixing-point, and minimum masking level. In most cases, <b>tinnitus</b> pitch or frequency range is between 5000Hz and 10.000Hz, and loudness between 5 and 15dB above the hearing threshold.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>tinnitus</b> is usually {{based on the}} person's description. A number of questionnaires exist that may help to assess how much <b>tinnitus</b> is interfering with a person's life. The diagnosis is commonly supported by an audiogram and a neurological examination. If certain problems are found, medical imaging, such as with MRI, may be performed. Other tests are suitable when <b>tinnitus</b> occurs with the same rhythm as the heartbeat. Rarely, the sound may be heard by someone else using a stethoscope, in which case it is known as objective <b>tinnitus.</b> Spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, which are sounds produced normally by the inner ear, may also occasionally result in <b>tinnitus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The use {{of sound}} therapy by either hearing aids or <b>tinnitus</b> maskers helps the brain ignore the {{specific}} <b>tinnitus</b> frequency. Although these methods are poorly supported by evidence, {{there are no}} negative effects. There is some tentative evidence supporting <b>tinnitus</b> retraining therapy. There is little evidence supporting the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation. It is thus not recommended.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinnitus</b> is {{commonly}} {{thought of as}} a symptom of adulthood, and is often overlooked in children. Children with hearing loss have a high incidence of <b>tinnitus,</b> even though they do not express the condition or its effect on their lives. Children do not generally report <b>tinnitus</b> spontaneously and their complaints may not be taken seriously. Among those children who do complain of <b>tinnitus,</b> there is an increased likelihood of associated otological or neurological pathology such as migraine, juvenile Meniere’s disease or chronic suppurative otitis media. Its reported prevalence varies from 12% to 36% in children with normal hearing thresholds and up to 66% in children with a hearing loss and approximately 310% of children have been reported to be troubled by <b>tinnitus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since most {{persons with}} <b>tinnitus</b> also have hearing loss, a pure tone hearing test {{resulting}} in an audiogram may help diagnose a cause, though some persons with <b>tinnitus</b> do not have hearing loss. An audiogram may also facilitate fitting of a hearing aid in those cases where hearing loss is significant. The pitch of <b>tinnitus</b> is often {{in the range of}} the hearing loss.|$|E
25|$|Other {{potential}} sources of the sounds normally associated with <b>tinnitus</b> should be ruled out. For instance, two recognized sources of high-pitched sounds might be electromagnetic fields common in modern wiring and various sound signal transmissions. A common and often misdiagnosed condition that mimics <b>tinnitus</b> is radio frequency (RF) hearing, in which subjects have been tested and found to hear high-pitched transmission frequencies that sound similar to <b>tinnitus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanisms}} of subjective <b>tinnitus</b> are often obscure. While {{it is not}} surprising that direct trauma to the inner ear can cause <b>tinnitus,</b> other apparent causes (e.g., temporomandibular joint dysfunction) are difficult to explain.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tinnitus</b> {{can also}} occur {{due to the}} {{discontinuation}} of therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines. It can sometimes be a protracted symptom of benzodiazepine withdrawal and may persist for many months. Medications such as bupropion may also result in <b>tinnitus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Objective <b>tinnitus</b> can be {{detected}} by other people and is sometimes caused by an involuntary twitching of a muscle {{or a group of}} muscles (myoclonus) or by a vascular condition. In some cases, <b>tinnitus</b> is generated by muscle spasms around the middle ear.|$|E
25|$|Straw has {{suffered}} from depression and <b>tinnitus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ginkgo biloba {{does not}} appear to be effective. The American Academy of Otolaryngology {{recommends}} against taking melatonin or zinc supplements to relieve symptoms of <b>tinnitus.</b> In addition, a 2016 Cochrane Review concluded that evidence is not sufficient to support taking zinc supplements to reduce symptoms associated with <b>tinnitus.</b>|$|E
25|$|There is {{a growing}} body of {{evidence}} suggesting that <b>tinnitus</b> is a consequence of neuroplastic alterations in the central auditory pathway. These alterations are assumed to result from a disturbed sensory input, caused by hearing loss. Hearing loss could indeed cause a homeostatic response of neurons in the central auditory system, and therefore cause <b>tinnitus.</b>|$|E
25|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} (also {{known as}} paracusia) are {{the perception of}} sound without outside stimulus. Auditory hallucinations {{are the most common}} type of hallucination. Auditory hallucinations can be divided into two categories: elementary and complex. Elementary hallucinations are the perception of sounds such as hissing, whistling, an extended tone, and more. In many cases, <b>tinnitus</b> is an elementary auditory hallucination. However, some people who experience certain types of <b>tinnitus,</b> especially pulsatile <b>tinnitus,</b> are actually hearing the blood rushing through vessels near the ear. Because the auditory stimulus is present in this situation, it does not qualify as a hallucination.|$|E
25|$|Ototoxic {{drugs can}} also cause {{subjective}} <b>tinnitus,</b> as they may cause hearing loss, or increase {{the damage done by}} exposure to loud noise. Those damages can occur even at doses that are not considered ototoxic. Over 260 medications have been reported to cause <b>tinnitus</b> as a side effect. In many cases, however, no underlying cause could be identified.|$|E
25|$|The {{accepted}} {{definition of}} chronic <b>tinnitus,</b> {{as compared to}} normal ear noise experience, is five minutes of ear noise occurring {{at least twice a}} week. However, people with chronic <b>tinnitus</b> often experience the noise more frequently than this and can experience it continuously or regularly, such as during the night when there is less environmental noise to mask the sound.|$|E
