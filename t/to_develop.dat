5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent severe complications. Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
