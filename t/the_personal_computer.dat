5|$|An {{enhanced}} remaster titled Wild Guns: Reloaded {{was released}} for the PlayStation 4 in December 2016. The game {{was developed by}} the original team and features classic characters and stages but also enhancements such as more playable characters, enemies, stages, and local 4-player support. The game was made available for download on the PlayStation Store, and physical copies were available from Amazon, Play-Asia, and Video Games Plus. Critics praised the game for being a quality remaster of an already classic game. Natsume released Reloaded on Microsoft Windows in July 2017, marking the company's first ever release on <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, {{in part due to}} frustration, and in part due to differing views of the future of computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer.</b> The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|The ARC {{became the}} driving force behind the design and {{development}} of the oN-Line System (NLS). He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E

5|$|Alien Rage {{was first}} {{announced}} in early April 2012, {{under the name}} Alien Fear. The game was to be developed using Unreal Engine 3 by City Interactive's Bydgoszcz Studio, and would have a cooperative gameplay (co-op) mode. The first screenshots from the game were released two months later, in June 2012. In May 2013 the game's name was changed to Alien Rage, and two months later {{it was announced that}} the game would be released on <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer,</b> Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 on 24 September 2013. The game was eventually released on 24 September 2013 for Windows, 18 October 2013 for the Xbox 360, and 21 October 2013 for the PlayStation 3, with and ESRB rating of Mature.|$|E
5|$|Sony {{launched}} a multimillion-dollar ad {{campaign to promote}} Final Fantasy XI along with the PlayStation 2 hard drive add-on which the game required. Having been released on the PlayStation 2 as well as <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer,</b> it became the first cross-platform MMORPG ever created. On June 14, 2002, the game server was down for four hours for maintenance to the database servers, bug fixes on the text interface, and a new patch for the game client. This {{is thought to be}} the first patch ever released for a console game. Other early issues included complaints by American players that experienced Japanese players had already completed all the quests. Square Enix responded by adding new servers in order to have game worlds with fewer expert players.|$|E

Dailly used the code from the Talisman demo, and wrote a new sprite system. He also re-worked the multi-directional scrolling, and wrote his own tape loading routines, wanting one that allowed players to play a simple game while Blood Money loaded. Smith designed the graphics for the port, and became confused by {{the limitations of the}} hardware: he had to draw double pixels in Deluxe Paint, and was limited to sixteen colours. Dailly finished developing the Commodore 64 version of Blood Money on 12 March 1990.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the transistor in the 1950s, a key active component in practically all modern electronics, led to many technological developments and a significant expansion of the U.S. technology industry. This in turn led {{to the establishment of}} many new technology companies and regions around the country such as Silicon Valley in California. Advancements by American microprocessor companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel along with both computer software and hardware companies that include Adobe Systems, Apple Inc., IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems created and popularized <b>the</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer.</b> The ARPANET was developed in the 1960s to meet Defense Department requirements, and became {{the first of a series}} of networks which evolved into the Internet.|$|E
