5|$|The odorless and {{tasteless}} thallium sulfate {{was once}} widely used as rat poison and ant killer. Since 1972 this use has been prohibited in the United States due to safety concerns. Many other countries followed this example in subsequent years. Thallium salts {{were used in}} the treatment of ringworm, other skin infections and to reduce the night sweating of tuberculosis patients. This use has been limited due to their narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>index,</b> and the development of improved medicines for these conditions.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at Farmitalia soon {{discovered}} that changes in biological activity could be made by minor changes {{in the structure of}} the compound. A strain of Streptomyces was mutated using N-nitroso-N-methyl urethane, and this new strain produced a different, red-colored antibiotic. They named this new compound Adriamycin, after the Adriatic Sea, and the name was later changed to doxorubicin to conform to the established naming convention. Doxorubicin showed better activity than daunorubicin against mouse tumors, and especially solid tumors. It also showed a higher <b>therapeutic</b> <b>index,</b> yet the cardiotoxicity remained.|$|E

40|$|A {{previously}} developed {{method for}} cyclic peptide synthesis was demonstrated {{to be able}} to provide convenient access to large combinatorial libraries of analogues, and this methodology was applied to the optimization of natural product cyclic decapeptides. Using this method, a 192 -member library was designed and successfully constructed {{on the basis of the}} natural products tyrocidines, streptocidins, and loloatins to increase the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> of these antibiotics. Library screening identified nine analogues whose <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> were increased by up to 90 -fold in comparison to the natural products. Three of these analogues showed significant increase in antibacterial potency and concurrent drastic decrease in hemolytic activity.

50|$|Ocfentanil (INN) (also called A-3217) is {{a potent}} {{synthetic}} opioid structurally related to fentanyl that {{was developed in the}} early 1990s as {{one of a series of}} potent naloxone-reversible opioids in an attempt to obtain an opioid that had better <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> in terms of cardiovascular effects and respiratory depression as compared to fentanyl.|$|R
40|$|The {{potency of}} {{antimalarial}} dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors, alone and in synergistic combination with dihydropteroate synthetase inhibitors, against the Kenyan K 39 strain of Plasmodium falciparum (pyrimethamine resistant) and against normal replicating human bone marrow cells in in vitro {{culture has been}} studied. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> and rank order of synergistic potency were derived. Trimethoprim, pyrimethamine, and the quinazolines WR 159412 and WR 158122 had the smallest <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> (1. 39, 4. 38, 2. 56, and 90. 0, respectively), while the three triazines clociguanil, WR 99210, and chlorcycloguanil had the largest (3, 562, 3, 000, and 2, 000, respectively). In rank order of decreasing activity against P. falciparum, the six most potent drug combinations were WR 99210 -dapsone, chlorcycloguanil-dapsone, WR 158122 -dapsone, WR 159412 -dapsone, WR 159412 -sulfamethoxazole, and chlorcycloguanil-sulfamethoxazole; pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine was the least potent combination.

40|$|This study {{compared}} {{the performances of}} randomized dose-controlled trials (DCTs) with those of concentration-controlled trials (CCTs) in dose finding for drugs with narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indexes.</b> A simulation-based study was performed for a hypothetical immunosuppressant agent with two clinical end points. Different scenarios were simulated and analyzed, and three designs were compared: one DCT and two CCTs (a target-equivalent CCT and a variability-equivalent CCT). The DCT was consistently superior to the CCTs in the following aspects: (i) precision and bias reduction in parameter estimates, (ii) precision and bias reduction in the estimate of optimal exposure, (iii) bias reduction in prediction of the estimated therapeutic benefit at estimated optimal exposure, and (iv) bias reduction in prediction of the estimated benefit of therapeutic drug monitoring as compared with fixed dosing. DCT designs are more informative when describing the exposure-response relationship for drugs with narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indexes</b> and provide a better basis for decision making with regard to dosing strategy...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY. -The rat Walker 256 tumour {{was grown}} in mice that had {{previously}} been thymectomized and treated with anti-lymphocyte serum. These rat tumour-bearing mice were used to determine the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> of 4 anti-tumour drugs. The agent with the highest index of the four examined was 5 -aziridino 2, 4 -dinitrobenzamide (CB 1954), followed by melphalan, aniline mustard and methotrexate,, in that order. This rank order is the same as that found when <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> are determined on the Walker tumour growing in the rat. In this system, therefore, drugs have been ranked correctly in effectiveness against a rat tumour by measuring their effects on the tumour. when growi'ng in an immunosuppressed xenogeneic species.

25|$|Meprobamate — {{marketed as}} Miltown by Wallace Laboratories and Equanil by Wyeth, among others — is a {{carbamate}} derivative {{used as an}} anxiolytic drug. It was the best-selling minor tranquilizer for a time, but has largely {{been replaced by the}} benzodiazepines due to their wider <b>therapeutic</b> <b>index</b> (lower risk of toxicity at therapeutically prescribed doses) and lower incidence of serious side effects.|$|E
25|$|The benzodiazepines gained {{popularity}} among medical professionals as {{an improvement over}} barbiturates, which have a comparatively narrow <b>therapeutic</b> <b>index,</b> and are far more sedative at therapeutic doses. The benzodiazepines are also far less dangerous; death rarely results from diazepam overdose, except in cases where it is consumed with large amounts of other depressants (such as alcohol or opioids). Benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam initially had widespread public support, but with time the view changed to one of growing criticism and calls for restrictions on their prescription.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, {{fentanyl}} {{was introduced}} for palliative {{use with the}} fentanyl patch, followed {{in the next decade}} by the introduction of the fentanyl lollipop, dissolving tablets, and sublingual spray which are absorbed through the tissues inside the mouth. , fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in medicine. In 2013, 1,700 kilograms (3,750 lbs) were used globally. Fentanyl has a relatively wide <b>therapeutic</b> <b>index</b> (270) which makes it a very safe surgical anaesthetic when monitored carefully; however, its potency requires careful measurements of highly diluted fentanyl in solution.|$|E
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{activity of}} arbidol was investigated against representatives of seven different virus families.

40|$|Large-scale {{in vitro}} {{screening}} {{of different types}} of ionophores previously pinpointed nine compounds that were very active and selective in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum; their in vitro and in vivo antimalarial effects were further studied. Addition of the ionophores to synchronized P. falciparum suspensions revealed that all P. falciparum stages were sensitive to the drugs. However, the schizont stages were three- to ninefold more sensitive, and 12 h was required for complete parasite clearance. Pretreatment of healthy erythrocytes with toxic doses of ionophores for 24 to 48 h showed that the activity was not due to an irreversible effect on the host erythrocyte. No preferential ionophore adsorption in infected or uninfected erythrocytes occurred. On the other hand, ionophore molecules strongly bound to serum proteins since increasing the serum concentration from 2 to 50 % led to almost a 25 -fold parallel increase in the ionophore 50 % inhibitory concentration. Mice infected with the malaria parasites Plasmodium vinckei petteri or Plasmodium chabaudi were successfully treated with eight ionophores in a 4 -day suppressive test. The 50 % effective dose after intraperitoneal administration ranged from 0. 4 to 4. 1 mg/kg of body weight, and the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> were about 5 for all ionophores except monensin A methyl ether, 5 -bromo lasalocid A, and gramicidin D, whose <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> were 12, 18, and 344, respectively. These three compounds were found to be curative, with no recrudescence. Gramicidin D, which presented impressive antimalarial activity, requires parenteral administration, while 5 -bromo lasalocid A has the major advantage of being active after oral administration. Overall, the acceptable levels of toxicity and the good in vivo <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> in the rodent model highlight the interesting potential of these ionophores for the treatment of malaria in higher animals...|$|R

25|$|For {{many years}} the TCAs {{were the first}} choice for {{pharmacological}} treatment of clinical depression. Although they are still considered to be highly effective, they have been increasingly replaced by antidepressants with an improved safety and side effect profile, such as the SSRIs and other newer antidepressants such as the novel reversible MAOI moclobemide. However, tricyclic antidepressants are possibly more effective in treating melancholic depression than other antidepressant drug classes. Newer antidepressants {{are thought to have}} fewer and less severe side effects and are also thought to be less likely to result in injury or death if used in a suicide attempt, as the doses required for clinical treatment and potentially lethal overdose (see <b>therapeutic</b> <b>index)</b> are far wider in comparison.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} led by Sidney Farber showed aminopterin, a chemical analogue of folic acid developed by Yellapragada Subbarao of Lederle, could induce remission in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The development of folic acid analogues had been prompted by the discovery that the administration of folic acid worsened leukemia, and that a diet deficient in folic acid could, conversely, produce improvement; the mechanism of action behind these effects was still unknown at the time. Other analogues of folic acid were in development, and by 1950, methotrexate (then known as amethopterin) was being proposed as a treatment for leukemia. Animal studies published in 1956 showed the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>index</b> of methotrexate was better than that of aminopterin, and clinical use of aminopterin was thus abandoned in favor of methotrexate.|$|E
500|$|Forensic {{toxicology}} is {{the study}} of the pharmacodynamics, or what a substance does to the body, and pharmacokinetics, or what the body does to the substance.

40|$|We {{describe}} computational {{approaches for}} identifying promising lead {{candidates for the}} development of peptide antibiotics, in the context of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) studies for this type of molecule. A first approach deals with predicting the selectivity properties of generated antimicrobial peptide sequences in terms of measured <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> (TI) for known antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Based on a training set of anuran AMPs, the concept of sequence moments was used to construct algorithms that could predict TIs for a second test set of natural AMPs and could also predict the effect of point mutations on TI values. This approach was then used to design peptide antibiotics (adepantins) not homologous to known natural or synthetic AMPs. In a second approach, many novel putative AMPs were identified from DNA sequences in EST databases, using the observation that, as a rule, specific subclasses of highly conserved signal peptides are associated exclusively with AMPs. Both anuran and teleost sequences were used to elucidate this observation and its implications. The predicted <b>therapeutic</b> <b>indices</b> of identified sequences could then be used to identify new types of selective putative AMPs for future experimental verification...|$|R
500|$|The {{toxicity}} of psilocybin is low. In rats, the {{median lethal dose}} (LD50) when administered orally is 280milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg), approximately {{one and a half}} times that of caffeine.

[...] Psilocybin comprises approximately 1% of the weight of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, and so nearly [...] of dried mushrooms, or [...] of fresh mushrooms, would be required for a [...] person to reach the 280mg/kg LD50 value of rats. Based on the results of animal studies, the lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6grams, 1000 times greater than the effective dose of 6milligrams. The Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances assigns psilocybin a relatively high <b>therapeutic</b> <b>index</b> of 641 (higher values correspond to a better safety profile); for comparison, the therapeutic indices of aspirin and nicotine are 199 and 21, respectively. The lethal dose from psilocybin toxicity alone is unknown at recreational or medicinal levels, and has rarely been documented—, only two cases attributed to overdosing on hallucinogenic mushrooms (without concurrent use of other drugs) {{have been reported in the}} scientific literature and may involve other factors aside from psilocybin.|$|E
