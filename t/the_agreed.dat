40|$|ABSTRACT: Clinical {{practice}} guidelines play {{an important}} role in practitioner and patient decisions regarding appropriate clinical health care and in health policy formation. In the guideline development process, inappropriate methodologies and development strategies significantly influence the quality of guidelines; therefore, research and evaluation of guidelines have great significance. The original Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument was published in 2003 by a group of international guideline developers and researchers. AGREE has important significance for the quality guarantee and successful implementation of guidelines, and has extensively achieved endorsement since 2003. In 2009, <b>The</b> <b>AGREE</b> Collaboration has developed <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> Ⅱ by refining <b>the</b> original <b>AGREE</b> instrument. At present, <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> Ⅱ has already replaced <b>the</b> original <b>AGREE</b> instrument; however, related introduction regarding AGREE Ⅱ has not been found in China. The authors of this article briefly introduce <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> Ⅱ, and believe that it will add value to research and evaluation of the guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Practice {{guidelines}} (PGs) are systematically developed statements {{intended to}} assist in patient, practitioner, and policy decisions. <b>The</b> <b>AGREE</b> II is <b>the</b> revised and updated standard tool for guideline development, reporting and evaluation. It is comprised of 23 items and a user's Manual. <b>The</b> <b>AGREE</b> II is ready for use. Objectives To develop, execute, and evaluate the impact of two internet-based educational interventions designed to accelerate the capacity of stakeholders to use <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> II: a multimedia didactic tutorial with a virtual coach, and a higher intensity training program including both the didactic tutorial and an interactive practice exercise component. Methods Participants (clinicians, developers, and policy makers) will be {{randomly assigned to one}} of three conditions. Condition one, didactic tutorial [...] participants will go through <b>the</b> on-line <b>AGREE</b> II tutorial supported by a virtual coach and review of <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> II prior to appraising the test PG. Condition two, tutorial + practice [...] following the multimedia didactic tutorial with a virtual coach, participants will review <b>the</b> on-line <b>AGREE</b> II independently and use it to appraise a practice PG. Upon entering their AGREE II score for the practice PG, participants will be given immediate feedback on how their score compares to expert norms. If their score falls outside a predefined range, the participant will receive a series of hints to guide the appraisal process. Participants will receive an overall summary of their performance appraising the PG compared to expert norms. Condition three, control arm [...] participants will receive a PDF copy of <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> II for review and to appraise the test PG on-line. All participants will then rate one of ten test PGs with <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> II. <b>The</b> outcomes of interest are learners' performance, satisfaction, self-efficacy, mental effort, and time-on-task; comparisons will be made across each of the test groups. Discussion Our research will test innovative educational interventions of various intensities and instructional design to promote <b>the</b> adoption of <b>AGREE</b> II and to identify those strategies that are most effective for training. The results will facilitate international capacity to apply <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> II accurately and with confidence and to enhance the overall guideline enterprise. </p...|$|R

5|$|As the {{economic}} situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of <b>the</b> <b>agreed</b> reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the (still) ruling party {{of some of its}} burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>The</b> <b>AGREE</b> {{instrument}} {{has been}} validated for evaluating Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) pertaining to medical care. This study evaluated {{the reliability and}} validity of physical therapists using <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> to assess quality of CPGs relevant to physical therapy practice. Methods A total of 69 physical therapists participated and were classified as generalists, specialist or researchers. Pairs of appraisers within each category evaluated independently, a set of 6 CPG selected at random from a pool of 55 CPGs. Results Reliability between pairs of appraisers indicated low to high reliability depending on the domain and number of appraisers (0. 17 – 0. 81 for single appraiser; 0. 30 – 0. 96 when score averaged across a pair of appraisers). The highest reliability was achieved for Rigour of Development, which exceeded ICC> 0. 79, if scores from pairs of appraisers were pooled. Adding more than 3 appraisers did not consistently improve reliability. Appraiser type did not determine reliability scores. End-users, including study participants and a separate sample of 102 physical therapy students, found <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> useful to guide critical appraisal. The construct validity of <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> was supported in that expected differences on Rigour of Development domains were observed between expert panels versus those with no/uncertain expertise (differences of 10 – 21 % p = 0. 09 – 0. 001). Factor analysis with varimax rotation, produced a 4 -factor solution that was similar, although not in exact agreement with <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> Domains. Validity was also supported by the correlation observed (Kendall-tao = 0. 69) between Overall Assessment and the Rigour of Development domain. Conclusion These findings suggest that <b>the</b> <b>AGREE</b> instrument is reliable and valid when used by physiotherapists to assess the quality of CPG pertaining to physical therapy health services. </p...|$|R

5|$|After {{his army}} crossed the Euphrates, {{following}} a route opened up by Lucullus {{over a hundred}} years before, he received envoys from Tiridates and Vologases. At the approach of such a large force, and aware of Corbulo's ability as a general, the two Arsacids were anxious to negotiate. Indeed, Corbulo, no doubt on instructions from Nero, reiterated the old Roman position: if Tiridates would accept his crown from Rome, then renewed war could be averted. Tiridates readily agreed to negotiations, and Rhandeia, the scene of last year's Roman defeat, was agreed upon as a meeting place. To the Armenians, this place was intended as a reminder of their strength, while Corbulo agreed to it because there he hoped to expunge the earlier disgrace, by peace or war. Once there, Corbulo put Paetus' son, who served under him as a legate, in charge of a party that was to gather the remains of the Roman soldiers and ensure them a proper burial. On <b>the</b> <b>agreed</b> day, both Tiridates and Corbulo, each accompanied by 20 horsemen, met between the two camps. Tiridates agreed to travel to Rome and seek confirmation of his crown from Nero. In sign of this agreement, a few days later, both armies put on a display, arrayed in full parade gear. Tiridates approached the Roman camp, where a statue of the Emperor Nero had been erected upon a raised platform, and placed his royal diadem at its feet in submission.|$|E
5|$|Al-Muktafi {{also kept}} up the {{perennial}} conflict with the Byzantine Empire, with varying success. In May 902, al-Qasim ibn Sima al-Farghani was appointed {{in command of the}} frontier districts of the Jazira. In 902 or 903, a naval raid reached the island of Lemnos, dangerously close to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople; the island was plundered and its inhabitants carried off into slavery. Nevertheless, in May 903, the newly appointed governor of Tarsus, Abu'l-Asha'ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, was dispatched to the frontier districts with gifts for the Byzantine ruler, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), and in return, Byzantine envoys arrived in Baghdad for negotiations on a prisoner exchange. The exchange eventually took place in September–October 905, at the river Lamus in Cilicia, but was interrupted because the Byzantines reneged on <b>the</b> <b>agreed</b> terms. After further negotiations, the exchange was completed in August 908.|$|E

Alice's sister, Philippa, married Erard of Ramerupt, who laid claim to Champagne and Brie on Philippa's behalf in 1213. Blanche of Navarre soon approached the Holy See to demand an investigation into the validity of the second and third marriage of Alice's and Philippa's mother, stating that her first marriage to Humphrey IV of Toron had not been canonically annulled. The inquiry conducted by Cardinal Robert of Courçon at the pope's order concluded that both Humphrey IV and Isabella I had protested against the annulment of their marriage, which suggested that Isabella I's two subsequent marriages were unlawful. However, the Holy See did not complete the investigation and thus the legitimacy of Alice (and her sister) was not questioned.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{motorway}} was constructed, the A6 {{road through}} Preston handled north-south traffic with tailbacks and congestion a common occurrence, more so during special occasions {{such as the}} Blackpool Illuminations. The route had been planned {{as far back as}} 1937–1938, with the basic alignment still deemed feasible by the time Lancashire County Council gave approval in the mid 1940s. Chief engineer Drake was part of a delegation from Lancashire that travelled to Germany in 1938 in order that a plan could be drawn up by the council. <b>The</b> <b>agreed</b> route formed part of the County Surveyors' Society's national proposals and was protected by Lancashire County Council from any future developments. During planning, the legal powers necessary for motorway construction did not exist, until the introduction of the Special Roads Act in 1949 that made it lawful to construct roads that were to be used only by certain classes of vehicle. The by-pass was seen as an experiment for the future motorway construction, with many lessons and techniques were learned that would help towards successful future projects. When the proposals were made public, including a large-scale model to ease the explaining of the scheme, only a handful of formal objections were raised and were resolved by agreement without the need to initiate a public inquiry, cited in part because of close personal involvement of Lancashire County Council and the surveyor during consultation.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the latest}} bailout {{programme}} audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed that even after transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of <b>the</b> <b>agreed</b> adjustment package in 2012, {{there was a new}} forecast financing gap of: €5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016. The new forecast financing gaps will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to the bond market during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra financing gaps with additional private capital. A total of €6.1bn was received from the sale of three-year and five-year bonds in 2014, and the Greek government now plans to cover its forecast financing gap for 2015 with additional sales of seven-year and ten-year bonds in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Following lengthy {{discussions between}} Royal Mail {{managers}} and union representatives {{a deal to}} settle the dispute was finally agreed to on 8 March 2010.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Toulouse episode, Louis made an attempt to repair relations with Henry through an 1160 peace treaty: this promised Henry the lands and the rights of his grandfather, Henry I; it reaffirmed the betrothal of Young Henry and Margaret and the Vexin deal; and it involved Young Henry giving homage to Louis, a way of reinforcing the young boy's position as heir and Louis's position as king. Almost immediately after the peace conference, however, Louis shifted his position considerably. Louis's wife Constance died and Louis married Adèle, the sister of the Counts of Blois and Champagne. Louis also betrothed daughters by Eleanor to Theobald of Blois's sons, Theobald and Henry. This represented an aggressive containment strategy towards Henry rather than <b>the</b> <b>agreed</b> rapprochement, and caused Theobald to abandon his alliance with Henry. Henry reacted angrily; the King had custody of both Young Henry and Margaret, and in November he bullied several papal legates into marrying them—despite the children being only five and three years old respectively—and promptly seized the Vexin. Now it was Louis's turn to be furious, as the move clearly broke the spirit of the 1160 treaty.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period of turmoil, in February 865, that Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862–866) and two of the senior Turkish officers, Wasif and Bugha the Younger, fled Samarra to Baghdad, where they could count on the support of the Tahirids. The Turkish army in Samarra then {{selected}} al-Musta'in's brother al-Mu'tazz (r. 866–869) as Caliph, and Abu Ahmad was entrusted with the conduct of operations against al-Musta'in and his supporters. The ensuing siege of Baghdad lasted from February to December 865, after which a negotiated settlement was reached. Contrary to <b>the</b> <b>agreed</b> terms, however, al-Musta'in was murdered. It was most likely during this time that Abu Ahmad consolidated his relationship with the Turkish military, especially with Musa ibn Bugha, who played a crucial role during the siege. Abu Ahmad further solidified these ties when he secured a pardon for Bugha the Younger.|$|E

The terms of the surrender were absolute: the island, its dependencies, fortifications and military supplies were all turned over to British control. This included the ships of the line Athenien and Dégo and the frigate Carthagénaise (these were all French ships previously captured from the Order), although only Athenien was of sufficient standard to be incorporated into the Royal Navy, becoming HMS Athenienne.
