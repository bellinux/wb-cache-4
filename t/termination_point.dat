5000|$|Tines and reeds {{differ from}} strings {{in that they}} are held at one end and free to vibrate at the other. The {{frequencies}} of their fundamental and harmonic vibrations are subject to the same inharmonicity as strings. However, because of the comparative thickness of the bars that terminate the tines in an electric piano, the larger (and stronger) vibrations tend to [...] "see" [...] <b>termination</b> <b>points</b> slightly deeper in the bar than do smaller, weaker vibrations. This enhances inharmonicity in tines.|$|R
