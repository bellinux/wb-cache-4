5|$|Colorado held several {{meetings}} to convince reluctant Utah officials they {{would benefit from}} a freeway link between Denver and Salt Lake City. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link {{would be difficult to}} build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> <b>of</b> US40, US6 and a route starting at Pueblo, proceeding west along US50/US285/US24. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the U.S. Congress that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at I-15 near Spanish Fork, Utah, linking the Front Range and Wasatch Front metropolitan areas.|$|E
5|$|Labor's convincing win was not unexpected, {{particularly}} as infighting in the LCL had been ongoing {{for over a}} year. Friction was present throughout the campaign as well as before it, {{particularly as}} much of the donations were given directly to the LM. In the months before the election LCL members had thrown punches in <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> <b>of</b> Parliament House. Internal battles between conservatives and LM members for party pre-selection were keenly contested. Around half of the LCL candidates were LM supporters and avoided mention of the LCL and its conservative leader Bruce Eastick in their pamphlets. Some of the LM faction candidates instead trumpeted Hall as their leader and printed books detailing their policies. There was also an incident where a LM function celebrating Wilson's win in the 1972 federal election clashed with Eastick's main policy speech. Eastick and his conservatives arrived at Wilson's dinner after they finished campaigning for the night, but then walked out when Wilson was delivering a speech calling for the LCL to be more tolerant of the diverse opinions within the party. Labor ran a sedate campaign, but made much of the internal LCL divisions.|$|E

Logopolis soon falls under the Master's control, but the stasis field he is generating ends up releasing Entropy and eroding matter throughout the universe, threatening to destroy the entire universe.|$|E
25|$|Allusions to myth {{were very}} {{widespread}} in Egyptian art and architecture. In temple design, the central {{path of the}} temple axis was likened to the sun god's path across the sky, and the sanctuary {{at the end of}} the path represented the place of creation from which he rose. Temple decoration was filled with solar emblems that underscored this relationship. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> <b>of</b> tombs were linked with the god's journey through the Duat, and the burial chamber with the tomb of Osiris. The pyramid, the best-known of all Egyptian architectural forms, may have been inspired by mythic symbolism, for it represented the mound of creation and the original sunrise, appropriate for a monument intended to assure the owner's rebirth after death. Symbols in Egyptian tradition were frequently reinterpreted, so that the meanings of mythical symbols could change and multiply over time like the myths themselves.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the first}} game in the series, the six former disciples of Ansem the Wise became Heartless and their Nobodies created the Organization. Members are {{numbered}} in {{the order in which}} they joined, with Xemnas, the Nobody of Xehanort, numbered one as their leader. Each member is given a cloak made of a special material that allows them to pass through <b>the</b> <b>Corridors</b> <b>of</b> Darkness into other worlds safely without being attacked by the Heartless there. Members are given titles indicating both their role in Organization XIII and their personality, as well as their own breed of lesser Nobodies to control, usually suited to their fighting style and unique themed powers. As Nobodies, they lack emotion and morality, and are unable to feel guilt and remorse for their actions. However, most of the members' personalities are based from what memories they have of their original selves. About half of the members were introduced in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, with the remaining members introduced in Kingdom Hearts II. In Chain of Memories, the series' protagonist Sora and his friends Donald Duck and Goofy are led to a mysterious fortress called Castle Oblivion by members of the Organization, who intend to turn Sora into their pawn by manipulating his memories. Sora's friend Riku also arrives at Castle Oblivion, but in the basement where he encounters other Organization members. Sora and Riku traverse the levels of the castle to reach the top, fighting and defeating several members along the way. By Kingdom Hearts II, the actions of Sora and Riku, along with Roxas' resignation, reduce the Organization to seven members, who seek to use the power of Kingdom Hearts to become complete beings.|$|E

Marcas, a prime example of such a man, is doomed to fail in the government of Louis-Philippe. Those in power were blind to the valuable minds being lost in their midst, as the students discover early in the story: [...] ("we were amazed at the brutal indifference of the authorities to everything connected with intellect, thought, and poetry"). Marcas' personal woes– and his tales of life within <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> <b>of</b> power– strongly reinforce this view.|$|E

The idea of Andy injuring himself in a motorcycle accident was conceived early in the filming of the second season by Chris Pratt. Pratt's stunt double, Joe Bucaro III, {{is considered one of}} the leading motorcycle stuntmen in the United States, and Pratt suggested that a stunt involving Andy crashing a motorcycle would be very funny. Bucaro filmed two takes of the crash in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", and the first take was used in the final episode. At the beginning of the episode, while roller-skating through <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> <b>of</b> city hall, Andy unsuccessfully tries to jump over a desk and falls violently to the ground. Unlike the motorcycle crash, Pratt performed that stunt himself, and had to film about six takes of it.|$|E
500|$|North Arlington was {{incorporated}} as a borough by a referendum held on March 26, 1896, {{the day the}} state legislature passed a bill providing that, [...] "no borough or village shall hereafter be incorporated in this state except by special act of the legislature." [...] The following year, the legislature undertook a thorough revision of the laws relating to boroughs, and forbade incorporations, dissolutions, or boundary changes without its leave. This simply moved the venue for conflicts over schools from local referenda to <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> <b>of</b> the State House in Trenton. Boroughs continued to be incorporated by legislative act, with a major burst in the 1920s. [...] These 20th century increases {{in the number of}} boroughs were sometimes caused by conflicts over road funds, causing Caldwell Township, Essex County, to divide into six municipalities by 1908, and with Clementon Township, Camden County fracturing into nine between 1915 and 1929.|$|E
500|$|Sections of {{the media}} have often campaigned for a {{particular}} person to be appointed England manager.

If he fails, that's {{the end of the}} clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." [...] Robson added, [...] "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> <b>of</b> power but I think {{he would have been a}} good England manager. He had good judgement, knew how to design a team and was a great motivator." [...] Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000.|$|E
