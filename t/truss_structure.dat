5|$|The {{design that}} Pei {{developed}} for the Bank of China Tower was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The tower was planned around a visible <b>truss</b> <b>structure,</b> which distributed stress to {{the four corners of}} the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.|$|E

40|$|Reconstruction, {{according}} to physical shape, {{is a novel}} way to generate free-form grid <b>truss</b> <b>structures.</b> 3 D scanning is {{an effective means of}} acquiring physical form information and it generates dense point clouds on surfaces of objects. However, generating grid <b>truss</b> <b>structures</b> from point clouds is still a challenge.

Several examples of generating grid <b>truss</b> <b>structures</b> from 3 D scanned point clouds of seashells are carried out to verify the proposed scheme.

25|$|The rack section, {{which begins}} at Ackersand, extends {{for a few}} hundred metres past Stalden. The line {{continues}} from there over a relatively flat section, along {{the right side of}} the increasingly narrowing valley, while the Vispa flows about 150 metres lower down, through a narrow gorge. The following section displays the first still relatively short tunnels, as well as the largest bridge on the line. The 67 metre long Mühlebachviadukt spans its eponymous waters at a height of 43 metres. Its original steel <b>truss</b> <b>structure</b> was replaced in 1959 by a reinforced concrete arch bridge.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of three arch bridges all steel bridges consisted of very simple, straight, single beam truss constructions. These had to be reinforced already before 1914 still during steam operation of the Gotthardbahn due to quickly increasing traffic and load. Fish-belly truss structures were attached to the bridges from below where possible and an arch <b>truss</b> <b>structure</b> was added from the top, where a short clear height made this necessary, besides other measures. Eventually all original iron bridges had to be replaced with modern bridges {{because they had been}} built and were repeatedly reinforced to specifications that again and again were surpassed by increasing traffic, velocity and load.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{topology}} optimization algorithm which uses the adaptive design principles to enable the creation of an integral adaptive system.

25|$|The {{upper level}} of the bridge has four lanes of {{automobile}} traffic and provides {{a view of the}} bridge's cantilever <b>truss</b> <b>structure</b> and the New York skyline. The lower level has five vehicular lanes, the inner four for automobile traffic and the southern outer lane for automobile traffic as well, used exclusively for Queens-bound traffic. The North Outer Roadway was converted into a permanent pedestrian walk and bicycle path in September 2000. The Manhattan approach to the bridge is supported on a series of Guastavino tile vaults which formed the elegant ceiling of the former Food Emporium Bridge Market and the restaurant Guastavino's, located under the bridge. Originally, this open air promenade was known as Bridgemarket and was part of Hornbostel's attempt to make the bridge more hospitable in the city.|$|E
25|$|On flight day 7 astronauts Clay Anderson and Rick Mastracchio {{performed}} {{their second}} spacewalk of the STS-131 mission. Mastracchio and Anderson exited the airlock at 05:30 UTC, a full 45 minutes {{ahead of the}} planned time, and spent 7 hours and 26 minutes outside the ISS. The pair removed the old Ammonia Tank Assembly (ATA) from the S1 truss and installed the new ATA. Anderson and Mastracchio ran into a small problem {{when one of the}} four bolts that holds the tank in place wouldn't turn. They loosened the other three and tried them all again and the fourth bolt was successfully tightened. The two spacewalkers helped guide the SSRMS to temporarily stow the old ATA on the <b>truss</b> <b>structure.</b> The new ATA had its electrical connections made, but the fluid connections were deferred until the third spacewalk since the EVA was behind the time-line. Mastracchio and Anderson also installed two radiator grapple fixture stowage beams on the P1 truss. While Anderson and Mastracchio were outside, members of the STS-131 crew continued transferring items from space shuttle Discoverys mid-deck and the MPLM Leonardo. Overall, the crew had completed about half of the transfer work.|$|E
25|$|Assembly resumed in 2006 {{with the}} arrival of STS-115 with Atlantis, which {{delivered}} the station's second set of solar arrays. Several more truss segments and a third set of arrays were delivered on STS-116, STS-117, and STS-118. As a result of the major expansion of the station's power-generating capabilities, more pressurised modules could be accommodated, and the Harmony node and Columbus European laboratory were added. These were soon followed by the first two components of Kibō. In March 2009, STS-119 completed the Integrated <b>Truss</b> <b>Structure</b> with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays. The final section of Kibō was delivered in July 2009 on STS-127, followed by the Russian Poisk module. The third node, Tranquility, was delivered in February 2010 during STS-130 by the Space Shuttle Endeavour, alongside the Cupola, followed in May 2010 by the penultimate Russian module, Rassvet. Rassvet was delivered by Space Shuttle Atlantis on STS-132 in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the Zarya module in 1998 which had been funded by the United States. The last pressurised module of the USOS, Leonardo, was brought to the station by Discovery on her final flight, STS-133, followed by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on STS-134, delivered by Endeavour.|$|E
40|$|The Integrated Structural Optimization System (ISOS) is a {{computing}} {{environment for the}} overall design of planar structures and is described in (Papalambros and Chirehdast 1990, Bremicker et al. 1991). The design process implemented by ISOS is carried out in four phases. For <b>truss</b> <b>structures,</b> phases I-III automatically generate a size-optimized topology with little aid from the designer. At this point however, the truss design still needs considerable refinement {{before it can be}} fabricated. The designer must determine the member cross-sections, the member layout, and the individual joint geometries. Phase IV embodies this refinement stage of a <b>truss</b> <b>structure's</b> design. Automatic generation of truss connections using gusset-plates and weldments is outlined in (Chirehdast et al. 1991) as one example of a phase IV activity. A computer program was written to automate a portion of this process. This paper establishes the progress made in phase IV for truss refinement and serves as a reference for further work.

25|$|At {{the time}} the bridge was built, {{engineers}} had not discovered the aerodynamics of bridge construction. Bridges were not tested in wind tunnels until the 1950s, well {{after the collapse of}} the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, known as Galloping Gertie, in 1940. It is therefore fortunate that the open <b>truss</b> <b>structure</b> supporting the deck is by its nature less subject to aerodynamic problems. Roebling designed a bridge and truss system that was six times as strong as he thought it needed to be. Because of this, the Brooklyn Bridge is still standing when many of the bridges built around the same time have vanished or been replaced. This is also in spite of the substitution of inferior quality wire in the cabling supplied by the contractor J. Lloyd Haigh—by the time it was discovered, it was too late to replace the cabling that had already been constructed. Roebling determined that the poorer wire would leave the bridge four rather than six times as strong as necessary, so it was eventually allowed to stand, with the addition of 250 cables. Diagonal cables were installed from the towers to the deck, intended to stiffen the bridge. They turned out to be unnecessary, but were kept for their distinctive beauty.|$|E
