500|$|Following its release, Mississippi Burning became {{embroiled in}} {{controversy}} over its fictionalization of events; it was heavily criticized by African-American activists {{who were involved}} in the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the families of Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner. Coretta Scott King, widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., boycotted the film, stating, [...] "How long will we have to wait before Hollywood finds the courage and the integrity to tell the stories of some of the many thousands of black men, women and children who put <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for equality?" [...] Myrlie Evers-Williams, the wife of slain civil rights activist Medgar Evers, said of the film, [...] "It was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did not show one black role model that today's youth who look at the movie could remember." [...] Benjamin Hooks, the executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), stated that the film, in its fictionalization of historical events, [...] "reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud" [...] and portrays African Americans as [...] "cowed, submissive and blank-faced".|$|E

It’s that spotlight on the humanity of the contractors that makes this an engaging read, and artist Tucci (Sgt.

2500|$|In {{a lengthy}} {{interview}} with Paddick published in The Daily Telegraph on 17 November 2007 detailing his thinking on becoming London Mayor, {{he made a}} revealing comment possibly connected with difficulties that have arisen because of the de Menezes killing: [...] "Policing is a dangerous job, we should trust the professional judgement of officers on the front line. We shouldn't prosecute them or their bosses if they decide to put <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for the public." [...] In addition, on 26 November 2007 in The Independent Paddick was asked if Commissioner Ian Blair should have resigned over the de Menezes case. His response was: [...] "Yes. The public allows the police to use force on the understanding that someone will be held to account if something goes wrong. An innocent man was killed {{by the police and}} in the absence of any individual officer being held to account, the person at the top should take responsibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... My {{late father}} was a seaman with the Wexford Steamship Company. He served the nation, like so many young men, through {{dangerous}} times in the war years. In every sense {{he and his colleagues}} put <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> day after day, in ships which today would not be licensed to go on the high seas, to bring supplies to this nation. Many of his colleagues and friends and many people from Wexford and around the coast paid the ultimate price in serving this nation by losing their lives. The ships were so rickety, old and derelict that we would not go to sea in them today. Yet, these brave, perhaps foolhardy, men crossed the Atlantic, went to the Mediterranean and North African coast and kept Ireland supplied with vital provisions. My father's ship, the Kerlogue, was involved in one of the great rescues of the war. One of the proudest possessions I have is a decoration awarded to him {{and other members of the}} crew for rescuing German sailors in the Bay of Biscay in December 1943, when they hauled hundreds of young men from the water .....
