5|$|The Panhandles' opening {{game against}} the Dayton Triangles is {{considered}} to be the first football game between two APFA teams. The Panhandles lost 14–0 to the Triangles. Despite the first two quarters resulting in ties, the crowd was excited. In the second quarter, the Triangles made a goal line stand while the Panhandles had <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the 3-yard line. Before halftime, the Triangles' Al Mahrt completed a 30-yard pass to Dutch Thiele, which resulted in the Triangles to having <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the 5-yard line. The Triangles' did not score on that possession due to the clock running out.|$|E
5|$|Brazilian striker Fred, who was {{replaced}} by Willian in the 70th minute, received a particularly hostile reaction from the home fans. According to Opta Sports, Fred failed to make a single tackle, cross, run or interception during the match, and actually spent {{the majority of his}} time in possession of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the centre spot due to six restarts.|$|E
5|$|East Carolina {{took the}} kickoff on the 39–yard line, after a Boise player {{illegally}} touched <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the 39. Pinkney threw an incomplete pass {{to start the}} drive, and after two more plays failed to convert the first down, ECU was forced to punt the ball away. After a touchback, Boise State began at its 20–yard line. The Broncos completed three plays for 11yards before the third quarter ended.|$|E

5|$|On 4 January 2014, Rosický scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} season in a 2–0 win in the FA Cup against Tottenham Hotspur, winning <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the halfway line from Danny Rose before running to the goal and beating {{opposition}} goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated. At that time, {{the object of the}} game was to touch <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the opponent's end of the pool. The goalkeeper would wait {{at the end of the}} pool until an opposing player approached the goal, when the goalkeeper would try to stop that player, for example, by dunking their head.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of the halfback, {{also known as the}} tailback, is to carry <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and {{function}} primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage situations and are seldom used in passing situations.|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} Molecular Dynamics simulations, we {{investigate}} the elementary process of avalanches and size segregation by surface flow in 2 dimensions: a single ball confined to moving along an inclined line consisting of <b>balls.</b> <b>The</b> global {{characteristics of the}} motion depend strongly {{on the size of}} <b>the</b> moving <b>ball</b> relative to <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line, as well as the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line. We find that in the steady state the friction force acting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is independent of material properties like the Coulomb friction coefficient and the coefficient of restitution. Contrary to previous notions about the details of the motion, we find that it is very regular and consists of many small bounces <b>on</b> each <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line. As a result of this regularity, introducing a random spacing between <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line has mainly the same influence as a regular spacing of adequate length. The insensitivity of the steady state velocity to material properties and to the detailed arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line allows for an analytical estimation of the mean velocity which fits the simulation results very well. We find that results from the 2 D case can probably not be transferred to the 3 D case of a <b>ball</b> moving <b>on</b> a rough inclined plane as easily as has been suggested previously.

5|$|With 4:50 {{remaining}} on the clock, and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> their own eight-yard line, Maryland drove 89yards to the Wolfpack three-yard line, which included a pass to Davin Meggett for 31yards. This set up a 20-yard field goal attempt by Obi Egekeze with eightseconds on the clock. The kick was good and put Maryland ahead for good, 27–24.|$|E
5|$|A minute later, West Ham {{went ahead}} again; defender Paul Konchesky {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the left flank, {{and played a}} ball into the Liverpool penalty area, only to see it sail over goalkeeper Reina and into the goal. Three minutes later, Liverpool made another substitution, as Alonso went off with an injury {{to be replaced by}} defender Jan Kromkamp. Minutes later, West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker had an attempt to score, but his shot went over the Liverpool goal. West Ham subsequently made their first substitution of the match, as Ashton was replaced by fellow striker Bobby Zamora. Liverpool also replaced Crouch with midfielder Dietmar Hamann.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} Louisville's kickoff, Virginia Tech {{elected to}} run out the clock and bring the first half to an end. During the process, Marcus Vick ran <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> a designed play and was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil after Vick gained nine yards. Following the play, Vick paused, then stomped on Dumervil's leg. Though referees failed to observe the stomp, television commentators replayed the action, and Tech coaches considered pulling Vick from the game as punishment. At {{the end of the}} first half of play, Louisville held a 17–10 lead.|$|E
50|$|Because players receive {{points for}} fouls by their {{opponent}}s, snookering one's opponent {{a number of}} times in a row is a possible way of winning a frame when potting all <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> table would be insufficient to ensure a win.|$|R

5|$|Alabama stormed 80 {{yards and}} T. J. Yeldon {{extended}} the Alabama lead to 21–0 with his one-yard {{run on the}} first play of the second quarter. Notre Dame then responded with their longest play from scrimmage of the game on a 31-yard Everett Golson pass to DaVaris Daniels. However, the Irish then surrendered <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> downs when they failed to convert on fourth-and-five four plays later. Each team then traded punts {{over the next four}} possessions before the Crimson Tide scored their final points of the first half. With just 0:31 left in the quarter, McCarron threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Lacy that made the halftime score 28–0.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the equaliser United won another corner, again taken by Beckham. He landed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the head of Sheringham who nodded it to Solskjær who in turn toe-poked it into {{the roof of the}} net. Oliver Kahn, the Bayern goalkeeper, was motionless on the line. United had completed the come-back. Bayern barely had time to restart the game, which referee Collina brought to a close just a few seconds later.|$|E
5|$|As had Virginia Tech, Air Force {{began moving}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the ground. The Falcons were aided by two offsides {{penalties}} against the Hokies and drove into Tech territory. Once there, Weiss completed a 16-yard pass to Tom Coleman {{for a first}} down. Weiss picked up another first down by running the ball, pushing the Falcons inside the Tech red zone with 10:10 remaining. The Tech defense stiffened, forcing a fourth down at the two-yard line. Rather than kick a field goal, Fisher DeBerry elected to attempt the touchdown, and Mike Brown ran the needed twoyards. The score and following extra point gave Air Force a 177 lead with 6:00 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did not keep the Sooners from running <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the ground. Allen Patrick returned from missing {{the last two games}} with a sore ankle and put up 163yards on 23carries, including a 65-yard touchdown scamper to start the second half. Chris Brown had an additional 19carries for 74yards and two touchdowns as Patrick's backup. At the end of the day, Paul Thompson only threw 11passes, 7completions for 77yards with one touchdown and no interceptions, and Oklahoma had 238yards of rushing.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{struggled}} {{to put a}} flowing move together in the opening exchanges, but it was United who had the better chances, both falling to Ronaldo. The first came in the seventhminute: having been played the ball by Michael Carrick, Ronaldo turned away from Piqué {{on the edge of}} the centre circle, before hitting a shot just wide from almost 40yards; the second saw the ball break to Ronaldo after Anderson and Patrice Evra had linked up well down the left flank. The Portuguese winger controlled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the chest before hitting the ball just past the far post.|$|E
5|$|In South Carolina's {{first trip}} to Bryant–Denny since 2004, the Tide {{defeated}} the South Carolina Gamecocks 20–6 on homecoming in Tuscaloosa. On the second play {{from the start of}} the game, Mark Barron intercepted a Stephen Garcia pass and returned it 77 yards for a touchdown and a 7–0 Alabama lead. Greg McElroy struggled; he threw a pair of first-quarter interceptions on Bama's first two offensive possessions. South Carolina's C.C. Whitlock fumbled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the return of the second interception and possession was recovered by Darius Hanks. The Tide continued its drive to the Gamecock 8, and Leigh Tiffin kicked a field goal to put Alabama ahead 10–0.|$|E

5|$|In {{the sixth}} week of play, Vanderbilt beat the Alabama Crimson Tide 14–0 in Birmingham. The score {{reflected}} predictions, since the Commodores were favored by two touchdowns. Jess Neely {{played a role}} in each scoring drive. Early in the first quarter, Vanderbilt had the ball {{in the middle of the}} field after an Alabama punt. Two line bucks preceded Neely, who connected with Tot McCullough for a 30-yard pass play. Neely ran for an additional 17 yards, putting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the nine-yard line. After a run by Godchaux, Lynn Bomar bucked over the line for the touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{fashioned}} {{the first}} chance {{of the second half}} after just three minutes, when Rooney cut inside from the right along the face of the penalty area, but his left-footed shot was blocked away for a corner kick. Soon after, Van Nistelrooy received <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> the edge of the penalty area and held it up before playing a through-ball to Keane, but the Irishman's low cross was diverted behind by Kolo Touré before it reached Rooney. United then had their third chance in the space of five minutes when Ronaldo shot just wide from 25 yards, from the left corner of the penalty area.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{returned}} the post-touchdown kickoff to its 34-yard line, where the Hokies began their first offensive drive {{of the fourth}} quarter. Randall ran for nine yards, Suggs for three, then Randall completed two passes for 16 yards to push the Hokies into Air Force territory. Once there, Tech continued to grind forward as Suggs ran <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>on</b> five consecutive plays for 15 yards and a first down. After Randall was sacked for a loss of eight yards, however, Tech sent in Warley, who kicked a 37-yard line to restore Tech's seven-point lead, 20–13, with 4:03 {{to go in the}} game.|$|E
