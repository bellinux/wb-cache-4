With both teams going for the Premier League title in May 2011, Arsenal won their first game against Manchester United since November 2008, to leave United just three points ahead of Chelsea and six ahead of Arsenal going into the final three games of the season. Nevertheless, United won the league, nine points ahead of Chelsea and 12 points ahead of Arsenal.|$|E

500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] {{is based}} on Peter Buck's mandolin-playing. Buck said, [...] "The verses {{are the kinds of}} things R.E.M. uses a lot, going from one minor to another, kind [...] like those 'Driver 8' chords. You can't really say {{anything}} bad about E minor, A minor, D, and G– I mean, they're just good chords." [...] Buck noted that [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] was [...] "probably the most typical R.E.M.-sounding song on the record. We are trying to get away from <b>those</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> songs, but like I said before, those are some good chords." [...] Orchestral strings play through parts of the song. The song is in natural minor.|$|E

[...] Eno also {{considers the}} album [...] "something that combines something very human and fallible and personal, with something very electronic and mathematical sometimes." [...] The music combines electronic and gospel influences to [...] "make that picture of the human still trying to survive in an increasingly complicated digital world... It's quite easy to make just digitalmusic and it's quite easy to make just humanmusic, but to try and make a combination is sort of, exciting, I think." [...] Tracks such as [...] "MyBigNurse" [...] combine apocalypticism and comfort, blending hopefulness and despair.|$|E

Futatsugi attributed the deaths to the stressful working conditions of the video game industry. In 2013, he said: [...] "All we could do was carry on and finish the game - {{it was out of}} my hands. Part of me did want to stop though. That was definitely the toughest project I've ever worked on. Personal relationships became strained. The stress was overwhelming." [...] Despite the difficulty of the project, he felt it had benefited from having [...] "someone who plays the bad guy role, someone who acts a little selfish, acts a little forceful to the team to achieve specific goals ...

500|$|On {{the early}} experience, Richards said, [...] "The amazing {{thing is that}} {{although}} Mick and I thought these songs were really puerile and kindergarten-time, every one that got put out made a decent showing in the charts. That gave us extraordinary confidence to carry on, because at the beginning songwriting was something {{we were going to}} do in order to say to Andrew , 'Well, at least we gave it a try...'" [...] Jagger said, [...] "We were very pop-orientated. We didn't sit around listening to Muddy Waters; we listened to everything. In some ways it's easy to write to order... Keith and I got into the groove of writing <b>those</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> tunes; they were done in ten minutes. I think we thought it was a bit of a laugh, and it turned out to be something of an apprenticeship for us." ...|$|E
500|$|When he was twenty, the National Post {{described}} Raonic as a [...] "hothead whose on-court demeanour {{was holding}} him back."

In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and <b>those</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> things, but I don't know if I'd ever change that because I feel that's the way I get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|E
500|$|Douglas filmed {{the opening}} scene, which is Gekko being {{released}} from Sing Sing maximum-security prison, in Ossining, Westchester County, on September 18. Stone felt that the prison scene was a [...] "key plot element" [...] {{because there is no}} one there to meet Gekko, who returns to society as an outsider. Regarding there being no scenes that show Gekko adjusting to the modern world, the director clarified that there is [...] "very little space to do <b>those</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> tricks in this movie" [...] because of how modern the world is becoming on a monthly basis. Filming took place in Fordham University for the classroom scenes on October 10 and 11. In order to shoot a dining scene between LaBeouf and Douglas, Shun Lee West closed for 24 hours so the two could film scenes at the restaurant for the entire day of November 10. Brolin and Stone found extras simply by asking workers, at places like RdV, if they would like {{to be a part of}} the sequel.|$|E

500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it just seemed like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag <b>those</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E
500|$|Concerning inspirations on the season, Loeb {{revealed}} that [...] "Chinatown... {{is one of}} the things that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character. So <b>those</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> beautiful, long, wide expansive shots, where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone’s in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they’re having a conversation, that’s the stuff that makes it interesting." [...] Director of Photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette, while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create [...] "unconventional" [...] compositions, with Billeter explaining, [...] "There were a lot of foreground elements [...] headroom as well, and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create a sense of claustrophobia." [...] Billeter shot the season with a Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution, with 5K used for some visual effects shots, and with Panavision PVintage lenses; he focused mostly on static frames and [...] "good composition", but did occasionally employ a camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting, Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs, so he tried to recreate the [...] "warm, dirty color of sodium vapor" [...] for night exterior scenes.|$|E
500|$|Now {{two years}} since she signed the deal, Lavigne, who was then unknown, came to the {{attention}} of the three-piece production team The Matrix. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team's manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together: [...] "Why don't you put her together with The Matrix for a couple of days?" [...] According to member Lauren Christy, they had been listening to Lavigne's early songs and felt they contained [...] "a Faith Hill kind of vibe". As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, The Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude. After talking to Lavigne for an hour, [...] "we cottoned on that she wasn't happy but couldn't quite figure out where to go". The Matrix played her songs with Faith Hill influences, because it was <b>those</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> songs the label wanted Lavigne to sing. But Lavigne dismissed it, saying she wanted songs with punk rock inclinations. Lavigne played The Matrix a song that she had recorded and really loved, a track with sounds in the likes of the rock band System of a Down. Fortunately, prior to forming The Matrix, its members' early projects were in the pop-rock type, so they readily figured out what Lavigne wanted to record and knew exactly what to do with her. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into [...] "Complicated" [...] and another song called [...] "Falling Down" [...] (Falling Down appears on the Sweet Home Alabama Soundtrack). They played it to Lavigne when she came back the following day, inspiring her what path she should take.|$|E
