Choosing to let the passengers escape first, Neerja is fatally shot by the terrorists when she tries to shield young children from the gunfire.

5|$|Harveys Lake {{has been}} popular for {{recreational}} purposes {{since the late}} 1800s. Places such as Warden Place and Sandy Beach were popular recreational areas near the lake in the early 1900s. Around this time period, there were four steamboats on Harveys Lake. They were used for carrying passengers and freight. Recreational steamboat rides on the lake were popular between 1900 and 1920. A 60-foot (18-meter) high Shoot <b>the</b> <b>Chute</b> {{was built in the}} area by Charles Shelley in 1910. It was one of the largest attractions in the lake's vicinity. A casino near the lake was opened by Frank Devlin in May 1924, but was demolished in 1980. Devlin also opened the largest bowling alley in northeast Pennsylvania near the lake. Throughout the 20th century, prior to and after World War II, the lake attracted thousands of visitors yearly.|$|E

However, a week later, Koboi is detained by the LEP, and Holly is cleared of all charges over Commander Root's murder. However, she is frustrated by Commander Root's replacement, Ark Sool, so she resigns and starts a private investigation firm with Mulch Diggums.|$|E
25|$|It {{was further}} theorized that the abrupt change in {{transverse}} rotational axis during the ship's descent {{down the long}} launch ramp caused the bow to press against <b>the</b> <b>chute</b> itself as the stern hit the water. This may have caused a crack somewhere in the keel, contributing to admission of water to the hull. Regardless of the exact cause, it was eventually determined that full responsibility {{for the loss of}} the steamship was due to the shipyard's technical mistakes during launch and not in the design or construction of the vessel.|$|E
25|$|Shock waves {{can also}} occur in rapid flows of dense {{granular}} materials down inclined channels or slopes. Strong shocks in rapid dense granular flows {{can be studied}} theoretically and analyzed to compare with experimental data. Consider a configuration in which the rapidly moving material down <b>the</b> <b>chute</b> impinges on an obstruction wall erected perpendicular {{at the end of}} a long and steep channel. Impact leads to a sudden change in the flow regime from a fast moving supercritical thin layer to a stagnant thick heap. This flow configuration is particularly interesting because it is analogous to some hydraulic and aerodynamic situations associated with flow regime changes from supercritical to subcritical flows.|$|E
50|$|After <b>the</b> drogue <b>chute</b> has {{stabilized}} <b>the</b> SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum {{is separated}} from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of 5500 ft about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then {{pulled away from the}} SRB by <b>the</b> drogue <b>chute.</b> <b>The</b> main <b>chute</b> suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are 203 ft long, <b>the</b> three main <b>chutes</b> are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10 and 17-second reefing line cutters), <b>the</b> main <b>chute</b> reefing lines are cut and <b>the</b> <b>chutes</b> inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. <b>The</b> main <b>chute</b> cluster decelerates <b>the</b> SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the 136 ft diameter, 20-degree conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately 195000 lb and each weighs approximately 2180 lb. These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used — both in deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.|$|R

500|$|Born in Sydney on 9 October 1918, Read {{was the son}} of an {{immigrant}} from Bristol, England. He was educated at Sydney Grammar School, where he completed his Leaving Certificate. After working as a clerk in a motoring firm, Read joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) as an air cadet on 21July 1937. He underwent instruction at No. 1 Flying Training School in Point Cook, Victoria, and gained his commission as a pilot officer in June 1938. Over the next two years he flew with No.3 Squadron and No.22 Squadron, which were based at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and operated Hawker Demon biplanes. He was involved in experimental parachute drops with dummies near Menangle; on one such test a fundamental flaw in the harness revealed itself when the dummy slipped clean from <b>the</b> <b>chute,</b> necessitating a redesign. By the time Australia declared war on 3September 1939, Read had been promoted to flying officer.
