Milne's form attracted attention elsewhere with Aberdeen among those interested, a move Milne favoured to be near his son and other family in Scotland. On being called into a meeting with manager, Joe Jordan, Milne was told by Jordan {{that he had no}} intention of letting him nor any of his other best players leave, but that he would make an exception for Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Several {{changes to}} the roster were made before the 2007–08 {{campaign}} as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign. Most notably, the Raptors acquired Carlos Delfino in a trade with Detroit for two second round draft picks, and signed Jamario Moon and three-point specialist Jason Kapono as free agents. On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets. Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles. However, Toronto quickly fell behind Boston in the division, as Bargnani's inability <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>well</b> consistently, along with injuries to Garbajosa (75 games), Bosh (15 games) and Ford (31 games), derailed {{the possibility of a}} smooth campaign.|$|E
5|$|The {{first game}} was against Otago University on 10 September, which the home side won easily, 21–0. Jack Verge {{was the only}} one of the team <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>well,</b> {{preventing}} the home side scoring through his tackling. For the return match on 15 September, the younger Verge was brought in at five-eighth, which helped strengthen the team. No points were scored in the first half, although the visitors came close to getting a try but were held up on the line. In the second half, Otago scored six points to Sydney's three, and again came away the winners. Verge missed scoring from a penalty kick, which hit the crossbar.|$|E

5|$|Reading {{finished}} the 1973–74 season in sixth position, one place {{higher than the}} previous year. Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision. He was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974–75 season in July 1974, arriving only {{on the day of}} a closed-doors friendly against Watford. Despite his lack of training, he far out-performed the rest of the team. He continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>well</b> when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The former had been following him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading's 4–2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez was {{announced}} as the starter for the Eagles Week 11 {{game against the}} Buccaneers after {{it was revealed that}} Bradford suffered a separated shoulder and a concussion. Sanchez's opening drive was excellent, completing 100% of his passes and ending it with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Josh Huff to make the score 7-0. Sanchez continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>well</b> {{for the majority of the}} 1st half, and threw a second touchdown pass to Darren Sproles, but the Buccaneers offense had already scored 21 points. However, after that drive, Sanchez started to crumble, throwing an interception near the end of the second quarter. Sanchez finished the game with 3 interceptions, 1 of which was returned for a touchdown, in a humiliating 45-17 blowout. His 2 touchdown passes were the only points scored by the offense.|$|E

A second-place finish in the 1947–48 season led St. Pauli to its first {{appearance}} in the national championship rounds. They advanced {{as far as the}} semi-finals, where they were knocked out 2–3 by eventual champions 1. FC Nürnberg. The club continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>well</b> throughout the early 1950s, but were unable to overtake rivals Hamburger SV, finishing in second place in five of the next seven seasons, and going out in the early rounds in each of their championship-round appearances from 1949 to 1951. In the late 1950s and into the early 1960s, St. Pauli were overtaken by rivals such as Werder Bremen and VfL Osnabrück, but finished fourth a number of times.|$|E
25|$|Eleven {{games into}} the season, the Thrashers {{were alone in}} first place atop both the Southeast Division and the NHL.

Boxing Day 2003 marked both a bright and dark day for the Thrashers. On that day, Heatley skated {{for the first time since}} his car accident with Snyder, but it also marked the last win for the Thrashers before an extended losing streak. From December 28 to February 11, the team went a dismal 2–16–3. However, fans were entertained regardless of the team's struggles. Kovalchuk became only the second Thrashers' player to score in the NHL All-Star Game (after Heatley).|$|E
25|$|At the Omega Dubai Desert Classic McIlroy {{finished}} tied 5th on 14-under-par, four strokes behind winner Rafael Cabrera-Bello.

After 10 {{holes in the}} final match, McIlroy was 4 down to Mahan, but cut the deficit to 2 down through 16 holes. The 17th hole was halved with pars, securing the win for Mahan. There was anticipation surrounding the semi-final match between McIlroy and Westwood, as the winner would become the number one golfer in the world if they also won the final. McIlroy's runner-up finish moved him up to number two in the world while also putting him {{at the top of}} the Race to Dubai leaderboard.|$|E

25|$|Douglas {{initially}} struggled at {{the point}} guard position while adjusting to the Florida State offense, but continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>well</b> in other respects. The early part of his sophomore season was highlighted by his shot block that helped to seal an upset victory against then-fourth-ranked University of Florida Gators, and a late-game period against Wake Forest in which he scored 10 consecutive points, leading Florida State to a win. On February 7, 2007, Douglas injured the fourth metacarpal in his right (shooting) hand, forcing him to sit out six games (nearly a month)—of which Florida State lost five. In his first game (against the University of Miami) after sustaining his injury, Douglas scored 13 points, including a three-pointer that tied the game and forced overtime; Florida State {{went on to win}} the game. Douglas finished the season with averages of 12.7 points, 2.9 assists and 2.7 rebounds per game. In three games of the 2007 National Invitation Tournament (NIT), he averaged 11.7 points and 3.7 rebounds, as Florida State won twice before losing to Mississippi State University in the semifinals.|$|E
25|$|After two {{losses in}} a week, {{including}} elimination from the League Cup, Southampton returned to St Mary's on 10 November to host Swansea City. In a game which featured the league debut of Luke Shaw, {{as well as}} the first league game of the season for Jack Cork, the Saints dominated possession and goal-scoring chances in the first half but failed to break the deadlock before the break. After half time Southampton continued <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>well,</b> with a penalty possibility for Adam Lallana turned down ten minutes after the break, before Morgan Schneiderlin headed in a cross from Rickie Lambert to score his second goal of the season and go 1–0 up against the Welsh side. Despite more chances for the home side, however, former Saints player Nathan Dyer scored to equalise for the visitors following a mistake by goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga. The game remained 1–1, despite more chances for both sides, and due to other results the Saints moved off the bottom of the table with only their fifth point of the season.|$|E
