The key enzyme of this pathway, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase, harbours mixed nickel-iron-sulfur clusters in its reaction centres and catalyzes the formation of acetyl-CoA (similar to acetyl-thiol) in a single step. There are increasing concerns, however, that prebiotic <b>thiolated</b> and Thioester compounds are thermodynamically and kinetically unfavourable to accumulate in presumed prebiotic conditions (i.e. hydrothermal vents).|$|E

Mesoporous gold sponges are attractive materials for molecular sensing by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), for catalysis, and for fuel cell construction. The following approach is “green” because PEG Thiol is biocompatible, and because it requires relatively little energy; PEG Thiol-triggered self-assembly of mesoporous gold sponges occurs at room temperature. By contrast, the most popular method of generating mesoporous gold sponges, dealloying Au-Ag alloys, employs electrochemical corrosion.|$|E
50|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} {{have their}} advantages in drug vectorization. They can pack several different sizes {{and types of}} dendrimers and several different types of ligands in order to effectively treat different types of cancers. For example, research shows that 80~90% of breast cancer’s tumor cells have estrogen receptors and 60~70% of prostate cancer’s tumor cells have androgen receptors. These significant amount of hormone receptors {{play a role in}} intermolecular actions. This role is now used by targeting and therapeutic ligands on gold nanoparticles to target tissue-selective anti-tumor drug delivery. In order to have multiple targeting and therapeutic ligands bind with gold nanoparticles, the gold nanoparticles must first undergo polymer stabilization.

The type of polymers used is of biodegradable polyester, as nanocapsules are often used in biological systems. Poly-e-caprolactone (PCL), poly(lactide) (PLA), and poly(lactide-co-glicolide) (PLGA) are typical polymers used in nanocapsule formation. Other polymers include <b>thiolated</b> poly(methacrylic acid) and poly(N-vinyl Pyrrolidone).

However, some natural occurring polymers such as chitosan, gelatin, sodium alginate, and albumin are used in some drug delivering nanocapsules. Other nanocapsule shells include liposomes, along with polysaccharides and saccharides. Polysaccharides and saccharides are used due to their non-toxicity and biodegradability. They are attractive to use as they resemble biological membranes.|$|E
40|$|Thiols (RSH) or <b>thiolates</b> (RS) {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular anchor groups used for {{attaching}} molecules to gold electrodes in molecular junction devices. Operation of these devices under oxidizing conditions may lead to oxidation of the <b>thiolate</b> anchor groups. Herein we investigate the plausibility of this process as a potential source of current fluctuation. Density functional theory calculations on various oxide derivatives of ethanethiolate on gold clusters (EtSO_n/Au_(13); n = 0 − 3) suggest that oxidation of <b>thiolate</b> anchor groups (Au−S) into sulfoxides (Au−SO) should be unlikely under ambient conditions. Under oxidizing conditions, sulfoxides can form and oxidize further into sulfinates (Au−SO_ 2) and sulfonates (Au−SO_ 3) favorably via oxygen transfer from surface oxides or other active oxygen species. Nonequilibrium Green’s function calculations on model devices with <b>thiolate,</b> sulfoxide, and sulfonate anchor groups suggest that <b>thiolates</b> show essentially the same insulating current−voltage characteristics before and after oxidation. However, oxidation of <b>thiolates</b> into sulfonates can increase the length of the electron transfer pathway (that is, the molecule), and this type of oxidation-induced change (molecular lengthening, SAM thickening, and possibly SAM disordering) can affect the robustness of the molecular junction devices...|$|R

50|$|Part of {{the issue}} with these studies {{is the lack of}} {{reliable}} methods for determining the uptake of gold nanoparticles in vivo without examining the tumor site post-mortem. Gold nanoparticle uptake in cells is often carried out by examining the organs of injected mice post-mortem. This technique cannot be replicated during clinical trials, so new methods need to be developed to determine the uptake of cells to avoid higher concentrations of gold nanoparticles in the body leading to toxic effects. One recently suggested method to counter this limitation is radiolabeling. The uptake of <b>thiolated</b> gold nanoparticles has recently been monitored using 111In-labeled polymer shells that surround the gold nanoparticle and shows a possible way around this problem, but these polymer shells can be removed from the particle making a more stable labeling system required for these kinds of studies.|$|E
50|$|Not all the {{clusters}} are stable. The stability of nanoclusters {{depends on the}} number of atoms in the nanocluster, valence electron counts and encapsulating scaffolds. In the 1990s, Heer and his coworkers used supersonic expansion of an atomic cluster source into a vacuum in the presence of an inert gas and produced atomic cluster beams. Heer's team and Brack et al. discovered that certain masses of formed metal nanoclusters were stable and were like magic clusters. The number of atoms or size of the core of these magic clusters corresponds to the closing of atomic shells. Certain <b>thiolated</b> clusters such as Au25(SR)18, Au38(SR)24, Au102(SR)44 and Au144(SR)60 also showed magic number stability. Häkkinen et al explained this stability with a theory that a nanocluster is stable if the number of valence electrons corresponds to the shell closure of atomic orbitals as (1S2, 1P6, 1D10, 2S2 1F14, 2P6 1G18, 2D10 3S2 1H22.......).|$|E

The chemical and biological aspects of NO and S-nitrosothiols (thionitrites RSNO) are reviewed in Chapter 1. It is known that RSNO decomposition is Cu(^+) catalysed, while formation by S-nitrosation of thiols ensures the presence of some <b>thiolate</b> ion in solutions of RSNO generally. The extent of free <b>thiolate</b> ion in solutions of S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (SNAG) has been determined by the Ellman procedure.

This backbone consists of well-established and safe polymers such as chitosan or poly(acrylic acid). It {{has been demonstrated}} in various studies, that thiomers exhibit mucoadhesive, permeation enhancing, controlled release as well as enzyme and efflux pump inhibitory properties. These features make the thiomer technology highly interesting for non-invasive delivery routes, including in first instance the oral but also the nasal, buccal and vaginal route. Thiomers can be directly compressed to tablets or given as solutions. Furthermore thiomer based micro- and nanoparticles have already been developed.In 2012 a second generation of thiomers - so called preactivated or S-protected thiomers - were introduced.

50|$|To {{be of use}} for {{connecting}} molecules, MWs need to self-assemble following well-defined {{routes and}} form reliable electrical contacts between them. To reproducibly self-assemble a complex circuit based on single molecules. Ideally, they would connect to diverse materials, such as gold metal surfaces (for connections to outside world), biomolecules (for nanosensors, nanoelectrodes, molecular switches) and most importantly, they must allow branching. The connectors should also be available of pre-determined diameter and length. They should also have covalent bonding to ensure reproducible transport and contact properties. DNA-like molecules have specific molecular-scale recognition {{and can be used}} in molecular scaffold fabrication. Complex shapes have been demonstrated, but unfortunately metal coated DNA which is electrically conducting is too thick to connect to individual molecules. Thinner coated DNA lacks electronic connectivity and is unsuited for connecting molecular electronics components. Some varieties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are conducting, and connectivity at their ends can be achieved by attachment of connecting groups. Unfortunately manufacturing CNTs with pre-determined properties is impossible at present, and the functionalized ends are typically not conducting, limiting their usefulness as molecular connectors. Individual CNTs can be soldered in an electron microscope, but the contact is not covalent and cannot be self-assembled. Possible routes for the construction of larger functional circuits using Mo6S9−xIx MWs have been demonstrated, either via gold nanoparticles as linkers, or by direct connection to <b>thiolated</b> molecules. The two approaches may lead to different possible applications. The use of GNPs offers the possibility of branching and construction of larger circuits.|$|E
50|$|Thiols. Thiol-containing small {{molecules}} {{are the most}} commonly adopted stabilizers in metal nanoparticle synthesis owing to {{the strong interaction between}} thiols and gold and silver. Glutathione {{has been shown to be}} an excellent stabilizer for synthesizing gold nanoclusters with visible luminescence by reducing Au3+ in the presence of glutathione with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Also other thiols such as tiopronin, phenylethylthiolate, thiolate α-cyclodextrin and 3-mercaptopropionic acid and bidentate dihydrolipoic acid are other <b>thiolated</b> compounds currently being used in the synthesis of metal nanoclusters. The size as well as the luminescence efficiency of the nanocluster depends sensitively on the thiol-to-metal molar ratio. The higher the ratio, the smaller the nanoclusters. The thiol-stabilized nanoclusters can be produced using strong as well as mild reductants. Thioled metal nanoclusters are mostly produced using the strong reductant sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Gold nanocluster synthesis can also be achieved using a mild reducant tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium (THPC). Here a zwitterionic thiolate ligand, D-penicillamine (DPA), is used as the stabilizer. Furthermore, nanoclusters can be produced by etching larger nanoparticles with thiols. Thiols can be used to etch larger nanoparticles stabilized by other capping agents. Dendrimers. Dendrimers are used as templates to synthesize nanoclusters. Gold nanoclusters embedded in poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (PAMAM) have been successfully synthesized. PAMAM is repeatedly branched molecules with different generations. The florescence properties of the nanoclusters are sensitively dependent on the types of dendrimers used as template for the synthesis. Metal nanoclusters embedded in different templates show maximum emission at different wavelengths. The change in florescence property is mainly due to surface modification by the capping agents. Although gold nanoclusters embedded in PAMAM are blue-emitting the spectrum can be tuned from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared (NIR) region and the relative PAMAM/gold concentration and the dendrimer generation can be varied. The green-emitting gold nanoclusters can be synthesized by adding mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) into the prepared small gold nanoparticle solution. The addition of freshly reduced lipoic acid (DHLA) gold nanoclusters (AuNC@DHLA) become red-emitting fluorophores.|$|E
