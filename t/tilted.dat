5|$|Because the Earth's axis is <b>tilted</b> {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is <b>tilted</b> towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbital parameters affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate.

30|$|In <b>tilting</b> trains, {{naturally}} <b>tilting</b> systems hardly {{need any}} controls to initiate <b>tilt.</b> However, most naturally <b>tilting</b> {{systems can be}} upgraded with an actuator {{in order to improve}} their performance and give more control to operators and/or computer systems. Such are most actively <b>tilting</b> systems. As defined previously, actively <b>tilting</b> trains require some sort of device or component in other to initiate <b>tilting.</b>|$|R
30|$|From the {{accelerogram}} on the surface, {{we could}} estimate the surface <b>tilt</b> {{by measuring the}} static offset appearing in the surface accelerogram, which was 2.2 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 radians down to the east (Figure  3 b, Table  1). We call this <b>tilt</b> SUF <b>tilt</b> to avoid potential confusion with DIF <b>tilt.</b> The SUF <b>tilt</b> change was larger than the DIF <b>tilt</b> change, but the <b>tilt</b> direction was again consistent with the DIF <b>tilt.</b> In the borehole accelerogram, the static offsets were not consistent among the three components, suggesting that these offsets were not caused only by <b>tilt</b> motion. Accordingly, we {{did not use the}} offset of the borehole accelerogram for the <b>tilt</b> estimation.|$|R
40|$|Narrow <b>tilting</b> {{vehicles}} {{offer an}} opportunity to reduce both traffic congestion and carbon emissions by having a small road footprint, a low weight and a small frontal area. Their narrow track requires that they <b>tilt</b> into corners to maintain stability; this may be achieved {{by means of an}} automated <b>tilt</b> control system. Automated <b>tilt</b> control systems can be classed as steering <b>tilt</b> control in which active control of the front-wheel steering angle is used to maintain stability, direct <b>tilt</b> control in which some form of actuator is used to exert a moment between the <b>tilting</b> part(s) of the vehicle and non-tilting part(s), or a combination of the two, namely steering–direct <b>tilt</b> control. Combined steering–direct <b>tilt</b> control systems have the potential to offer improved performance as, unlike steering <b>tilt</b> control systems, they are effective at low speeds while offering superior transient roll stability to direct <b>tilt</b> control systems. This paper details the implementation of a steering direct <b>tilt</b> control system on a prototype narrow <b>tilting</b> vehicle and presents experimental results which demonstrate a 36 % reduction in load transfer from the inside wheel to the outside wheel during a ramp-steering manoeuvre when compared with a direct <b>tilt</b> control system...|$|R

The calibration and testing process is very important before using of the <b>tilt</b> sensors. This paper deals with declination angle gage for testing of these <b>tilt</b> sensors.

40|$|Abstract Background One {{problem in}} the {{mobilization}} of patients with neurological diseases, such as spinal cord injury, is the circulatory collapse that occurs while changing from supine to vertical position because of the missing venous pump due to paralyzed leg muscles. Therefore, a <b>tilt</b> table with integrated stepping device (<b>tilt</b> stepper) was developed, which allows passive stepping movements for performing locomotion training in an early state of rehabilitation. The aim of this pilot {{study was to investigate}} if passive stepping and cycling movements of the legs during <b>tilt</b> table training could stabilize blood circulation and prevent neurally-mediated syncope in healthy young adults. Methods In the first experiment, healthy subjects were tested on a traditional <b>tilt</b> table. Subjects who had a syncope or near-syncope in this condition underwent a second trial on the <b>tilt</b> stepper. In the second experiment, a group of healthy subjects was investigated on a traditional <b>tilt</b> table, the second group on the <b>tilt</b> ergometer, a device that allows cycling movements during <b>tilt</b> table training. We used the chi-square test to compare the occurrence of near-syncope/syncope in both groups (<b>tilt</b> table/tilt stepper and <b>tilt</b> table/tilt ergometer) and ANOVA to compare the blood pressure and heart rate between the groups at the four time intervals (supine, at 2 minutes, at 6 minutes and end of head-up <b>tilt).</b> Results Separate chi-square tests performed for each experiment showed significant differences in the occurrence of near syncope or syncope based on the device used. Comparison of the two groups (<b>tilt</b> stepper/ <b>tilt</b> table) in experiment one (ANOVA) showed that blood pressure was significantly higher at the end of head-up <b>tilt</b> on the <b>tilt</b> stepper and on the <b>tilt</b> table there was a greater increase in heart rate (2 minutes after head-up <b>tilt).</b> Comparison of the two groups (<b>tilt</b> ergometer/tilt table) in experiment 2 (ANOVA) showed that blood pressure was significantly higher on the <b>tilt</b> ergometer at the end of head-up <b>tilt</b> and on the <b>tilt</b> table the increase in heart rate was significantly larger (at 6 min and end of head-up <b>tilt).</b> Conclusions Stabilization of blood circulation and prevention of benign syncope can be achieved by passive leg movement during a <b>tilt</b> table test in healthy adults. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tilting</b> trains can be {{classified}} into different categories according the features of their <b>tilting</b> system. On every types of <b>tilting</b> trains the <b>tilting</b> systems shall perform three main functions: first, they have to identify accurately and without delay the initial position of curve transitions, {{then they have to}} <b>tilt</b> the car body according to the <b>tilting</b> algorithm provided for the system and finally they have to verify that the provided amount of <b>tilt</b> corresponds to the <b>tilt</b> demand. With the “Italian solution ” applied on Pendolino trains curves are recognized by some dynamic signal measured by sensors located on the bogies such as the bogie lateral acceleration and roll rate. On these <b>tilting</b> trains, the type of algorithm controlling the angle of <b>tilt</b> has been defined in order to compensate a fixed percentage of total lateral acceleration which is constant for all curves. In order to achieve that, the <b>tilting</b> system evaluates the same signals used to identify curves and produces a <b>tilt</b> request proportional to the lateral acceleration on the bogie. Finally, on Pendolino trains a simple loop allows to verify the effectiveness of the <b>tilting</b> control comparing the requested <b>tilt</b> angle and the actual angle applied and measured on the car body. The most significant advantage of this solution is that <b>tilting</b> trains can be operated on all type...|$|R

5|$|A {{key feature}} of the F-16's cockpit is the {{exceptional}} field of view. The single-piece, bird-proof polycarbonate bubble canopy provides 360° all-round visibility, with a 40° look-down angle {{over the side of}} the aircraft, and 15° down over the nose (compared to the common 12–13° of preceding aircraft); the pilot's seat is elevated for this purpose. Furthermore, the F-16's canopy lacks the forward bow frame found on many fighters, which is an obstruction to a pilot's forward vision. The F-16's ACES II zero/zero ejection seat is reclined at an unusual tilt-back angle of 30°; most fighters have a <b>tilted</b> seat at 13–15°. The <b>tilted</b> seat can accommodate taller pilots and increases G-force tolerance; however it has been associated with reports of neck ache, possibly caused by incorrect head-rest usage. Subsequent U.S. fighters have adopted more modest tilt-back angles of 20°. Due to the seat angle and the canopy's thickness, the ejection seat lacks canopy-breakers for emergency egress; instead the entire canopy is jettisoned prior to the seat's rocket firing.|$|E
