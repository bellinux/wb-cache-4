5|$|Gale married Henrietta Roper, the {{daughter}} of Henry Roper of Cowling, Kent. She died in 1720. They had one son, Roger Henry Gale, {{who was born in}} 1710. Gale himself died on 25 June 1744 at his estates in Scruton, and was buried near the church there. There is no monument in the churchyard, as he stipulated in his will that he be buried in such a manner <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> know exactly where he was buried.|$|E
5|$|The {{terms of}} the peace {{agreement}} were <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be enslaved, no harm would be done to the temples, nothing would be taken as booty and that safe passage was given to Thomas, Harbees, and every citizen of Damascus who {{was not willing to}} live under Muslim rule. The peace agreement also stated that the peace would end after three days and that the Muslims could attack after these three days without violating the agreement.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{where he}} {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> employ {{him in any}} job other than as an actor. In 1882, he put together a troupe of his own with Keni Liptzin, and brought Rosenberg in as a partner. This troupe toured to Rostov, Taganrog, around Lithuania, to Dünaburg (now Daugavpils, Latvia). Aiming to bring the troupe to Saint Petersburg, they brought back their sometime manager Chaikel Bain. They were in Riga in August 1883 when the news arrived that a total ban {{was about to be}} placed on Yiddish theater in Russia.|$|E

6000|$|And {{now that}} {{all had been}} rescued from the Crystal Lake, the King put a rope around the broken crust and stuck up {{a sign that said}} [...] "Danger!" [...] so <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> fall in.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are so {{generous and}} kind-hearted that you let people borrow, and can't say 'No' to anyone. We heard about Henshaw {{and all you}} did for him. If you always spent money in <b>that</b> way, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> blame you," [...] said Jo warmly.|$|R
5|$|Speaking {{publicly}} about Biko's death, the country's police minister Jimmy Kruger initially implied {{that it had}} been the result of a hunger strike, a statement he later denied. His account was challenged by some of Biko's friends, including Woods, who said that Biko had told them that he would never kill himself in prison. Publicly, he stated that Biko had been plotting violence, a claim repeated in the pro-government press. South Africa's attorney general initially stated <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be prosecuted for Biko's death. Two weeks after the funeral, the government banned all Black Consciousness organisations, including the BCP, which had its assets seized.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} then {{attempted to}} elect Vidoni again, but Chigi was now opposed to {{him out of}} anger at the French for excluding d'Elci. The Spanish cardinals also worked against Vidoni, implying {{at one point that}} Mariana of Austria, the Queen regent of Spain, had excluded Vidoni's candidacy. The Spanish then attempted to elect Benedetto Odescalchi, but d'Ailly declared <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to be elected unless they owed loyalty to Louis XIV. The Spanish soon sent word that their cardinals were free to vote for anyone. The letter was brought by courier and announced that Mariana of Austria had not actually excluded Vidoni nor any member of the college.|$|E
5|$|Costa, Thomas, and J.B. go to buy {{marijuana}} from drug-dealer T-Rick. While T-Rick {{gets the}} marijuana, Costa steals his lawn gnome {{to use as}} a party mascot. As they leave, T-Rick discovers his gnome stolen and chases after them but they escape in Thomas' mini-van. As night falls, the party's start time passes but no one turns up and Thomas worries that the party will fail. Suddenly, party-goers arrive en-masse. Thomas intends to limit the party to the backyard and poolhouse with the house guarded by two young security guards, Everett and Tyler. However, more and more people begin to arrive and the party moves beyond their control and into the house. Thomas questions Costa on how he advertised the party, forcing him to confess that he put ads on Craigslist and on a local radio station, worried <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> attend.|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't know him, Caleb. He is so changed <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> hardly <b>would</b> know him. You can't {{conceive}} {{how much}} in earnest he is, how determined and resolute. And then, I {{should like to}} have Mary so much if mamma would let her come." ...|$|R

5|$|Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based {{professional}} photographer, {{arrived at}} city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and photographed the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which only shows dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals in the photographs made no attempts to hide their identities. Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town.|$|E
5|$|The design {{specifications}} were completed in February 1945, and contracts were let {{to build the}} components. Three different plants were used so <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> {{have a copy of}} the complete design. The gun and breech were made by the Naval Gun Factory in Washington, D.C.; the target case and some other components were by the Naval Ordnance Plant in Center Line, Michigan; and the tail fairing and mounting brackets by the Expert Tool and Die Company in Detroit, Michigan. The bomb, except for the uranium payload, was ready at the beginning of May 1945. The uranium-235 projectile was completed on 15 June, and the target on 24 July. The target and bomb pre-assemblies (partly assembled bombs without the fissile components) left Hunters Point Naval Shipyard, California, on 16 July aboard the heavy cruiser , arriving on 26 July. The target inserts followed by air on 30 July.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E
5000|$|After even a {{quick glance}} at the content of the website at , <b>no</b> <b>one</b> seeking Reverend Falwell’s {{guidance}} would be misled by the domain name — [...] — into believing Reverend Falwell authorized the content of <b>that</b> website. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> believe <b>that</b> Reverend Falwell sponsored a site criticizing himself, his positions, and his interpretations of the Bible.|$|R

[...] "By what you said this morning I judged you would be {{returning}} about this hour, {{and it was in}} hopes you might hear me that I cried out, for I knew well <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> be likely to be within earshot." ...|$|R
5000|$|Communication grew faster as {{now there}} was a way to get {{messages}} across just like mail. Important and private clay tablets were coated with an extra layer of clay, <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> read it. This means of communicating was used for over [...] 3000 years in fifteen different languages. Sumerians, Babylonians and Eblaites all had their own clay tablet libraries.|$|R
25|$|Whitehorn said {{great care}} was {{taken during the}} {{numerous}} bombings to ensure <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be hurt, including the janitorial staff.|$|E
25|$|Lemlich {{was also}} active in Unemployed Councils {{activities}} and in founding the Emma Lazarus Council, which supported tenants' rights. The Emma Lazarus Council declared in 1931 <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be evicted in Brighton Beach for {{inability to pay}} rent, then backed that up by rallying supporters to prevent evictions and returning tenants' furniture to their apartments in those cases in which authorities attempted to effect eviction.|$|E
25|$|Many ballparks {{were large}} by modern standards, {{such as the}} West Side Grounds of the Chicago Cubs, which was 560 feet to the center field fence, and the Huntington Avenue Grounds of the Boston Red Sox, which was 635 feet to the center field fence. The {{dimensions}} of Braves Field prompted Ty Cobb to say <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> ever hit {{the ball out of}} it.|$|E
5000|$|Jesters {{could also}} give bad {{news to the}} King <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> dare deliver. The best {{example of this is}} in 1340, when the French fleet was {{destroyed}} at the Battle of Sluys by the English. Phillippe VI's jester told him the English sailors [...] "don't even have the guts to jump into the water like our brave French".|$|R
50|$|Because of her {{continuous}} unpleasant behavior, Lamia becomes unwanted in Samy’s {{house and}} she is forced to go back. Samy warns Lamia <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> want her anymore if he divorces her {{and she would be}} alone forever. Lamia is in great dilemma because she {{does not want to be}} with her husband but she does not want to go back either (because of Youssef).|$|R
5000|$|Dowry: This {{issue is}} a {{relatively}} minor one in the film. It is addressed only in one quote, when Lakshmi explains why she married Kishtayya. After Surya asks why Lakshmi chose to marry a [...] "drunken deaf-mute," [...] she answers <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> marry her as she {{could not afford to}} pay dowry. She then points out that Kishtayya was not yet a drunkard.|$|R
25|$|Analysts {{and other}} activists said Ai had been widely {{thought to be}} untouchable, but Nicholas Bequelin from Human Rights Watch {{suggested}} that his arrest, calculated to send the message <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be immune, must have had the approval of someone in the top leadership. International governments, human rights groups and art institutions, among others, called for Ai's release, while Chinese officials did not notify Ai's family of his whereabouts.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, most {{financial}} institutions and some economists feel that all too often, banks are accused unfairly of discrimination against minority owned businesses when said business is simply not worth such a credit risk, and <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> find such a decision discriminatory if the business were not minority owned. These charges of reverse racism or prejudicial analysis are a longstanding source of controversy {{in the study of}} economic discrimination.|$|E
25|$|In response, De Palma argued that, if {{the latest}} version of the film was now {{considered}} an R, then his original version would also be rated R, rationalizing that the edits which he made were minor. The MPAA told De Palma that only his latest edit would be certified as an R. De Palma believed that the changes were so slight <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> notice if he released his original version anyway, which he ultimately did.|$|E
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} college, he was “working as a PA and basic {{all-around}} grunt” and “was also doing some photo work {{and wanted to}} make films.” When he met Hawley at a party, she was a film-school student, and he “talked her into dropping out {{so that they could}} make a film instead. He knew <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> give him the chance to shoot.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is <b>that</b> all, Gillian? <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> coerce you. Shall I {{send him}} away, {{and tell him}} not to think of it? Remember, it is a serious thing—-nay, an unworthy thing to trifle with a right-minded man." ...|$|R
50|$|Putney Swope, {{the only}} black man on the {{executive}} board of an advertising firm, is accidentally put in charge after the unexpected death of {{the chairman of the}} board: each board member actually believed that he, himself, should be elected chairman, but the bylaws of the corporation prohibit voting for oneself, so each individual member voted his secret ballot for the person <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> vote for: Putney Swope.|$|R
25|$|Modern {{scholars}} agree Herod suffered {{throughout his}} lifetime from depression and paranoia. Josephus stated that Herod was so concerned <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> mourn his death, that he commanded {{a large group}} of distinguished men to come to Jericho, and he gave an order that they should be killed {{at the time of his}} death so that the displays of grief that he craved would take place. Fortunately for them, Herod's son Archelaus and sister Salome did not carry out this wish.|$|E
25|$|In April 2009, the United States Supreme Court {{agreed to}} hear a suit over reverse {{discrimination}} brought by 20 white and Hispanic firefighters against the city. The suit involved the 2003 promotion test for the New Haven Fire Department. After the tests were scored, no blacks scored high enough to qualify for consideration for promotion, so the city announced <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be promoted. On 29 June 2009, the United States Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the firefighters, agreeing that they were improperly denied promotion because of their race. The case, Ricci v. DeStefano, became highly publicized and brought national attention to New Haven politics due to the involvement of then-Supreme Court nominee (and Yale Law School graduate) Sonia Sotomayor in a lower court decision.|$|E
25|$|The report {{published}} in December 2008 {{assumed that the}} total number of passenger journeys would be 150,000 per annum, each paying £3.15 per journey. It also assumed <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> use the line at week-ends, even though it runs via the successful tourist attractions of the National Forest. This equates to an assumption that just over 300 return journeys would be made daily and only during the week, yet according to the latest travel-to-work plans, some 4000–6000 car journeys occur daily on the Coalville to Leicester corridor and 6000–8000 per day from the south. Thus, about 12,000 car journeys takes place along part or all the rail track; it is not considered credible that only 2.5% would be attracted on to the train. That led to a widespread belief that the report's economic assumptions were wrong.|$|E
60|$|Dan had learned, with a lover's keenness, to read Alice's moods in {{the most}} {{colourless}} wording of her notes. She was rather apt to write him notes, taking back or reaffirming the effect of something that had just passed between them. Her note were tempered to varying degrees of heat and cold, so fine <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> have felt the difference, but sensible to him in their subtlest intention.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{may tell}} you," [...] Father Ignacio said, [...] "that for these terms you are indebted solely to this English officer. Had it {{depended}} upon us only, rest assured <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> of you <b>would</b> have gone away alive." ...|$|R
50|$|The story, however, {{has been}} viewed with scepticism by some historians, {{pointing}} out that the German chronicler Jacob von Stählin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>would</b> have documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link. However, the story may still, in part, contain some grain of truth.|$|R
