5|$|From late 1918, {{the ships}} {{were used to}} escort convoys part-way across the Atlantic. In late September, Minnesota struck a naval mine laid by the German U-boat U-117, causing serious damage <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> out of service for five months. Convoy duty was cut short by the German {{surrender}} in November; thereafter, the Connecticuts were used to ferry American soldiers back from the battlefields of France. This work was completed by mid-1919. The ships briefly operated as training ships in the early 1920s, though {{under the terms of}} the Washington Naval Treaty, they were all sold for scrap by 1924 and broken up.|$|E
5|$|Horizon Zero Dawn is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} video game developed by Guerrilla Games {{and published by}} Sony Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 4 and released in early 2017. The plot revolves around Aloy, a hunter and archer {{living in a world}} overrun by robots. Having been an outcast her whole life, she sets out to discover the dangers <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> sheltered. The character uses ranged weapons and a spear and stealth tactics to combat the mechanised creatures, whose remains can be looted for resources. A skill tree provides the player with new abilities and passive bonuses. The game features an open world environment for Aloy to explore, divided into tribes that hold side quests to undertake, while the main story guides her across the entire map.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after she}} entered service, Minnesota joined the Great White Fleet for its circumnavigation {{of the globe}} in 190809. The years from 1909 to 1912 were uneventful, but {{thereafter}} the ship began {{to become involved in}} conflicts in the Caribbean. She supported efforts to put down an insurrection in Cuba in 1912 and patrolled the coast of Mexico in 191314 during the Mexican Revolution. In 1916, the ship was placed in reserve, though she quickly returned to service when the United States entered World War I in April 1917. During the war, she trained naval personnel; while cruising off the eastern coast of the United States in September 1918, she struck a naval mine laid by a German U-boat. The extensive damage required lengthy repairs <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> out of service {{for the rest of the}} war. She helped to return American soldiers from Europe in 1919 before resuming her training ship duties in 192021, before being decommissioned in December 1921 and broken up for scrap at the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1924.|$|E

25|$|In 1911 both of {{her parents}} and Howard Pyle died and Elizabeth Shippen Green was married to Huger Elliott. Oakley had a project in Harrisburg, the state capitol, <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> away from Cogslea for {{extended}} periods. Smith had a 16-room house and studio that she called Cogshill built on property near Cogslea. She lived in what was her final home with Cozens, her aunt, and her brother.|$|E
25|$|DeShannon {{recorded}} {{many other}} singles that encompassed teen pop, country ballads, rockabilly, gospel, and Ray Charles-style soul that didn't fare {{as well on}} the charts. During these years it was her songwriting and public profile rather than her recording career <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> contracted to Liberty. DeShannon dated Elvis Presley and formed friendships with The Everly Brothers and Ricky Nelson. She also co-starred and sang with Bobby Vinton in the 1964 teen surf movie Surf Party.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, Krieger {{returned}} to Germany for the 2011–12 Bundesliga season. Her first appearance {{for the team}} since the previous March was on August 21, 2011 against SGS Essen. She subsequently made 18 appearances for the team between August and December, three of those appearances {{being a part of}} the Frauen DFB–Pokal. In January 2012, Krieger sustained a serious knee injury while with the United States national team <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> off the pitch {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

25|$|After {{completing}} {{her part}} of the correspondence, Stone went to Illinois to visit a brother. Within days of her arrival, he died of cholera and Stone was left to settle his affairs and accompany his pregnant widow back east. Fearing she {{might not be able}} to return for three months, she wrote to Davis asking her to take charge of issuing the call. The call began appearing in September, with the convention date pushed back one week and Stone's name heading the list of eighty-nine signatories: thirty-three from Massachusetts, ten from Rhode Island, seventeen from New York, eighteen from Pennsylvania, one from Maryland, and nine from Ohio. While the call began circulating, Stone lay near death in a roadside inn. Having decided not to tarry in the disease-ridden Wabash Valley, she had begun a stage coach trek back across Indiana with her sister-in-law, and within days contracted typhoid fever <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> bed-ridden for three weeks. She arrived back in Massachusetts in October, just two weeks before the convention.|$|E
25|$|Upon Jutta's {{death in}} 1136, Hildegard was {{unanimously}} elected as magistra {{of the community}} by her fellow nuns. Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be Prioress, which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence {{for herself and her}} nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to Rupertsberg. This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of Archbishop Henry I of Mainz. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness <b>that</b> <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery. Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where Volmar served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at Eibingen.|$|E

60|$|I {{leave you}} to draw your {{conclusion}} from what I have related. My own {{faith in the}} reality of the apparition is immovable. I say, and believe, <b>that</b> Jeromette <b>kept</b> <b>her</b> word with me. She died young, and died miserably. And I heard of it from herself.|$|R
