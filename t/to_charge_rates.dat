40|$|Recent {{changes in}} the {{economic}} regulation of the for-hire trucking industry in Ontario (Truck Transportation Act, 1988) have provided a new opportunity to investigate the associated impacts of deregulation or regulatory reform. Two main areas of concern are the overall <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels for trucking service and the <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels for shipments involving small remote communities. To investigate these areas of concern, the makeup of shipment revenues {{before and after the}} initiation of regulatory reform is analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the variation in intraregional shipment <b>charge</b> <b>rates</b> with respect <b>to</b> commodity type as well as the size and remoteness of the communities involved. The results of the multivariate analysis indicate that the overall <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels have not declined in the majority of industry sectors examined. With respect <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>rate</b> levels for small communities, the basic question concerns the existence of cross-subsidization. This can occur when carriers, 'obliged' to serve remote communities under regulation, subsidize shipments to such areas from revenues earned in busier markets. The analysis of data in this paper provides evidence that cross-subsidization was present in some sectors of the industry but not in others. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1840, {{money was}} {{urgently}} {{needed for a}} new burial ground near St Nicholas' Church. A poorly supported public vote supported the Vestry's proposal for a 3% rate; but Wagner's opponents {{set up a meeting}} to examine whether the decision was legal and to organise a petition to Parliament demanding the abolition of the Church rate as [...] "unjust in principle ... a violation of the rights of conscience and a continual source of discord ... in this parish". Captain Pechell delivered this petition himself after another meeting in March 1841 when a 2% rate was sought for work at St Peter's Church. Although this rate was voted in, events at the next meeting in October 1841 led to [...] "the most notorious incident of Wagner's incumbency". At this meeting, another 1% rate was voted out; but in response to a claim by one of Wagner's opponents that it was illegal <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>rates</b> for [...] "laying out a burial ground and embellishments to a church" [...] (for which purposes the March 1841 rate was levied), the money raised was removed from the parish accounts and the money could not be spent. Accordingly, when the clock on St Peter's Church stopped in November 1841, it was not re-wound because the allocated money was not available. The Vestry stated that as the clock benefited everybody, its maintenance should be met by public funds—the Church rate. This was unpopular with the public, and Wagner began to face criticism and [...] "petty persecution". On 15 January 1842, in response to mockery by a group of boys, he chased one into a house, reprimanded him and hit him with his riding crop. Although the boy's mother supported the vicar's actions, his father sought to prosecute Wagner for assault, and he was recommended to solicitor Sidney Bennett—one of Wagner's fiercest opponents. He insisted on a summons being issued, and Wagner appeared in front of the magistrates on 20 January 1842. The bench was made up of a mixture of his supporters and opponents, including Isaac Wigney who led proceedings. Wagner was fined £2 (instead of the £5 sought by Bennett), and the incident affected Wagner's reputation in Brighton {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{charging}} rates {{negatively affect}} {{the lifetime of}} lithium-ion cells by increasing cell resistance and reducing capacity. This work is a post-mortem study of 18650 -type cells subjected <b>to</b> <b>charge</b> <b>rates</b> of 0. 7 -, 2 -, 4 -, and 6 -C. For cells charged at 0. 7 -C to 4 -C, this performance degradation is primarily related to surface film thickness with no observable change in surface film chemical composition. However, at charge rates of 6 -C, the chemical composition of the surface film changes significantly, suggesting that this change {{is the reason for}} the sharper increase in cell resistance compared to the lower charge rates. In addition, we found that surface film formation was not uniform across the electrode. Surface film was thicker and chemically different along the central band of the electrode “jelly roll”. This result is most likely attributable to an increase in temperature that results from non-uniform electrode wetting during manufacture. This non-uniform change further resulted in active material delamination from the current collector owing to chemical changes to the binder for the cell charged at 6 -C...|$|E
