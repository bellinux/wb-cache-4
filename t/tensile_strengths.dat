2500|$|Tensile {{strength}} {{represents the}} ability for a geomembrane to resist tensile stress. [...] Geomembranes are most commonly tested for tensile strength using one of three methods; the uniaxial tensile test described in ASTM D639-94, the wide-strip tensile test described in ASTM D4885-88, and the multiaxial tension test described in ASTM D5617-94. [...] The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the test specimens. [...] Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under uniaxial stress conditions. [...] During the wide-strip test the sample is restrained laterally while the middle portion is unrestrained. [...] The multiaxial tensile test provides a plane stress boundary condition {{at the edges of}} the sample. [...] A typical range of <b>tensile</b> <b>strengths</b> in the machine direction are from 225 to 245lb/in for 60-mil HDPE to 280 to 325lb/in for 80-mil HDPE.|$|E

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy were used to investigate the influencing mechanism of the microstructure of crystallites of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) -based carbon fibers on <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> The {{results show that the}} crystallinity, the degree of graphitization, the degree of crystallites structural disorder and the crystallite size have obvious effects on <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> The larger the crystallinity and the degree of graphitization,the larger the tensile strength; the smaller the degree of crystallites structural disorder, the larger the tensile strength; the larger the crystallite size, the smaller the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength.</b> Comparing T 300 with T 700, the increment of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> which is caused by the increase of the crystallinity and the degree of graphitization, and the decrease of the degree of crystallites structural disorder, is larger than the decrement of <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> which is caused by the increase of the crystallite size.

40|$|AbstractThe tensile {{behaviour}} of soil plays {{a significantly}} {{important role in}} various engineering applications. Compacted soils used in geotechnical constructions such as dams and clayey liners in waste containment facilities can suffer from cracking due to tensile failure. In order to increase soil <b>tensile</b> <b>strength,</b> discrete fibre reinforcement technique was proposed. An innovative tensile apparatus was developed to determine the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> characteristics of fibre reinforced soil. The effects of fibre content, dry density and water content on the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> were studied. The {{results indicate that the}} developed test apparatus was applicable in determining <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of soils. Fibre inclusion can significantly increase soil <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> and soil <b>tensile</b> failure ductility. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> basically increases with increasing fibre content. As the fibre content increases from 0 % to 0. 2 %, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> increases by 65. 7 %. The <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of fibre reinforced soil increases with increasing dry density and decreases with decreasing water content. For instance, the <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> at a dry density of 1. 7  Mg/m 3 is 2. 8 times higher than that at 1. 4  Mg/m 3. It decreases by 30 % as the water content increases from 14. 5 % to 20. 5 %.
