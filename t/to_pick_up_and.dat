The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to fish for eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles. Men and children would traditionally leave their catch on the shore for women <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> take back to the village.|$|E
5|$|Various {{courtship}} behaviours {{have been}} observed among mecopterans, with males often emitting pheromones to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion to the female. Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> place the female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids vibrate their wings or even stridulate while approaching a female.|$|E
5|$|Developers {{working on}} Oblivion focused on {{providing}} a tighter storyline, with fewer filler quests and more developed characters. The developers {{sought to make}} information in the game world more accessible to players, making the game easier <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> play. Oblivion features improved AI (courtesy of Bethesda's proprietary Radiant AI), improved physics (courtesy of the Havok physics engine), and impressive graphics, taking advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines like high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools {{in the creation of}} Oblivions terrain, leading to landscapes that are more complex and realistic than those of past titles, with less of a drain on Bethesda's staff.|$|E

5|$|Kirby's Dream Land was {{designed}} by Masahiro Sakurai, who intended {{it to be a}} simple game that could be easy <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> play even by those unfamiliar with action games. For more advanced players, he offered additional optional challenges such as an unlockable hard mode and the ability to edit Kirby's maximum HP and starting number of lives. Kirby's Dream Land has been re-released on the Nintendo 3DS via the Virtual Console in 2011 and {{was also one of the}} games included in the compilation game Kirby's Dream Collection for the Wii, released to celebrate Kirby's 20th anniversary.|$|E

50|$|Example: The pool {{contains}} Ace, 2, 2, 4 and 10 {{in varying}} suits.

25|$|Before the {{introduction}} of pillar boxes, in the UK, it was customary to take outgoing mail to the nearest letter-receiving house or post office.

25|$|Although the SAM {{supported}} commerce, by arranging products by type {{rather than}} by brand it helped visitors compare features and prices. The Salon organizers tried to impose some degree of uniformity on the display stands, but there was naturally competition by the vendors to attract attention through taller and more original stands. To counteract this, all displays had to meet standards and be approved by a committee. There was some social segregation. The displays of inexpensive small items in the basement from 1956 tended to be fairly chaotic, with visitors able <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> examine the products, while the booths upstairs showing the larger and more expensive items were calmer and more elegant.|$|E
25|$|During a {{study of}} the bat's diet, {{examination}} of droppings showed that it can also gather prey items from the ground. The diet was found mostly to consist of large Diptera (flies) but Trichoptera (caddisfly), Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, ants and hoverflies) and Arachnida (spiders and harvestmen) were also commonly eaten. The remains of other prey items occasionally found in the droppings included Lepidoptera (moths), Coleoptera (beetles), Hemiptera (bugs), Dermaptera (earwigs) and Chilopoda (centipedes). This bat may use its interfemoral membrane to catch prey and the fringing hairs may have a sensory function. It has been shown that it can land on the ground <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> pursue invertebrates that are active at night, and continues to emit search signals in order to locate them precisely.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} common effectors is the gripper. In its {{simplest}} manifestation, it consists of just two fingers which can open and close <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> let go of a range of small objects. Fingers can for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire run through it. Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand. Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand. Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.|$|E
25|$|Starship Titanic is {{a graphic}} {{adventure}} game played from a first-person perspective. The player moves on the eponymous ship by clicking on locations {{indicated by the}} cursor and advancing to the next frame after a blurred transition (although this can be avoided by holding down shift during clicks). The mouse {{can also be used}} <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> store items in your inventory and interact with onscreen objects. In the beginning of the game, the player is given a device called Personal Electronic Thing (PET), which serves as a toolbar {{on the bottom of the}} screen. The PET has five modes: Chat-O-Mat, a text parser through which the player can talk with characters by inputting text; Personal Baggage, the inventory in which the player can add or withdraw items; Remote Thingummy, a set of functions to interact with objects and locations; Designer Room Numbers, which indicates the player's current location; and Real Life, an options menu with settings and a game save/load system.|$|E
