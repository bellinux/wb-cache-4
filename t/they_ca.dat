I will cross them in nothing: they shall never know a sorrow that I can spare them, or a want which I will not satisfy.' He made me put those words in his will, to plead for him when the truth which he had concealed from his children in his lifetime was revealed to them after his death.

40|$|Water {{solubilization}} of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) {{has been}} achieved by functionalizing the SWNT with glucosamine. The grafting of glucosamine to the nanotubes was attained by producing acyl chloride on the carboxylic groups associated with the nanotubes. Subsequently, amide bonds were formed between the glucosamine and the SWNT. This grafting results in solubility of SWNT in water, which ranges from 0. 1 to 0. 3 mg/mL, depending on temperature. Introduction. The solubilization of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) has been a research goal {{for the past few}} years. Having SWNTs in solution opens a large number of possibilities.
