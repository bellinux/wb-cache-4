5|$|A ship {{received}} {{by a pair}} of induction coils hung {{on opposite sides of the}} ship, and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.|$|E
5|$|The Patent Cable Tramway Corporation {{owned the}} rights to the Hallidie {{cable-car}} system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of the cable system.|$|E

5|$|Three {{spin-off}} {{versions of}} Jeopardy! have been created. Rock & Roll Jeopardy! debuted on VH1 in 1998 and ran until 2001; the show centered around post-1950s popular music trivia and was hosted by Jeff Probst. Jep!, which aired on GSN during the 1998–1999 season, {{was a special}} children's version hosted by Bob Bergen and featured various rule changes from the original version. Sports Jeopardy!, a sports-themed version hosted by Dan Patrick, premiered in 2014 on the Crackle digital service and eventually moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> sports network NBCSN in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} caused {{severe damage}} to shipping in Halifax Harbour. A visiting recreational schooner named Larinda was sunk at the wharf beside the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic and a harbour tour ketch Mar was driven ashore in Eastern Passage {{on the opposite}} side of Halifax Harbour. Another harbour tour vessel, the tern schooner Silva, broke from her moorings and caused extensive damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cable</b> Wharf on the Halifax Waterfront. Dozens of smaller yachts were also driven ashore; extensive damage occurred to yacht clubs in the Bedford Basin and Northwest Arm. Dozens of containers were knocked off two container ships at the South End Container Terminal. Wharves on the Halifax and Dartmouth waterfront suffered large amounts of damage and several railcars were washed into the harbour at the Dartmouth railway yard; one of the tracks for the double-track main line was washed out in several places along the Bedford Basin near Millview. Coastal flooding was also reported around Halifax Harbour as a result of the storm surge, although inland flooding was minor as rainfall was not heavy due to Juan's fast forward movement.|$|E

Villareal said the patterns will be inspired by weather patterns, tides, and the volume of traffic on the bridge at any given time.|$|R

25|$|Since 1876, a {{submarine}} cable connected Valparaíso and Lima. Later, {{at the beginning}} of the war, Antofagasta and Iquique became connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable.</b> Both navies tried to take control of the cable or severed it according to its military and naval interests.|$|E

25|$|The tower saddle {{includes}} eyebars for {{the attachment}} of temporary cables that supported four walkways, each a simple suspension bridge (called a catwalk) that allowed access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> spinning mechanism {{and the main}} cable during construction. In several ways similar to a ski lift, additional superior cables carried {{one or more of}} these travelers, wheeled devices that shuttled from one end of the span to the other, pulled by drafting cables manipulated by several winches.|$|E
25|$|Homeland co-creators Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa {{initially}} {{pitched the}} show to networks with the Carrie Mathison character being a rather strait-laced CIA officer.

25|$|In mid-June 2011, {{preparations}} for the spinning of the main cable began by installing the temporary catwalks on the SAS span. Both western catwalks were installed and by mid-August, all four catwalks were installed in place and an approximation of the completed outline of the bridge could then be seen. All four catwalks, the traveler, its suspension cable and the drafting cables and the winches and specialized tracks at the deviation saddles {{had to be in}} place before strand dragging could begin. These catwalks were required for worker's access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> strands for bundling and arrangement as the individual wires are placed.|$|E
25|$|A {{cable car}} is superficially {{similar to a}} funicular, but differs from such a system in that its cars are not {{permanently}} attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> and can stop independently, whereas a funicular has cars that are permanently attached to the propulsion cable, which is itself stopped and started. A cable car cannot climb as steep a grade as a funicular, but many more cars can be operated with a single cable, making it more flexible, and allowing a higher capacity. During the rush hour on San Francisco's Market Street Railway, a car would leave the terminal every 15 seconds.|$|E

Ten of their singles reached the US Top 40, where they are associated with the Second British Invasion of British new wave groups that became popular in the US due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> music channel MTV.

25|$|Some {{microphones}} such as condenser microphones require power. An {{alternative to}} battery power is phantom power, {{which consists of}} direct current applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector, usually a three-pin XLR connector. The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 volts DC, although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.|$|E
25|$|The SM83, ST86 and ST89 {{were not}} subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> and braking issue and were {{therefore}} kept in service. Originally Oslo ordered seventeen SL95s {{and planned to}} keep either the SM83 or the SM91 units. However, the options for another fifteen SL95s was redeemed, allowing all non-articulated trams to be retired. As the SL95 units were delivered, retirement of SM83 commenced in mid 1999. The choice to retire SM83 before SM91 was both that the former were in worse technical condition and that the need to raise the voltage on the tramway to 750 volts. SM91 had proven that it could adapt to such in Gothenburg, an outcome that the SM83 {{could not be sure}} of duplicating.|$|E
25|$|The Cable Car has two cars, which {{start from}} {{opposite}} ends of the line and pass in the middle. They are attached to each other by a 30mm diameter cable, supported by 120 rollers, which runs round a pulley {{at the top of the}} hill. A 185kW 550V DC motor at the top of the hill drives the pulley. The Cable Car is a funicular rather than a true cable car: the cars are permanently attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cable,</b> which stops and starts as required, while a cable car grips and releases a continuously-moving cable. Wheels on the south side of car 1 and the north side of car 2 have double flanges, while the opposite wheels on each car have no flanges, directing the cars to the correct side of the mid-way passing loop at Talavera.|$|E
