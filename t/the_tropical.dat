The warm waters then cause the depression to reach tropical storm strength and the storm was given the name Fern by the National Hurricane Center on September 7.|$|E
5|$|A {{storm of}} {{potentially}} Cape Verde origin was {{detected in the}} Virgin Islands at 1800UTC on August5. Initially moving westward, <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm gradually gained in intensity before making a sharp curve towards the north on August8. The storm continued in a northerly motion before a second curvature brought it in a generally westward direction on August9. Shortly after, <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm reached hurricane intensity as a modern-day Category1hurricane. The hurricane eventually made landfall at peak intensity on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina at 2030UTC on September21. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), equivalent to a modern-day Category2hurricane.

5|$|A westward moving {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} southwestern Caribbean Sea just west of Bluefields, Nicaragua at 1200UTC on September18. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm at 0600UTC. <b>The</b> <b>tropical</b> storm made landfall on the Mosquito Coast of Nicaragua at 1400UTC, with winds of 40mph (65km/h). The cyclone weakened to a {{tropical depression}} over land, but reintensified back to tropical storm strength upon entry into the Gulf of Honduras on September20. The cyclone's northwest motion caused it to make a second landfall near the border of Mexico and British Honduras at 0300UTC on September21 as a slightly stronger system with winds of 50mph (85km/h); {{this would be the}} storm's peak intensity. Over the Yucatán Peninsula, <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm re-weakened, but later intensified once again once it reached the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf, the storm made a gradual curve northward, before making a final landfall near Lafayette, Louisiana at 0900UTC on September24 with winds of 45mph (75km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1002mbar (hPa; 29.59inHg). Once inland, <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclone curved eastward and weakened before dissipating the next day, after becoming absorbed by a frontal boundary.|$|E

5|$|As Tropical Depression Five-E {{approached}} Mexico, the country's government released {{tropical storm}} watches and warnings for {{certain parts of}} the coastline. When <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> depression formed on July 5, the government issued a tropical storm warning from Acapulco to Zihuatanejo. Other interests in the Pacific Ocean were asked {{to keep an eye on}} the developing depression. The morning of July 6, the Mexican government issued a tropical storm watch for Zihuatanejo to Manzanillo. The earlier tropical storm warning remained in effect, for another six hours, when the warning was demoted into a tropical storm watch. On the afternoon of July 6, the government discontinued <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm watch up to Acapulco. The remaining tropical storm watch was discontinued on July 7, after <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> depression had made landfall and began to weaken. The government's weather center also released thirteen tropical cyclone bulletins and four warnings for personal caution.|$|E

5|$|At 2100UTC on August24, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for all of Florida south of the Jupiter Inlet {{on the east coast}} and south of Bonita Springs on the west coast; it also included Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Keys. Early on the next day, <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm watch was upgraded to a warning, while the Florida Keys and the mainland from Ocean Reef to Bonita Springs were placed under a hurricane watch. Further north, {{a tropical}} storm watch was issued from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet. Later on August25, the hurricane watch was switched to a warning, while a separate hurricane watch was issued from Golden Beach southward. At 1500UTC on August25, <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm warning was extended northward to Sebastian Inlet. In addition, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued further north from Sebastian Inlet to Flagler Beach on the east coast and Bonita Springs to Tarpon Springs on the west coast.

40|$|The poleward {{movement}} of a decaying tropical cyclone {{often results in}} a rapidly-moving, explosively-deepening midlatitude cyclone. The re-intensification of <b>the</b> remnant <b>tropical</b> cyclone as an extratropical cyclone depends on the phasing between <b>the</b> decaying <b>tropical</b> cyclone and a midlatitude environment that is favorable for midlatitude cyclogenesis (Klein et al. 2001). Because of the typical rapid translation speed (Jones et al. 2003) of <b>the</b> decaying <b>tropical</b> cyclone, accurate extended-range prediction of the phasing between <b>the</b> remnant <b>tropical</b> circulation and <b>the</b> midlatitude environment into which it is moving is critical.

5|$|Further {{intensification}} was slowed {{because of}} strong wind shear, which caused the storm's center of circulation to be displaced from {{the bulk of}} convection. Due {{to the lack of}} atmospheric steering currents at the time, Odile assumed a slow, meandering course towards the west. Continued wind shear caused <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> storm to become disorganized on September11 before abating, allowing for thunderstorms to rebuild over Odile's circulation center on September12. The relaxed wind shear enabled the growth of intense rainbands encircling <b>the</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclone as well as improved outflow aloft. The following day, Odile quickly attained a large central dense overcast; in accordance with Dvorak-derived satellite intensity estimates, the NHC upgraded the storm to hurricane intensity.|$|E
