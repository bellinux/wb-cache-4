5|$|Narrowly escaping, Mike and Debbie {{travel to}} the police station to report the {{incident}} to Debbie's ex-boyfriend, Deputy Dave Hanson (John Allen Nelson), and his curmudgeonly partner, Deputy Curtis Mooney (John Vernon). The skeptical Mooney believes the story to be a hoax. After taking Debbie home, Mike and Dave return to the woods, only to find the circus tent has vanished, leaving a large crater in its place. They then {{travel to the}} lovers' lane, only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> the cars abandoned and covered in a cotton candy-like substance. Back in town, the klowns arrive and begin capturing townspeople in cocoons using rayguns that resemble toys. Several klowns perform pranks and mock circus acts, all resulting in the deaths of several onlookers.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{there were}} 1,000fishermen missing at sea, despite {{warnings}} {{not to leave}} port. After being presumed lost, 162boats returned to port {{four days after the}} storm, and additional fishermen returned over the succeeding days. However, there were 569fishermen killed or left missing due to lost boats at sea. Many of these fishermen had departed days before the storm, and those that survived had transistors in their boats. Lacking advanced warning, many shrimp farmers in remote villages were swept away by waves. Hundreds of dead bodies were discovered along the shore; after they were identified, the corpses were cremated instead of bringing the bodies into local villages. Most of the fatalities on land were the result of buildings collapsing on people who stayed inside. A ferry crossing the Godavari River sank amid rough waves, killing all 42people on board. Overall, the cyclone killed at least 978people in Andhra Pradesh, with 1,375people listed as missing in January 1997. However, the Red Cross did not expect <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> of the missing bodies, as some were likely washed into the Bay of Bengal. A later report to the Food and Agriculture Organization indicated there were 1,077confirmed deaths, with an unconfirmed death toll as high as 2,760.|$|E

5|$|In October 2009, AV-TEST {{conducted}} {{a series of}} trials on the final build of the product in which it detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 computer viruses, computer worms and software Trojan horses as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 spyware and adware samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits, generating no false-positives. Between June 2010 to January 2013, AV-TEST tested Microsoft Security Essentials 14 times; in 11 out of 14 cases, MSE secured AV-TEST certification of outperforming AV industry average ratings. Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0 was tested and certified on March 2011. The product achieved a protection score of 2.5 out of 6, a repair score of 3.5 out of 6 and a usability score of 5.5 out of 6. Report details show that although version 2.0 was able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> malware samples of the WildList (widespread malware), it was not able to stop all Internet-based attacks because it lacks personal firewall and anti-spam capabilities. In an April 2012 test, version 2.1 achieved scores of 3.0, 5.5 and 5.0 for protection, repair and usability. Version 4.0 for Windows 7 SP1 (x64) was tested in June 2012 and achieved scores of 2.5, 5.5 and 5.5 for protection, repair and usability. In October 2012, the product lost its AV-TEST certification when Microsoft Security Essentials 4.1 achieved scores of 1.5, 3.5 and 5.5 for its protection, repair and usability.|$|E

25|$|In Egypt, Abu Kamil {{extended}} algebra {{to the set}} of irrational numbers, accepting square {{roots and}} fourth roots as solutions and coefficients to quadratic equations. He also developed techniques used to solve three non-linear simultaneous equations with three unknown variables. One unique feature of his works was trying <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> the possible solutions {{to some of his}} problems, including one where he found 2676 solutions. His works formed an important foundation for the development of algebra and influenced later mathematicians, such as al-Karaji and Fibonacci.|$|E

25|$|As {{with higher}} {{dimensional}} unit disk graphs, {{it is possible}} to transform a set of points into their indifference graph, or a set of unit intervals into their unit interval graph, in linear time as measured in terms {{of the size of the}} output graph. The algorithm rounds the points (or interval centers) down to the nearest smaller integer, uses a hash table <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> pairs of points whose rounded integers are within one of each other (the fixed-radius near neighbors problem), and filters the resulting list of pairs for the ones whose unrounded values are also within one of each other.|$|E

25|$|Primary {{physical}} examination is undertaken {{to identify any}} life-threatening problems, after which the secondary examination is carried out. This may occur during transportation or upon arrival at the hospital. The secondary examination consists of a systematic assessment of the abdominal, pelvic, and thoracic areas, a complete inspection of the body surface <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> injuries, and a neurological examination. Injuries that may manifest themselves later, may be missed during the initial assessment, such as when a patient is brought into a hospital's emergency department. Generally, the {{physical examination}} is performed in a systematic way that first checks for any immediate life threats (primary survey), and then taking a more in depth examination (secondary survey).|$|E
25|$|His major prose {{work was}} The History of King Richard the Third, which he {{completed}} in 1619 {{and left in}} rough draft at his death, and which, in 1731, was burnt around the edges in the Cotton library fire. Before that, the work had suffered more serious damage, coming {{into the hands of}} Buck's great-nephew, George Buck, who used it as he did others of Buck's works: he produced manuscript copies that he dedicated to various patrons from whom he sought advancement, passing them off as his own. Gradually he altered the History, cutting it, making it look like something written in his own time, rather than earlier, by deleting names of Buck’s learned contemporaries who had shared sources and viva voce information with him, and altering or deleting documentation of sources, with the details of which, also, his copyist was careless. Finally in 1646 he published a version of the History that was slightly over half the length of the original. A second issue (usually referred to erroneously as a second edition) appeared the next year, leading to the assumption that Buck invented many of his sources. This damaged Buck's scholarly reputation for centuries. The authentic text of Buck's History was not published until 1979; the editor, Arthur Kincaid, was able <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> but seven of the hundreds of sources that Buck had meticulously documented.|$|E

500|$|The messenger, however, {{does not}} reach Romeo and, instead, Romeo learns of Juliet's {{apparent}} death from his servant, Balthasar. Heartbroken, Romeo buys poison from an apothecary {{and goes to}} the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Believing Romeo to be a vandal, Paris confronts him and, in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Still believing Juliet to be dead, he drinks the poison. Juliet then awakens and, finding Romeo dead, stabs herself with his dagger. The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> three dead. Friar Laurence recounts the story of the two [...] "star-cross'd lovers". The families are reconciled by their children's deaths and agree to end their violent feud.

500|$|In March 2008, Dale {{replaced}} Peter Davison in {{the lead}} role of King Arthur in the London West End production of Monty Python's Spamalot at the Palace Theatre. He accepted the role {{because he was a}} fan of Monty Python and considered that [...] "life's too short" [...] for him to have turned down a West End part. Although he has seen all of the shows and the other films, Dale had never seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail (from which Spamalot is [...] "lovingly ripped off") and had to buy a copy to prepare for the role. It was not his first experience in musical theatre because he appeared in a 1984 Australian production of Applause, but Dale found the comic timing of the part to be the hardest task. [...] "On stage, the battle is <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> of the humorous moments and not skip over them.

Also, Lex's curiosity into the symbols (and Clark) leads to a blowout between the two. When Lionel gives Clark a key to {{a room in the}} Luthor Mansion where Lex has been collecting information on Clark's family, Clark informs Lex that their friendship [...] "is over". In season four, Lex replaces his father as LuthorCorp's CEO and turns his attention turns toward finding three ancient stones, which contain the same symbols as those in the cave and on the disc. He fails <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> three stones but suspects that Clark did, and used the stones to find the treasure of knowledge they were supposed to have led to, often having confrontations with Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles). Around this time, Lex's lifestyle of bedding women and then leaving them the next day would catch up to him when one (Cobie Smulders) that he had previously slept with attempts to kill him.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the vast stores of {{information}} made accessible on the web, one hundred critics pointed to a decrease in the desire to recall certain types of information, indicating, they believed, a change in the process of recalling information, as well as the types of information that are recalled. According to Ben Worthen, a Wall Street Journal business technology blogger, the growing importance placed on the ability to access information instead of the capacity to recall information straight from memory would, in the long term, change the type of job skills that companies who are hiring new employees would find valuable. Due to an increased reliance on the Internet, Worthen speculated that before long [...] "the guy who remembers every fact about a topic may not be as valuable as the guy who knows how <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> of these facts and many others". Evan Ratliff of Salon.com wondered if the usage of gadgets to recall phone numbers, as well as geographical and historical information, had the effect of releasing certain cognitive resources that in turn strengthened other aspects of cognition. Drawing parallels with transactive memory — a process whereby people remember things in relationships and groups — Ratliff mused that perhaps the web was [...] "like a spouse who is around all the time, with a particular knack for factual memory of all varieties". Far from conclusive, these ruminations left the web's impact on memory retention an open question.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, Clark {{is forced}} <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>all</b> three stones, {{which results in}} the {{creation}} of the Fortress of Solitude in the season five premiere. There, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to begin his training in order to complete his destiny, but Clark interrupts the training to go back to Smallville, which forces Jor-El to strip Clark of his powers. When Clark is killed in his mortal body in season five's [...] "Hidden", Jor-El resurrects Clark with his powers; as a result, Jonathan's life is traded for Clark's in the episode [...] "Reckoning". Clark's consistent disobedience forces Jor-El to imprison his son in a block of ice in the season seven episode [...] "Blue", but after learning a clone of Clark has returned to Smallville in [...] "Persona", Jor-El frees his son so he can take care of the creature. When Clark thinks a world without him would be better, Jor-El sends Clark to an alternate reality to show him the world would be worse if he did not exist in it. By the start of season nine, Jor-El begins fully training Clark for his ultimate destiny. As part of that training, Jor-El informs Clark he needs to tune his Kryptonian intuition. To do so, Jor-El gives Clark the ability to read people's thoughts, only to take it away at an important moment and force Clark to apply what he has learned about human behavior. A clone of Jor-El is released on Earth in the episode [...] "Kandor", but he is murdered before he can fully reunite with Clark and is only able to share a single moment with his son before dying.|$|E
