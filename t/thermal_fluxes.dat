We are searching for new physical tools in human physiology by employing the <b>thermal</b> <b>fluxes</b> between the body and the environment, and the energy exchange in the body itself. A trial to relate <b>thermal</b> <b>fluxes</b> from the body to the internal disturbances is worked out.

The dependence between <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> level and oil viscosity is established. It is shown that oil viscosity decreases with increase in <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> level.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the absorption coefficient of a transparent slab, which forms the outer layer of a roof/wall, on such factors as average <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> passing/through/a roof/wall, maximum and minimum values of this <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> and the <b>thermal</b> load levelling. It is seen that a non-completely transparent slab (non-zero absorption coefficient) performs slightly better than a completely transparent slab (zero absorption coefficient) for small thicknesses, as far as the average <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> through a roof/wall is concerned. A non-completely transparent slab with an absorption coefficient greater than 3 m- 1 is as effective as a completely transparent slab in introducing thermal load levelling. For both a non-completely transparent slab and a completely transparent slab, maximum, minimum and average values of the <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> increase with increasing thickness. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{procedure}} for structural assessment of tunnel construction during fire is presented. In particular, {{it consists of}} two steps: the first one deals with a realistic evaluation of <b>thermal</b> <b>fluxes,</b> both convective and radiative, for the whole tunnel. In the fires recently occurred in some European tunnels, {{the duration of the}} fire was longer than expected and the produced temperature fields were much more severe than those considered in standard codes. Therefore, such a kind of evaluation is of great importance. As the second step, a simulation of the hygro-thermo-mechanical behaviour of concrete structure will be carried out using <b>thermal</b> <b>fluxes</b> previously calculated as thermal input for a fully coupled code, which considers concrete as a multiphase porous material...|$|E

40|$|Most modern nodal {{methods used}} today {{are based upon}} the {{transverse}} integration procedure in which the multi-dimensional flux shape is integrated over the transverse directions {{in order to produce}} a set of coupled one-dimensional flux shapes. The one-dimensional flux shapes are then solved either analytically or by representing the flux shape by a finite polynomial expansion. While these methods have been verified for most light-water reactor applications, they have been found to have difficulty predicting the large <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> gradients near the interfaces of highly-enriched MOX fuel assemblies. A new method is presented here in which the neutron flux is represented by a non-seperable, two-dimensional, semi-analytic flux expansion. The main features of this method are (1) the leakage terms from the node are modeled explicitly and therefore, the transverse integration procedure is not used, (2) the corner point flux values for each node are directly edited from the solution method, and a corner-point interpolation is not needed in the flux reconstruction, (3) the <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> expansion contains hyperbolic terms representing analytic solutions to the <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> diffusion equation, and (4) the <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> expansion contains a <b>thermal</b> to fast <b>flux</b> ratio term which reduces the number of polynomial expansion functions needed to represent the <b>thermal</b> <b>flux.</b> This new nodal method has been incorporated into the computer code COLOR 2 G and has been used to solve a two-dimensional, two-group colorset problem containing uranium and highly-enriched MOX fuel assemblies. The results from this calculation are compared to the results found using a code based on the traditional transverse integration procedure...|$|R

Among the constructive systems in buildings, fa√ßades are the ones having higher influence on thermal performance in urban spaces. Lime renders are specialized systems which can improve not only the durability of the support but also the thermal properties. According to previous researches, a modification of their radiative properties can reduce <b>thermal</b> <b>fluxes</b> between 24 % and 89 %. In this paper, the influences of the aggregate content in lime pastes, as well as the nature of the aggregates, colour and roughness, on the visible near and medium infrared reflectance are analyzed.

30|$|Figure¬† 4 (b) {{shows that}} the {{relative}} error is large when t is small, e.g., with a value {{in the range of}} [10, 100] at the time 10 ^- 9 s. The reason is that the <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> is still very close to zero (the circuit is hardly heated up) and the numerical error arising from the discretization of the FOM results in numerical noise, which dominates the output of the FOM when the true physical dynamics is small. As Figure¬† 4 (b) shows, the ROM approximates the <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> accurately after the <b>thermal</b> <b>flux</b> dominates the numerical error (t > 2 √ó 10 ^- 7). Therefore, the ROM can not only approximate the true dynamics accurately, but is also robust to the numerical error present in the FOM due to discretization. Furthermore, although the samples are selected within the range [10 ^ 7, 5 √ó 10 ^ 7], Figure¬† 4 (b) {{shows that the}} parametric ROM is valid in a much wider range.|$|R

40|$|Further {{investigations}} an the Kohlestein insulation {{have been}} carried out. The test section was mounted in vertical position. The insulation consists of five carbon rings. During the First experiments in the HD-channel the gaps between the rings caused increased hegt fluxes due to axial pressure gradients and unsymmetrical temperature distributions along the pressure tube.
