25|$|The juniper {{groves of}} Spanish juniper (Juniperus thurifera) {{constitute}} a curious formation that occupies the high heaths and mesetas of the interior, nearly always above 900 metres in altitude. The principal woodlands {{of this type}} are in the Serranía de Cuenca, Sistema Ibérico, Alcarria, Maestrazgo and other mountains of the interior. They do not usually form dense forests, but rather parkland or small woods in meadows. They prefer soils developed over limestone, especially those of an ochre or reddish color and rich in clay, de carácter relicto (<b>Terra</b> <b>rosa,</b> Terra fusca); on occasions, as {{in the region of}} Tamajón (Guadalajara), they also colonize siliceous terrain.|$|E
25|$|Across Israel {{there is}} a wide range of microclimates due to differing soil types and topography. Most areas have {{limestone}} based soils with layers of marl and hard dolomites. The color of the soils range from red <b>terra</b> <b>rosa</b> in Judea and Galilee near Mount Tabor to gray in the mountain ranges stretching from Mount Carmel to Zikhron Ya'akov. Marine sediments are found in the loam soils of the coastal plains and {{at the base of the}} elevated foothills around Binyamina-Giv'at Ada and Latroun. The Golan Heights and parts of the Upper and Lower Galilee regions have significant layers of basalt deposits of clay and tuff created by centuries of volcanic activity and lava flows. Wind blown sediment deposits help create the loess based and alluvial sand soils of the Negev area.|$|E

500|$|The Cabernet grape variety has thriven in {{a variety}} of {{vineyard}} soil types, making the consideration of soil less of concern particularly for New World winemakers. In Bordeaux, the soil aspect of terroir was historically an important consideration in determining which of the major Bordeaux grape varieties were planted. While Merlot seemed to thrive in clay- and limestone-based soils (such as those of the Right Bank regions of the Gironde estuary), Cabernet Sauvignon seemed to perform better in the gravel-based soil of the Médoc region on the Left Bank. The gravel soils offered the benefit of being well drained while absorbing and radiating heat to the vines, aiding ripening. Clay- and limestone-based soils are often cooler, allowing less heat to reach the vines, delaying ripening. In regions where the climate is warmer, there is more emphasis on soil that is less fertile, which promotes less vigor in the vine which can keep yields low. In the Napa Valley wine regions of Oakville and Rutherford, the soil is more alluvial and dusty. Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon has been often quoted as giving a sense of terroir with a taste of [...] "Rutherford dust". In the South Australian wine region of Coonawarra, Cabernet Sauvignon has produced vastly different results from grape vines planted in the region's <b>terra</b> <b>rosa</b> soil– {{so much so that the}} red soil is considered the [...] "boundary" [...] of the wine region, with some controversy from wine growers with Cabernet Sauvignon planted on red soil.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, {{a plethora}} of Japanese heavy metal bands formed. Loudness was formed in 1981 by former Lazy members Akira Takasaki and Munetaka Higuchi. In 1983, they toured the United States and Europe and soon started {{focusing}} more on an international career. In a 1985 deal with Atco Records, Loudness became the first Japanese metal act signed to a major label in the United States. Their albums Thunder in the East (1985), Lightning Strikes (1986) and Hurricane Eyes (1987) reached numbers 74, 64 and 190 on the Billboard chart. Loudness replaced singer Minoru Niihara with American vocalist Michael Vescera in 1988, in an unsuccessful attempt to further their international popularity. Till {{the end of the}} eighties only two other bands, Ezo and Dead End, got their albums released in the United States. In the eighties few bands had a female members, like all-female band Show-Ya fronted by Keiko Terada, and <b>Terra</b> <b>Rosa</b> with Kazue Akao on vocals. In September 1989, Show-Ya's album Outerlimits was released, it reached number 3 in the Oricon album chart.|$|E
50|$|Japanese {{heavy metal}} bands started {{emerging}} in the late 1970s, pioneered by bands like Bow Wow, formed in 1975 by guitarist Kyoji Yamamoto, and Loudness, formed in 1981 by guitarist Akira Takasaki. Although there existed other contemporary bands, like Earthshaker, Anthem and 44 Magnum, their debut albums were released only around the mid eighties when metal bands started getting a major exposure. First oversease live performances were by Bow Wow in 1978 in Hong Kong and at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, as well played at the Reading Festival in England in 1982. In 1983, Loudness toured United States and Europe, and started focusing more on an international career. In 1985, the first Japanese metal act was signed to a major label in the United States. Their albums Thunder in the East and Lightning Strikes, released in 1985 and 1986, peaked at number 74 (while number 4 in homeland Oricon chart), and number 64 in the Billboard 200 charts respectively.

5000|$|The Cockpit Country is pockmarked with steep-sided hollows, {{as much as}} 120 m deep in places, {{which are}} {{separated}} by conical hills and ridges. On the north, the main defining feature is the fault-based [...] "Escarpment", a long ridge that extends from Flagstaff in the west, through Windsor in the centre, to Campbells {{and the start of}} the Barbecue Bottom Road (B10). The Barbecue Bottom Road, which runs north-south, high along the side of a deep, fault-based valley in the east, is the only drivable route across the Cockpit Country. However, there are two old, historical trails that cross further west, the Troy Trail, and the Quick Step Trail, both of which are seldom used [...] and difficult to find.

40|$|The {{deep red}} colours {{observed}} on the topmost portions of cliffs along the Algarve coast {{are due to}} the presence of goethite/haematite pigments dispersed within the predominantly sandy sediments. Chemical and mineralogical analyses of these iron-enriched Pliocene/Quaternary siliciclastic sediments and of samples of <b>terra</b> <b>rosa</b> taken from carstic cavities in neighbouring calcareous terrains indicate the genetic link between these materials on the Algarve coast. The authors suggest that the terra rosas which developed on Tertiary and Mesozoic limestones were transported and deposited on top of sandy sediments cropping in a coastal area of the Algarve, during the period of erosion in Late Pliocene/Early Quaternary times. The distribution of trace elements in these sediments supports the conclusion that the later process of remobilisation and redistribution of the ferruginous pigments {{led to the formation of}} hardpans, globules and crusts.

Processing of samples for microscopic analysis were made using the method of staining with an ink and vinegar solution (Vierheilig et al, 1998) improved on certain points, and the results were interpreted using Mycocalc software.
