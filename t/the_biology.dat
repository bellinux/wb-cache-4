40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{implementation}} of <b>the</b> SSP <b>Biology</b> in five provinces of Kenya and its relationship to the examination system. ^ Procedure. Factors affecting the implementation of <b>the</b> SSP <b>Biology</b> course were identified through relevant literature and interviews with Kenyan educational policy makers. Only <b>the</b> SSP <b>Biology</b> course development and its implementation in Kenya since 1965 - 1980 was examined. ^ <b>The</b> SSP <b>Biology</b> secondary schools were selected utilizing criteria developed by the researcher. The instruments used in collecting data in this study included the following: (1) student questionnaires, (2) teacher questionnaires, (3) interview/questionnaires for educational policy makers and program personnel and (4) personal observations. All the instruments were designed and developed by this researcher. These facets were examined and analyzed: (1) patterns of <b>the</b> SSP <b>Biology</b> course implementation: (i) the teaching method, (ii) objectives, (2) factors affecting the implementation of the course: (i) teacher training, (ii) science equipment, (iii) national examinations and curriculum, and (iv) attitudes towards <b>the</b> SSP <b>Biology</b> course. ^ Findings. The data-collecting instruments revealed several common factors affecting the implementation of <b>the</b> SSP <b>Biology</b> course. First, <b>the</b> positive factors: (1) Congruity between <b>the</b> SSP <b>Biology</b> course objectives and the national exams objectives; (2) High teacher interest in the heuristic teaching method; (3) Generally positive attitudes toward <b>the</b> SSP <b>Biology</b> course. Second, <b>the</b> impediment factors were: (1) Inadequate teacher inservice training in the heuristic method; (2) Inadequate supervision and follow-up of teachers by the Inspectorate; (3) Exams-dominated system pressured teachers to teach to the exams; (4) Inadequate supply of science equipment and curriculum materials; (5) Excessive difficulty of some units and shallowness of other units; (6) Lack of consistent involvement of teachers in the development and revision of the course. ...|$|R

Molloy (1995) reported on the captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis and associated field studies related to factors influencing the distribution of Succinea sp. B. Confusion on snail identification may have affected the results of Thomee's and Aloi's work, but by the time Molloy's study was initiated, the identification problems had been resolved.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on <b>the</b> <b>biology</b> of attachment.

Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>biology</b> of life {{operates}} {{within a}} certain range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{observes that}} there are many spirals in nature, from the horns of {{ruminants}} to the shells of molluscs; other spirals are found among the florets of the sunflower. He notes that the mathematics of these are similar but <b>the</b> <b>biology</b> differs. He describes the spiral of Archimedes before moving on to the logarithmic spiral, which has the property of never changing its shape: it is equiangular and is continually self-similar. Shells as diverse as Haliotis, Triton, Terebra and Nautilus (illustrated with a halved shell and a radiograph) have this property; different shapes are generated by sweeping out curves (or arbitrary shapes) by rotation, and if desired also by moving downwards. Thompson analyses both living molluscs and fossils such as ammonites.|$|E
5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and <b>the</b> <b>biology</b> of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, and the necessity of calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
