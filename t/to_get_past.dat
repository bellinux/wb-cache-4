Alonso passed Rosberg for seventh, and quickly closed in on Heidfeld, but stayed behind him until he pitted on Lap 16. Alonso {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> on Lapfive, but ran wide, giving the position back to the German.

5|$|Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth was {{released}} on October 24, 2005 for the Xbox, and on March 27, 2006 for the PC. The game contains a number of software bugs, which have never been officially patched; these bugs are generally intermittent, and restoring from an earlier saved game can be enough <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> them. There is also an unofficial patch available that fixes some glitches and lowers the game's overall difficulty level. The Xbox version is officially compatible with the Xbox 360 in certain regions.|$|E
5|$|Each club needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> four rounds {{to reach}} the final. Chelsea made {{comfortable}} progress; they scored 12 goals while conceding only one to Wycombe Wanderers in the semi-final. Arsenal fielded a relatively young team throughout the competition; their wins against fellow league opponents Liverpool in the fifth-round and Tottenham Hotspur in the semis were acclaimed by the British press. Chelsea entered the match as favourites and were undefeated against Arsenal in all competitions since 2004.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the race Hamilton, Rosberg and Vettel {{maintained}} their grid positions into the first corner, while Daniil Kvyat managed to overtake team-mate Daniel Ricciardo for fourth. Trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> Nico Hülkenberg on the inside of turn five, Fernando Alonso made contact with Hülkenberg, who hit the wall but was able to continue, though {{at the back of the}} field. Alonso was reprimanded with a five-second penalty to serve at his first pit stop. Meanwhile, Felipe Massa made contact with Pastor Maldonado, damaging his front wing. Massa came into the pit lane for a new wing and equipped the harder tyre compound. Maldonado suffered from brake problems in the early laps, eventually retiring on lap seven.|$|E

5|$|Each club needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> five rounds {{to reach}} the showpiece event at Wembley. Both clubs made {{comfortable}} progress; Luton scored 14 goals and conceded three, Arsenal {{on the other hand}} conceded two fewer. Luton for the final were without Darron McDonough who injured himself in training, but David Preece and Ricky Hill both returned to the side after lengthy periods of treatment. Goalkeeper Les Sealey was not fit in time to play, so Andy Dibble deputised in goal for only his sixth appearance of the season. Gus Caesar replaced David O'Leary in Arsenal's starting eleven, as the Irishman was ruled out for the final having damaged his achilles weeks prior.|$|E
5|$|With the Alabama {{starters}} in {{the game}} for the first possession of the second half, the defense again held the Tigers to a three-and-out and forced a punt. The offense then made it seven-for-seven on offense when McCarron threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to Norwood for a 49–0 lead. The Alabama defense then did not allow Auburn <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> their own 41-yard line {{for the duration of}} the game and secured their fourth shutout of the season. The victory was the second largest in the history of the Iron Bowl after the 55–0 Alabama win in 1948 and improved Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 42–34–1.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{started the}} 1964–65 season on wages of £40 a week, {{and the club}} only agreed to pay £60 a week in December. These miserly wages made it {{difficult}} for the club to spend the £80,000 it received from the sale of Frank McLintock – he had put in a transfer request over dissatisfaction with his pay and quality replacements were reluctant to join a club that paid full internationals like Banks and McLintock no more than the base rate that rival clubs paid to average players. Leicester finished 18th in the league and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Liverpool at Anfield in the sixth round. In the League Cup, City struggled <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> Peterborough United (in a replay), Grimsby Town and Crystal Palace (in a replay), before they recorded an 8–1 victory over Coventry City at Highfield Road. After easing past Plymouth Argyle in the semi-finals, Banks found himself playing in another League Cup final. However Chelsea won the final after successfully defending their 3–2 win at Stamford Bridge with a goalless draw at Filbert Street.|$|E

5|$|In {{his early}} career, {{he played in}} a variety of attacking positions. Although he usually {{operated}} inside the penalty area as a main striker or centre-forward, his wide range of skills also allowed him to play in a more withdrawn role, as an inside forward or second striker, or out wide. In his later career, he took on more of a deeper playmaking role behind the strikers, often functioning as an attacking midfielder. Pelé’s unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. His excellent technique, balance, flair, agility, and dribbling skills enabled him to beat opponents with the ball, and frequently saw him use sudden changes of direction and elaborate feints in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> players, such as his trademark move, the drible da vaca. Another one of his signature moves was the paradinha, or little stop.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 regular season, Parker {{recorded}} similar averages as {{the previous}} two seasons for points and rebounds, and slightly increased his assists per game average.

For the third time in four years, San Antonio prevailed over Phoenix; Parker had an outstanding first round series, averaging nearly 30 points and 7 assists a game. In the next round against Chris Paul's New Orleans Hornets, the Spurs dropped the first two road games before responding with a strong win in the third game. In that game, Parker recorded a double-double with 31 points and 11 assists. The experienced Spurs took seven games to defeat the Hornets, but were unable <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.|$|E

5|$|The players {{acquired}} by Fletcher matured {{into one of}} the strongest teams in the league during the mid-1980s and early 1990s. From 1984–85 to 1990–91, the Flames tallied 90 points in every season but one. However, they were usually unable to transform that success into a deep playoff run, largely because they could not get the better of their provincial rivals, the powerhouse Oilers. Although the Oilers and Flames usually finished at or {{near the top of the}} Campbell Conference, the NHL's playoff structure of the time made it very likely that the Flames would meet the Oilers in either the first or second round, rather than in Campbell Conference finals. That same structure made it very likely that the other two playoff qualifiers in the Smythe Division would have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> the Flames or Oilers (or both) in order to make it to the conference finals. From 1983 until 1990, either the Oilers or the Flames represented the Campbell Conference in the Stanley Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began the}} 2010 MLS season slowly with {{injuries}} to key players that impacted Schmid's starting lineups. The team {{had a record}} of 4–8–3 over the first 15 games.

The 2010 U.S. Open Cup campaign culminated in Schmid winning his third championship with a 2–1 victory over the Crew at Seattle's Qwest Field. No MLS team had previously won back-to-back Open Cups. The Sounders rebounded {{in the second half}} of the regular season with a 10–2–3 record to qualify for the playoffs. The team faced Bruce Arena's Galaxy in the two-legged quarter-final. Both coaches are considered to be among the best in the MLS, and it was the first meeting between the two in the playoffs. The Sounders lost by a 3–1 aggregate and Arena moved within one game of Schmid's MLS postseason record of 19 wins.|$|E
5|$|Vettel drew {{to within}} two-tenths {{of a second}} behind Alonso as the final lap started, and came across Sutil, Hülkenberg, Petrov and Massa; both drivers managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> Petrov, and Alonso {{maintained}} the first position heading into the final sector of the track. The yellow flag for Kovalainen's car meant that Vettel's final chance of an overtake, into the final corner, was denied, and Alonso took the checkered flag on lap61 to win the race, 0.293 seconds ahead of Vettel. Alonso secured the first, and, as of 2015, the only Grand Chelem (leading the entire race from pole position with fastest lap) of his career {{as well as the}} first since Schumacher achieved the feat at the 2004 Hungarian Grand Prix. Webber was third, 1.2 seconds ahead of Button in fourth. Rosberg, Barrichello and Kubica took the next three positions. Sutil held off Hülkenberg in the final sector of the track for eighth and ninth on the line with Massa in tenth. Petrov, Alguersuari, Schumacher and Buemi finished one lap behind Alonso, with di Grassi and Kovalainen (despite his retirement) the last of the classified finishers.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal made a host {{of changes}} before the match {{restarted}} – Gilberto, Robin van Persie and Alexander Hleb were substituted on for Bergkamp, Robert Pirès and Flamini. Robben made a run down {{the right side of}} the pitch, but failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> Senderos in what was the first notable action of the second half. Moments after, Fredrik Ljungberg's attempt on goal was cleared by the Chelsea defence following good play by Van Persie. In the 57th minute Chelsea increased their lead. A long pass found Drogba, who once more held off Senderos in pursuit of the ball. He was forced wide by Lehmann, but on the turn shot the ball through the net to score his second goal of the game. Drogba was then replaced by Hernán Crespo, and Tiago came on for Eiður Guðjohnsen. Arsenal scored in the 64th minute; Ljungberg crossed the ball from the left and Fàbregas evaded the Chelsea defence to slot it past Čech in the goal. Both clubs made mass substitutions in the final third of the game, notably Wright-Phillips coming on for his Chelsea debut in place of Robben. Arsenal continued to push for an equaliser the longer the match went on, which meant they were culpable to Chelsea countering. A free-kick by Van Persie was saved by Čech and it was not until the 86th minute that Henry fashioned his first chance of the half – it too was dealt with by Čech. Chelsea continued to withstand Arsenal’s pressure in injury time and came close to scoring a third goal, but for Touré’s intervention.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a pit road, the race was split into three {{segments}} of 60, 50 and 40 laps so teams can make pit stops and adjustments between each segment, {{and there would be no}} positions gained nor lost during stops. In segment 1, Timothy Peters took the lead from pole-sitter Ken Schrader on lap 15, and led for 23 laps until Kyle Larson took the lead on lap 39, who led for the remainder of the segment. In the final five laps of the segment, the first caution of the race flew for debris, and the beneficiary was Max Gresham, who was the first driver at least a lap down, which allowed him to regain a lap. In the second segment, Larson continued to lead for a total of 50 laps until Austin Dillon passed him on lap 89 after the former collided with Germán Quiroga. One lap later, another caution was flown for debris, and Gresham was again the beneficiary. On lap 116, Jared Landers' truck became loose in turn 2, collected Ty Dillon and made contact with Johnny Sauter. Quiroga was the beneficiary on the resulting caution. Larson and Austin Dillon dueled for the remainder of the race, with Dillon allowing Larson to pass on lap 122, but Dillon managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> Larson on the following lap. Two more cautions for debris (first on the front stretch, the second in turn 4) were eventually flown, and a green–white–checker finish was initiated due to debris in turn 4 on lap 149. Dillon retained the lead on the GWC to win, beating Larson by 1.197 seconds. Behind Dillon and Larson, Ryan Newman finished third, followed by Joey Coulter, Brendan Gaughan, Timothy Peters, Darrell Wallace Jr., Matt Crafton, Dave Blaney and Max Gresham. Sauter (accident) and Jeff Babcock (engine) failed to finish the race.|$|E
5|$|Häkkinen {{retired from}} the race when he slowed and later pulled {{to the side of}} the track with fluid leaking from his engine on lap 14. His {{retirement}} allowed Räikkonen to move into the first points-scoring position of sixth. By lap 15, Montoya had a lead of 8.3 seconds over Ralf Schumacher, who in turn was 3.3 seconds in front of Barrichello. Michael Schumacher was a further 9.2 seconds behind his Ferrari teammate, but was drawing ahead of Coulthard in fifth. Barrichello and Panis were the first drivers to make scheduled pit stops on lap 16. The Ferrari and Williams teams were employing different pit stop strategies – the Ferrari were planning a two stop strategy for Barrichello whereas the Williams team were only planning for one stop. Räikkonen slowed on track with an driveshaft failure but managed to return to the pit lane and retire on the same lap, while Irvine retired with an misfiring engine. Two laps later, Burti lost tenth position after he spun and was passed by Trulli and Panis. Barrichello attempted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>past</b> Coulthard for fourth position on lap 19, but Coulthard moved onto a defensive line to keep the position. Montoya continued to pull away from Ralf Schumacher—setting the race's fastest lap of 1:41.808 on lap 20—to maintain his first position after his one and only pit stop. Barrichello was able to overtake Coulthard at the Agip corner on the same lap.|$|E
