40|$|AbstractHigh Temperature Superconducting (HTS) {{power cable}} {{consists}} of a conducting layer and a shield layer for carrying the required current. Geometrically, <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> and shield layers each have self inductance; and the mutual inductance exists between <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> and shield layers. Therefore, {{the direction of the}} current of shield the layer is opposite that of <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> layer current. <b>The</b> value of the shield layer current is over 95 % of <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> layer current at the steady state. However, if a fault current passes through an HTS power cable, the quench occurs in both <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> and shield layers. After the quench, resistance appears, and the even self inductance values are not changed a great deal, but the mutual inductance value is directly affected. According to the above mentioned processes, the current distribution of <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> and shield layers changes due to the fault current. In this paper, the authors describe the transient state analysis of a real manufactured HTS power model cable, considering both <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> and <b>the</b> shield layers. The manufactured system is coupled with RTDS, in which a utility grid is composed and simulated. These results provide important data for the design of an HTS power cable...|$|R

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{found a way}} to suppress the vortex signal in anisotropic type II superconductors, and measure the London penetration depth directly while applying a magnetic field. Our method requires that the sample is placed in the coil of a tunnel diode oscillator with the oscillating magnetic field oriented perpendicular to <b>the</b> most <b>conducting</b> layers. In this orientation the penetration depth is measured in <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> planes. <b>The</b> key to our method is to orient the applied dc magnetic field parallel to <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> layers. Often, <b>the</b> applied magnetic field needs to be aligned better than a degree. Depending on the anisotropy of the superconductor, the vortices parallel to <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> layers will be large and weak because they will reside in <b>the</b> least <b>conducting</b> planes of <b>the</b> sample. The rf field will try to move the vortices in the direction perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> planes, but in this direction <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> planes will intrinsically pin the vortices reducing any vortex related penetration depth signal to zero. However, the vortices will still be able to move {{in and out of the}} sample with no effects of intrinsic pinning by moving parallel to <b>the</b> <b>conducting</b> planes. A good example proving that our method removes the effects of vortices is the case of κ-(ET) 2 Cu(NCS) 2. Figure 1 shows the penetration depth signal as a function of angle.
