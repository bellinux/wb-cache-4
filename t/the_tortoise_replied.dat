50|$|In Classical {{times the}} story was annexed to a {{philosophical}} problem by Zeno of Elea in one of many demonstrations that movement is impossible to define satisfactorily. The second of Zeno's paradoxes is that of Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise,</b> in which <b>the</b> hero gives <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> a head start in a race. The argument attempts to show that even though Achilles runs faster than <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise,</b> he will never catch up with her because, when Achilles reaches {{the point at which}} <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> started, <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> has advanced some distance beyond; when Achilles arrives at the point where <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> was when Achilles arrived at the point where <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> started, <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> has again moved forward. Hence Achilles can never catch <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise,</b> no matter how fast he runs, since <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> will always be moving ahead.|$|R
25|$|In {{the paradox}} of Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>tortoise,</b> Achilles is in a footrace with <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b> Achilles allows <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> a head start of 100 meters, for example. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some {{constant}} speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to <b>the</b> <b>tortoise's</b> starting point. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> has run a much shorter distance, say, 10 meters. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b>|$|R

He is always coming nearer, but he never makes up to it."[44] ...|$|R
5000|$|In a race, {{the quickest}} runner can never {{overtake}} the slowest, since the pursuer must first {{reach the point}} whence the pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead. - as recounted by Aristotle, Physics VI:9, 239b15 In the paradox of Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>tortoise,</b> Achilles is in a footrace with <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b> Achilles allows <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> a head start of 100 meters, for example. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 meters, bringing him to <b>the</b> <b>tortoise's</b> starting point.

It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, by which time <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles arrives somewhere <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> has been, he still has some distance to go before he can even reach <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b> Therefore, because there are {{an infinite number of}} points Achilles must reach where <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> has already been, he can never overtake <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Tortoise</b> then asks Achilles {{whether a}} second kind of reader might exist, who accepts that A and B are true, but {{who does not}} yet accept the {{principle}} that if A and B are both true, then Z must be true. Achilles grants <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> that this second kind of reader might also exist. <b>The</b> <b>Tortoise,</b> then, asks Achilles to treat <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> as a reader of this second kind. Achilles must now logically compel <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> to accept that Z must be true. (<b>The</b> <b>tortoise</b> is a reader who denies the argument form itself; the syllogism's conclusion, structure, or validity.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In Douglas Hofstadter's GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach, {{there is}} a {{narrative}} between Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> (characters borrowed from Lewis Carroll, who in turn borrowed them from Zeno), and within this story they find a book entitled [...] "Provocative Adventures of Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> Taking Place in Sundry Spots of the Globe", which they begin to read, <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise</b> taking <b>the</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>Tortoise,</b> and Achilles taking the part of Achilles.

60|$|The {{argument}} is, let Achilles run {{ten times}} as fast as <b>the</b> <b>tortoise,</b> yet if <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> has <b>the</b> start, Achilles will never overtake him. For suppose them to be at first separated by an interval of a thousand feet: when Achilles has run these thousand feet, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> will have got on a hundred; when Achilles has run those hundred, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> will have run ten, and so on forever: therefore Achilles may run forever without overtaking <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b>|$|R

Then the jackal kicked him out of the way, and went to the well and began to drink, but {{scarcely}} had he touched the water, than <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> seized him by the leg.

2500|$|For a long time, {{the idea}} that such a {{potentially}} infinite summation could produce a finite result was considered paradoxical by mathematicians and philosophers. This paradox was resolved using {{the concept of a}} limit during the 19th century. Zeno's paradox of Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> at <b>the</b> beginning of <b>the</b> race, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> is at a third position, and so on. Zeno concluded that Achilles could never reach <b>the</b> <b>tortoise,</b> and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> is given by a series. [...] The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b>|$|R
60|$|We can now {{understand}} why Zeno believed that Achilles cannot overtake <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> and why {{as a matter}} of fact he can overtake it. We shall see that all the people who disagreed with Zeno had no right to do so, because they all accepted premises from which his conclusion followed. The argument is this: Let Achilles and <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> start along a road at the same time, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> (as is only fair) being allowed a handicap. Let Achilles go twice as fast as <b>the</b> <b>tortoise,</b> or ten times or a hundred times as fast. Then he will never reach <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b> For at every moment <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> is somewhere and Achilles is somewhere; and neither is ever twice in the same place while the race is going on. Thus <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> goes to just as many places as Achilles does, because each is in one place at one moment, and in another at any other moment. But if Achilles were to catch up with <b>the</b> <b>tortoise,</b> <b>the</b> places where <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> would have been would be only part of the places where Achilles would have been. Here, we must suppose, Zeno appealed to the maxim that the whole has more terms than the part.[16] Thus if Achilles were to overtake <b>the</b> <b>tortoise,</b> he would have been in more places than the tortoise; but we saw that he must, in any period, be in exactly as many places as <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b> Hence we infer that he can never catch <b>the</b> <b>tortoise.</b> This argument is strictly correct, if we allow the axiom that the whole has more terms than the part. As the conclusion is absurd, the axiom must be rejected, and then all goes well. But there is no good word to be said for the philosophers of the past two thousand years and more, who have all allowed the axiom and denied the conclusion.|$|R

5000|$|Zeno himself also {{discusses}} {{the notion of}} what he calls [...] "Achilles and the tortoise". Suppose that Achilles is the fastest runner, and moves at a speed of 1 m/s.

Common sense seems to decree that Achilles will catch up with <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> after exactly 1 second, but Zeno argues {{that this is not the}} case. He instead suggests that Achilles must inevitably come up to the point where <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> has started from, but by the time he has accomplished this, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> will already have moved on to another point. This continues, and every time Achilles reaches the mark where <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> was, <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> will have reached a new point that Achilles will have to catch up with; while it begins with 0.9 metres, it becomes an additional 0.09 metres, then 0.009 metres, and so on, infinitely. While these distances will grow very small, they will remain finite, while Achilles' chasing of <b>the</b> <b>tortoise</b> will become an unending supertask. Much commentary has been made on this particular paradox; many assert that it finds a loophole in common sense.|$|R
