50|$|In 1981, Summers began private medical {{practice}} in Arcadia, California.

He discovered that <b>tacrine</b> was readily absorbed by oral administration and did enter the central nervous system, An intravenous treatment for a chronic disease is not a practical treatment. An oral preparation of <b>tacrine</b> was a potentially practical treatment for Alzheimer’s. Safety experiments were done in animal models. In 1984, it was inconceivable that a dementia patient could improve on a short or long term basis. Thus, psychometric scales had to be developed and validated.|$|E

50|$|Morphine-N-oxide (genomorphine) is {{an active}} opioid {{metabolite}} of morphine. Morphine itself, in trials with rats, acts 11-22 times more potent than morphine-N-oxide subcutaneously and 39-89 times more potent intraperitoneally. However, pretreatment with amiphenazole or <b>tacrine</b> increases the potency of morphine-N-oxide in relation to morphine (intraperitoneally {{more so than in}} subcutaneous administration). A possible explanation is that morphine-N-oxide is rapidly inactivated in the liver and impairment of inactivation processes or enzymes increases functionality.|$|E

5000|$|Thomas et al. {{worked on}} a group of enzyme systems, were able to achieve {{monitoring}} and direct analysis of enzyme-catalyzed reaction by DIOS-MS [...] One famous result was the reaction of acetylcholineesterase (AChE) with acetylcholine producing choline.This approach gained more fame when showed the ability to detect the selectivity of different enzyme inhibitors. The study started with hyperzine A, <b>tacrine,</b> and 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl-N-butylcarbamate, which are all inhibitors of AChE. The Inhibitor constant (ki) value of each of the inhibitors was found to be an important factor of their inhibition potentials. DIOS-MS has another advantage over MALDI, it can detect additional information in the low-mass region of mass spectrum as it can detect peptide peaks, and also identify post-translation modifications. These capabilities have great applications in protein identification with more confidence.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, {{extensive}} research {{is occurring in}} the field of nanoparticle drug delivery systems to the brain. One of the common diseases being studied in neuroscience today is Alzheimer's disease. Many studies have been done to show how nanoparticles {{can be used as a}} platform to deliver therapeutic drugs to these patients suffering from the disease. A few Alzheimer's drugs that have been studied especially are rivastigmine, <b>tacrine,</b> quinoline, piperine, and curcumin. PBCA, chitosan, and PLGA nanoparticles were used as delivery systems for these drugs. Overall, the results from each drug injection with these nanoparticles showed remarkable improvements in the effects of the drug relative to non-nanoparticle delivery systems. This possibly suggests that nanoparticles could provide a promising solution to how these drugs could cross the BBB. One factor that still must be considered and accounted for is nanoparticle accumulation in the body. With long-term and frequent injections that are often required to treat chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, polymeric nanoparticles could potentially build up in the body, causing undesirable effects. This area for concern would have to be further assessed to analyze these possible effects and to improve them.|$|E
50|$|The current {{treatment}} for AD symptoms are acetylocholinesterase inhibitors and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonists. Based {{on the current}} literature on AD pharmacology research, analyzing differentially expressed genes in drug-drug, disease-disease, and drug-disease models allow discovery of novel pharmaceutical agents that potentially treat more than AD symptoms. Analytical tool such as Connectivity Map (cMap) was utilized in drug-disease interaction from publicly available microarray data. Gene signatures from the cMap-based interpretation showed that common anti-AD drugs (<b>tacrine,</b> donepezil, galantamine, memantine, and rivastigmine) were not listed in the final drug list. Rather, other compounds that inhibit downstream effectors of cell proliferation, Wnt and insulin pathways, epigenetic modifications, and cell cycle regulation were among the top in the final anti-AD drug list. These findings further supported the fact that AD is a disease of degeneration and growth dysregulation. In fact, the final list of anti-AD drugs, obtained from analyzing microarray datasets and cMap drug-disease model contained the common effector of AD and diabetes - glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3-an enzyme that {{has been found to}} be related to hyperphosphorylation of tau protein) - confirmed the link between the two diseases. Further pathway and network interpretation of genes obtained from AD microarray datasets using KEGG, WikiPathways, Reactome, Biocarta, and NetworkAnalyst showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptors were strongly associated with pathogenesis of AD. EGFR is a transmembrane protein and a member of the HER/ErbB receptor family that share a common pathway with insulin receptors (Ras/Raf/Mak and PI3K/Akt). Furthermore, amyloid protein precursor (APP) was found to be indirectly related based on network analysis. Aβ (one of the diagnostic findings of AD) activates EGFR and inhibition of the receptor improved memory disorders in Aβ-overexpressed drosophila. Drugs that block GSK3 were found to be affecting PI3K/Akt pathway, demonstrating that EGFR could be a new target for pharmaceutical agent in treating AD.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} value of serum {{measurements}} of <b>tacrine</b> hydrochloride and its metabolite in predicting risk of adverse reaction in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The study was an outpatient-based controlled clinical trial. Study subjects were 35 female and 31 male patients who were receiving 50 to 150 mg <b>tacrine</b> hydrochloride per day. RESULTS: Serum concentration of <b>tacrine</b> hydrochloride and ratio of <b>tacrine</b> hydrochloride to metabolite were significantly higher in the 45 patients with symptomatic adverse effects (p < 0. 001). The <b>tacrine</b> hydrochloride to metabolite ratio was significantly higher (p < 0. 05) in the 30 patients in whom abnormal liver function developed, but concentration of <b>tacrine</b> hydrochloride was not significantly higher. Women showed {{a higher incidence of}} adverse effects (p < 0. 05), and <b>tacrine</b> hydrochloride concentrations were higher (p < 0. 05). <b>Tacrine</b> hydrochloride concentration and <b>tacrine</b> hydrochloride to metabolite ratio were higher in both men and women in whom adverse effects developed. CONCLUSION: <b>Tacrine</b> hydrochloride concentration is valuable in predicting the development of adverse effects, and its measurement may improve the use of the drug...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} {{the mechanisms of}} gastrointestinal side effects of <b>tacrine,</b> and find treatment methods with electroacupuncture (EA). Methods. Twenty-five healthy cats were randomly divided into 5 groups: gastric-distention group (model group), <b>tacrine</b> group (cholinesterase inhibitor), <b>tacrine</b> + sham acupoint group (control group), <b>tacrine</b> + PC 6 (neiguan) group, and <b>tacrine</b> + ST 36 (zusanli) group, with 5 cats in each group. Saline 2 [*]mL i. p. was given 30 [*]min before gastric distention in model group. <b>Tacrine</b> 5. 6 [*]mg/kg i. p. was given 30 minutes before gastric distention in the other groups. <b>Tacrine</b> + sham acupoint group (control group), <b>tacrine</b> + PC 6 group, and <b>tacrine</b> + ST 36 group received EA at corresponding acupoints during gastric distention. The frequency of TLESRs and LESP were recorded by using a perfused sleeve assembly. Results. Compared with the model group, <b>tacrine</b> significantly increased the frequency of gastric distention-induced TLESR (P< 0. 05) but did not influence the rate of common cavity during TLESR. <b>Tacrine</b> significantly increased the LESP, which could not remain during gastric distention. EA at PC 6 could decrease the frequency of TLESR and maintain the increase of LESP, but EA at ST 36 did not have these effects. Conclusion. <b>Tacrine</b> can significantly increase the gastric distention-induced transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations (TLESRs). Electroacupuncture (EA) at PC 6 may reverse the above side effect...|$|E
40|$|KEY WORDS Alzheimer disease; cholinesterase inhibitors; sodium channels; tetrahydroacridine (tacrine); myocardium; patch-clamp {{techniques}} AIM: To {{study the}} effects of tetrahydroacridine (<b>tacrine)</b> on voltage-gated Na+ channels in cardiac tissues. METHODS: Single ventricular myocytes were enzymatically dissociated from adult guinea-pig heart. Voltage-dependent Na+ current was recorded using whole cell voltage-clamp technique. RESULTS: (1) <b>Tacrine</b> reversibly inhibited Na+ current with an IC 50 value of 120 µmol/L (95 % confidence range: 108 - 133 µmol/L). (2) The inhibitory effects of <b>tacrine</b> on Na+ current exhibited both a tonic nature and use-dependence. (3) <b>Tacrine</b> at 100 µmol/L caused a negative shift (about 10 mV) in the voltage-dependence of steady-state inactivation of Na+ current, and retarded its recovery from inactivation, but did not affect its activation curve. (4) Intracellular application of <b>tacrine</b> significantly inhibited Na+ current. CONCLUSION: In addition to blocking other voltage-gated ion channels, <b>tacrine</b> blocked Na+ channels in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes. <b>Tacrine</b> acted as inactivation stabilizer of Na+ channels in cardiac tissues...|$|E
40|$|We used single-channel kinetic {{analysis}} {{to study the}} inhibitory effects of <b>tacrine</b> on human adult nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. Single channel recording from cell-attached patches revealed concentration- and voltage-dependent decreases in mean channel open probability produced by <b>tacrine</b> (IC 50 4. 6 μM at − 70 mV, 1. 6 μM at − 150 mV). Two main effects of <b>tacrine</b> were apparent in the open- and closed-time distributions. First, the mean channel open time decreased with increasing <b>tacrine</b> concentration in a voltage-dependent manner, strongly suggesting that <b>tacrine</b> acts as an open-channel blocker. Second, <b>tacrine</b> produced {{a new class of}} closings whose duration increased with increasing <b>tacrine</b> concentration. Concentration dependence of closed-times is not predicted by sequential models of channel block, suggesting that <b>tacrine</b> blocks the nAChR by an unusual mechanism. To probe tacrine's mechanism of action we fitted a series of kinetic models to our data using maximum likelihood techniques. Models incorporating two <b>tacrine</b> binding sites in the open receptor channel gave dramatically improved fits to our data compared with the classic sequential model, which contains one site. Improved fits relative to the sequential model were also obtained with schemes incorporating a binding site in the closed channel, but only if it is assumed that the channel cannot gate with <b>tacrine</b> bound. Overall, the best description of our data was obtained with a model that combined two binding sites in the open channel with a single site in the closed state of the receptor...|$|E
40|$|Effects of the cholinesterase inhibitors <b>tacrine</b> and bis(7) <b>tacrine</b> (0. 25 - 20 mu mol/kg, s. c.) on {{locomotor}} {{activity and}} passive-avoidance response were investigated in mice treated with scopolamine (SCP, 1 or 5 mu mol/kg, i. p.), using an open-field test and step-through task with a 24 -hour retention interval. Drugs were given 30 min {{prior to the}} first session. During the acquisition session, SCP treatment increased the locomotor activity (10 - 16 %). <b>Tacrine,</b> but not bis(7) -tacrine, cotreatment significantly reduced the locomotor activity by 23 or 27 %, {{when compared with the}} SCP-treated control mice. In the step-through task, <b>tacrine</b> or bis(7) -tacrine coadministration dose-dependently attenuated {{the increase in the number}} of footshocks (by 50 or 58 %) in SCP-treated mice. The lowest dose of <b>tacrine</b> and bis(7) -tacrine for prolonging the retention latency (up to 500 %) in SCP-treated mice was 5 and 1 mu mol/kg, respectively. <b>Tacrine</b> and bis(7) -tacrine inhibited brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity 15 min (but not 30 min) after the drug administration in mice. At the same dose of 20 mu mol/kg, the bis(7) -tacrine-induced AChE inhibition in serum was 14 -fold higher than that of <b>tacrine.</b> The results indicated that bis(7) -tacrine was less potent than <b>tacrine</b> in causing motor dysfunction. However, bis(7) -tacrine was more potent than <b>tacrine</b> in the cognitive enhancement of SCP-induced memory loss and in AChE inhibition. Copyright (C) 2009 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
