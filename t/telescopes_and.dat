5|$|Planetary {{science is}} the study of the {{assemblage}} of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets. The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> then later by spacecraft. This has provided a good overall understanding of the formation and evolution of this planetary system, although many new discoveries are still being made.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, Gascoigne {{developed}} a device, {{known as an}} optical corrector plate, which allowed wide field photography on the new 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring. Such corrector plates were subsequently used on many <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> became known as Gascoigne correctors. During this period he was also active in supporting {{the establishment of a}} national research organisation for astronomers, the Astronomical Society of Australia. It held its first meeting in 1966, and Gascoigne was made its first vice-president.|$|E

40|$|The {{observations}} were taken {{as part of}} a coordinated observing campaign which was designed to study flares on the dMe star YZ CMi. The campaign also included rapid spectral time sequences in the optical (using the 3. 9 m Anglo-Australian <b>Telescope)</b> <b>and</b> UV (using the GHRS aboard the Hubble Space <b>Telescope</b> <b>and</b> the IUE satellite) and radio observations taken with the Australia <b>Telescope</b> <b>and</b> VLA. The goal was to investigate the physical characteristics of the flares in different temperature regimes with a time resolution which is high enough to investigate the dynamics of the events...|$|R

The entire event was also photographed by Earth-based <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> orbital observatories, including the Hubble, Chandra, Spitzer, and XMM-Newton. The impact was also observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board Europe's Rosetta spacecraft, which was about 80millionkm (50millionmiles) from the comet {{at the time of}} impact. Rosetta determined the composition of the gas and dust cloud that was kicked up by the impact.|$|E
5|$|Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, {{but a small}} {{minority}} experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional <b>telescopes,</b> <b>and</b> also the use of radio telescopes. The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s. A number of amateur astronomers use either homemade telescopes or use radio telescopes which were originally built for astronomy research but which are now available to amateurs (e.g. the One-Mile Telescope).|$|E
5|$|The disks of most {{stars are}} much too small in angular size to be {{observed}} with current ground-based optical <b>telescopes,</b> <b>and</b> so interferometer telescopes are required to produce images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation. By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the Moon (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's angular diameter can be computed.|$|E

5|$|These {{criteria}} {{restricted the}} field of potential target areas. It was decided that the target should be in Hubble's 'continuous viewing zones' (CVZs)—the areas of sky which are not occulted by the Earth or the moon during Hubble's orbit. The working group decided {{to concentrate on the}} northern CVZ, so that northern-hemisphere telescopes such as the Keck telescopes, the Kitt Peak National Observatory <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> the Very Large Array (VLA) could conduct follow-up observations.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 20th century astronomers {{increasingly}} {{turned to}} computer-controlled <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> CCDs for hunting supernovae. While such systems are popular with amateurs, there are also professional installations such as the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope. Recently the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) project has begun using a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the Milky Way galaxy. Neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova, and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk.|$|E
5|$|With {{advent of}} {{automated}} <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> improvements in spectroscopes, {{a number of}} collaborations {{have been made to}} map the Universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the large-scale structure of the Universe. The Great Wall, a vast supercluster of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.|$|E

5|$|The {{observatory}} {{was originally}} built by Worchester R. Warner and Ambrose Swasey, owners of Warner & Swasey Company, which made precision instruments and telescopes {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries. They became trustees of the Case School of Applied Science (later renamed to Case Institute of Technology), and built an observatory in East Cleveland, which they gave to the school in 1919. This original observatory building was located on Taylor Road four {{miles east of the}} university campus and housed a 9.5-inch refractor, and was dedicated in 1920. The building was designed by the firm of Walker and Weeks. In subsequent years the observatory grew to house several more <b>telescopes</b> <b>and</b> instruments, such as the 24-inch Burrell Schmidt telescope, as well as an astronomical library and public lecture hall.|$|E
