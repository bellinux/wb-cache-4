5|$|Brown partnered the {{recovered}} Barnes and patiently scored 140, {{before being}} the fifth man {{out with the}} score at 344, as Australia amassed 456 and defeated Derbyshire by an innings immediately after the Fourth Test. Looking to regain his <b>Test</b> <b>position</b> by sheer weight of runs, Brown started slowly; Barnes made 24 of the first 29 runs. He took 185 minutes to reach 50, much to the displeasure of the restless spectators, before accelerating and scoring his next 50 runs in 37 minutes.|$|E

He then took 9/70 to cut down Mumbai for 184, and his batting colleagues accumulated the 55 needed for victory without loss. Kartik then took 3/82 and 1/45 against Madhya Pradesh to secure his spot in the Test team.|$|E
5|$|At only 21 Kydd was the {{youngest}} player on the tour of Jamaica and, while she toured with {{the remainder of the}} team, was overlooked for a <b>Test</b> <b>position.</b> She finally made her full début against South Africa not long afterwards, and managed to cement her position with a superb performance, managing an accuracy rate of 94% in the third Test. This performance, along with similar form in the national league, led to her selection in the starting squad for the 2003 Netball World Championships. She played every game in the world championships in July at the expense of ageing veteran Eloise Southby, a decision which was the cause of some controversy. She subsequently helped the Kestrels to the elimination final and, {{at the end of the}} season, was named as the team's new vice-captain, with predecessor Janine Ilitch assuming the captaincy. She also won the coveted Commonwealth Bank Trophy Player's Player Award, and tied for third in the Most Valuable Player count.|$|E

40|$|Function of the {{shoulder}} complex is highly dependent {{on the relationship between}} the scapula and the humerus. Etiologies for the disruption of the glenohumeral relationship include impaired or abnormal scapular function, motion, or position. The lateral scapular slide test (LSST) has been developed as a clinical tool to assess this phenomenon, also known as scapular dyskinesis. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the validity of the LS ST by comparing the clinical measurements on the skin surface to the actual anatomical distance between the scapula and the spine as seen on radiographic images. The secondary purpose of this study was to determine the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the LSST. Nine subjects (18 shoulders) were assessed with the clinical LSST and radiographic images in three <b>test</b> <b>positions</b> (0 °. 45 °. and 90 ° of glenohumeral abduction). Comparison of the clinical LSST measurements with the radiographs revealed the LSST to be valid (> 0. 80) in only the 0 ° and 45 ° <b>test</b> <b>positions</b> with respective Pearson correlation values of 0. 91 and 0. 98.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his <b>Test</b> <b>position,</b> and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball instead of doing so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E
5|$|He {{started his}} career as a bowling all-rounder. He made his Test debut in 1907, {{primarily}} as a left arm orthodox spinner who was considered to be a useful lower-middle order right-hand batsman. As Macartney was initially selected for his flexibility, his position in the batting order was frequently shuffled and he was largely ineffective. His most noteworthy Test contribution in his early career was a match-winning ten wicket haul at Headingley in 1909, before being dropped in the 1910–11 Australian season. It was around this time that Macartney befriended Trumper and began to transform himself from a bowler who batted in a defensive and technically correct manner, into an audacious attacking batsman. He reclaimed his <b>Test</b> <b>position</b> and made his maiden Test century in the same season, before establishing himself as the leading batsman in the team.|$|E
5|$|He was {{selected}} for the 1953 tour of England, and scored 76 against Tasmania before the tourists departed. Despite making only 35 runs at 7.00 in the lead-up matches, Tallon {{was selected}} for the First Test at Trent Bridge, his first match at the top level {{in more than two}} years. He took two catches and scored a duck and 15. Hassett and his deputy Arthur Morris then made the decision to replace Tallon with Langley. Still troubled by stomach ulcers, Tallon played in another eight first-class matches for the tour, scoring 119 runs at 19.83. His most notable effort was an unbeaten 83 in an innings win over Kent. He was unable to regain his <b>Test</b> <b>position.</b>|$|E

He broke through for his first first-class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales, {{but it was not}} enough to prevent an innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, but this was not enough for him to regain his <b>Test</b> <b>position.</b> He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{returned}} to Australia and led New South Wales to the Sheffield Shield title in 1953–54. He topped the Australian first-class batting averages with 71.10, but had his poorest {{season with the}} ball, taking only 16wickets at 38.75. The season was purely domestic with no touring side and therefore no Test matches. The season was also a transition point in Australian cricket, as Hassett retired upon return to Australia. Initially, Morris and Miller were the two frontrunners for the captaincy. Miller was the state captain, but Morris was the vice-captain of the Test team ahead of Miller. At the time, Johnson had been dropped from the Australian team, but inherited the Victorian captaincy from Hassett, who accused him of not trying. Hassett told Johnson that he could become Test captain if he regained his form and his <b>Test</b> <b>position.</b> As the outgoing captain, Hassett was believed to have an influence over the selection of his successor. Miller had also criticised Hassett in his book, and there was talk that Hassett was upset about Miller's departure from South Melbourne and Victoria. Johnson {{returned to}} form with 45wickets at 22.75 for the season.|$|E
5|$|Having {{missed a}} season due to {{national}} service and university studies, Craig returned to first-class cricket in 1955–56, earning {{a place in}} the 1956 Ashes touring squad. Craig regained a <b>Test</b> <b>position</b> for the final two Tests of the series. After the series, at which point Australia had suffered three consecutive Ashes series defeats, captain Ian Johnson and vice-captain Keith Miller retired. The selectors focussed on young players to rebuild the team, appointing Craig as the captain for the 1957–58 tour of South Africa, although he had played just six Tests and was not an established member of the team. Aged 22years and 194days, Craig was, at the time, the youngest captain in Test history and led a team that critics dismissed as having no chance to a convincing 3–0 victory; his own batting form was poor, and he averaged less than 20. He contracted hepatitis {{before the start of the}} 1958–59 season and withdrew from cricket. Although he returned the following season for New South Wales, he could not regain his Test place. He retired from first-class cricket at the age of just 26: work commitments as a pharmacist increasingly restricted his ability to train. In later life, Craig was the managing director of the Australian subsidiary of the British pharmaceutical firm Boots. He had a continued involvement with cricket as an administrator, working with the New South Wales Cricket Association, the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust and the Bradman Museum. Craig was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1997 for his service to cricket.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{methods have}} been {{developed}} {{over the last decade}} to predict allelic identity at unobserved loci between pairs of chromosome segments along the genome.

A criterion based on a simple measure of matrix distance was used to study the relation between LD and allelic identity prediction when using haplotypes. The consistency of this criterion with the accuracy of QTL localization, another criterion commonly used to compare AIP, was evaluated on a set of real chromosomes. For this set of chromosomes, the criterion was consistent with the mapping accuracy of a simulated QTL with either low or high effect. As measured by the matrix distance, the best AIP for QTL mapping were those that best captured LD between a <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> and a QTL. Moreover the matrix distance between a <b>tested</b> <b>position</b> and a QTL was shown to decrease for some AIP when LD increased. However, the matrix distance for AIP with continuous predictions in the [0, 1] interval was algebraically proven to decrease less rapidly up to a lower bound with increasing LD in the simplest situations, than the discrete predictor based on identity by state between haplotypes (IBS hap), for which there was no lower bound.

25|$|After his unconvincing {{performances}} {{with the}} bat in the South African Tests, Simpson needed runs {{at the start}} of the 1958–59 season to retain his position in the national team for the Ashes series against England. His first two matches of the season were for Western Australia and a Western Australia Combined XI against the Englishmen, and he scored 60 and 17. In three further Shield matches, he continued his habit of not converting starts into larger scores, registering scores of between 31 and 67 in all six innings with three half-centuries. Up to this point, he had scored 364 runs at 52.00, and Simpson was selected for the Australian XI match against May's Englishmen, effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests. He failed in both innings with two and a duck, and the hosts were crushed by 345 runs. Simpson was overlooked for selection for the First Test at Brisbane against England. Norm O'Neill, who had scored 1,003 runs at 83.75 in the previous season, while Simpson was in South Africa, took his middle-order position. Peter Burge failed in the First Test, resulting in Simpson's recall for the Second Test at Melbourne. Simpson made a duck in his only innings as Australia won by eight wickets and was subsequently omitted for the remainder of the series. At the time, Australia had three all rounders who were capable with the bat:Ken Mackay, Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson. This meant that Australia needed only five specialist batsmen and in the Fifth Test of the series, only four were used in order to accommodate an extra bowler. Simpson was facing heavy competition for a <b>Test</b> <b>position.</b> Simpson scored 91 runs in four innings in the remainder of the season, which was not enough for him to force his way back into the Test team.
