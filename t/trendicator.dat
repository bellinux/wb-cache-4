40|$|The {{objective}} is to familiarize students with steady and unsteady heat transfer by conduction and with the effect of thermal conductivity upon temperature distribution through a homogeneous substance. The elementary heat conduction experiment presented is designed for associate degree technology students in a simple manner to enhance their intuition and to clarify many confusing concepts such as temperature, thermal energy, thermal conductivity, heat, transient and steady flows. The equipment set is safe, small, portable (10 kg) and relatively cheap (about $ 1200) : the electric hot plate 2 kg (4. 4 lb) for $ 175 : the 24 channel selector and Thermocouple Digital Readout (<b>Trendicator)</b> 4. 5 kg (10 lb) for about $ 1000; the three metal specimens (each of 2. 5 cm diameter and 11 cm length), base plate and the bucket all about 3 kg (7 lb) for about $ 25. The experiment may take from 60 to 70 minutes. Although the hot plate surface temperature could be set from 90 to 370 C (maximum of 750 watts) {{it is a good}} practice to work with temperatures of 180 to 200 C (about 400 watts). They may experiment in squads of 2, 3 or even 4, or the instructor may demonstrate it for the whole class...|$|E
30|$|We have {{previously}} deposited Ti/Pt as thin inking films on the silicon substrate to facilitate adhesion of the ZnO films. It {{has been found}} that a substrate temperature of 100  °C, target/substrate distance of about 70  mm, very low gas pressures of 3.35 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 Torr in a mixed argon gas atmosphere and for an oxygen content of 20 %, giving to ZnO thin films a good homogeneity and high crystallinity. The thickness measurements of the samples were taken using a DEKTAK_ST high-resolution profilometer. We measured 2.8 – 3  μm ZnO thin films on samples. We confirmed these thicknesses by the determination of the optical properties. Indeed, the optical properties are a function of the thickness. To do this, we consider that the two envelopes of the measured optical transmittance form a nonlinear system consisting of continuous functions that can be solved by iteration. These continuous functions are the refractive index and the absorption percentage. After deposition of the zinc oxide, silver dot electrodes were evaporated on the Pt/ZnO/Ti/Pt/Si sample using an electron gun evaporation system to render the structure metal–insulator–semiconductor useful for electrical measurements. These were carried out in a vacuum chamber evacuated at about 10 − 3  Torr. Measurements of frequency and temperature dependencies of conductivity and capacity were taken using a laboratory configuration for the AC-based electrical test properties. The samples obtained were tested using an alternating current in the frequency range from 5  Hz to 13  MHz (using a capacitance bridge technique) using measurement temperatures of Tp[*]=[*] 30 – 300  °C, with a Hewlett-Packard LF 4192 A impedance analyzer between silver points and Pt electrode bottom. The temperature was measured with a Doric thermometer (<b>Trendicator</b> 400  K/ °C). To appreciate the nature of our piezoelectric ZnO layers, we determined the coupling coefficient of the complete structure based on frequencies for which the conductance is maximum and the minimum susceptance using a network analyzer (HP 8752 A Network Analyzer) whose pass-band ranges from 300  kHz to 1.3  GHz. This type of device is one of the instruments to define with precision the characteristics of an electric circuit (impedance measurement, electrical admittance, reflection coefficient, etc.).|$|E
