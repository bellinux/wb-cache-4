She {{played the role of}} a prostitute, working by choice. Bhatt called her performance [...] "stunning" [...] and reported that when shooting ended, she was [...] "on the point of a breakdown" [...] as she was [...] "exhausted battling with <b>the</b> <b>nitty-gritty</b> of a whore's character". She next played Barkha, a single woman who abandons her premarital daughter upon birth, in Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai. In Shashilal K. Nair's Angaar, a crime drama based on the life of an underworld don, she played Mili, a homeless orphan collected by an unemployed man, played by Jackie Shroff. Angaar received positive reviews from critics, as did Kapadia's performance, but it was financially unsuccessful, which Meena Iyer of The Times of India—who called it [...] "one of the most engaging mafia films to have come out of Bollywood"—attributed to its dark proceedings.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with several {{commenting on the}} honesty of the work. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Life offers much more than vicarious thrills. It captures the true spirit of rock and roll, <b>the</b> <b>nitty-gritty</b> {{of life on the}} road, and just {{what it feels like to}} be a heroin addict who doesn't know where his next fix is coming from. It also movingly captures Richards' extraordinary love of music—an even more powerful addiction for him than smack—and perhaps more surprisingly, his manifest destiny as a human being." [...] Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in [...] "Life" [...] defies almost every public perception about him." [...] In The Independent, John Walsh commented, [...] "He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox. But the watchwords of this book are honesty, confessionalism, telling it straight." ...|$|E

Do we love Clifford Geertz (1926 - 2006) because he put Java (and Bali) on the {{scholarly}} map with his well-written books that appealed to a large audience? Or do we hate him because his Agricultural Involution (1963) was such a travesty of Java’s economic and social history of the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries? Geertz has been praised and imitated by many scholars who worked on areas other than Java but vilified by most Java scholars. Personally, we, the authors, are inclined to applaud him for drawing our attention to Java as a nice case study of the possible linkages between population growth and the high rates of labor absorption in wet-rice cultivation.

500|$|In practice, Tudor monarchs used {{patronage}} {{to maintain}} a royal court that included formal {{institutions such as the}} Privy Council as well as more informal advisers and confidants. Both {{the rise and fall of}} court nobles could be swift: although the often-quoted figure of 72,000 executions during his reign is inflated, Henry did undoubtedly execute at will, burning or beheading two of his wives, twenty peers, four leading public servants, six close attendants and friends, one cardinal (John Fisher) and numerous abbots. Among those who were in favour at any given point in Henry's reign, one could usually be identified as a chief minister, though one of the enduring debates in the historiography of the period has been the extent to which those chief ministers controlled Henry rather than vice versa. In particular, historian G. R. Elton has argued that one such minister, Thomas Cromwell, led a [...] "Tudor revolution in government" [...] quite independent of the king, whom Elton presented as an opportunistic, essentially lazy participant in <b>the</b> <b>nitty-gritty</b> of politics. Where Henry did intervene personally in the running of the country, Elton argued, he mostly did so to its detriment. The prominence and influence of faction in Henry's court is similarly discussed in the context of at least five episodes of Henry's reign, including the downfall of Anne Boleyn.|$|E

The crux of our argument is that, on threat of otherwise ceasing to be recognized as a self, all of us must satisfy at least two conditions.

The second is that selves must also somehow remain the same, lest all notions of moral responsibility and any commitment to an as yet unrealized future become nonsensical.

Here, the perceived threat of six anomalies to an existing research lineage depended on perspective, or Kuhnian paradigm. The ambiguous status of anomalies sharpens the problem of Kuhnian incommensurability. But the details of the historical case also indicate a possible solution. The asymmetric organization of multiple anomalies strongly indicated interparadigm disagreement, and thus how to orient discourse and frame evidence. I briefly extend the results of this historical case analysis to Darwin's synthesis and to gendered bias in craniology, to profile their prospective generality. In developing the workshop's theme, I want to focus on how history can offer empiricial data on philosophical questions. Philosophical may offer epistemological, or normative, aims [...] the “whys”. History, however, answers the epistemic, or descriptive, questions [...] the “hows ” of sceintific practice.
