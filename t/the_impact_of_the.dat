Hence, this study estimates <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DDA that will finally reach an agreement sooner or later. For estimating <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DDA, this study makes a dairy trade model for the Korean dairy industry and measures <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DDA in terms of raw-milk price for fluid use incurred by further tariff cuts in the Korean dairy market by the DDA.
