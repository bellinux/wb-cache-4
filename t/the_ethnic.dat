5|$|Although {{there were}} {{periodic}} attempts at reconciliation between the Metropolia and the Russian Church {{over the next}} few decades, no serious progress was made. During this time, <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> character of the Metropolia began to change.

As a result, <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> makeup of the Metropolia began to shift away from a purely Slavic one that had included mainly Russians, Ukrainians, Galicians, and Rusyns.|$|E

5|$|Sin Po {{first went}} into print in 1910 and began gaining {{momentum}} {{as the leading}} advocate of Chinese political nationalism in 1917. <b>The</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese who followed its stream of thought refused any involvement with local institutions and would only participate in politics relating to mainland China. A second stream was later formed by wealthy ethnic Chinese who received an education at Dutch-run schools. This Dutch-oriented group wished for increased participation in local politics, Dutch education for <b>the</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese, and the furthering of ethnic Chinese economic standing within the colonial economy. Championed by the Volksraad's Chinese representatives, such as Hok Hoei Kan, Loa Sek Hie and Phoa Liong Gie, this movement gained momentum and reached its peak with the Chung Hwa Congress of 1927 and the 1928 formation of the Chung Hwa Hui party, which elected Kan as its president.

40|$|This study aims to {{describe}} the forms of and responses to racial hegemony and <b>the</b> Afro-American <b>ethnic</b> group’s self-identity in Hughes’s poems. It employed the qualitative descriptive approach. The data sources were Hughes’s poems entitled “I, Too, Sing America”, “Let America be America Again”, and “Theme for English B”. The data were analyzed {{by means of the}} postcolonialism theory, enriched by historical, socio-cultural, and political information during the post-civil-war era till 1960 s in the United States of America. The findings are as follows. First, racial hegemony appears {{in the form of the}} negative stereotype of <b>the</b> Afro-American <b>ethnic</b> group. <b>The</b> negative stereotype leads to the marginalization of <b>the</b> Afro-American <b>ethnic</b> group, reflected by the injustice and tyranny by <b>the</b> majority <b>ethnic</b> group. Second, responses to racial hegemony are manifested in <b>the</b> Afro-American <b>ethnic</b> group’s awareness of dignity, self-esteem, and self-confidence as foundations to demand equality and to show their existence amid <b>the</b> white people <b>ethnic</b> group’s domination. Third, <b>the</b> pride of <b>ethnic</b> identity is actually a potential to realize Amerian ideals as a nation highly respecting equality and diversity as aspired by the founding fathers...|$|R
