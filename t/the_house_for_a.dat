She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest houses to accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, when Roddenberry {{was twelve}} years old, {{the family moved to}} 4906 Monte Vista in the shadow of Mount Washington, and he began {{attending}} Luther Burbank Junior High School. This was the house that Roddenberry would later describe as his childhood home. His father helped the boys obtain local jobs; Gene worked as a newspaper delivery boy and as a gas station attendant on Saturdays, and after school. The young Roddenberry moved to Franklin High School during the middle years of the Great Depression. His father was relatively unaffected by the Great Depression because of his stable employment with the police department. The family distributed food to friends and family who were in need. Glen's parents and her younger sister Willodean moved into <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time before finding other accommodation in Redondo Beach. During his time at Franklin, Roddenberry joined the Varsity Debate Team and {{was a member of the}} Authors Club under Mrs. Virginia Church. He graduated in 1939.|$|E

These glasses are turned when there is a division; one of the four-minute glasses is turned and the bells will ring and the clocks will flash green for the House of Representatives or red for the Senate for four minutes. After the hour glass stops, the house's attendants will lock the doors and the whips will count the votes. Members vote by either moving to the government side of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vote for a bill or the opposition side for a vote against a bill. If there is a division soon after another division, the middle hour glass will be turned and the bells will ring for two minutes.|$|E
500|$|The exact {{sequence}} of events which led to Van Gogh's mutilation of his ear is not known. Gauguin claimed, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour. Their relationship was complex, and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially. It seems likely that Van Gogh had realised that Gauguin was planning to leave. The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House. Gauguin reported that Van Gogh followed when Gauguin left <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> walk, and [...] "rushed towards me, an open razor in his hand". This account is uncorroborated; Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely in a hotel.|$|E

By 1922, the Fitzgeralds had employed a nurse for their daughter, a couple to clean their house, and a laundress.

Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily.

500|$|The {{house was}} ready for {{occupancy}} in 1934 and was used by many tenants, but the Ames sold {{the house to the}} Connecticut College in 1949. Sometime after its completion, Winslow Ames and his family lived in <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brief period. From 1949 to 1987, the college used it for faculty housing. One of the tenets, Mary Kent, lived in the house with her husband and three children from 1958 through 1961. Throughout its life the original furnace, kitchen cabinets, plumbing fixtures were replaced, but the core module has retained its purpose. The house fell into a state of disrepair, becoming an [...] "eyesore". By 1989, the college was concerned with the asbestos in the building and obtained a permit to demolish the house; the college intended to use the land for a boathouse. After its restoration was completed, the Connecticut College uses the house as an office and for meeting rooms.|$|E
500|$|Fearing that {{he would}} be killed, Lenin and fellow senior Bolshevik Grigory Zinoviev then escaped Petrograd in disguise, {{relocating}} to a house in Razliv owned by Bolshevik metalworker Nikolai Yemelyanov. Concerned about being discovered, they soon left <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rural thatchet hut, where they were plagued by mosquitos and torrential rain. It was here that Lenin began work on the book that became The State and Revolution, an exposition on how he believed the socialist state would develop following the proletarian revolution, and how from that point on the state would gradually wither away leaving a pure communist society. The book also represented an attack on other Marxist and far left groups which did not share his embrace of violence as the primary means of achieving proletarian revolution, an attitude that he blamed on the influence of Kautsky. At this point he also dramatic altered his approach to the soviets, declaring them to be counter-revolutionary for their support of the Provisional Government, which he now lambasted as a [...] "military dictatorship". He began arguing for a Bolshevik-led armed insurrection to topple the government, although at a clandestine meeting of the party's central committee this idea was rejected. Lenin then headed by train and by foot to Finland, arriving at Helsinki on 10 August, where he hid away in safe houses belonging to Bolshevik sympathisers. Due to this geographical isolation, Lenin was unable to attend the party's sixth congress, held in secret during July and August.|$|E
500|$|In 1930, upon {{learning}} of Aiello's continued plotting against him, Capone resolved to finally eliminate him. In {{the weeks before}} Aiello's death Capone's men tracked him to Rochester, New York, where he had connections through Magaddino, and plotted to kill him there, but Aiello returned to Chicago before the plot could be executed. Aiello, angst-ridden from the constant need to hide out and the killings of several of his men, set up residence in the Chicago apartment of Unione Siciliana treasurer Pasquale [...] "Patsy Presto" [...] Prestogiacomo at 205 N. Kolmar Ave. He moved in on October 13, 1930, and rarely left the apartment. However, {{his wife and child}} occasionally visited him, and Frank Nitti biographer Mars Eghigian Jr. theorized that Capone's forces located Aiello by tracking his family members. Men who gave the names Morris Friend and Henry Jacobson rented rooms in an apartment across the street overlooking Prestogiacomo's apartment building and began observing Aiello. On October 23, Aiello made plans to permanently leave Chicago and apparently move to Mexico, although Prestogiacomo later told police Aiello was simply leaving <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> barber's appointment. Upon exiting Prestogiacomo's building to enter a taxicab, a gunman in a second-floor window across the street started firing at Aiello with a submachine gun. Aiello was said to have been shot at least 13 times before he toppled off the building steps and moved around the corner, attempting {{to move out of the}} line of fire. Instead, he moved directly into the range of a second submachine gun positioned on the third floor of another apartment block, and was subsequently gunned down.|$|E

500|$|Sandra {{normally}} {{went out}} with her boyfriend, John Hankins, on Thursday nights, but had decided to change her night off and thus, had seen him the previous day. The two last spoke on the telephone at about 8:00pm on 7November. After putting the younger children to bed, at about 8:55pm she asked Veronica if she would like a cup of tea, before heading downstairs to the basement kitchen to make one. As she entered the room, she was bludgeoned {{to death with a}} piece of bandaged lead pipe. Her killer then placed her body into a canvas mailsack. Meanwhile, wondering what had delayed her nanny, Lady Lucan descended from the first floor to see what had happened. She called to Rivett {{from the top of the}} basement stairs and was herself attacked. As she screamed for her life, her attacker told her to [...] "shut up". Lady Lucan later claimed at that moment to have recognised her husband's voice. The two apparently continued to fight; she bit his fingers, and when he threw her face down to the carpet, managed to turn around and squeeze his testicles, causing him to release his grip on her throat and give up the fight. When she asked where Rivett was, Lucan was at first evasive, but eventually admitted to having killed her. Terrified, Lady Lucan told him she could help him escape if only he would remain at <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few days, to allow her injuries to heal. Lucan walked upstairs and sent his daughter to bed, then went into one of the bedrooms. When Veronica entered, to lie on the bed, he told her to put towels down first to avoid staining the bedding. Lucan asked her if she had any barbiturates and went to the bathroom to get a wet towel, supposedly to clean Veronica's face. Lady Lucan realised her husband would be unable to hear her from the bathroom, and made her escape, running outside to a nearby public house, the Plumbers Arms.|$|E
