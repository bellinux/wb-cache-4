50|$|Although planets can {{sometimes}} be mistaken for stars as one observes the night sky, the planets actually change position from night to night in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> Retrograde (backward) and prograde (forward) are observed as though <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> revolve around <b>the</b> Earth. Ancient Greek astronomer Ptolemy in 150 AD believed that the Earth {{was the center of}} the Solar System and therefore used the terms retrograde and prograde <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> movement of the planets in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> Although it is known today that the planets revolve around the sun, the same terms continue to be used in order <b>to</b> describe <b>the</b> movement of the planets in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> as they are observed from Earth. Like the sun, <b>the</b> planets appear <b>to</b> rise in <b>the</b> East and set in the West. When a planet travels eastward in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> it is called prograde. When the planet travels westward in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> (opposite path) it is called retrograde.|$|R
5|$|Although {{a planet}} {{has yet to}} be {{directly}} observed around Vega, the presence of a planetary system can not yet be ruled out. Thus there could be smaller, terrestrial planets orbiting closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> The inclination of planetary orbits around Vega is likely to be closely aligned to the equatorial plane of this star. From the perspective of an observer on a hypothetical planet around Vega, the Sun would appear as a faint 4.3 magnitude star in the Columba constellation.|$|E
5|$|As {{she does}} not expect to see it, Izzi asks Tom to finish {{the outcome of the}} story for her.

In the 26th century, future space {{traveler}} Tommy travels there for the event, in a spaceship made of an enclosed biosphere containing the Tree of Life he seeded above her grave.|$|E
5|$|At the DFL {{endorsement}} convention, Schiff came {{in third}} place behind Mark Andrew and Hodges {{during the first two}} rounds of voting but was denied a place on the third round ballot after failing to meet a minimum vote threshold during round two. When Schiff backed Hodges with the intention, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> Tribune, of preventing Andrew from receiving the 60% of votes needed to win the endorsement, he lost the support of the Minneapolis Firefighters Union. The convention concluded with no winner and, because no one was endorsed, Schiff stated that he would remain in the race. His campaign manager, Mark Warren, left Schiff's campaign shortly after the convention and a few days later, he declared an end to his bid for mayor and announced that he would campaign actively for Hodges.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the game's high sales and critical acclaim, Take-Two chairman Strauss Zelnick revealed {{in a conference call}} to analysts that the company now considered the game as part of a franchise. He also speculated on any follow-ups mimicking the development cycle of Grand Theft Auto, with a new release expected every two to three years. 2K's president Christoph Hartmann stated that BioShock could have five sequels, comparing the franchise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> Wars movies.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} by Alec Sulkin and {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino. To produce the installment the staff asked Lucasfilm, the company who owns the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> Wars franchise, for permission. Blue Harvest guest starred Chevy Chase, Beverly D'Angelo, Mick Hucknall, Leslie Nielsen, and Rush Limbaugh. The episode also included recurring voice actors Lori Alan, Adam West, Ralph Garman, Danny Smith, John Viener, Steve Callaghan, Kirker Butler, Mark Hentemann, Johnny Brennan, Jon Benjamin, Phil LaMarr, and Wally Wingert. The episode contains various references to popular culture, specifically the Star Wars film series. It was viewed by 10.86 million viewers on its original broadcast and received generally positive reviews from critics.|$|E

5|$|Nilo Rodis, who {{had worked}} on two {{previous}} Star Trek features, was appointed the role of art director, and worked with Shatner to establish the film's visual design. Shatner sought a grittier and more realistic feel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> Trek universe, and so the two worked together to visualize the film from start to finish. After Shatner explained the entire story in a day-long session, Rodis went home and sketched out each scene from the script.

5|$|Serpens Caput {{contains}} many RR Lyrae variables, although most are too faint {{to be seen}} without professional photography. The brightest is VY Serpentis, only of 10th magnitude. This star's period has been increasing by approximately 1.2 seconds per century. A variable star {{of a different kind}} is Tau4 Serpentis, a cool red giant that pulsates between magnitudes 5.89 and 7.07 in 87 days. This star has been found to display an inverse P Cygni profile, where cold infalling gas on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> creates redshifted hydrogen absorption lines next to the normal emission lines.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, {{which is similar}} to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are nearly twice as long because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E

5|$|The names at {{that point}} {{remained}} unofficial, but in 2016 the IAU organised a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardise proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognised the names of exoplanets and their host stars that were produced by the competition. Epsilon Eridani is now listed as Ran in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. It {{is not yet clear}} whether professional astronomers will generally use the new name, or continue to refer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star</b> as Epsilon Eridani; both are now equally valid.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Dyson swarm, the {{constructs}} {{making it up}} are not in orbit around the star, but would be statites—satellites suspended by use of enormous light sails using radiation pressure to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs {{would not be in}} danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> and independent of one another. Because the ratio of radiation pressure to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an unobstructed line-of-sight to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E

5|$|In 1614, German {{astronomer}} Johannes Kepler {{determined that}} {{a series of three}} conjunctions of the planets Jupiter and Saturn occurred in the year 7 BC. He argued (incorrectly) that a planetary conjunction could create a nova, which he linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> of Bethlehem. Modern calculations show that there was a gap of nearly a degree (approximately twice a diameter of the moon) between the planets, so these conjunctions were not visually impressive. An ancient almanac has been found in Babylon which covers the events of this period, but does not indicate that the conjunctions were of any special interest. In the 20th century, Prof. Karlis Kaufmanis, an astronomer, argued that this was an astronomical event where Jupiter and Saturn were in a triple conjunction in the constellation Pisces. Archaeologist and Assyriologist Simo Parpola has also suggested this explanation.|$|E
5|$|LucasFilm was {{hesitant}} to grant access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> Wars library of sound effects for the game's sound designer, Rudolph Stember. As a compromise, the company provided Stember with sounds sampled at {{the relatively low}} rate of 22kHz, half the standard rate. Stember objected, claiming that the clips sounded worse than effects he had lifted from VHS tapes for a previous Star Wars project. The game includes voice work from several notable persons, including screen actors Olivia Hussey and Raphael Sbarge as well as voice actors Bob Bergen, Neil Ross and Terence McGovern. Instead of using Nintendo's default sound drivers, Factor 5 developed its own tool called MOsys FX Surround. The Factor 5 drivers use Nintendo 64 processors, but tax them less; advanced compression techniques were also employed. As a result, the game includes over 80minutes of high-quality stereo sound.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the early}} results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the {{discovery}} of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10arcseconds (10″) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80astronomical units (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension {{on the order of}} a millimeter, as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an effective force that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
