5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the attempt to relocate the Timberwolves, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Regional Basketball Alliance sought to lure an existing franchise to the city. After completion of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Arena, the Alliance led efforts to relocate the Vancouver Grizzlies to the city. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> bid ultimately lost out to Memphis, and by early 2002 the city looked to the Charlotte Hornets to potentially relocate to the city. The Hornets became attractive to relocate following a failed referendum for a new arena in Charlotte. On May 10, 2002, the NBA {{voted in favor of}} the relocation of the Hornets to New Orleans marking the return of the NBA to the city since the relocation of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Jazz to Salt Lake City in 1979. In November 2002, the Timberwolves made their first trip to New Orleans since the failed relocation efforts of the Top Rank group in 1994.|$|E

5|$|Beauregard's first {{employment}} {{following the}} war was in October 1865 as chief engineer and general superintendent of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans,</b> Jackson and Great Northern Railroad.

This job overlapped with that of president of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> and Carrollton Street Railway (1866–1876), where he invented a system of cable-powered street railway cars. Once again, Beauregard made a financial success of the company, but was fired by stockholders who wished to take direct management of the company.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, the U.S. Treasury had mints {{operating}} in New Orleans, Denver, San Francisco, and the main center in Philadelphia, which more than met the demand for minted money. In 1904, the government ceased the minting of the silver dollar, which accounted {{for the bulk of}} the coinage <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> branch had been producing since 1879. In 1909 Treasury officials declined to appropriate funds for the mint's operation, effectively halting subsequent minting activity in New Orleans. In 1911, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Mint was formally decommissioned and the machinery was transferred to the main U. S. Mint facility in Philadelphia,.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) {{were unable}} to play any home games for the entire 2005–06 season, after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans, Louisiana on August 29, 2005, and caused {{extensive}} damage to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Arena (now known as Smoothie King Center).

5|$|The {{refurbishment}} and recommissioning of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Mint was due {{partly to}} the fact that in 1878 the Federal government in Washington, D.C. had passed the Bland–Allison Act, which mandated the purchase and coining of a large quantity of silver yearly. The Treasury Department needed additional facilities to do so. It reopened <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> facility primarily to coin large quantities of silver dollars, most of which were simply stored in the building instead of circulated. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed former Mississippi Senator and governor Henry S. Foote the new superintendent of the mint.|$|E
