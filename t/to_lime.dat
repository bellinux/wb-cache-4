5|$|The Grand Western Canal ran between Taunton in Somerset and Tiverton in Devon in the United Kingdom. The canal had {{its origins}} in various plans, going back to 1796, to link the Bristol Channel and the English Channel by a canal, {{bypassing}} Lands End. An additional purpose of the canal was the supply of limestone and coal <b>to</b> <b>lime</b> kilns along with {{the removal of the}} resulting quicklime, which was used as a fertiliser and for building houses. This intended canal-link was never completed as planned, as the coming of the railways removed the need for its existence.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode was}} rehearsed from Monday to Friday at the Student Movement House on Gower Street in London, with camera rehearsals taking place {{all day on}} Saturday before transmission. The episodes were then {{transmitted}} live—with a few pre-filmed 35mm film inserts shot {{before and during the}} rehearsal period—from Studio A of the BBC's original television studios at Alexandra Palace in London. It {{was one of the last}} major dramas to be broadcast from the Palace, as the majority of television production was soon to transfer <b>to</b> <b>Lime</b> Grove Studios, and it was made using the BBC's oldest television cameras, the Emitrons, installed with the opening of the Alexandra Palace studios in 1936. These cameras gave a (by modern standards) poor-quality picture, with areas of black and white shading across portions of the image.|$|E

25|$|The oldest {{terminal}} {{station in the}} world was Crown Street railway station in Liverpool, built in 1830, on the locomotive hauled Liverpool to Manchester line. As the first train on the Liverpool-Manchester line left Liverpool, the station is slightly older than the Manchester terminal at Liverpool Road.

500|$|The {{screenplay}} {{was written}} by Alun Owen, who was chosen because the Beatles were familiar with his play No Trams <b>to</b> <b>Lime</b> Street, and he had shown an aptitude for Liverpudlian dialogue. McCartney commented, [...] "Alun hung around with us and was careful to try and put words in our mouths that he might've heard us speak, so I thought he {{did a very good}} script." [...] Owen spent several days with the group, who told him their lives were like [...] "a train and a room and a car and a room and a room and a room"; the character of Paul's grandfather refers to this in the dialogue. Owen wrote the script from the viewpoint that the Beatles had become prisoners of their own fame, their schedule of performances and studio work having become punishing.|$|E

2500|$|From 1821 {{the town}} of Villeneuve had {{effective}} control of the monument without actually owning it, [...] but instead of repairing the buildings, the town claimed that the ruined structures around the tower posed a hazard and in 1822 ordered them to be demolished and the material sold to cover the costs.

The pelican is also the Louisiana state bird and is found on the state flag and state seal. The name [...] "Riptide" [...] was selected for the performing pelican by the administration after a vote of the student body in which the students actually voted that the pelican be named [...] "Pecker." [...] The pelican mascot name may have been so voted as the student body had also overwhelmingly voted for Poseidon to be the mascot.

2500|$|The first {{significant}} improvement to US 15 between Tuscarora and Frederick came in 1951 and 1952 when the U.S. highway was reconstructed and widened from Evergreen Point <b>to</b> <b>Lime</b> Kiln. [...] In 1950, construction {{began on the}} Washington National Pike freeway, which would later become I-270. [...] As part of that construction, a cloverleaf interchange was constructed between US 15 and the new freeway, which had its northern terminus at US 15 until US 40's segment of the Frederick Bypass opened in 1956. [...] US 15 was moved to Washington National Pike north of Buckeystown Pike {{after the completion of}} the Frederick Freeway in 1959. [...] The portion of Buckeystown Pike between the freeway and MD 355 was designated MD 806, which is used for several segments of the old alignment of US 15 north of Frederick.

In 1889, William Bullock Ives' Hereford Railway purchased the Dominion Lime Company railroad and extended it south {{to connect with the}} Upper Coos Railroad. MEC leased the Upper Coos Railroad and the Hereford Railway in 1890 and built a connecting Coos Valley Railroad in 1891 from North Stratford to the Mountain Division at Quebec Junction. [...] This line was operated as the MEC Quebec Division until Maine Central terminated lease of the Hereford Railway in 1925. Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) later operated over some of the line through Quebec. The Upper Coos Railroad and Coos Valley Railroad were purchased by MEC in 1931 and operated as the Beecher Falls branch of the Mountain Division. The former Coos Valley Railroad was dismantled in 1948 when MEC negotiated trackage rights over the B to Groveton, New Hampshire and over the former Grand Trunk Berlin Subdivision from Groveton to North Stratford. The remaining line north of North Stratford operated as the North Stratford Railroad after 1976.|$|E

2500|$|... "For, as a broad view of {{the field}} [...] {{immediately}} shows, in every well-established culture realm to which {{a new system of}} thought and civilization comes, it is received creatively, not inertly. A sensitive, complex process of selection, adaptation, and development brings the new forms into contact with their approximate analogues or homologues in the native inheritance, and in certain instances - notably in Egypt, Crete, the Indus valley, and a little later, the Far East - prodigious forces of indigenous productivity are released in native style, but on the level of the new stage. In other words, although its culture stage at any given period may be shown to have been derived, as an effect of alien influences, the particular style of each of the great domains can no less surely be shown to be indigenous. And so it is that a scholar largely concerned with native forms will tend to argue for local, stylistic originality, whereas one attentive rather to the broadly flung evidence of diffused techniques, artifacts, and mythological motifs will be inclined <b>to</b> <b>lime</b> out a single culture history of mankind, characterized by well-defined general stages, though rendered by way of no less well-defined local styles. It is one thing to analyze the genesis and subsequent diffusion of the fundamental heritage of all high civilizations whatsoever; another to mark the genesis, maturation, and demise of the several local mythological styles; and a third to measure the force of each local style {{in the context of the}} unitary history of mankind. A total science of mythology must give attention, as far as possible, to all three." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry III in 1217 {{recognised}} by royal charter the town's oldest institution, Berkhamsted's pre-existing market. Trades within medieval Berkhamsted were extensive: {{early in}} the 13th century the town had a merchant, two painters, a goldsmith, a forester, two farriers, two tailors, a brewer of mead, a blacksmith, carpenters, wood turners, tool makers, a manufacturer of roofing tiles and wine producers. In the mid–13th century, a banker, the wealthy Abraham of Berkhamsted, financier to the Earl of Cornwall, lived in the town; this was unusual for {{a small town in}} a time of heightened persecution of Jews. In 1290, a taxation list mentions a brewer, a lead burner, a carpenter, leather workers, a fuller, a turner, a butcher, a fishmonger, a barber, an archer, a tailor, a cloth-napper, a miller, a cook, a seller of salt and a huntsman. At this time, larger houses of merchants and castle officials appeared {{on the south side of}} the high street (including 173High Street, the oldest known extant jettied building in England). In 1307 Berkhamsted was a large town with an estimated population of 2,000 to 2,500. In 1355, there were five butchers, two bakers, nine brewers, two cobblers, a pelter, a tanner, five cloth dyers, six wheelwrights, three smiths, six grain merchants, a skinner and a baker/butcher. In the 14th century, Berkhamsted (recorded as [...] "Berchamstede") was considered to be one of the [...] "best" [...] market towns in the country.
