5|$|Breckinridge and Minnesota Territory's Henry Mower Rice {{were among}} the speculators who {{invested}} in land near present-day Superior, Wisconsin. Rice disliked Minnesota's territorial governor, Willis A. Gorman, and petitioned Pierce to replace him with Breckinridge. Pierce twice investigated Gorman, but found no grounds to remove him from office. Breckinridge fell ill when traveling to view his investments in mid-1855 {{and was unable to}} campaign in the state elections. Know Nothings captured every state office and six congressional districts—including the Eighth District—and Breckinridge sent regrets to friends in Washington, D.C., promising <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> active role in the 1856 campaigns.|$|E
5|$|In 1793 {{a further}} survey was {{conducted}} by John Rennie, and {{the route of the}} canal was altered <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> southerly course through Great Bedwyn, Devizes, Trowbridge and Newbury. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of the Bruce Tunnel in the Savernake Forest. On 17April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the Royal Assent and construction began.|$|E
5|$|In October 1962, South Kasai {{returned}} to the Republic of the Congo. The State of Katanga continued to hold out against the central government until it too collapsed in January 1963 after UN forces began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> aggressive stance under Thant. As a compromise, South Kasai {{was one of the}} 21 provinces formally established by the federalist constitution of 1962. As the Mobutu regime launched a centralist restructuring of the Congolese state from 1965, South Kasai {{was one of the few}} provinces which was retained. In order to discourage further secessionist sentiment, the province was later restructured to include new territory in Kabinda and Sankuru Districts and renamed Eastern Kasai (Kasaï-Oriental).|$|E

5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She {{wrote a letter}} to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that it would allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images of homosexual acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> public role.|$|E
5|$|Later on September23, {{the storm}} entered the Windward Passage, {{maintaining}} a broad circulation with well-defined banding and an eye-like feature. Little change {{occurred during the}} day; the storm made its fifth landfall near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with winds of 75mph (120km/h). The storm began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> northwesterly track {{in response to a}} mid- to upper-level high pressure area to the northeast and a mid- to upper-level low over the Yucatán Peninsula. Throughout its passage across Cuba, Georges maintained a well-defined outflow pattern despite having an ill-defined center. By September24, the storm moved over water north of Cuba, and the eyewall quickly began to redevelop.|$|E
5|$|Susanto Pudjomartono, {{former chief}} editor of Tempo, became The Jakarta Post second chief editor on 1 August 1991, after Siagian {{was chosen to}} be Indonesia's {{ambassador}} to Australia. Under Pudjomartono's leadership, the paper began publishing more original work and doing less translation; reporters were also asked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{active role in the}} day-to-day operations of the paper. The paper also became more vocal regarding politics, taking a pro-democracy stance like Tempo.

5|$|The storm quickly strengthened, being {{upgraded}} twice by the JMA on September 11, at 0600 UTC to {{a severe}} tropical storm and at 1800 UTC to a typhoon, becoming the seventh official typhoon of the season. It then {{took on a}} more north-northwesterly track, weakening while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle on September 14. However, it restrengthened, reaching its maximum intensity of 110 knots (205km/h, 125mph) from the JMA and 120knots (220km/h, 140mph) from the JTWC before passing Iriomote on September 15. Originally expected by the JTWC to pass {{to the east of}} Okinawa Island, a subtropical high-pressure ridge south of the main Japanese islands forced the storm <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> westward track, pushing it towards Taiwan. Shortly later, Shanshan passed directly over Iriomote.|$|E
5|$|Although HTC has {{developed}} several notable Android devices, {{such as the}} Dream—the first publicly released Android device, it failed {{to capitalize on the}} first-mover advantage, and has struggled financially in recent years due to the increasing market share captured by other vendors such as Samsung and Apple. In some markets, HTC released numerous carrier-specific phones and relied heavily on wireless providers to promote its products, a strategy that was unsuccessful in the face of Samsung and Apple’s strong marketing efforts. The company’s flagship phone in 2012, the One X, received critical acclaim from reviewers, but was commercially unsuccessful {{in the wake of the}} Galaxy S III and the iPhone 5. In response, the company planned to take bigger risks with their next flagship device to make it stand out among its competitors, and also planned <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> direct role in promoting its products—doubling its marketing budget for 2013.|$|E

5|$|Another legacy was {{the manner}} in which it led to the emergence—albeit only fleetingly—of an {{independence}} in Australian foreign affairs. Although previously Australian foreign interests had been largely handled by Britain, as a combatant Australia sent its own delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, while it also began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> assertive role in regional affairs in the Pacific. At the peace conference Prime Minister Hughes pushed aggressively for reparations and an Australian mandate over German New Guinea; a stance which conflicted with the liberal internationalist inspired Fourteen Points put forward by American President Woodrow Wilson. Regardless, following the war there was little real change in Imperial relations and Dominion affairs, and as a result the war arguably did not lead to any significant change in Australia's perception of its role in the world. Indeed, profound change would only occur following the Japanese crisis of 1942, which ultimately saw Australia pursue a foreign policy more independent of Britain, and an alliance with the United States.|$|E
5|$|Baith Israel hired Marcus Friedlander as rabbi in 1887. Born in Congress Poland in 1862, he left Russia for England {{before he}} was twenty. Though {{speaking}} little English at the time, he graduated there from the London Theological Seminary, before emigrating to the United States. He was 24 {{years old when he}} assumed the post at Baith Israel, at the time the youngest man in New York state to be appointed to so significant a position of Jewish leadership. Friedlander served until 1893, when he resigned <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> lucrative position in California at the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland. After Friedlander left, his name was, for reasons unknown, deleted from the synagogue histories, and the financial records and minute books dating from his tenure were removed from Baith Israel's archives. He was succeeded by Joseph Taubenhaus, the brother of Dr. Gottheil/Godfrey Taubenhaus, the rabbi of Congregation Beth Elohim; another brother, Jacob/Jean Taubenhaus was a famous French chess master.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} morning of June25, Celia started rapidly {{weakening}} {{as it began}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> northwesterly track into a more hostile environment, with cooler water temperatures and higher wind shear; all of these conditions are highly unfavorable for tropical cyclones. By June26, convection associated with the hurricane had substantially lessened and cloud tops warmed. The storm also began to resume a westward track as it moved into an area of weaker steering currents. Traversing water temperatures estimated at , Celia continued to degenerate as it weakened to tropical storm status, by which time it was situated about 955mi (1,535km) southeast of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur. Most of the convection associated with the system had dissipated and the center of circulation became exposed, with a small area of showers and thunderstorms to the north. Throughout June27, the system gradually lost its forward momentum over the open water of the Pacific Ocean but managed to maintain minimal tropical storm status longer than initially anticipated.|$|E

5|$|Empires: Dawn of the Modern World is a 2003 {{real-time}} strategy {{video game}} developed by Stainless Steel Studios {{and published by}} Activision. Set in a world-historical period that extends from the Middle Ages to World War II, the game tasks players with guiding one of nine rival great civilizations to victory. Customer surveys from Stainless Steel's previous game, Empire Earth, were used {{as a starting point}} for Empires: these inspired the team <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> minimalist design approach, and to include civilizations without overlapping styles of play. Empires was positively received by critics, who enjoyed its multiplayer component. However, certain reviewers disliked its single-player mode, and opinion clashed on the game's level of uniqueness compared to competitors such as Rise of Nations. The sales of Empires, when combined with those of Empire Earth, totaled 2.5 million units by 2004.|$|E

5|$|On 30December, the JTWC {{reported}} that Rewa had become {{equivalent to a}} category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS); early {{the next day the}} BoM {{reported that}} the system had developed into a category 3severe tropical cyclone, and an eye became visible on satellite imagery. The system then abruptly turned and started to move towards the south parallel to the Queensland coast because of an interaction with an upper-level trough of low pressure. On 2January both the JTWC and the BoM reported that Rewa had reached its peak intensity, with the JTWC reporting that Rewa had peaked with 1-minute windspeeds of 230km/h (145mph), equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. Meanwhile, the BoM reported that the system had peaked with 10-minute windspeeds of 205km/h (125mph) with a central pressure of , which made it a category 5severe tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale. Rewa remained at its peak intensity for 24hours before the system started to weaken during 3January, as strengthening upper level north-westerlies increased vertical wind shear over the system. Throughout that day, the cyclone started to move towards the south-east, before it started <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> eastwards track as it approached 160°E.|$|E
