5|$|After Victory Road, Samoa Joe and Booker T {{continued}} their rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On the July17 episode of Impact, Management Director Jim Cornette demanded that Booker T give the championship back to Joe, who {{was recognized as}} the official champion by TNA. Booker T refused this demand, while Joe also declined the offer as he felt he did not deserve to hold the title due to being pinned at the event. Due to these feelings, Cornette instead scheduled a rematch between the two for the championship at TNA's next PPV event Hard Justice on August10. On the July24 episode of Impact!, Joe challenged Booker <b>T</b> <b>to</b> contest their rematch in a Six Sides of Steel Cage match, which Booker T accepted after adding that weapons would be allowed in the match.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the longitudinal relations between psychopathology and social competence {{in a sample of}} 115 Chinese children during the transition to preschool initiated in their third year of life. Social competence was assessed by maternal reports at three months after preschool entry (T 1) {{and at the end of}} the first (T 2) and second (T 3) preschool years. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were assessed by maternal reports at T 1 and T 2. The results showed that T 1 externalizing predicted rank-order decreases in social competence from <b>T</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 3. T 1 Internalizing predicted rank-order decreases in social competence from <b>T</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 2 but growth of competence from <b>T</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 3 and rank-order increases in competence from <b>T</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 3.

5|$|The {{main event}} was a King of the Mountain {{match for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the {{objective}} is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box. Roode was the next to qualify after bashing a ladder Cage held with a chair into him and following with a pin. Immediately afterwards, Rhino pinned Roode with a roll-up pin to qualify. Later, Joe held Booker T in his signature Coquina Clutch submission hold when Cage ascended a padded turnbuckle and jumped off onto Booker T and Joe. He followed by pinning Booker <b>T</b> <b>to</b> qualify and send Booker <b>T</b> <b>to</b> the penalty box. When Booker T was released from the box, he attacked Nash with the title belt and then attempted to hang it. Nash stopped him and then dropped Booker T back-first against the mat with his signature Jackknife Powerbomb maneuver. Joe was the last to qualify by pinning Roode after slamming him back and neck-first into the mat with his signature Muscle Buster maneuver. Joe then hung the title belt at 19 minutes and 49 seconds to win the competition.|$|E

5|$|This angular scaling {{can be seen}} in the apsidal precession, i.e., in {{the gradual}} {{rotation}} of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed Ω=(k−1)ω, where ω equals the mean angular speed of the particle about the stationary ellipse. If the particle requires a time <b>T</b> <b>to</b> move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle β=ΩT=(k−1)ωT=(k−1)×180°. For an inverse-square law such as Newton's law of universal gravitation, where n equals 1, there is no angular scaling (k=1), the apsidal angle α is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is stationary (Ω=β=0).|$|E

5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} {{company-wide}} narrative {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker <b>T</b> <b>to</b> the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to listen and continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent in their current rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end that type of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E
5|$|Robert Roode versus Booker T in a Stand By Your Man Strap {{match was}} another highly {{promoted}} match {{heading into the}} event. The feud regarding this contest began at Final Resolution, where Roode accidentally punched Booker T's wife Sharmell, fracturing her jaw in the storyline, after a Mixed Tag Team match pitting Roode and his then-manager Ms. Brooks against Booker T and Sharmell. Booker T and Roode then fought at Against All Odds to a double count-out. Cornette announced on the February 14 episode of Impact! that Booker T and Roode would face in another match at Destination X. On the February 28, 2008, episode of Impact!, Roode handcuffed Booker <b>T</b> <b>to</b> the ring ropes and beat him with a belt, until Roode's former manager Ms. Brooks, now Traci Brooks, came to Booker T's defense. However, Roode and his new manager Payton Banks ended up attacking both with belts. On the March 6 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Booker T and Roode would face in a Stand By Your Man Strap match, in which if Booker T won then Brooks {{would be allowed to}} beat Banks with a strap ten times and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|TNA held a Three Way War between A.J. Styles, Booker T, and Christian Cage at the show. Leading {{into the}} event, Styles {{represented}} the younger wrestlers in the company, while Booker T represented the veterans. Cage was neutral in the storyline, due to not having revealed which side he had aligned with. This upset Styles in the storyline, who wanted Cage {{to join the}} younger wrestlers. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Styles fought Booker T in a standard match. Booker T won the bout after bashing Styles {{in the head with}} a steel briefcase. Styles blamed the loss on Cage, who had interfered in the bout and accidentally cost Styles the win due to a miscommunication. On the October2 episode of Impact!, the team of Cage, Styles, and Jay Lethal teamed to face the team of Booker T and Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) in a Six Man Tag Team match. Another miscommunication between Styles and Cage occurred in the contest, allowing Booker <b>T</b> <b>to</b> pin Cage to win the bout. This led to the October9 episode of Impact!, when Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Booker T versus Styles with Cage as Special Guest Referee would be the main event of that telecast to settle the issue. Styles defeated Booker T during the show, with Cage assaulting both wrestlers after the contest. Cornette then promoted a Three Way War at Bound for Glory in order to end the overall conflict.|$|E

On the July17 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T proclaimed {{that he was the}} new TNA World Heavyweight Champion before Management Director Jim Cornette announced that Booker T did not win the match and that Joe was still the TNA World Heavyweight Champion, despite Booker T having taken possession of the title belt. Cornette then scheduled a rematch between the two for the title at Hard Justice; Joe did not retrieve physical possession of the title belt after this, instead chose to reclaim the physical belt after he beat Booker T at the event.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the contractile properties of individual slow and fast myofibers in response to various training periods throughout a collegiate cross-country season in male runners. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the gastrocnemius of five runners at three time points during the season; after a summer aerobic training phase (T 1); after an 8 week period of intense training (T 2) and after a 4 week taper period (T 3). Absolute (4. 6 ± 0. 3 L/min) and relative (71 ± 0. 7 mI/kg/min) maximal oxygen consumption were unchanged during the study duration. Run performance (8 km) improved 3 % from <b>T</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 2 (27 : 26 to 26 : 38 min:sec) and 1 % from <b>T</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 3 (26 : 21 min:sec). A total of 328 individual myofibers were isolated and studied at 15 °C. MHC I diameter was 3 % lower (P < 0. 05) at <b>T</b> 2 compared <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 1 and 4 % smaller at <b>T</b> 3 compared <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 2. MHC I and Ila fibers were 18 and 11 % stronger (P < 0. 05) respectively, from <b>T</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 2. MHC I fibers produced 9 % less force (P < 0. 05) after the taper (T 2 -T 3) while MHC Ila fibers were 9 % stronger (P < 0. 05). Specific tension (Po/CSA) increased (P < 0. 05) 38 and 26 % for MHC I and Ila fibers, respectively from <b>T</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 2 and was unchanged with the taper. Maximal shortening velocity (Vo) of the MHC I fibers decreased (P < 0. 05) 23 % from <b>T</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 2 and 17 % from <b>T</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 3. MHC I peak power decreased (P < 0. 05) 20 % from <b>T</b> 1 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 2 and 25 % from <b>T</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 3. Power corrected for cell size decreased (P < 0. 05) 15 % from <b>T</b> 2 <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 3 and was 24 % lower at <b>T</b> 3 compared <b>to</b> <b>T</b> 1 for the MHC I fibers only. MHC Ila diameter, Vo, peak and normalized power were unaltered during the study duration. These data suggest that myocellular function is sensitive to changes in run training and it appears that MHC I fibers are moreaffected than MHC IIa fibers. Furthermore, the increase in interval training with the taper may have offset the modest reduction in training volume and prevented any positive adaptations at the cellular level.
