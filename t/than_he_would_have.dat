5|$|Tomlinson {{chose not}} to renew his Barrow {{contract}} {{at the end of}} the season, and instead signed a one-year contract at Port Vale in May 2010. Anyon had at by this time left Vale Park for Lincoln City, and Tomlinson was brought into provide competition for teenager Chris Martin. This required him to accept a lower wage <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> got at Barrow.|$|E
5|$|In {{producing}} the English dub {{version of the}} series, Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke's voice actor. When writing Sanosuke's dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English dub script, noted that the character was smarter <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked {{in the first few}} episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be more similar to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.|$|E
5|$|Both The Pleasure Garden and The Mountain Eagle were {{produced}} in co-operation with Emelka Film Studios in Munich, Germany. The film was mostly shot at Emelka in Munich {{in the fall}} of 1925, and the film exteriors were shot on location in Obergurgl, in what is now the municipality of Sölden in the State of Tyrol in southwestern Austria, the Ötztal Alps standing in for the mountains and hollows of Kentucky. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had in England, and influences in the technique and style of German cinema are evident in his early works.|$|E

5|$|Penfold {{was born}} to Alfred and Florence (née Green) in 1944 and educated at Sutton Grammar School for Boys, where he stayed on until 19. He left school with A-levels in French, German, and geography, and took casual {{employment}} to earn money. Having a desire {{to make use of}} his language qualifications, he began applying for jobs at multi-national companies. He applied to Her Majesty's Civil Service and passed the civil service exam, but was keen to join the Foreign Service. He took and passed a second exam to join the Foreign Service, but had to enter at a lower grade <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> held in the Civil Service.|$|E
5|$|The Mountain Eagle is a 1927 British silent film, and Alfred Hitchcock's second as director, {{following}} The Pleasure Garden. The film, {{a romantic}} melodrama set in Kentucky, {{is about a}} widower (Bernhard Goetzke) who jealously competes with his crippled son (John F. Hamilton) and a man he loathes (Malcolm Keen) over the affections of a schoolteacher (Nita Naldi). The film was mostly produced at the Emelka Film studios in Munich, Germany in autumn of 1925, with exterior scenes shot {{in the village of}} Obergurgl in the State of Tyrol, Austria. Production was plagued with problems, including the destruction of a village roof and Hitchcock experiencing altitude sickness. Due to producing the film in Germany, Hitchcock had more directorial freedom <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> had in England, and he was influenced by German cinematic style and technique.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, after a year's probation, Stainer {{became a}} chorister at St Paul's Cathedral. He was already an {{accomplished}} player on keyboard instruments and possessed perfect pitch {{and a fine}} treble voice and soon became the choir's principal soloist. In 1854 {{he was invited to}} sing in the first English performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under William Sterndale Bennett at the Hanover Square Rooms. He travelled each day between his home in Streatham and the cathedral by steamboat. The choristers were required to sing for services at 9.30 a.m. and 3.15 p.m. In between these times the choristers were instructed in Latin, arithmetic, writing and other subjects, and Stainer probably received a much better education there <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done had he been educated at the local elementary school. A house in the cathedral's present choir school has since been named after him. He received organ lessons at St. Sepulchre's Church, Holborn from George Cooper, assistant organist at St Paul's Cathedral under John Goss. He may have met future composer Arthur Sullivan, his junior by two years, there. At any rate they became friends and undertook activities together on half-holidays. In 1855 he was offered a six-month contract as organist at St Benet's, Paul's Wharf. He proved successful, and his contract was renewed several times for further six-month terms. As he was still a minor, his salary of £30 per year was paid to his father. During this period, he sometimes deputised for the regular organists, Goss and Cooper, at services in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the demands}} {{of his career in}} the Navy and NASA, Pete and Jane {{spent a great deal of}} time apart, and Pete saw less of his boys growing up <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked.

The Sixers would pay Webber $36 million over the next 1½ seasons, which is $7 million less <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been paid to play. After the buyout, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent. Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly thereafter.|$|E

500|$|Gaiman {{began writing}} the episode before Matt Smith was even {{cast as the}} Eleventh Doctor; Gaiman had envisioned David Tennant's {{performance}} in the first draft, knowing Smith would play the Doctor differently. Despite this he had no issue writing the dialogue. The episode was originally slated for the eleventh episode of the fifth series. However, it was delayed to the sixth series because of budget issues; the eleventh episode would be replaced with [...] "The Lodger". Even so, Gaiman was forced to operate with less money <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> liked; for instance, he had to scrap a scene set in the TARDIS' swimming pool, and instead {{of being able to}} use a monster of his own design he had to use an Ood.|$|E
500|$|Brown worked freely, without ruling {{lines or}} lettering. [...] Usually he roughly sketched the artwork {{with a light}} blue pencil, then {{elaborated}} it with an HB pencil, at which stage he has said [...] "most of the work [...] done". [...] Brown inked the pre-Vortex stories with a brush; when he committed himself to a regular schedule, he felt inking with a brush would be too slow, and switched to cheap markers or pencils to increase his productivity. [...] He continued to use a brush to fill in blacks and to letter his dialogue balloons. [...] Brown came to favour {{the quality of the}} brush again {{toward the end of the}} story's run, but found it slow to work with and thus used it less <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> preferred.

Thi felt that despite Diệm's shortcomings, the president was South Vietnam's best available leader, believing that enforced reform would yield the best outcome.
