Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. <b>They</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban {{design management}} provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.|$|E

Rhoads corresponded often with Simon Flexner at the Rockefeller Institute in New York regarding his research and career interests. In Puerto Rico, the Rockefeller group had more than 200 patients; historian and ethicist Susan E. Lederer notes that, while referred to as patients, they were primarily clinical subjects whose conditions were studied to advance medical research. Because {{of the effects of}} anemia and the suspicion that tropical sprue was related to diet, Rhoads experimentally controlled patients' diets. Lederer notes that in letters from this time, Rhoads referred to his patients as [...] "experimental 'animals'." [...] He wrote: [...] "If they don’t develop something <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> the constitutions of oxen." [...] Rhoads sought to experimentally induce the conditions he was studying in his patients rather than simply treat them. If they did develop tropical sprue, he could treat it with liver extract.|$|E

2500|$|Years later, Ripken {{admitted}} to having written the expletive on the bat; however, he claimed he did it to distinguish it as a batting practice bat, and {{did not intend to}} use it for the card. He went on to say, [...] "I can't believe the people at Fleer couldn't catch that. I mean, <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> to have enough proofreaders to see it. I think not only did they see it, they enhanced it. That writing on that bat is way too clear. I don't write that neat. I think they knew that once they saw it, they could use the card to create an awful lot of stir." [...] Some collectors list the card as the [...] "Rick Face" [...] card, as they claim that the proximity between the letters appears to make the word [...] "FUCK" [...] look similar to [...] "RICK".|$|E
2500|$|The {{sources of}} De Almeida's {{knowledge}} are not spelled out, but {{they at least}} reflect contemporary views. His comments regarding the Hebrew knowledge of the Beta Israel of that time is very significant: {{it could not have}} come from recent intercourse with Jews elsewhere, so it indicates deep antiquity to Beta Israel traditions, at least at that time, before their literature was taken away from them and demolished by the later conquering Christians. (The more sceptical school of historians, whose views are discussed above, deny that the Ethiopian Jews ever knew Hebrew; <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> no Hebrew texts remaining, and have been forced in recent centuries to use the Christian [...] "Old Testament" [...] in Ge'ez after their own literature was destroyed.) It is also of interest that he mentions more Jewish communities dwelling beyond Ethiopia in the Sudan. [...] As so often in such medieval hearsay accounts, however, loose claims are made that may not be accurate. [...] The Beta Israel were not predominantly of the Arabic race, for instance, but he may have meant the term loosely or meant that they also knew Arabic.|$|E

We now see, with few exceptions, that the largest plant on the crossed side in each pot exceeds the largest plant on the self-fertilised side, that the second exceeds the second, the third the third, and so on. Out of the fifteen cases in the table, there are only two exceptions to this rule. We may therefore confidently affirm that a crossed series will always be found to exceed a self-fertilised series, within the range of the conditions under which the present experiment has been made." ...|$|E

6000|$|AS we {{have seen}} that {{nitrogenous}} fluids act very differently on the leaves of Drosera from non-nitrogenous fluids, and as the leaves remain clasped for a much longer time over various organic bodies than over inorganic bodies, such as bits of glass, cinder, wood, &c., it becomes an interesting inquiry, whether they can only absorb matter already in solution, or render it soluble,--that is, have the power of digestion. We shall immediately see that <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> this power, and that they act on albuminous compounds in exactly the same manner as does the gastric juice of mammals; the digested matter being afterwards absorbed. This fact, which will be clearly proved, is a wonderful one in the physiology of plants. I must here state that I have been aided throughout all my later experiments by many valuable suggestions and assistance given me with the greatest kindness by Dr. Burdon Sanderson. [page 86] ...|$|E
6000|$|At first their manners, {{gentle and}} pliable, {{contrast}} pleasantly with the roughness of the half-breds, Huwaytát and Maknáwi, who {{have many of}} the demerits of the Fellah, without acquiring {{the merits of the}} Bedawi.

60|$|Nations may {{not have}} {{missions}} but <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> functions. And the function of ancient Italy was not merely to give us what is statical in our institutions and rational in our law, but to blend into one elemental creed the spiritual aspirations of Aryan and of Semite. Italy was not a pioneer in intellectual progress, nor a motive power {{in the evolution of}} thought. The owl of the goddess of Wisdom traversed over the whole land and found nowhere a resting-place. The dove, which is the bird of Christ, flew straight to the city of Rome and the new reign began. It was the fashion of early Italian painters to represent in mediaeval costume the soldiers who watched over the tomb of Christ, and this, which {{was the result of the}} frank anachronism of all true art, may serve to us as an allegory. For it was in vain that the Middle Ages strove to guard the buried spirit of progress. When the dawn of the Greek spirit arose, the sepulchre was empty, the grave-clothes laid aside. Humanity had risen from the dead.|$|E
6000|$|In the art {{of telling}} a story in verse, Pope is peculiarly happy; we almost forget the grossness of {{the subject of this}} tale, while we are struck by the {{uncommon}} ease and readiness of the verse, the suitableness of the expressions, and the spirit and happiness of the whole. I think Dr. Warton injudiciously censures the verse, which appears to me to be very suitably employed. Pope has introduced triplets in many places, no doubt for greater effect, which <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have.</b> There is generally two together, ended with an Alexandrine. This is common in Dryden's fables, on which Pope evidently formed his style in these narrative pieces. When I say that Dr. Warton injudiciously objects to the verse, it should be remembered that there is a mock-elevation in the speeches, descriptions, &c., of this story, and even poetry in the fairy revels, for which the versification Pope has chosen is more proper, than it would be for Prior's burlesque, and less poetical, ribaldry. The mixture of classical and gothic imagery, such as Chaucer uses, in making Pluto and Proserpine, instead of spirits, like Oberon and Titania, the king and queen of the [...] "yellow-skirted fays," [...] is very common in our early poets, who derived the combination from the old romances, and Ovid.--BOWLES.|$|E
60|$|Mr. James Turnbull had all {{his life}} professed a {{profound}} interest in physical science, and the phenomena of a good garden were really a pleasure to him; but after three-quarters of {{an hour or so}} even the apostle of science began to find rhododendrus a bore, and was somewhat relieved when an unexpected development of events obliged him to transfer his researches to the equally interesting subject of hollyhocks, which grew some fifty feet farther along the path. The ostensible cause of his removal was the unexpected reappearance of his two other acquaintances walking and talking laboriously along the way, with the black head bent close to the brown one. Even hollyhocks detained Turnbull but a short time. Having rapidly absorbed all the important principles affecting the growth of those vegetables, he jumped over a flower-bed and walked back into the building. The other two came up along the slow course of the path talking and talking. No one but God knows what they said (for <b>they</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>have</b> forgotten), and if I remembered it I would not repeat it.
