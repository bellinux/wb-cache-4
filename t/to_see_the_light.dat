This was chopped out during the last year of production, and has yet <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day in a finished form, although concept art from these sequences were showcased at the Siggraph 2007 demonstration, and are available online, as well.|$|E

I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song is never going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day.' It made me feel so good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it." ...|$|E

500|$|The Planet People's leader, Kickalong (Ralph Arliss), {{believes}} that the Planet People gathered at Ringstone Round have been transported—as promised—to the planet, {{but it is clear}} to Quatermass and Kapp that they have been reduced to ashes. One survivor – a girl called Isabel (Annabelle Lanyon) who deliriously talks about [...] "lovely lightning" [...] – is found and is brought back to the Kapps' cottage. Making contact with NASA scientist Chuck Marshall (Tony Sibbald), they learn that thousands of young people have disappeared in similar incidents all around the world. Quatermass, aided by District Commissioner Annie Morgan (Margaret Tyzack), decides to bring Isabel to London for tests. As they make their journey, Quatermass speculates as to whether there is any connection between recent events and the decline in society. Reaching London, they are attacked by a gang. Quatermass is yanked from the car but Annie and Isabel manage to escape. Meanwhile, a large number of Planet People arrive at the radio telescope, congregating at the stone circle on its grounds. Working at a perimeter building, Kapp is horrified <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> strike the area around his home – rushing home, he finds his family gone.|$|E
500|$|New {{releases}} {{continued into}} late 2006. The [...] "Thieves' Den", a 2.27MB download offering {{the chance to}} [...] "Uncover a famous pirate's lost ship and claim it for your own", was released on May 22 for the Xbox 360, priced at 150 Marketplace points, [...] "roughly" [...] equivalent to US$1.89. Explaining the add-on, Ashley Cheng stated [...] "Basically, it's Goonies." [...] "Mehrunes' Razor", a quest revolving around a mage {{in search of the}} deadly Daedric artifact known as Mehrunes' Razor, was released on June 14. It became the most expensive download yet, at US$2.99 for PC users and 250 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$3.13, for Xbox 360 owners. One 1UP.com reporter took the occasion to reflect on the increasing price of owning the [...] "complete" [...] Oblivion. With all the add-ons included, he calculated, [...] "That's over $80 in game for the complete version of Oblivion, thus far." [...] Foreseeing eventual problems with the upcoming PS3 release, and a potential bundling of all the software for a cheaper price, he wondered: [...] "will Xbox 360 and PC users feel slighted?...Microtransactions are sticky business." [...] Joystiq continued to comment on the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] add-on in their notice of the quest's release. [...] "With a weapon like that, who needs horse armor?" [...] On July 13, [...] "The Vile Lair", sporting a hidden crypt called [...] "Deepscorn Hollow" [...] for players bitten with Oblivions vampirism bug, was released. Like the [...] "Orrery" [...] and the [...] "Wizard's Tower", Bethesda set [...] "The Vile Lair"'s PC release price at US$1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$1.88. Joystiq responded positively to the new price point. [...] "What a bargain!...It's good to see the folks at Oblivion have learned their lesson and aren't offering relatively super expensive content not fit <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> of day." ...|$|E

The 1645 collection was the only poetry of his to see print until Paradise Lost appeared in 1667.|$|E

2500|$|An Island was {{unpublished}} during Blake's lifetime, {{and there}} is no evidence that it ever got beyond the MS stage. Extracts were first published in The Light Blue, Volume II (1867), a literary magazine published by Cambridge University, however, it has been suggested that perhaps Blake never intended for An Island to be published at all. Speaking of the sketches and poetry in Blake's Notebook, John Sampson writes they [...] "are in the nature of rough jottings, sometimes mere doggerel set down from whim or to relieve a mood, and never probably [...] intended <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> in cold print. Such without doubt is the fragment known as An Island in the Moon." [...] Peter Ackroyd agrees with this suggestion, strongly believing that Blake never intended the piece to be read by the public.|$|E

[...] He also recalled in 1995 that [...] "Peter basically ceased <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> with Fleetwood Mac and had aspirations of playing for nothing in strange places—none of which really happened. He made several interesting albums after he left, then basically took a left turn in terms of his psyche. He pulled out of the mainstream and chose to stay at home. He doesn't play much anymore, which is certainly a shame, because he's my mentor, and he's the reason that Fleetwood Mac became what we became." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{expanded}} {{portion of}} the ode {{is related to the}} ideas expressed in Wordsworth's The Prelude Book V in their emphasis on childhood memories and a connection between the divine and humanity. To Wordsworth, the soul was created by the divine and was able to recognise the light in the world. As a person ages, they are no longer able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> but they can still recognise the beauty in the world. He elaborated on this belief in a note to the text: [...] "Archimedes said that he could move the world if he had a point whereon to rest his machine. Who has not felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his own mind? Having to wield some of its elements when I was impelled to write this poem on the [...] "Immortality of the Soul", I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorising me to make for my purpose the best use I could of it as a Poet." [...] This [...] "notion of pre-existence" [...] is somewhat Platonic in nature, and it is the basis for Wordsworth believing that children are able to be the [...] "best philosopher". The idea was not intended as a type of , the reincarnation of the soul from person to person, and Wordsworth later explained that the poem was not meant to be regarded as a complete philosophical view: [...] "In my Ode... I do not profess to give a literal representation {{of the state of the}} affections and of the moral being in childhood. I record my feelings at that time,--my absolute spirituality, my 'all-soulness,' if I may so speak. At that time I could not believe that I should lie down quietly in the grave, and that my body would moulder into dust." ...|$|E
