500|$|In 1965, at age 90 {{and with}} no heirs, Calment signed a deal to sell her {{apartment}} to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a life estate. Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 francs (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000 which was {{more than double the}} apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death. Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, [...] "In life, one sometimes makes bad deals." [...] During all these years, Calment used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that she [...] "competed with Methuselah". In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.|$|E
500|$|... "Brother, Brother", {{the first}} song on the album, is {{inspired}} by the band members' experience with the drug use of friends. Bawinkel stated {{in an interview that}} [...] "a bunch of the tunes cover what we wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> during those times [...]" [...] Michael Weaver, writing for Jesus Freak Hideout, interpreted the song as an attempt to convince this individual to turn his or her life around and return to the Christian faith. The next track, named [...] "The Rich, The Strong and The Poor", tells the story of three men looking for happiness. The first tries to find it in money, but he returns unfulfilled. The second tries looking for happiness in physical strength. He believes that if he proves himself, that he will find peace. Like the first man, he ends up unfulfilled. The final man looks for happiness in basic life needs and likewise ends up in the same position as the first two men. Bawinkel explains that, [...] "all three are very much in the same position in that happiness hasn’t been found in chasing these various desires. There is something more which is hopeful for some and frustrating for others." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindelof {{said that}} {{the other parts of}} the script were strong enough to survive without the Alien hallmarks, such as the Alien creature, which he {{believed}} had been diluted by the exposure it had received. He said, [...] " [...] were just looking for someone <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> Hey, we don't need the Alien stuff in here. It shouldn't be about that. It can {{be a part of this}} movie, but it shouldn't be what it's about." [...] Lindelof {{said that the}} film could instead run parallel to the Alien series and that a sequel would be Prometheus 2 and not Alien, and submitted an idea for how such a sequel could work. Lindelof met with the producers the following morning, and was hired shortly afterward in late 2010. Under Lindelof, the script diverged from Spaihts's Alien prequel into an original creation. Scott and Lindelof worked together five days a week between July and August 2010 to construct the vision Scott wanted to convey and decide what script changes were needed, including scaling back the Alien symbolism and tropes. In August and September 2010, Lindelof spent almost five weeks writing his first draft, which he submitted in mid-September 2010. Inspired by Blade Runner and Spaihts's script, Lindelof thought that it would be possible to combine an Alien story of action and horror with [...] "the Blade Runner thematic," [...] to ask bigger questions than he felt were normally posed in science fiction films. Lindelof said, ...|$|E

You might find {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>'em</b> to-night. I know Henwood's pretty well pumped dry." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{this was}} the way it was. It was night when I kem up here [...] <b>To</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>'em</b> all [...] "good-by," [...] for I {{reckoned}} to go for deer [...] At [...] "sun up" [...] the day they left. So I shook 'em all round by the hand, [...] 'Cept Mabel, and she was sick, ez they give me to understand.|$|R
6000|$|... "So she is, so she is," [...] {{said the}} Captain, with fatherly pride. [...] "Sally's the very {{image of her}} ma at her age--black eyes, black hair, tall and trim as a spruce-tree, and steps off {{as if she had}} springs in her heels. I tell you, the feller'll have to be spry that catches her. There's two or three of 'em at it, I see; but Sally won't have nothin' <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>'em.</b> I hope she won't, yet awhile." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No indeed; but, Linda, I {{will tell}} you what I have always thought about young men. They are very nice, and all that; and when old croaking hunkses have told me that I should have nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> I have always {{answered}} that I meant to have as much <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> as possible; but it is like eating good things;--everybody likes eating good things, but one feels ashamed of doing it in secret." ...|$|E
60|$|One morning, about a {{month after}} this, George Shelby called all his {{servants}} together, telling them he had something <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
60|$|Two of {{the more}} enterprising of the journalists caught them up upon the pavement. Miss Penelope Morse, however, had little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{tools are}} my lancet and my drugs," [...] said he, quietly, [...] "and all I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> refers <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> It suits my purpose {{to become the}} {{principal}} medical man in this neighbourhood--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I can't <b>say</b> they have. <b>To</b> <b>say</b> truth, considerin' that Hendrick's a {{relation}} o' the Redskins an' that Master Paul is his friend, I {{thought it best}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>them</b> about it. So I'll--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly you may," [...] {{he replied}} with dignity. [...] "Only before you speak, {{let me put}} this plain {{question}} to you: Do you ask us {{to provide you with}} garments--that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> bestow <b>them</b> as a gift on you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm here to {{take orders}} and to wait on customers. I've got nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> and I don't want them to say {{anything}} to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|JAMES. But what am I <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them?</b> ['Mr. Shand's compliments, {{and he will}} {{be proud}} to receive them' is the very least that the Wylies expect.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But what am I <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them?</b> What {{explanation}} can I give? What {{story can}} I tell them? Can't {{you see what}} a hole you've put me in?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will you {{thank the}} queen and princess for their kindness," [...] Roger said, [...] "and say that, much as I should like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> goodbye <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> I would not that they should run any risks by coming to see me?" ...|$|R
60|$|The men quietly obeyed this order. Leif did {{not think}} it {{necessary}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> more <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> but <b>to</b> Hengler and two others who had been selected as leaders he revealed more minutely the intended plan of action before they lay down.|$|R
60|$|And, verily, as I {{was going}} forth of the doors, I had much ado <b>to</b> forbear <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> that I carried {{the peace of}} God along with me; but I held my peace, and, blessed be the Lord, went away to prison, with God's comfort in my poor soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can I go {{out without}} seeing those others?" [...] she asked. [...] "I really have nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> {{and this has}} been quite a shock to me." ...|$|E
60|$|HORNBLOWER. [With {{the first}} sign of uneasiness] I've seen these people. I've nothing more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> I told 'em I'd give 'em five pounds to cover their moving.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. McKinstry {{passed his}} three whole fingers over his {{forehead}} and eyes as if troubled by a drowsy aching. [...] "Then you don't reckon to hev anythin' <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> Harrisons?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My brother {{sees his}} young men," [...] said le Bourdon, quietly, the instant a dead calm had succeeded to the outcries {{with which he}} had been greeted. [...] "I thought he might wish <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> and my bees told me where <b>to</b> find <b>them.</b> Does my brother wish to know anything else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may be as}} you say, sir," [...] {{returned}} Adams, [...] "but I can't exactly {{feel that}} I'm fit <b>to</b> <b>say</b> much <b>to</b> <b>'em</b> about that.

6000|$|Wal. By Siegfried's sword, My {{words are}} true, and I came here <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>them,</b> <b>To</b> thee, my son {{in all but}} blood. Mass, I'm no gossip. Why? What ails the boy? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay--ay--Morganic, you'll {{be remembered}} in proper time. In the mean while, keep your people's eyes open, {{so as not}} to lose sight of the French. We shall have {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> in the morning." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{the mention}} of the women and {{children}} being required to assemble along with them, the natives pricked up their ears, and, as a matter of course, they willingly agreed to listen to all that the missionary had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You've only <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{the word}}," [...] {{continued}} Pat, {{in a low}} voice, [...] "you've only <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the word <b>to</b> <b>them</b> boys as 'll be there to-night, and they'll see you righted with Keegan." ...|$|R
60|$|The man {{shut the}} gate after <b>them,</b> {{and then began}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>them,</b> very fluently and earnestly, pointing {{at the same time}} to a door which opened upon a gallery that extended along the wall of a tower near by. As soon as he had finished what seemed to be some sort of explanation, he left the party standing in the court, and returned to his work.|$|R

"There's {{all sorts}} o' genelmen here," [...] Bob went on, {{turning over the}} leaves with some excitement, [...] "wi' all sorts o' nones,--an' some bald an' some wi' wigs,--Parlament genelmen, I reckon.

My eyes! I wonder what the chaps wear as go a-courtin' 'em! I sot up till the clock was gone twelve last night, a-lookin' at 'em,--I did,--till they stared at me out o' the picturs as if they'd know when I spoke <b>to</b> <b>'em.</b> But, lors! I shouldn't know what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>'em.</b> They'll be more fittin' company for you, Miss; and the man at the book-stall, he said they banged iverything for picturs; he said they was a fust-rate article." ...|$|R
60|$|WILDER. [Lashing himself.] If any {{one expects}} me <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them</b> I've lost you fifty {{thousand}} pounds and sooner than put my pride {{in my pocket}} I'll lose you another. [Glancing at ANTHONY.] It's--it's unnatural! I don't want to go against you, sir.|$|E
6000|$|This fact, {{more than}} any other, brought home to James the real danger of the situation. It was always like this with these 'artistic' chaps; a {{sensible}} man should have nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> He had warned Irene, too. And see what had come of it! ...|$|E
6000|$|Bambro' {{started in}} his chair. What could the fierce {{leader of the}} Bretons, {{a man who was}} red to the elbow with English blood, have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>them?</b> On what errand had he left his castle of Josselin to pay this visit to his deadly enemies? ...|$|E
60|$|And so on, in all {{the spirit}} and ardour of that charming hymn. These are no ideal pleasures, they are real delights; and I ask, what of the delights among the sons of men are superior, not <b>to</b> <b>say</b> equal <b>to</b> <b>them?</b> And they have this precious, vast addition, that {{conscious}} virtue stamps them for her own; and lays hold on <b>them</b> <b>to</b> bring herself into {{the presence of a}} witnessing, judging, and approving God.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{will you}} be able to spare me for a quarter-of-an-hour, father?

They would give their ears, some of <b>them,</b> I know, <b>to</b> be in my place. I should like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> good-bye, too, <b>to</b> old Marshall.

25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> no <b>to</b> <b>them</b> (Roberto, 2005).|$|R
