In the ensuing power struggle, Qa'itbay was forced to flee and received refuge in Choueifat, before relocating to Beirut; there, he accrued funds to bribe the governor of Damascus, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, to replace Hasan as the <b>tax</b> <b>farmer</b> of Keserwan. Hasan and Husayn sought to reconcile with their half-brother, but as they entered Beirut, they were killed in an ambush ordered by Qa'itbay. In his subsequent assertion of control over Keserwan, Jbeil and Beirut, Qa'itbay was backed by Janbirdi al-Ghazali, the ex-Mamluk Ottoman governor of Damascus Eyalet. Despite al-Ghazali's revolt against the Ottomans and its subsequent suppression in 1521, the authorities did not punish Qa'itbay for his alliance with al-Ghazali. However, the death of al-Ghazali represented {{the loss of a}} major political patron of the emir.|$|E

25|$|Diicul Buicescul {{was married}} twice, to a Dumitra of Arcești, and later, {{according}} to some disputed records, to a Lady Bălașa. Buicescul's eldest son, the Paharnic Papa, born ca. 1630–1633, was probably groomed by Rákóczi to take over as puppet ruler of Wallachia, following his father's mutilation—this alliance was superseded in 1655, when Constantin Șerban willingly submitted to Transylvania's leadership. Nonetheless, Papa remained figure of political importance {{until his death in}} 1688. He took in marriage the daughter of another Spatharios, Pană Filipescu, who had helped defeat Hrizea in 1655. A second son, Preda, settled in Transylvania, marrying Ana, a daughter of the diplomat István Szalánczy. Their daughter, born Stanca and later known as Sára Bulcsesdi-Székely-Haller, was one of the leading aristocrats of Kolozsvár (Cluj). According to Ionașcu, the son recorded as ill was neither Papa nor Preda, but an anonymous third, who did not survive 1654. One document suggests that Diicul had also adopted his nephew, Tudor, who worked as a <b>tax</b> <b>farmer,</b> with the title of Great Căminar.|$|E
50|$|In 1770, {{hundreds}} of watchmakers fled the political ructions in Geneva {{and went to}} make a new life at Ferney. Voltaire helped them to set up a new watchmaking business. He negotiated a tax exemption for the watchmakers with the duc de Choiseul, Prime Minister of France. But by 1774, the business was prospering and the <b>tax</b> <b>farmers</b> started to take an interest. Three-way negotiations between the <b>tax</b> <b>farmers,</b> Voltaire and Turgot ensued. In December 1775, Turgot confirmed the watchmakers' exemption from the salt tax (gabelle) and from road maintenance duties (corvée) and a figure was agreed to compensate the <b>tax</b> <b>farmers</b> for loss of revenue. Voltaire addressed a public meeting on 12 December and the watchmakers accepted the settlement.|$|R

40|$|Historically, governments {{contracted}} with private agents known as <b>tax</b> <b>farmers</b> to collect <b>taxes.</b> This paper develops {{a theoretical framework}} for determining when a welfare-maximizing government should choose <b>tax</b> <b>farmers</b> over bureaucratic <b>tax</b> collectors. While bureaucratic collectors {{have an incentive to}} shirk and raise collection costs above least costs, profit-maximizing private collectors tend to reduce tax evasion below the optimal level. Generally, the choice of collection methods depends on a comparison of the welfare loss associated with monitoring in the bureaucratic setting and the welfare loss associated with overdetection of evasion in the private setting.

50|$|The key {{flaw in the}} tax {{farming system}} is {{the tension between the}} state, which seeks a {{long-term}} source of taxation revenue, and the <b>tax</b> <b>farmers,</b> who seek to make a profit on their investment in as short a time as possible. As a result, tax-farmers often abuse the taxpayers in various ways, tending them to switch their economic activity from strategic long-term projects to short-term revenue generation. A common abuse by <b>tax</b> <b>farmers</b> is the undervaluation of goods received in lieu of taxes, allowing the tax-farmer to re-sell the goods to create a second profit source. Such abuses stifle economic growth by restricting the ability of the tradesman to reinvest in his business, thereby limiting the quantity of taxes generated over the long-term.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>farmers</b> did {{not usually}} deal with individuals; the tax was imposed on a {{community}} or other polity, {{and how the}} community raised the funds to pay the tax was its own business.

50|$|Qing {{had three}} main {{policies}} {{relating to the}} governance of Taiwan. The first policy was to restrict the qualification and number of migrants who were allowed to cross the Taiwan strait and settle in Taiwan. This was to prevent a rapid growth in population. The second policy was to restrict Han Chinese from entering the mountain area which was mainly settled by Indigenous Taiwanese peoples. This policy was to prevent conflict between the two groups. The third was to apply different tax policies for Han immigrants and aboriginal people. The colonial government first sold farming rights of land to urban businessmen, and then these rights-owners would rent out portions of the land to individual farm laborers from the mainland. Because of the high population from Fujian Province, demand for land was high, and therefore rents were also high and migrant laborers usually didn't make much profit. For aboriginal groups, <b>tax</b> <b>farmers</b> were used. The government recognized aboriginal rights to land, but per-village tax was also imposed. The tax was not paid directly, but by merchants who were buying the right to collect taxes for themselves. The <b>tax</b> <b>farmers,</b> and their interpreters and foremen, {{were known to be}} corrupt and commit abuses, especially against Aborigines. Besides, corvée labor was included. The result seemed good, since the tax policies made convenient revenue for the government, landowners, <b>tax</b> <b>farmers,</b> yet Han and aboriginal people were struggling.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} source of revenue, collectively known as gemene middelen (common means), were a set of excise taxes on first necessities, especially on beer, wine, peat, grain, salt, {{and the use of}} market scales. These were essentially transaction taxes, as they were levied at a fixed rate, not ad valorem (the revenue stamps introduced later in the 17th century basically fall in the same category as they tax transactions in commerce). In the 1630s this type of tax accounted for two-thirds of Holland's revenue. It then amounted to about ten guilders per capita (while per capita income for most people may have been much lower than the average of about 150 guilders a year). These taxes were levied on the seller of the good, who presumably passed them on to the consumer. They were collected by <b>tax</b> <b>farmers,</b> who bought their farms at auction, at least until the Pachtersoproer in 1748 put a stop to this practice. In Holland the real abuses of the system, though perceived to be great, may not have been as serious as the French abuses of the tax farms in that country. This was, because the <b>tax</b> <b>farmers</b> were numerous, low-status, and politically subordinate to the city Regenten, for which they formed a convenient barrier against popular discontent. Because of this weak position the Dutch <b>tax</b> <b>farmers</b> may have been less able than their French colleagues to exploit their privileges.|$|R
50|$|Many {{appointed}} as <b>tax</b> <b>farmers</b> absconded {{with as much}} revenue as they could during the time period between inspections. The British Parliament took note of the disastrous consequences of the system, and in 1784, British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger directed the Calcutta administration to alter it immediately. In 1786 Charles Cornwallis was sent out to India to reform the company's practices.|$|R
