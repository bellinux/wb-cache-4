500|$|The 43-minute, 56-second {{episode was}} {{developed}} from {{a story by}} Ronald D. Moore and Bryan Fuller, who wrote the teleplay, and was directed by Mike Vejar. David Bell edited the music, and Richard D. James was the production designer. The concept for the episode developed from Moore's failed pitch for the [...] episode [...] "Soldiers of the Empire", which {{would have seen the}} Klingon starship Rotarran travel to Gre'thor. Moore's idea was rejected as [...] "too philosophical for <b>this</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] ". The barge would later appear in Star Trek Online, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Cryptic Studios based on the Star Trek franchise.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Rare" [...] is an electropop {{and folk}} pop {{influenced}} ballad, that has [...] "an acoustic guitar and galloping beat". Lyrically, [...] "Rare" [...] discusses finding {{love in the}} [...] "perfect" [...] man, presumably Shelton. Patrick Ryan of USA Today called [...] "Rare" [...] an [...] "outright declaration of love for Shelton", summarizing the song as [...] "a rare moment of vulnerability for the singer who, for the most part, keeps her emotions close to her vest." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly declared the song a [...] "sweetly smitten confessional". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times described the lyrics as [...] "her shock to have found someone <b>this</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game", while Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe felt that the lyrics observe [...] "that 'only a stupid girl' would let the 'perfect' man go." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the National Weather Service in Detroit, tornadoes <b>this</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year in Michigan are rare. The last {{significant}} October tornado {{event was}} on October 24, 2001, when three tornadoes hit southeastern Lower Michigan, {{out of a}} total of nine in the state that day. Including the 2001 tornadoes, only seven October tornadoes had been recorded in the NWS Detroit county warning area prior to the 2007 outbreak. [...] By comparison, NWS Detroit had confirmed five tornadoes in its coverage area from this outbreak. It was also the largest October outbreak over western Kentucky and southern Indiana as 15 tornadoes were confirmed on October 18. [...] Previous to this outbreak, only 19 tornadoes had been recorded in that same region during the history of October prior to this event. The Owensboro tornado, which was rated an EF3 was also the strongest ever in that month over the same region since records were kept in 1950 although an unofficial F3 took place in Posey County, Indiana on October 16, 1928.|$|E

500|$|... "Jerry's Painting" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis {{called the}} episode [...] "one that may just {{have been the}} season's best — and that’s saying something when a show is as consistent as this one". She called the main plotline about the painting [...] "brilliant" [...] and said the subplot with Ben, April and Andy was so funny she hoped they had more pairings in the future. Nick McHatton of TV Fanatic called [...] "Jerry's Painting" [...] {{one of the strongest}} episodes of the season, and said he enjoyed seeing Leslie's character so empowered. McHatton also praised seeing April and Andy facing adulthood, writing, [...] "It's something many of us young adults go through and it was nice to see it reflected" [...] in the characters. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic said the show demonstrated how Leslie Knope has developed into a strong and confident character since the [...] "daffy, wide-eyed dreamer" [...] she was in the first season. He also praised the show's [...] "new funniest pairing" [...] of Ben, April and Andy, and said the episode demonstrated that [...] "even <b>this</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season, the show can still feel surprising and fresh".|$|E
2500|$|On January 27, 2014, {{a version}} of the White House OMB's marked up version of the bill was leaked. This White House version [...] "move away from {{standards}} and toward open data structures to publish information" [...] and [...] "requir OMB in consultation with Treasury to 'review and, if necessary, revise standards to ensure accuracy and consistency through methods such as establishing linkages between data in agency financial systems ...'" [...] Senator Warner's responded with the following statement: [...] "The Obama administration talks a lot about transparency, but these comments reflect a clear attempt to gut the DATA Act. DATA reflects years of bipartisan, bicameral work, and to propose substantial, unproductive changes <b>this</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game is unacceptable. We look forward to passing the DATA Act, which had near universal support in its House passage and passed unanimously out of its Senate committee. I will not back down from a bill that holds the government accountable and provides taxpayers the transparency they deserve." ...|$|E

6000|$|We left a dozen {{passengers}} in Constantinople, and sailed through the beautiful Bosporus and far {{up into the}} Black Sea. We left them in the clutches of the celebrated Turkish guide, [...] "FAR-AWAY MOSES," [...] who will seduce them into buying a ship-load of ottar of roses, splendid Turkish vestments, {{and all manner of}} curious things they can never have any use for. Murray's invaluable guide-books have mentioned 'Far-away Moses' name, and he is a made man. He rejoices daily in {{the fact that he is}} a recognized celebrity. However, we can not alter our established customs to please the whims of guides; we can not show partialities <b>this</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> day. Therefore, ignoring this fellow's brilliant fame, and ignoring the fanciful name he takes such pride in, we called him Ferguson, just as we had done with all other guides. It has kept him in a state of smothered exasperation all the time. Yet we meant him no harm. After he has gotten himself up regardless of expense, in showy, baggy trowsers, yellow, pointed slippers, fiery fez, silken jacket of blue, voluminous waist-sash of fancy Persian stuff filled with a battery of silver-mounted horse-pistols, and has strapped on his terrible scimitar, he considers it an unspeakable humiliation to be called Ferguson. It can not be helped. All guides are Fergusons to us. We can not master their dreadful foreign names.|$|E

50|$|Southern Ontario usually {{receives}} {{about a dozen}} tornadoes each year, {{with most}} of them occurring between May and September.

The only other tornado <b>this</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season occurred near Leamington on November 29, 1919.|$|E
5000|$|Ryan McGee of The A.V.

There are some great ideas here {{that no amount of}} screen time would ever sufficiently answer. But those ideas still needed more screen time to sufficiently debate. Still, in a season as subpar as this has been, it’s heartening to see the show can still recapture some of its past heights <b>this</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game." ...|$|E
