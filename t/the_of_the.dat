500|$|The cantata {{text was}} {{provided}} by Erdmann Neumeister, published in Geistliche Poesien in Frankfurt in 1714. He began and ended his work with a hymn stanza. [...] "" [...] is the main hymn for Advent, which Martin Luther had derived from the Latin [...] Its melody is based on Medieval chant and supplies a [...] "dark, imposing character". For the conclusion, Neumeister chose the second part, <b>the</b> , <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seventh and final stanza of Philipp Nicolai's [...] "". The librettist quoted the Book of Revelation in the fourth movement: [...] ""– [...] "Behold, I stand {{at the door and}} knock. Anyone that hears My voice and opens the door, to him I will enter and keep the evening meal with him and he with me." [...] (...) [...] The poet combined the ideas of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his promise to return with an invitation to enter the heart of the individual Christian. He developed his thoughts like a sermon, as the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr notes: mentioning that the arrival of Jesus brings blessing every day (movement 2), a prayer that Jesus may come to his congregation (movement 2), and in response to his statement of being at the door (movement 4) the opening of the heart of the individual Christian who knows about his sinfulness (movement 5). Bach had set one text by Neumeister before, possibly by 1713, in his cantata Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18.|$|E
