40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a temperature-aware DFS (Dynamic Frequency Scaling) {{technique}} using the performance counters {{that is already}} embedded in the commercial microprocessors. By using performance counters and simple regression analysis, we can predict the localized temperature and efficiently schedule the tasks considering the temperature. The proposed technique is especially beneficial to potential localized thermal problems that are inevitable due to limited number of costly CMOS <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors.</b> When localized <b>thermal</b> problems that were not detected by <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> are found after fabrication, the thermal problems can be avoided by the proposed software solution without re-fabrication costs.

30|$|Dynamic thermal {{management}} techniques employ {{a set of}} on-chip <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> to measure runtime thermal behavior of microprocessors so as to prevent the on-set of high temperatures. Therefore, effective analysis of thermal behavior and determination of the best allocation and placement of <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> directly impact {{the effectiveness of the}} dynamic {{thermal management}} mechanisms. In this paper, we propose systematic and effective techniques for determining the fewest number of <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> and the optimal locations based on dual clustering to provide a high fidelity thermal monitoring. Initially, we utilize the dual clustering algorithm to devise method that can reduce the number of sensors to a great extent while satisfying an expected accuracy. Then we identify an optimal physical location for each sensor such that the sensor’s attraction towards steep thermal gradient is maximized. Experimental results indicate the superiority of our techniques and confirm that our proposed methods are capable of creating a sensor distribution for a given microprocessor architecture using the number of <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> of 2, 8, 15, 24, 35, depending on different expected hot spot temperature error accuracy of 5 %, 4 %, 3 %, 2 %, 1 %, respectively.|$|R

40|$|Ground {{penetrating}} {{radar and}} <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> hold much promise {{for the detection}} of non-metallic land mines. In previous work we have shown that the performance of ground penetrating radar strongly depends on field soil conditions such as texture, water content, and soil-water salinity since these soil parameters determine the dielectric soil properties. From soil physics and field measurements we know that the performance of <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> also strongly depends on soil texture and water content. There is it critical that field soil conditions are taken into account when radar and <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> are employed. The objectives of this contribution are (i) to make an inventory of readily available soil data bases world wide and (ii) to investigate how the information contained in these data bases can be used for derivation of soil dielectric and thermal properties relevant for operation of land mine sensors...|$|R
50|$|In thermographic imaging, {{infrared}} radiation with wavelengths between 8-13 micrometers strikes the detector material, heating it, and thus changing its electrical resistance. This resistance change is measured and processed into temperatures {{which can be}} used to create an image. Unlike other types of infrared detecting equipment, microbolometers utilizing a transparent ceramic detector do not require cooling. Thus, a microbolometer is essentially an uncooled <b>thermal</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E

40|$|Temperature {{monitoring}} using <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> is {{an essential}} tool for evaluating the thermal behavior and sustaining the reliable operation in high-performance and high-power systems. With current technology scaling and integration trends timely and accurate detection of localized heating will be evermore important. In this work, we address {{the creation of a}} resource efficient sensor infrastructure for computing systems that are of regular nature, such as logic array-based computing platforms. We propose algorithms to embed <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> into a regular structure to minimize the number of sensors and determine sensor locations required to maintain a given accuracy in temperature sensing for a given design. Our algorithms are tailored for minimal usage of <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> to suit a variety of architectural conditions. For programmable logic arrays the highly application-specific usage of the hardware resources leads to unpredictable thermal profiles. As a result, post-manufacture instantiation of <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> is desired, which in turn demands the use of native hardware resources, which can be scarce. We demonstrate that using our techniques the number of sensors required to monitor a set of hotspots is reduced by 75 % on an average, across different sizes of logic arrays for different hotspot distributions compared to a uniform distribution of sensors throughout the fabrics...|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} means {{are used to}} control temperature. The {{simplest}} of these is a variable power control, much like a light dimmer, which changes the equilibrium temperature of the iron without automatically measuring or regulating the temperature. Another type of system uses a thermostat, often inside the iron's tip, which automatically switches power on and off to the element.

40|$|Flow sensing in hostile environments is of {{increasing}} interest for {{applications in the}} automotive, aerospace, and chemical and resource industries. There are thermal and non-thermal approaches for high-temperature flow measurement. Compared to their non-thermal counterparts, <b>thermal</b> flow <b>sensors</b> have recently attracted {{a great deal of}} interest due to the ease of fabrication, lack of moving parts and higher sensitivity. In recent years, various <b>thermal</b> flow <b>sensors</b> have been developed to operate at temperatures above 500 °C. Microelectronic technologies such as silicon-on-insulator (SOI), and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) have been used to make <b>thermal</b> flow <b>sensors.</b> <b>Thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> with various heating and sensing materials such as metals, semiconductors, polymers and ceramics can be selected according to the targeted working temperature.

30|$|Moreover, {{accuracy}} is another crucial criterion for dynamic thermal management techniques. Overestimation of temperature results in spurious alerts {{that lead to}} unnecessary triggering of thermal control mechanisms, e.g., DVFS (Long et al. 2008; Memik et al. 2008). On the other hand, underestimation of temperature greatly reduces the reliability since the processor will continue to operate at a higher temperature than its rated operating condition (Long et al. 2008; Memik et al. 2008). Embedding {{a large number of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> on the die is an unadvisable option to increase the accuracy. In fact, chips need to use the fewest number of <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> to reduce manufacturing costs, die area and design complexity. In addition, allocating arbitrarily large number of sensors employed by the monitoring infrastructure, constructing the sensor networks will also pose a challenge (Long et al. 2008). An ideal goal is to monitor the highest temperatures on a microprocessor with allocating a minimum number of <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors.</b> As a result, how to provide accurate thermal monitoring in a given system while maintaining a reasonable number of sensors becomes crucial.|$|R

A <b>thermal</b> <b>sensor</b> can detect variations to heat transfers {{into and out of}} near surface layers because of external heating by the thermal processes of conduction, convection, and radiation. Microwave remote sensing from satellites has also proven useful as it has an advantage over TIR of not being effected by cloud cover.|$|E
50|$|A linear {{induction}} motor consists of two parts: the primary coil assembly and the reaction plate. The primary coil assembly consists of phase windings surrounded by steel laminations, and includes a <b>thermal</b> <b>sensor</b> within a thermal epoxy. The reaction plate consists of a 3.2 mm (0.125 inch) thick aluminum or copper plate bonded to a 6.4 mm (0.25 inch) thick cold rolled steel sheet. There is an air gap between these two parts that creates the frictionless property an electromagnetic propulsion system encompasses. Functioning of a linear {{induction motor}} begins with an AC force that is supplied to the coil windings within the primary coil assembly. This creates a traveling magnetic field that induces a current in the reaction plate, which then creates its own magnetic field. The magnetic fields in the primary coil assembly and reaction plate alternate, which generates force and direct linear motion.|$|E

The <b>thermal</b> wind <b>sensor</b> can measure wind speed and direction at the same time, by measuring the temperature gradient on the sensor’s surface which is induced by the wind flow. Compared to traditional mechanical wind sensors, {{there are two main}} advantages for thermal wind sensors: Firstly, <b>thermal</b> <b>sensors</b> can measure the wind flow without any moving parts, thus no maintenance is required.
