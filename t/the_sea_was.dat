5|$|Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} in December 2004 to mixed reviews from critics and bombed {{at the box}} office. Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee and former Darin manager Steve Blauner responded with enthusiastic feedback to Spacey's work on the film. Despite a number of negative reviews, some critics praised Spacey's performance, largely due to his decision to use his own singing voice. He received a Golden Globe nomination.|$|E

5|$|The {{inventor}} of the electric telegraph, Francis Ronalds, lived on Chiswick Lane from 1833 to 1852. Another engineer, John Edward Thornycroft was born in Chiswick in 1872; his father, John Isaac Thornycroft, had founded the Chiswick-based John I. Thornycroft & Company shipbuilding company in 1864, which Thornycroft later joined and developed.

5|$|Ancient Hawaiians {{were the}} first to {{recognize}} the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands. The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>was</b> a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by volcanologist Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands. In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii's seafloor.|$|E

5|$|In February 2003, it was {{announced}} that production for Beyond <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>was</b> becoming fast tracked with Spacey as lead actor, co-writer, producer and director, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) agreed to cover distribution duties in North America. The following August, with principal photography to begin in just weeks, MGM dropped out as distributor and main financier over scheduling conflicts. To accumulate financing of the film's $25 million budget, which came from foreign production companies, Spacey performed six songs at the November 2003 American Film Market. Lions Gate Entertainment quickly picked up the distribution duties and Spacey found enough investors from England and Germany to continue to move forward on production.|$|E
5|$|In October, {{the second}} unit {{travelled}} to Nassau to film the underwater sequences. To perform the car becoming a submarine, seven different models were used, {{one for each}} step of the transformation. One of the models was a fully mobile submarine equipped with an engine built by Miami-based Perry Submarines. The car seen entering <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>was</b> a mock-up shell, propelled off the jetty by a compressed air cannon. During the model sequences, the air bubbles seen appearing from the vehicle were created by Alka-Seltzer tablets.|$|E

5|$|On {{sighting}} land, {{the crew}} persuaded the Malagasy {{that what they}} saw {{was a part of}} Madagascar the mutineers were unfamiliar with: after further subterfuge by the crew, the Malagasy set Meermin to drift towards the shore at Struisbaai. But <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>was</b> rough, and one of the ship's masts was cut down to improve her balance. Meermin eventually grounded on a sandbank, by which time a militia consisting of local farmers and burghers had been formed onshore, who had observed that the ship was flying no flags, which they recognised as a distress signal. The militia killed or captured those of the Malagasy who ventured ashore, and then organised the removal into custody of all Malagasy remaining on the ship, under the command of a magistrate from Stellenbosch. Meermin was assessed as beyond recovery, and left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately {{the revolutionary}} {{excesses of the}} period would prove {{disastrous}} for the French Navy. Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the French officer corps. The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure {{at the hands of}} more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>was</b> crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20years earlier.|$|E
5|$|Walmer Castle was {{the first}} to be besieged and {{surrendered}} on 12 July. An earthwork fort was then built between Sandown and Deal, who each may have been defended by around 150 men each. Deal, which had been resupplied by the Royalists from <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> <b>was</b> besieged in July. A Royalist fleet bombarded the Parliamentary positions and temporarily landed a force 1,500 Flemish mercenaries in support of the revolt, but a shortage of money forced their return to the Continent. The fleet, under the command of Prince Charles, attempted to landed a fresh force in August, but despite three attempts the operation failed and suffered heavy losses. Deal surrendered on 25 August, followed by Sandown on 5 September.|$|E

5|$|When {{repairs to}} Craven Sluices were {{necessary}} in 1684, {{the water was}} temporarily diverted into Scots Float Channel. This worked well, and a regulating penn was built, so that water could be routed to Craven Sluices or Scots Float. Knock Sluice was built below the Appledore Sluice in 1686, and land above it was reclaimed. In 1696, New Knock Sluice was built, close to Craven Sluices, and <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>was</b> finally excluded from the Wittersham Levels.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Devonian period (400 Mya) <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>was</b> retreating from the Welsh Basin as the land was thrust up by the collision of land masses, forming a new range of mountains, the Welsh Caledonides. The strata were compressed and deformed, and in places, the clay minerals recrystallised, developing a grain that allowed parallel cleavage, making it easy to split the rocks into thin flat sheets of stone known as slate. In the Carboniferous period (360 to 300 Mya), erosion of the mountains resulted in the formation of sandstones and mudstones. A reinvasion of southern and northeastern parts of Wales by the sea resulted in depositions of limestone, and extensive swamps in South Wales gave rise to peat deposits and the eventual formation of coal measures. Southwestern Wales, in particular, was affected by the Variscan orogeny, a period when continental collisions further south caused complex folding and fracturing of the strata.|$|E

5|$|During 1941 and {{the first}} months of 1942 Japan conquered or {{established}} de facto rule over almost the entire South China Sea region. Control of <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>was</b> vital to the Japanese economy, as it was the conduit through which essential supplies of oil and other natural resources passed from occupied Malaya, Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. As the war turned against Japan, convoys of ships passing through the South China Sea frequently came under attack from Allied submarines and – by late 1944 – aircraft. These attacks were guided by information gained from signals intelligence and long-range air patrols, supplemented by reports from coast watchers along the Chinese coast and other observers in Asian ports. While losses of oil tankers and freighters were increasingly heavy, the Japanese Government continued to order ships to make the voyage. In an attempt to limit losses, convoys and individual ships took routes well way from the established sea lanes, or sailed close to the shore and operated only at night.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and The Shadow of the Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and The Shadow of the Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>was</b> performed at the same venue in February the following year. The Shadow of the Glen, under the title In the Shadow of the Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E
5|$|In 533, taking {{advantage}} of the absence of the Vandal fleet, sent to suppress a revolt in Sardinia, an army of 15,000 under Belisarius was transported to Africa by an invasion fleet of 92 dromons and 500 transports, beginning the Vandalic War, the first of the wars of reconquest of Emperor Justinian I (527–565). These were largely amphibious operations, made possible by the control of the Mediterranean waterways, and the fleet played a vital role in carrying supplies and reinforcements to the widely dispersed Byzantine expeditionary forces and garrisons. This fact was not lost on the Byzantines' enemies. Already in the 520s, Theodoric had planned to build a massive fleet directed against the Byzantines and the Vandals, but his death in 526 limited {{the extent to which these}} plans were realized. In 535, the Gothic War began with a double-pronged Byzantine offensive, with a fleet again carrying Belisarius' army to Sicily and then Italy, and another army invading Dalmatia. Byzantine control of <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>was</b> of great strategic importance, allowing the smaller Byzantine army to successfully occupy the peninsula by 540.|$|E
