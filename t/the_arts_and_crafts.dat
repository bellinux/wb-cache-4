5|$|Established in 1998, <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> Village is a children's {{cultural}} center with {{the objectives of}} promoting comprehensive, regular and periodic documentation of creative art {{in all of its}} forms. It interacted on a large scale with a class of artists from different nationalities and organized around 100 exhibitions for creative art, ceramics, graphics, carvings and others. Nearly 10,000 children from throughout the Gaza Strip have benefited from <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> Village.|$|E

5|$|The building, though {{based on}} Classical {{architecture}} {{is not entirely}} a Classical building. Its rooflines, main entrance, and the placement and style of the windows are all asymmetrical in nature, a hallmark of <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> style. Its simple massing and noticeable lack of ornamentation throughout the structure connects the building closely to <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> movement. This influence is seen most prominently on the building's interior.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{greatest}} influences on Tolkien was <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> polymath William Morris. Tolkien wished to imitate Morris's prose and poetry romances, from which he took hints for the names of features such as the Dead Marshes in The Lord of the Rings and Mirkwood, along with some general aspects of approach.|$|E

5|$|Hollamby {{was born}} in his parental home of 6 Wellesley Avenue in Hammersmith, West London. He was the oldest of two sons born to Ethel May Hollamby, née Kingdom (1899/1900–1966), and Edward Thomas Hollamby (1893–1978), a police constable. His primary {{education}} took place at St. Peter's Church School, before he won a scholarship to study at a junior technical school. From there, he gained a higher education by training in architecture at the nearby Hammersmith School of Arts and Crafts during the 1930s. At the college, he was inspired by <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> aesthetic propounded {{by one of his}} lecturers, Alwyn Waters, and through him came to take an interest in William Morris, who had been a pioneer of <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> movement {{in the latter part of}} the 19th century. At the same time, Hollamby was influenced by the modernist movement in architecture to which two of his favourite lecturers, Arthur Ling and Alex Lowe, belonged, and joined the Modern Architectural Research Group (MARS).|$|E
5|$|Morris’s {{aesthetic}} and social values became a leading force in <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> Movement. The Kelmscott Press influenced {{much of the}} fine press movement in England and the United States during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. It brought the need for books that were aesthetic objects as well as words to the attention of the reading and publishing worlds.|$|E
5|$|The house {{started as}} a small {{farmhouse}} in 1630 but was enlarged into its current form in the 18th century. The house was {{the property of the}} Napper family for centuries. It was given to the National Trust in 1954. <b>The</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> style garden is modeled on that at Hidcote Manor Garden in Gloucestershire. It was originally laid out by Phyllis Reiss and developed by Penelope Hobhouse.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>crafts</b> of Marrakesh {{have had}} a wide and {{enduring}} impact on Moroccan handicrafts to the present day. Riad décor is widely used in carpets and textiles, ceramics, woodwork, metal work and zelij. Carpets and textiles are weaved, sewn or embroidered, sometimes used for upholstering. Moroccan women who practice craftsmanship are known as Maalems (expert craftspeople) and make such fine products as Berber carpets and shawls made of sabra (cactus silk). Ceramics are in monochrome Berber-style only, a limited tradition depicting bold forms and decorations.|$|E
5|$|After {{working and}} {{training}} in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> Movement, {{but for most of}} his career he championed an unadorned style based on simplified forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing. Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by buildings' intended functions. After the First World War he increasingly simplified his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture. He {{was a member of the}} Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers' Guild. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.|$|E
5|$|Architectural designs {{resembling}} plants {{appear in}} the capitals of Ancient Egyptian columns, which were carved to resemble either the Egyptian white lotus or the papyrus. Ancient Greek columns of the Corinthian order are decorated with acanthus leaves. Islamic art, too, makes frequent use of plant motifs and patterns, including on column capitals. These designs became increasingly elaborate and stylised, appearing as complex arabesque and geometric motifs in objects such as the Ardabil Carpet and ten-pointed Persian ceramic star tiles, influencing the decorative arts in the Western world in such forms as the Rococo and later <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> movement.|$|E

5|$|As the Biddulphs were {{interested}} in <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> movement, using the manor house to give classes for villagers in crafts such as woodwork and embroidery. There were also plays and musical events for the villagers, including puppet shows for the children. Construction was paused during World War I and Barnsley died in 1926. The final part of the build was completed between 1926 and 1929 {{under the supervision of}} his brother, Sidney and his son-in-law, Norman Jewson. The built took a total of 23 years, largely due to the traditional methods being used, but also as no contractor was hired to manage the build.|$|E
5|$|Decorative tiles {{designed}} by Henry Chapman Mercer—one {{of the leading}} figures of <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> Movement in the U.S.—are placed throughout the building. These tiles (known as Moravian tiles after Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works) feature deep colors and a handmade appearance that complement the simple brick buildings. The tiles on the fireplaces and entry floors boast patterns in literary and educational themes, such as The Canterbury Tales in the old library. A large, tripartite tile mural on the north wall of the courtyard, also by Mercer, depicts the eastern and western hemispheres united by a ship on an allegorical journey of education.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} {{designed}} {{with an eye}} toward late 19th century and early 20th century movements in architecture. While it contains many elements common to Classical Revival architecture the building's asymmetry and playfully creative style are distinctly characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> Movement. The building was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Pond and Pond and is constructed of buff colored brick. Red brick belt coursing and accents contrast the buff colored brick on the majority of the facade. The two-story Oregon Public Library has a full brick basement and approximately 5,500 foot² (511 m²) of floor space.|$|E

5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and very simple ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century it was rented by a farmer for storage. Because of its poor {{condition}} it was recommended for demolition in both 1896 and 1901. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a public appeal {{to raise money}} for repairs to which Jane Morris, Thomas Hardy and George Bernard Shaw contributed. As the funding for the restoration was no longer an issue the building was acquired, in 1911, by the National Trust who employed Ernest Barnsley of the Barnsley brothers, <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> movement master builders, to design and the work. It was carried out by Norman Jewson and William Weir. The work left in place and strengthened earlier structures where possible but added new aspects including a stone buttress and a kitchen range.|$|E
5|$|Monotype's {{development}} of Ehrhardt took {{place under the}} influence of executive and historian of printing Stanley Morison, not long after their successful creation of Times New Roman. It began from a recognition that the Janson designs were well-respected by fine printers of <b>the</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>and</b> <b>Crafts</b> period such as Daniel Berkeley Updike, who could print books from them using hand-set type cast from surviving original matrices owned by the Stempel company of Germany. Morison had discussed what he knew of their history with Updike in their extensive correspondence from the 1920s onwards. Modernised versions of the Janson designs for hot metal printing were being created by Linotype and Monotype's American branch at the same time. In addition, Morison was interested in the history of printing in Leipzig, a centre of the German book trade, and would later write an article on the topic.|$|E
