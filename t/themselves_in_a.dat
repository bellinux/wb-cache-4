5|$|Although {{the general}} effects of {{invasive}} animals {{is not as}} profound as plants, they are more noticeable in many instances and {{a constant reminder of}} the many exotic species in the region. A wildlife biologist and several construction workers near Homestead Air Force Base witnessed a scene where several iguanas sunning <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> canal were attacked by a spectacled caiman, to the surprise of all.|$|E

5|$|Disk-shaped LC {{molecules}} can orient <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> layer-like fashion {{known as}} the discotic nematic phase. If the disks pack into stacks, the phase is called a discotic columnar. The columns themselves may be organized into rectangular or hexagonal arrays. Chiral discotic phases, similar to the chiral nematic phase, are also known.|$|E
5|$|Dutch team Twente were Borussia's {{opposition}} in the semi-finals. The first leg was held in West Germany and Borussia won 3–0 to put <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good position to reach the final going into the second leg in the Netherlands. Borussia won the second leg 2–1 to win the tie 5–1 on aggregate and progress to their first European final.|$|E

5|$|On 18 December 1944 Massachusetts and {{the other}} ships of TF 38 {{unexpectedly}} found <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fight for their lives when Typhoon Cobra overtook the force. At {{the time of the}} typhoon Massachusetts was sailing with the Third Fleet's Task Group 38.1 and reported one injured sailor and two planes lost {{as a result of the}} typhoon.|$|E
5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} found <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown {{and could be}} hostile, the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that {{to capitalize on the}} success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and defeat them.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} of the insurgency, the MNLA had largely split into small groups of guerrillas, which existed by basing <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chosen rural area, subverting local villagers and accumulating from them {{manpower}} and supplies. The lot of any security forces posted nearby was to play a constant game of hide-and-seek with the communists, whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up. The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever, and would, in time, simply give up attempting to regroup.|$|E

5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{modified}} form {{of one of}} the cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E
5|$|Even before Diarmait's demise, the Uí Chennselaig {{began to}} fight amongst <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{struggle}} {{that was almost}} certainly an after-effect of Diarmait's sons' untimely deaths. Specifically, the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters, and the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen reveal that Domnall battled {{against the forces of}} his own first cousin once removed, Donnchad mac Domnaill Remair (died 1089), before Diarmait's ally, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster (died 1086), was able to intervene and restore order in the Kingdom of Leinster.|$|E
5|$|Faced {{with the}} sudden {{appearance}} of the overwhelming Chinese forces, the ROK 1st Infantry Division tried to establish defensive positions by capturing the hills around Unsan. The South Koreans soon found <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> seesaw battle with the PVA 360th Regiment during the night of 25 October. The next day, the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong, completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division. Aided by airdrops, the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group, the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened the road on 27 October. Several more attempts to advance north by the Koreans made little progress, and the fighting stopped by 28 October.|$|E

Zero III informs the group that nine individual bracelet points are necessary to escape the facility, and points can only be earned by participating in the Ambidex Game.|$|E

Against the 0–13 Detroit Lions, the Colts found <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 21–21 game in the 4th quarter. Manning led his sixth game-winning drive {{of the season and}} the Colts pulled away 31–21. It marked their seventh straight win, seventh straight season with 10+ wins, and they became the only team in NFL history to have a winning streak of at least seven games in five straight seasons. Manning completed 28-of-37 passes for 318 yards and one touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Super Columbine Massacre RPG! is a {{role-playing}} video game. Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, the violence is not graphically rendered.|$|E

5|$|The {{general strike}} of 1950 {{began in the}} coal mining centres of Hainaut and quickly spread. Workers were soon on strike across Wallonia, Brussels, and, to a lesser extent, Flanders. The port of Antwerp {{was one of the}} key sites {{affected}} and the country was virtually paralysed. On 30 July, four workers were shot dead by the Gendarmerie at Grâce-Berleur, near Liège and the violence intensified. Staunch Leopoldists in the Government called for a stronger stance but found <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> minority, even in the PSC–CVP. Frustrated at the lack of progress, the Government threatened to resign en masse.|$|E
5|$|The story {{picks up}} {{approximately}} {{two weeks after}} the events of Guilty Gear X. In the time following Dizzy's disappearance, the mysterious Post-War Administration Bureau begins secretly investigating the Gears and fighters from previous tournaments for their own needs and ambitions. To achieve their goals the organization has created several mechanical copies of Ky Kiske, the “Robo-Kys”. In addition, fighters find <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reality beyond their control, most notably in the manipulative hands of the villainess I-No, who is revealed to be a servant of “That Man”, the creator of the Gears. Each character provides a different ending to Guilty Gear X2.|$|E
5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find <b>themselves</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strange high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E
