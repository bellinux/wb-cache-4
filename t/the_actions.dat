5|$|In another Buddhist text Majjhima Nikāya, the Buddha criticizes Jain {{emphasis}} on the destruction of unobservable and unverifiable types of karma {{as a means to}} end suffering, rather than on eliminating evil mental states such as greed, hatred and delusion, which are observable and verifiable. In the Upālisutta dialogue of this Majjhima Nikāya text, Buddha contends with a Jain monk who asserts that bodily actions are the most criminal, in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> of speech and mind. Buddha criticises this view, saying that <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> of mind are most criminal, and not <b>the</b> <b>actions</b> of speech or body. Buddha also criticises the Jain ascetic practice of various austerities, claiming that he, Buddha, is happier when not practising the austerities.|$|E

50|$|Bedding {{increases}} {{accuracy in}} part by relieving stress on <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> <b>The</b> rifle's <b>action</b> will rarely sit flush in the stock without bedding. This causes <b>the</b> <b>action</b> to flex when tightening the bolts holding <b>the</b> <b>action</b> to <b>the</b> stock. The flexing results {{in a loss of}} accuracy. Bedding will create a flush surface for <b>the</b> <b>action</b> and prevent flexing. Bedding also reduces movement of <b>the</b> <b>action</b> in <b>the</b> stock. Without bedding, <b>the</b> <b>action</b> {{may be more likely to}} shift after a shot. If <b>the</b> <b>action</b> shifts and does not return to same spot in the stock the rifle will lose the ability to maintain zero.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>action</b> {{could not}} be opened until a slight forward {{movement}} of the slide handle released <b>the</b> <b>action</b> slide lock. In firing, the recoil of the shotgun gave a slight forward motion to the slide handle and released <b>the</b> <b>action</b> slide lock which enabled immediate opening of <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> In <b>the</b> absence of any recoil, the slide handle had to be pushed forward manually in order to release <b>the</b> <b>action</b> slide lock.|$|R

50|$|Cebuano verbs act as predicates, {{or words}} that {{tell about the}} subject or the topic. This topic can be the doer of <b>the</b> <b>action,</b> <b>the</b> {{recipient}} of <b>the</b> <b>action,</b> <b>the</b> purpose for <b>the</b> <b>action,</b> or <b>the</b> means by which <b>the</b> <b>action</b> was made possible.

50|$|The {{complete}} {{aspect of}} a verb indicates <b>the</b> <b>action</b> has been completed.

The contemplative aspect of a verb indicates that <b>the</b> <b>action</b> has not happened but is anticipated.

50|$|For each skill a {{character}} has, {{they have an}} associated Action Value that states how good they are at that skill. When a skill is used, two six-sided dice are rolled.

The final value is <b>the</b> <b>Action</b> Result which is then compared {{to the difficulty of}} the task being performed. If <b>the</b> <b>Action</b> Result is {{greater than or equal to}} <b>the</b> difficulty, that <b>action</b> succeeds.
