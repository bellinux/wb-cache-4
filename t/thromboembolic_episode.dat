40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether the finding of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with venous thromboembolic episodes should influence the duration of treatment with anticoagulant drugs by mouth. METHODS [...] A retrospective study {{was carried out in}} 19 patients with antiphospholipid antibodies and a history of venous thromboembolic episodes. The median follow up from the first venous <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode</b> was 93 months and the median age at this episode was 26 years. The patients had in total 34 venous thromboembolic episodes. The total follow up period comprised 32 periods with and 23 periods without anticoagulant drugs. RESULTS [...] The probability of being free of recurrent venous thromboembolic episodes, calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, was significantly influenced by the use of anticoagulant drugs. Patients receiving oral anticoagulants had at eight years a 100 % probability of survival without recurrence, whereas patients in whom anticoagulant drugs were stopped had a 50 % probability of a recurrent venous <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode</b> at two years, and a 78 % probability of recurrence at eight years. CONCLUSION [...] Patients with venous thromboembolic episodes and antiphospholipid antibodies have a high risk for recurrent venous thromboembolic episodes and long term treatment with anticoagulant drugs by mouth is an effective prophylaxis...|$|E

The aim is to evaluate postextraction hemorrhagic or <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episodes</b> in patients who have been on anticoagulant medications for an uninterrupted period of 48 months. Results. Among the 108 patients evaluated, 215 extractions were performed in which there was only one case of postoperative bleeding. Warfarin was used by 98 patients; Warfarin associated with salicylic acetic acid by 9 patients and salicylic acetic acid in only 1 patient. As regards the serologic tests performed, International Normalized Ratio (INR) ranged from 0. 8 to 4. 9, with a mean of 3. 15. Conclusion. Extractions in patients on oral anticoagulants must be performed in the least traumatic manner possible. It is not necessary to stop anticoagulant therapy to perform extractions. Local hemostasis techniques, such as obliterative sutures alone are sufficient to prevent hemorrhagic complications...|$|R
40|$|Mean {{platelet}} volume {{has been}} proposed as a predictor for venous thromboembolism in cancer. We, therefore, investigated the effects of different anti-cancer drugs on mean platelet volume {{in order to assess}} its possible value in the risk prediction of a first <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode</b> in cancer outpatients during treatment. Pre-treatment mean platelet volumes were retrospectively evaluated in 589 ambulatory patients {{at the beginning of a}} new chemotherapy regimen. Moreover, serial changes were evaluated at baseline and before each chemotherapy cycle on 385 of the 589 patients who consented to have additional blood withdrawals during treatment. Cox proportional hazards survival analysis demonstrated a 2. 7 hazard ratio (P= 0. 01) of developing a first venous <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode</b> during chemotherapy for patients with baseline mean platelet volumes below the 10 (th) percentile (< 7. 3 fL). This index significantly declined during the first three months of chemotherapy (- 6 %; P< 0. 0001) reverting to baseline at the end of treatment. Multivariate regression analysis showed that normal baseline volumes (P= 0. 012) and platinum-based regimens (P= 0. 017) were both independent predictors of mean platelet volume decline during chemotherapy which, in turn, was associated with a 2. 4 hazard ratio (P= 0. 044) of venous thromboembolism. In conclusion, low pre-chemotherapy mean platelet volume might be regarded as a predictor of increased venous thromboembolism risk in cancer patients and chemotherapy further decreases platelet volumes, possibly due to drug-induced platelet activation and destruction. Changes in mean platelet volumes during chemotherapy might provide additional information on thromboembolic risk of patients treated with anti-cancer drugs, particularly platinum compounds...|$|E

40|$|Patients with a first venous thromboembolic {{event and}} a {{deficiency}} of the coagulation inhibitors antithrombin, protein C or protein S {{have an increased}} risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism compared to patients without such a deficiency.

The treatment decision involves continuation or discontinuation of vitamin K antagonists in patients with a first spontaneous or secondary venous thromboembolism and an antithrombin, protein C or S deficiency. Although the efficiency of oral anticoagulation is high in all age groups early after the first thromboembolic event, it decreases over time. Our analysis indicates that the optimal treatment duration will vary, {{depending on the type of}} the initial event (spontaneous or secondary; deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism), age, and time passed since the initial <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode.</b> Moreover, life-long duration of the prophylaxis seems not warranted in all patient...|$|E
40|$|A 53 -year-old female with atrial {{fibrillation}} underwenttransesophageal echocardiography for a suspected car-diac {{source of a}} <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode.</b> A thrombus was identified in the left atrial appendage. During the transesoph-ageal echocardiography, the thrombus disappeared, under direct visualization, from the left atrial appendage. Four hours later, the patient developed a stroke. We {{believe that this is}} the first case describing direct visualization of left atrial thrombus migration in the English-language literature. Se-quential frames are shown in the Figure. The development of neurological symptoms 4 hours (rather than immediately) after visualized thrombus migration is of interest. The luminal diameter of the internal carotid artery is highly variable, but it is unlikely that a 21 -cm thrombus entered the carotid artery system. We hypothesize that the observed clot migration was not the culprit event but that there were subsequent emboli, despite a therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time level of intravenous unfraction-ated heparin, resulting in the stroke.

40|$|BackgroundTraumatic and {{spontaneous}} dissections of internal carotid arteries (ICA) are rare conditions. So far, these pathologies are primarily treated conservatively, surgical revascularization being an option only after recurrent <b>thromboembolic</b> neurologic <b>episodes</b> or continuous aneurysm growth. Successful endovascular treatment strategies with covered stents {{have been reported}} in patients with ICA dissections. However, no long-term results are published so far. Herein, we report our experience of a combined conventional and endovascular repair of ICA dissections under reversed flow and their respective long-term results. MethodsIn a prospective evaluation of clinical and morphologic outcome of 6 patients with carotid artery dissections, 2 patients were treated for continuous aneurysm growth and 4 patients for high-grade ICA stenoses with recurrent <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episodes</b> during a 6 -month follow-up period. A 6 -mm polytetrafluoroethylene Hemobahn endoprosthesis was inserted under reversed flow of the internal carotid artery. ResultsNo perioperative strokes were observed; one TIA occurred, lasting less than 3 hours; no peripheral cranial nerve injuries or deaths were observed. No occlusions, hemodynamically significant stenosis, or recurrent neurologic symptoms were seen during follow-up, which ranged from 6 to 54 months (mean, 38. 3 months). ConclusionOpen endovascular repair of the ICA of symptomatic patients with dissections with a 6 -mm covered endoprosthesis is a safe alternative to conventional surgery, with excellent long-term patency...|$|R

40|$|Thrombophilia or hypercoagulable {{state is}} a {{clinical}} condition characterized by a tendency to develop venous (less frequently arterial) thrombosis. The development of a venous <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode</b> (VTE) {{is the result of}} environmental risk factors such as age, male sex, obesity, the exposure to “risk periods” of immobilization, trauma, cancer, pregnancy or the use of exogenous hormones or antineoplastic medications often on a background of a congenital procoagulant state. Table 1 summarizes the most frequently inherited and acquired thrombophilic conditions in a population of patients with a first episode of VTE. In patients with venous thrombosis before the early nineties a biologic cause of thrombophilia was detectable in only 5 % to 15 % of cases and was confined to deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S. The discovery of two prothrombotic mutations prevalent in white populations, the factor V-Arg 506 Gln mutation (factor V Leiden) and the prothrombin G 20210 A mutation has significantly increased the number of patients with recognizable hereditary risk factor.

Eltrombopag was examined at dosage levels of 75, 150, 225, and 300 mg given orally once daily for 27 days, starting at 24 to 48 hours post-transplantation. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed over a 24 -hour period after the first dose of eltrombopag, as well as during the second week of treatment (steady-state). Nineteen patients were enrolled, 15 of whom completed protocol treatments. Three patients completed each dose level up to 225 mg, and 6 completed treatment at the highest dose of 300 mg. Four patients were replaced because drug compliance was < 75 % of planned doses. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in this heterogeneous post-transplantation patient population. Common adverse events were related to standard stem cell transplantation. One episode of pulmonary embolus occurred 9 days after discontinuation of eltrombopag, and the only other <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode</b> was a grade 2 catheter-related clot.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, studies {{evaluating}} {{the quality of}} life (QoL) in patients with a history of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are not available, even though QoL is a key outcome component of medical care and a predictor of disease-specific prognosis. METHODS: As part of a large follow-up study, the Short Form 36 (SF- 36) was presented to consecutive patients who had survived one or more episodes of acute PE. The results of all nine subscales of the SF- 36 were compared with sex- and age-adjusted Dutch population norms. Single and multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent determinants of the QoL in our study population. RESULTS: The SF- 36 was completed by 392 patients. Except for the health change subscale, patients had substantially lower QoL than population norms on all eight remaining subscales. After multivariate analysis, the time interval between the last <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode</b> and study inclusion was inversely related to QoL, and significant determinants of poor QoL were prior PE, age, obesity, active malignancy, and cardiopulmonary comorbid conditions. Regression models that included all identified significant determinants proved to be quite modest predictors for QoL in the individual patient. Awareness of illness, coping mechanisms, and self-management behavior might be additional important indicators of QoL in our study population but require further investigation. CONCLUSION: We identified several PE- and non-PE-related determinants of QoL in patients with a history of acute PE, which is impaired compared with sex- and age-adjusted population norms. QoL after acute PE should be studied more extensively and added as a standard measure to outcome studies...|$|E

MethodsWe {{performed a}} prospective review of consecutive patients from August 1986 through June 2002 and follow-up through August 2004. Patient age was 2 days to 62 years (median, 24 years), and 197 patients were less than 18 years of age. The Ross operation was performed as a scalloped subcoronary implant in 26 patients, an inclusion cylinder in 54 patients, root replacement in 392 patients, and root–Konno procedure in 15 patients. Clinical follow-up in 96 % and echocardiographic evaluation in 77 % were performed within 2 years of closure. ResultsActuarial survival was 82 % ± 6 % at 16 years, and hospital mortality was 3. 9 %. Freedom from autograft failure (autograft reoperation and valve-related death) was 74 % ± 5 %. Male sex and primary diagnosis of aortic insufficiency (no prior aortic stenosis) {{were significantly associated with}} autograft failure by means of multivariate analysis. Freedom from autograft valve replacement was 80 % ± 5 %. Freedom from endocarditis was 95 % ± 2 %. One late <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode</b> occurred.

Though the peri-operative costs of laparoscopic hysterectomy and the operative time is higher, in the long term, with fewer days of hospital stay in busy district general hospitals, the laparoscopic procedure may address the issue of making more room for patients. Also, with greater motility and less tissue handling, the morbidity is significantly reduced, and we assume that the incidence of <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episodes</b> may be fewer. There is no doubt that society benefits from less recovery care needed and faster mobilisation and return to work in cases of laparoscopic hysterectomy.|$|R

Highly significant differences were observed in the mean plasma beta-thromboglobulin related antigen, platelet factor 4 and thromboxane B 2 levels in patients compared with healthy controls. The elevated levels of platelet release products observed 6 months after cardiac valve replacement suggest a continuous activation by the prosthesis.

40|$|Background—Mitral valve repair is the {{procedure}} of choice to correct mitral regurgitation (MR). Although chordal replacement with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) {{has been widely}} accepted to repair anterior mitral prolapse and other difficult situations, the long-term results of the repair {{and the fate of}} ePTFE have not been delineated. Methods and Results—From July 1988 to April 1999, 74 patients (49 males, 25 females) aged 17 to 77 years (mean age 55. 3614. 8 years) underwent mitral valve repair with chordal replacement with ePTFE. The follow-up period was from 6 months to 11. 3 years (mean 4. 663. 2 years). The causes of MR were degenerative in 65 patients (88 %) and infective in 9 (12 %). Three patients had active infective endocarditis. Valve lesions were anterior in 35 patients, posterior in 10, and both anterior and posterior in 29. Various procedures for plasty of leaflets were necessary in 37 patients (50 %). Atrial fibrillation was associated in 38 patients (51 %), and the maze procedure has been performed in a selected group of 30 patients (41 %) since July 1992. There was 1 in-hospital death (1. 4 %) and 3 late cardiac deaths (4. 1 %). More than moderate MR developed in 12 patients (17 %) during the follow-up period. Three of these patients required early reoperation within 1 year due to hemolysis. Two patients underwent mitral valve replacement at 6 and 8 years after repair, respectively. The actuarial reoperation-free rates at 5 and 10 years were 94. 362. 8 % and 81. 769. 1 %, respectively. Sinus rhythm was restored in 21 patients (70 %) with the maze procedure.

RESULTS: Compared with controls (n= 65), thrombotic episodes within 48 hours of HIT start date were more frequent (59. 2 % versus 32. 3 %; p= 0. 004), the median time between HIT start date and initiation of danaparoid infusion was longer (3. 0 versus 1. 0 days; p= 0. 001), and this treatment was more frequently underdosed (43. 8 % versus 18. 8 %; p= 0. 004) in study cases (n= 49). Upon multivariate analysis, all these three parameters were significant predictive factors for unfavorable clinical outcome. The adjusted odds ratios [95 % confidence interval] were 6. 6 [2. 5 - 17. 3] for time between HIT start date and danaparoid initiation over 48 hours, 4. 3 [1. 5 - 12. 0] for danaparoid underdosing, and 3. 2 [1. 3 - 8. 0] for presence of a <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode</b> at HIT start date. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the recommendations concerning the management of HIT patients, namely discontinuation of all heparin administration once the diagnosis is suspected and prompt initiation of an alternative anticoagulant drug with a strict adherence to doses specifically recommended for these patients...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. We {{studied the}} rate of {{thromboembolism}} in patients undergoing bioprosthetic replacement of the aortic or mitral valve, or both, at serial intervals after operation {{and the effects of}} anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment and risk factors. Background. Thromboembolism appears to occur early after operation, but the incidence, timing and risk factors for thromboembolism and the role, timing, adequacy, effectiveness, duration and risk of anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents are uncertain. Methods. The rate of thromboembolism was studied at three time intervals after operation (1 to 10, 11 to 90 and > 90 days) in 816 patients who underwent bioprosthetic replacement of the aortic or mitral valve, or both, at the Mayo Clinic from January 1975 to December 1982. The effect of antithrombotic therapy (warfarin, aspirin or dipyridamole, alone or in combination) was evaluated. Results. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 8. 6 years. The rate of thromboembolism (%/year) decreased significantly (p 90 days) for mitral valve replacement (55 %, 10 % and 2. 4 %/year, respectively) and over the first time interval for aortic valve replacement (41 %, 3. 6 % and 1. 9 %/year, respectively). During the first 10 days, 52 % to 70 % of prothrombin time ratios were low (< 1. 5 × control). Patients with mitral valve replacement who received anticoagulation had a lower rate of thromboembolism for the entire follow-up period (2. 5 %/year with vs. 3. 9 %/year without anticoagulation, p = 0. 05). Of 112 patients with a first <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episode,</b> permanent disability occurred in 38 % and death in 4 %. Risk factors for emboli were lack of anticoagulation, mitral valve location, history of thromboembolism and increasing age. Only 10 % of aortic, 44 % of mitral and 17 % of double valve recipients had anticoagulation at the time of an event. Patients with bleeding episodes (2. 3 %/year) were older and usually underwent anticoagulation. Blood transfusions were required in 60 of 111 patients (1. 2 %/year), and 13 patients (0. 3 %/year) died. Conclusions. Thromboembolic risk was especially high for aortic and mitral valve replacement for 90 days after operation, and overall was increased with lack of anticoagulation, mitral valve location, previous thromboembolism and increasing age. Anticoagulation reduced thromboemboli and appears to be indicated in all patients as early as possible for 3 months and thereafter in those with risk factors, but needs prospective testing...|$|E
40|$|The {{anticoagulants}} {{of indirect}} action during many years serve drugs of basic prophylaxis and therapy of <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episodes</b> at cardiovascular, neurological, oncology, orthopaedic and other diseases, after surgical interventions and traumas, and also large bunch of the generically caused and acquired (secondary) thrombophilie.

The highest concentrations are found in dark green vegetables and grass: parsley, spinach, green turnip, and also in cabbage and lettuce. For achievement stable hypocoagulation at assignment of anticoagulants of indirect action the daily entering with nutrition of constant amounts of vitamin K (at a level 65 - 80 mkg/day) is necessary.

40|$|The St. Jude Medical {{cardiac valve}} is a low-profile, bileaflet, central-flow {{prosthesis}} made entirely of pyrolytic carbon. A total of 261 St. Jude valves were implanted in 253 patients during a 25 -month period. Perioperative mortality {{for the entire}} series was 9. 1 %, including patients undergoing reoperation for valve disease and those having associated cardiac procedures. There were four nonfatal <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episodes</b> during the follow-up period, resulting in a risk of thromboembolism for aortic and mitral valves of 2. 1 % and 2. 1 % per patient year, respectively. There were no instances of structural failure of the valve, and no valve-related hemolysis occurred. Two-year actuarial survival was 95 %. Hemodynamic studies indicate that the valve has the lowest transvalvular pressure gradient of any prosthetic mechanical valve available, and {{we believe it is}} the valve of choice for patients in whom a prosthetic mechanical valve is indicated...|$|R
30|$|Twenty-two {{women who}} had submucous myomas more than 5  cm {{underwent}} laparoscopic myomectomy. The mean age was 34  years. Eleven patients were nulliparous, six women had previous normal delivery and the other five had previous caesarean section. The indication for myomectomy was menorrhagia in all women, two complained of fibroid uterus and one had lump in the abdomen. The clinical size of the uterus varied from 6  weeks {{to a maximum of}} 18  weeks. The average maximum diameter of the myoma measured by ultrasonography was 7.5  cm. All patients underwent pelvic ultrasound examination and basic blood investigations. Patients were kept on a liquid diet 2  days before the procedure and a laxative was given 12  h before the surgery to empty the bowel. Antibiotic prophylaxis was given to all patients included in the study. Subcutaneous low-dose heparin and a sequential compression device were also given to all patients for prophylaxis against possible <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>episodes.</b>|$|R
