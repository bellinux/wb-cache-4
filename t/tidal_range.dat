5|$|The Severn Estuary, which empties {{into the}} Bristol Channel, has {{traditionally}} been thought to have the second largest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in the world– about , exceeded only by the Bay of Fundy in Canada. Some controversy exists {{as to whether the}} <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in Ungava Bay, also in Canada, is greater than the Bay of Fundy, relegating the Severn Estuary to third place.|$|E
5|$|To allow steamers {{to bring}} day {{trippers}} to Weston-super-Mare from ports {{on both the}} English and Welsh side of the Bristol Channel, a landing jetty was extended {{on the west side}} of the island. The Severn Estuary has the second highest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in the world second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its <b>tidal</b> <b>range,</b> and the underlying geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide.|$|E
5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its <b>tidal</b> <b>range,</b> and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> means that the legs of the pier are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide and the landing stage at the end of the pier has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.|$|E
50|$|The large tonnage {{heavy duty}} iron ore {{railways}} require heavy duty ports, which have to accommodate very high <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dirk Hartog, a Dutchman, {{made the}} first {{authenticated}} landing by a European along this coastline in 1616. Early explorers recorded phenomenal <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> along this coast.|$|R
50|$|With one of {{the largest}} <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> in New Zealand, the coastal track {{includes}} some tidal crossings that can only be negotiated at low tide. Independent walkers and sea kayakers need to have information on tides in the area to plan their trips.|$|R
5|$|Many hillsides, {{such as at}} Cadbury Castle, Ham Hill and Maes Knoll, and {{sheltered}} valleys provided defensible {{locations for}} early human settlements. Trade was established early. The large tidal variation provided access inland, {{a key factor in}} distributing goods and produce, using rivers such as the Parrett and Avon. The <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of , is second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{is notable}} for its beach and mudflats, the danger they pose to {{individuals}} and shipping, and the efforts to which locals have gone in defending their town and preventing loss of life. Burnham {{is close to the}} estuary of the River Parrett where it flows into the Bristol Channel, which has the second highest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in the world. At , it is second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few centuries, the island was hard to govern. Trouble {{followed}} as both English and foreign pirates and privateers– including {{other members of the}} Marisco family– took control of the island for short periods. Ships were forced to navigate close to Lundy because of the dangerous shingle banks in the fast flowing River Severn and Bristol Channel, with its <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of , one of the greatest in the world. This made the island a profitable location from which to prey on passing Bristol-bound merchant ships bringing back valuable goods from overseas.|$|E
5000|$|South Coast - There are {{a number}} of semi-enclosed bays, islands and {{estuaries}} with moderate <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges.</b> Archipelagic environment makes it an ideal place for installation of cages. Aquaculture production in south coast is much higher than production in east and west coast.|$|R
50|$|Only {{three of}} the rocks remain visible at high tide: L'Êtaîthe (the eastern one), La Grôsse (the big one) and La Vouêtaîthe (the western one). The area {{has one of the}} {{greatest}} <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> in the world, sometimes being as much as 12 metres.|$|R
5|$|Minehead {{is located}} on the Bristol Channel coast of South West England, and thus {{experiences}} one of the highest <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> in the world. The tidal rise and fall in the Bristol Channel can be as great as , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|R
5|$|The low-lying {{areas of}} the bay {{have been subject to}} flooding, {{including}} the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 and many times since particularly around the Steart Peninsula. In response to this threat sea walls have been built at several points including at Burnham-on-Sea, Berrow and Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast. The extensive mud flats and high <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> have been the cause of several drownings and rescue services are now provided by the Burnham Area Rescue Boat.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Bristol's {{history the}} Avon Gorge {{has been an}} {{important}} transport route, carrying the River Avon, major roads and two railways. The Bristol Channel and Avon estuary have a very high <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering, making it notoriously difficult to navigate. Several vessels have grounded in the gorge including the SS Demerara soon after her launch in 1851, the schooner Gipsy in 1878, the steam tug Black Eagle in 1861 and the Llandaff City.|$|E
5|$|The beach of Weston Bay lies on {{the western}} edge of the town. The upper part is sandy, but the sea retreats a long way at low tide, exposing large areas of mud flats (hence the colloquial name of Weston-super-Mud). The <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in this part of the Bristol Channel is great, and since beach and mud flats are on a gentle slope, it is inadvisable to try to reach the sea at low tide, as the sand gives way to deep mud which has often {{resulted}} in loss of life over the years. Driving on the beach is permitted in certain areas, but occasionally the drivers are caught unawares as they drive too close to the sea and break through the sand into the underlying mud, and are then stuck.|$|E
50|$|Brackish marshes develop by salt marshes where a {{significant}} freshwater influx dilutes the seawater to brackish levels of salinity. This commonly happens upstream from salt marshes by estuaries of coastal rivers {{or near the}} mouths of coastal rivers with heavy freshwater discharges in the conditions of low <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges.</b>|$|R
25|$|As {{with the}} rest of southwestern Australia, tides at the Houtman Abrolhos are small and irregular. There is little tidal data {{available}} for the islands, but what there is accords very closely with the data for Geraldton. Geraldton tides follow a diurnal pattern, with maximum <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> of around 1-metre (3ft).|$|R
50|$|Minehead {{is located}} on the Bristol Channel coast of South West England, and thus {{experiences}} one of the highest <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> in the world. The tidal rise and fall in the Bristol Channel can be as great as 48 ft, second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|R
5|$|As Barry {{approached}} the Florida Panhandle, voluntary evacuations {{took place in}} eight counties. Shelters opened in six counties, though most were placed on standby. In parts of Franklin County, mandatory evacuations were ordered, and in Okaloosa County, tolls on the Mid-Bay Bridge were suspended. Forty C-130 cargo aircraft and about 300 personnel from Hurlburt Field were moved to the Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas to flee the storm's projected path. In Tallahassee, county officials filled sandbags in areas vulnerable to flooding. At Grand Isle State Park, park rangers moved picnic tables out of <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> and closed the camping grounds {{for a period of}} time. Additionally, the storm forced NASA to delay a shuttle launch in southern Florida. Elsewhere, thousands of personnel were evacuated from several offshore oil platforms. The city of New Orleans closed 60 of its 72 floodgates to avoid possible flooding. Throughout southeastern Louisiana, including New Orleans, roughly 500Red Cross volunteers and staff members were on standby. The threat of the storm forced the cancellation of an 'N Sync concert at Pro Player Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{preceding}} bombing missions, {{together with}} resistance sabotage acts, hit the Germans heavily, interrupting railroads, damaging bridges, and disrupting the communication network. The landing {{started on the}} morning of 15August. Ships of the Western Naval Task Force approached under cover of darkness and were in position at dawn. The first of 1,300 Allied bombers from Italy, Sardinia, and Corsica began aerial bombardment shortly before 0600. Bombing was nearly continuous until 0730 when battleships and cruisers launched spotting aircraft and began firing on specific targets detected by aerial surveillance. Naval gunfire ceased as the landing craft headed ashore at 0800. The relatively steep beach gradients with small <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> discouraged Axis placement of underwater obstacles, but landing beaches had been defensively mined. LCIs leading the first wave of landing craft fired rockets to explode land mines on the beaches to be used by following troops.|$|E
25|$|The bay's extreme <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> causes several {{interesting}} {{phenomena in}} the various rivers which empty into it.|$|E

50|$|The bridge crosses a {{river with}} one of the highest <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> in the world. It carried the main A48 road between Newport and Gloucester until 1988, when a new road bridge was opened {{downstream}} alongside Chepstow Railway Bridge. The road bridge now carries local traffic between Chepstow and Tutshill. It is a Grade I listed building.|$|R
40|$|The Reliability-based {{design and}} risk {{assessment}} model REBAD (1), {{which is used}} to predict the reliability levels of coastal structures that are subject to high damage risk and vast capital expenditures, was implemented to Wiseman’s Bridge revetment in UK by utilizing Van der Meer failure functions. The failure mode probabilities were calculated by the Second Order Reliability Method (SORM), where the failure surface was approximated by a quadratic polynomial having the identical curvature at design point. In this study, a methodology was suggested to determine the lifetime damage probability of coastal structures, which are subject to large <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> and storm surges. As a result, REBAD was successfully implemented to a rubble mound revetment subject to large <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> as a risk assessment study in order to point out the necessity for the development of deformation-based design (DD) methodology instead of the partial safety system used in EU countries...|$|R
25|$|Rivers in {{the upper}} Bay of Fundy have a smaller {{flow-rate}} than the Saint John, and a shallower slope. As a result, extensive mud flats are deposited throughout the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of the rivers.|$|E
25|$|It is {{frequently}} {{asserted that the}} river's estuary, which empties into the Bristol Channel, has the second largest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in the world—, exceeded only by the Bay of Fundy. However a <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> {{greater than that of}} the Severn is recorded from the lesser known Ungava Bay in Canada. During the highest tides, the rising water is funnelled up the Severn estuary into a wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current. The largest bores occur in spring, but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. The bore is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed.|$|E
25|$|The tide {{components}} with {{a period}} near twelve hours have a lunar amplitude (earth bulge/depression distances) {{that are a}} little more than twice the height of the solar amplitudes, as tabulated below. At new and full moon, the Sun and the Moon are aligned, and the lunar and the solar tidal maxima and minima (bulges and depressions) add together for the greatest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> at particular latitudes. At first- and third-quarter phases of the moon, lunar and solar tides are perpendicular, and the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> is at a minimum. The semi-diurnal tides go through one full cycle (a high and low tide) about once every 12 hours and one full cycle of maximum height (a spring and neap tide) about once every 14 days.|$|E
25|$|Leaf Basin {{has only}} been {{measured}} in recent years, whereas the Fundy system has been measured for many decades. The tide at Leaf Basin is higher on average than tides at Minas Basin; however, the highest recorded <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> ever measured are at Burntcoat Head and result from spring tides measured {{at the peak of}} the tidal cycle every 18 years.|$|R
30|$|These {{observations}} {{indicate that}} the sedimentary environment in the Bonaparte Gulf is primarily driven by sea-level variability due to the distinctive topography with its central depression surrounded by higher-level carbonate terraces and platforms. Exposure of carbonate terraces and platforms with a sea-level fall enhances sedimentary environmental change, characterized by carbonate sediment production and transportation. Paleobathymetry would also likely have affected local ocean circulation patterns and <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Gloucester Harbour Trustees area, {{especially}} above Sharpness, {{includes many}} areas of interest to environmentalists. These include extensive mud flats and grassland areas on which migrating and resident birds feed and include a number of Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The estury experiences {{one of the biggest}} <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> in the world and a Severn Barrage is often under discussion to harness the energy generated by the tide.|$|R
25|$|The Bay of Fundy {{is known}} for its high <b>tidal</b> <b>range.</b> The quest for world tidal {{dominance}} has led to a rivalry between the Minas Basin in the Bay of Fundy and the Leaf Basin in Ungava Bay, over which body of water lays claim to the highest tides in the world, with supporters in each region claiming the record.|$|E
25|$|Bay of Fundy tides are {{the highest}} in the world and the highest of all occur in the Minas Basin. Several factors affect the Fundy tides {{including}} water depth and the shape of the coastline. Both contribute to a natural Fundy tidal oscillation, or flow of water back and forth, of about half a day, almost matching the half-day tidal cycle of the outside North Atlantic. This matching tidal cycle amplifies Fundy's <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> as water flows in and out of the Bay across the threshold of the Gulf of Maine.|$|E
500|$|The Bristol Channel has {{the second}} largest <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> in the world. At Burnham-on-Sea, for example, the <b>tidal</b> <b>range</b> of a spring tide is more than [...]|$|E
5000|$|Habitats include {{areas of}} landslips, beaches with sand, shingle and rock, cliffs, coastal lagoons, {{isolated}} sea stacks and islands, muddy estuaries, salt marshes, submaritime zones (i.e. land influenced by sea spray) {{and the sea}} itself. British coasts are affected by strong winds and in some areas large waves. British <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> are large compared to some {{other parts of the}} world. Sheltered shores support different life from exposed shores.|$|R
40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} mixing and exchange of saltwater between a microtidal estuary and a lake connected by an automated box culvert bi-directional gated structure. The gates open four times each day and remain open {{for a period of}} 2 h. They are programmed to open once during each semi-diurnal tidal phase, thus allowing alternative and partial exchange between the two water bodies. To determine the mixing dynamics, vertical profiles of temperature and salinity were collected as water flowed from the lake into the estuary and vice versa. The profiles were taken over a number of days and during various <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> to examine the effect of tidal amplitude on the mixing dynamics of the plume. The results showed that the structure permits the exchange of saline and freshwater between the two systems, maintaining the lake system as a saline (brackish) environment. It perpetuated a permanently stratified environment {{on both sides of the}} structure under all <b>tidal</b> <b>ranges</b> examined.
