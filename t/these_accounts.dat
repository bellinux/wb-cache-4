The aim {{of this research is}} divergent and contains the following aspects according to Mouton and Marais (1989 : 43) : • to gain new insight over an unknown domain; • to explore central concepts; • to set priorities for further research. Overall, the aim of this dissertation is: • identify those accounting concepts applicable to financial school management; • discuss <b>these</b> <b>accounting</b> concepts; • discuss the application and use of <b>these</b> <b>accounting</b> concepts; • discuss the implication of application of <b>these</b> <b>accounting</b> concepts on financial school management. Guidelines will be set how accounting concepts can be used in financial school management...|$|R
5|$|Herodotus' {{colorful}} {{account of}} the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. <b>These</b> <b>accounts</b> are obviously not verifiable, but they form {{an integral part of}} the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the laconic speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.|$|E
5|$|When asked, many signers in the South gave anecdotal {{accounts}} {{of differences between}} the signing of Black and White signers.

Among <b>these</b> <b>accounts</b> were claims that Black signers had a larger signing space and used more two-handed signs. Investigation into these anecdotes has found correlations.|$|E
5|$|Accounts by 19th-century historians {{suggest that}} Day grew {{impatient}} with the girls when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent significant time nursing them through a bout of smallpox. <b>These</b> <b>accounts</b> may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant {{they would not have}} rebelled excessively.|$|E

5|$|Because of Kilmer's close {{identification}} with Roman Catholicism and his correspondence with many priests and theologians, a tree located near a grotto {{dedicated to the}} Virgin Mary at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, has been asserted as {{the inspiration for the}} poem. According to Dorothy Corson, the claim was first made by a priest named Henry Kemper. There are several accounts that Kilmer visited the campus of Notre Dame to lecture and to visit friends, but none of <b>these</b> <b>accounts</b> or occasions date before 1914.|$|E
5|$|Greek mythology is {{explicitly}} embodied {{in a large}} collection of narratives, and implicitly in Greek representational arts, such as ancient vase-paintings and votive gifts. Greek myth attempts to explain {{the origins of the}} world, and details the lives and adventures {{of a wide variety of}} gods, goddesses, heroes, heroines and mythological creatures. <b>These</b> <b>accounts</b> initially were disseminated in an oral-poetic tradition; today the Greek myths are known primarily from ancient Greek literature.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Kanhopatra. According to most {{traditional}} accounts, Kanhopatra was a courtesan and dancing-girl. <b>These</b> <b>accounts</b> typically concentrate on her death when she chose to surrender to the Hindu god Vithoba—the patron god of the Varkaris—rather than becoming a concubine of the Badshah (king) of Bidar. She died in the central shrine of Vithoba in Pandharpur. She {{is the only person}} whose samadhi (mausoleum) is within the precincts of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he died by poison only and another view claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} <b>these</b> <b>accounts</b> as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been shot through the mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed to be that of Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E
5|$|All of the wharves {{along the}} coast of Mississippi were {{reportedly}} ruined. In Mobile, Alabama, the storm uprooted trees and damaged several buildings, including a church. Tides rose several feet above normal, flooding low-lying streets such that fishermen were able to deliver their catches directly to market by boat. Some businesses sustained minor water damage, but overall, the city was spared any significant destruction, and received little impact on shipping. To the east, there were unconfirmed reports of significant damage to wharves and warehouses along the Florida Panhandle, but <b>these</b> <b>accounts</b> may have been exaggerated by rival companies.|$|E

5|$|Bites {{from the}} cottonmouth are {{relatively}} frequent {{in the lower}} Mississippi River Valley and {{along the coast of}} the Gulf of Mexico, although fatalities are rare. Allen and Swindell (1948) compiled a record of A. piscivorus bites in Florida from newspaper accounts and data from the Bureau of Vital Statistics: 1934, eight bites and three fatalities (no further fatalities were recorded after this year); 1935, 10; 1936, 16; 1937, 7; 1938, 6; 1939, 5; 1940, 3; 1941, 6; 1942, 3; 1943, 1; 1944, 3; 1998, 1. Wright and Wright (1957) report having encountered these snakes on countless occasions, often almost stepping on them, but never being bitten. In addition, they heard of no reports of any bites among 400 cypress cutters in the Okefenokee Swamp during the entire summer of 1921. <b>These</b> <b>accounts</b> suggest that the species is not particularly aggressive.|$|E
5|$|French {{casualties}} {{are hard}} to calculate, as the best available source is the vague totals submitted by Duckworth in his account to the Admiralty. He estimates, apparently based on reports by the senior remaining French officers on Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave, that those three ships suffered 760 casualties in total. <b>These</b> <b>accounts</b> were subsequently called into question by historian William James, who considered them too high. James also criticised the assumed totals for Impérial and Diomède, which are even less certain but reportedly totalled 500 and 250 respectively. In addition to those killed and wounded, the entire surviving crews of Alexandre, Jupiter and Brave were taken prisoner, as were 150 men from Diomède and six from Impérial seized by British boarding parties on 8 February.|$|E
5|$|In 615, some of Muhammad's {{followers}} {{emigrated to}} the Ethiopian Aksumite Empire and founded a small colony {{under the protection of}} the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar. Ibn Sa'ad mentions two separate migrations. According to him, most of the Muslims returned to Mecca prior to Hijra, while a second group rejoined them in Medina. Ibn Hisham and Tabari, however, only talk about one migration to Ethiopia. <b>These</b> <b>accounts</b> agree that Meccan persecution {{played a major role in}} Muḥammad's decision to suggest that a number of his followers seek refuge among the Christians in Abyssinia. According to the famous letter of ʿUrwa preserved in al-Tabari, the majority of Muslims returned to their native town as Islam gained strength and high ranking Meccans, such as Umar and Hamzah converted.|$|E

5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with <b>these</b> <b>accounts,</b> saying that Day had made her miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E
5|$|The ancient traditions {{regarding}} Philip's Christianity can {{be divided}} into three categories: the Eusebian, or Caesarean; the Antiochene; and the Latin. The Eusebian tradition consists of Eusebius, bishop of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica and the documents excerpted and cited therein, including the letters of Origen and Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria. The Antiochene tradition consists of the John Chrysostom's homily de S. Babyla and Leontius, bishop of Antioch's entries in the Chronicon Paschale. Most scholars hold that <b>these</b> <b>accounts</b> ultimately derive from Eusebius of Caesarea's Historia Ecclesiastica (Ecclesiastical History), but some, like Irfan Shahîd, posit that Antioch had an independent oral tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the tomb}} monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine notary, in 1424 (by the Florentine calendar) part of the tomb was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that three-fourths of the 800florin budget had been spent. To harmonize <b>these</b> <b>accounts,</b> one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E
