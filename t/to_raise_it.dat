Rejected by her boyfriend when he refused to raise their child, Claire decides {{to go to an}} {{adoption}} agency out of a belief that she will struggle <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> alone. Claire visits a psychic (Nick Jameson) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not raise it. In the present, Claire experiences terrifying nightmares and begins to suspect that somebody is trying to harm her unborn child. In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census of all of the survivors.|$|E
5|$|King Rufus, {{the leader}} of a furry race of creatures called the Gobbos, is {{watching}} the sunrise over Gobbo Valley when he sees a large, woven basket carrying a baby crocodile floating down the river. Initially suspicious of the young crocodile but ultimately won over by its innocence, King Rufus and the Gobbos decide <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> as one of their own and teach it in the ways of the Gobbo. The crocodile, named Croc, grows, eventually becoming much larger than the Gobbos.|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} the final battle, the player meets Morrigan, who proposes a way to slay the Archdemon without sacrificing anyone: the two conceiving a child. The child, also {{carrying}} the Taint, would merge with the Archdemon once it dies, creating a demonic essence which will spare any Grey Warden. Morrigan agrees to conceive the child, which would resultantly be born a demigod, {{on the condition that}} she be allowed <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> alone. The player can accept Morrigan's offer (if male), convince Alistair/Loghain to take part instead, or refuse the witch's proposal, which will cause her to leave the party.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, eight-year-old Victoria becomes {{upset that}} her mother Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) has married Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), even after he saves her from {{drowning}} in a swimming pool. When she continues to misbehave, her parents send her to boarding school in Switzerland. The following year, Victoria returns as a moody teenager who is working in the mailroom at her father’s company, Newman Enterprises, and becoming smitten with the Ryan McNeilwho is older than her. Victor offers Ryan money to leave town but he and Victoria elope. Their marriage ends when Ryan leaves her for Nina Webster in 1993. Victoria then {{falls in love with}} Cole Howard and they marry the following year, but their marriage is quickly annulled when it is believed by their parents that they are siblings. When this is proved untrue they wed again; this marriage breaks down four years later when in 1998 Cole has sex with Ashley Abbott. Victoria becomes pregnant with Cole’s child and chooses <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> with Neil Winters. Her baby girl, Eve Howard, dies a few days after birth and Victoria ends her union with Neil. Victoria briefly tries and fails to win Cole back from Ashley. In 1999, Victoria meets Gary Dawson (Ricky Paull Goldin) and they begin dating, though she soon discovers that he is stalking her and ends the relationship. Enraged, Gary kidnaps Victoria in a tree house and she takes months to recover. She and Ryan then reunite and plan to remarry, but on their wedding day in November 2001 Ryan's ex-wife Tricia Dennison shoots and kills him, leaving Victoria devastated. She then has a brief relationship with Diego Guittierez in 2002, and afterward dates Michael Baldwin. The following year, some of Victor's crimes come to light and Victoria leaves town when these and other family problems overwhelm her. She moves to Florence, Italy, where she studies Art History.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area {{of growth in the}} inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 and then finally having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E

Cocoa {{is the major}} cash crop for the entire region, with 80% of the arable land of Dja and Lobo division and Ocean division dedicated <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> <b>it.</b> Major cocoa collection facilities are located in Ebolowa. Rubber is another important crop, and a major operation is located at Njété, about 20km inland from Kribi. Palm oil is harvested near Campo.|$|R

25|$|During the Cold War, the Karelian-born Finnish {{politician}} Johannes Virolainen {{lobbied for}} the return of Karelia. President Urho Kekkonen also tried to reacquire the territory, especially when the Soviet Union returned the peninsula of Porkkala to Finland in 1956. There was, however, no significant public controversy about the case, because Kekkonen wanted to keep it quiet. The last time Kekkonen tried <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> was in 1972, but he had no success, and public discussion died out in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|On 10 September 1929, the {{day after}} the Supermarine S.6 had won the Trophy, N249 {{returned}} to flight. Flight Lieutenant George Stainforth flew it over a measured mile course for a top speed of 351.3mph and a ratified world absolute speed record, averaged over four runs of 336.3mph. This record was held only briefly, as a later run by Squadron Leader Augustus Orlebar in the S.6 managed <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> over 350mph. During the final Schneider Trophy in 1931, the Gloster VI was still in service with the High Speed Flight as a trainer.|$|E

25|$|The central {{position}} and military {{security of the}} city naturally tended <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> to a commanding position among the Boeotians, and from early days its inhabitants endeavoured to establish a complete supremacy over their kinsmen in the outlying towns. This centralizing policy is as much the cardinal fact of Theban history as the counteracting effort of the smaller towns to resist absorption forms the main chapter {{of the story of}} Boeotia. No details of the earlier history of Thebes have been preserved, except that it was governed by a land-holding aristocracy who safeguarded their integrity by rigid statutes about the ownership of property and its transmission over time.|$|E
25|$|The wreck was {{discovered}} in 2003 {{by a group of}} professional divers, who notified the Swedish National Maritime Museums (SNMM) and showed some objects that were brought up from the wreck, but the find was not made public until 28 March 2007 through a press release from SNMM. The wreck has not been moved from its current location and in order to preserve it, there are no plans <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it,</b> as was done with the warship Vasa in 1961. The difficulties in preserving the ship are considered by archaeologists to be too expensive and complicated. A salvage operation would also risk damaging the ship and the many related artefacts as well as disturb the site, making it more difficult to conduct further research.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 31, in a {{farmhouse}} on a hill just above the South Fork Dam, Elias Unger, president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, awoke {{to the sight of}} Lake Conemaugh swollen after a night-long heavy rainfall. Unger ran outside in the still-pouring rain to assess the situation and saw that the water was nearly cresting the dam. He quickly assembled a group of men to save the face of the dam by trying to unclog the spillway; it was blocked by the broken fish trap and debris caused by the swollen waterline. Other men tried digging a ditch {{at the other end of}} the dam, on the western abutment which was lower than the dam crest. The idea was to let more water out of the lake to try to prevent overtopping of the crest, but without success. Most remained on top of the dam, some plowing earth <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it,</b> while others tried to pile mud and rock on the face to save the eroding wall.|$|E
25|$|BorisI's {{successor}} SimeonI was {{not content}} to have the Bulgarian Church with the rank of archbishopric and was determined <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> to a patriarchate, {{in light of his}} own ambition to become an emperor. He was well acquainted with the Byzantine imperial tradition that the autocrat must have a patriarch and there could be no empire without a patriarchate. In the aftermath of his remarkable triumph over the Byzantines in the battle of Achelous, in 918 he convened a council and elevated the archbishop Leontius as a patriarch. The decisions of that council were not recognized by the Byzantines but {{as a result of the}} Bulgarian victory in the war they eventually recognized Leontius' successor Demetrius as Patriarch of Bulgaria in 927. It was the first Patriarchate officially accepted, apart from the ancient Pentarchy. It is likely that the seat of the Patriarchate was in the city of Drastar on the Danube River rather than in the capital Preslav. In the late 10th century the Bulgarian Patriarchate included the following dioceses: Ohrid, Kostur, Glavinitsa (in modern southern Albania), Maglen, Pelagonia, Strumitsa, Morovizd (in modern northern Greece), Velbazhd, Serdica, Braničevo, Niš, Belgrade, Srem, Skopje, Prizren, Lipljan, Servia, Drastar, Voden, Ras, Chernik, Himara, Drinopol, Butrint, Yanina, Petra and Stag.|$|E
25|$|The War of the Austrian Succession (1740– 1748) {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the power struggle between Britain and France and of European military ascendancy and political intervention in the Indian subcontinent. In September 1746, Mahé de La Bourdonnais landed off Madras with a naval squadron and laid siege to the port city. The defences of Madras were weak and the garrison sustained a bombardment of three days before surrendering. The terms of the surrender agreed by Bourdonnais provided for the settlement to be ransomed back for a cash payment by the British East India Company. However, this concession was opposed by Joseph François Dupleix, the governor general of the Indian possessions of the Compagnie des Indes Orientales. When Bourdonnais left India in October, Dupleix reneged on the agreement. The Nawab of the Carnatic Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan intervened in support of the British and the combined forces advanced to retake Madras, but despite vast superiority in numbers, the army was easily crushed by the French. As retaliation to the loss of Madras, the British, under Major Lawrence and Admiral Boscawen, laid siege to Pondicherry but were forced <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>it</b> after thirty-one days. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 forced Dupleix to yield Madras back to the British in return for Louisbourg and Cape Breton Island in North America.|$|E
