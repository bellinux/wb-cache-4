5|$|Colonels wore three gold {{stars of}} the same size on their collar; the same as generals, but without <b>the</b> <b>wreath.</b> While {{lieutenant}} colonels wore two stars on their collars, majors wore one star, which was placed {{in the middle of the}} collar. Captains had three gold horizontal bars, first lieutenants wore two bars, and second lieutenants wore one bar. However, the Confederate Congress often created new commissions, and did not always standardize rank insignia immediately.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wreath</b> on {{the reverse}} is also derivative, having been {{previously}} used on Longacre's Type II gold dollar of 1854, and the three-dollar piece of the same year. It is composed of leaves of wheat, corn, cotton and tobacco, thus including produce associated with both the North and the South. The cotton leaves are sometimes said to be maple leaves; the two types are not dissimilar, and maple leaves are more widely known than cotton leaves. An ear of corn is also visible.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{had trouble}} {{striking}} the new design. This {{was due to}} the hard copper-nickel alloy {{and the fact that the}} eagle on one side of the piece was directly opposite parts of the reverse design; efforts to bring out the design more fully led to increased die breakage. Many Flying Eagle cents show weaknesses, especially at the eagle's head and tail, which are opposite <b>the</b> <b>wreath.</b> In 1857, Snowden suggested the replacement of the eagle with a head of Christopher Columbus. Longacre replied that as there had been objections to proposals to place George Washington on the coinage, there would also be opposition to a Columbus design. Despite the difficulties, the 17,450,000 Flying Eagle cents struck at Philadelphia in 1857 constituted the greatest production of a single coin in a year at a U.S. mint to that time.|$|E

5000|$|Whitehall's Cenotaph was {{constructed}} from Portland stone between 1919 and 1920 by Holland, Hannen & Cubitts. It was undecorated {{apart from a}} carved wreath on each end and a smaller carved <b>wreath</b> on top. <b>The</b> words [...] "The Glorious Dead" [...] are inscribed twice, once below <b>the</b> <b>wreaths</b> on each end. Above <b>the</b> <b>wreaths</b> at each end are inscribed the dates of the First World War in Roman numerals (1914 - MCMXIV; and 1919 - MCMXIX). <b>The</b> <b>wreaths</b> at each end are 5 ft in diameter, while the one on top is 3.6 ft in diameter.|$|R

25|$|The {{width of}} <b>the</b> <b>wreath</b> was 5mm at the widest point and tapered {{to the apex}} where two oak leaves meet tip-to-tip. The height of the badge from base to tip was 26mm. The {{swastika}} was superimposed upon the separately-made wreath and was soldered onto <b>the</b> <b>wreath</b> assembly. The reverse side had four pins for attachment to allow securing to a strip of Iron Cross Second Class ribbon. This ribbon was then looped through the second button hole on the tunic of the recipient.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} aspect of modern May Day {{celebrations}} is {{the preparation of}} a flower wreath from wild flowers, although {{as a result of}} urbanisation there is an increasing trend to buy wreaths from flower shops. The flowers are placed on <b>the</b> <b>wreath</b> against a background of green leaves and <b>the</b> <b>wreath</b> is hung either on the entrance to the family house/apartment or on a balcony. It remains there until midsummer night. On that night, the flower wreaths are set alight in bonfires known as St John’s fires. Youths leap over the flames consuming the flower wreaths. This custom has also practically disappeared, like the theatrical revival of Adonis/Dionysus/Maios, as a result of rising urban traffic and with no alternative public grounds in most Greek city neighbourhoods, not to mention potential conflicts with demonstrating workers.|$|E
25|$|The reverse has {{the words}} ‘For Service’ below the Crown of St Edward, {{surrounded}} by a wreath of wattle.

25|$|Medal: A neck {{decoration}} of large pattern. Similar {{to the second}} class medal but the star is enamelled in with red points and a white circle surrounding the centre emblem.

25|$|In the {{background}} is wreath of Golden Wattle, the official national floral emblem, though {{the representation of the}} species is not botanically accurate.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>wreaths</b> served {{multiple}} functions. Some were {{in vogue}} in daily fashion, indicating one's status among the elite classes. Other wreaths served in funerary rituals or for other ceremonial purposes, {{as depicted in}} artworks and on coins from the period, indicating that <b>the</b> symbolism of <b>wreaths</b> was widely used on vessels and helmets. Wreaths made of clay or gilt-bronze have also been found.|$|R

25|$|As the war {{continued}} {{it became}} apparent that the single Panzer Badge was no longer adequate to recognize the growing number of veterans with years of experience, and in June 1943 four new classes of the award were introduced for 25, 50, 75 and 100 engagements. These new badges consisted of an award that was similar to the unnumbered Panzer Badge, but with a box showing the Arabic numeral of the class at the base of <b>the</b> <b>wreath.</b> The badge was slightly larger for the 25 and 50 type with the 75 and 100 being larger still. <b>The</b> <b>wreath</b> {{in the case of the}} 25 and 50 was silvered, while in the 75 and 100 class it was gilt. The center of the badge (the tank) was made of a separate striking and chemically darkened in the case of the 25 and 50 class, while in the 75 and 100 class the tank was silvered. The reverse has several variations, and could either have a slim or wide pin. The 50 and 100 engagement badges were struck in a lightweight zinc alloy; this was so that the larger pin did not pull inconveniently on the tunic.|$|E
25|$|The crest {{consists}} of a helm, crossing swords behind and a combined anchor and cross surrounded by a wreath.The helm is symbolic to strong defense with power projection. The anchor refers to the namesake of DD 191, John Young Mason, who was the Secretary of the Navy under President John Tyler and James K. Polk. The cross is in reference to Newton Henry Mason’s Distinguished Flying Cross award. <b>The</b> <b>wreath</b> represents all the awards, honors and achievements of the past ships with the namesake Mason and crews who served them.|$|E
