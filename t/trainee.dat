40|$|Aims: To {{assess the}} {{learning}} environment of New Zealand paediatric <b>trainees,</b> examine the factors influencing the <b>trainee's</b> perceptions of their learning environment and to assess the suitability of using the Postgraduate Hospital Education Environment Measure (PHEEM) in New Zealand. Methods: Paediatric <b>trainees</b> completed the PHEEM questionnaire and returned this anonymously by email. Results: Both basic and advanced trainees' perceptions of the environment were generally positive but significant concerns were identified. There were differences in perceptions of {{the learning environment}} between the basic and advanced <b>trainees</b> and between sites with more than six <b>trainees</b> compared with those with six or fewer <b>trainees.</b> The PHEEM is practical to use, showed good internal consistency and was acceptable to <b>trainees.</b> Conclusions: Both basic and advanced <b>trainees</b> perceived the learning environment positively but significant concerns must be addressed. The advanced <b>trainees</b> perceived the overall learning environment and the teaching they receive more positively than basic <b>trainees.</b> <b>Trainees</b> at smaller hospitals perceived that their social supports were better than at larger hospitals. The PHEEM {{can be used to}} assess the paediatric training environment in New Zealand...|$|R

Typically, these <b>trainees</b> are educated longer and better than <b>trainees</b> without a UED and show higher levels of academic achievement.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to elicit general {{practitioner}} (GP) <b>trainee's</b> perceptions of the educational structure of their hospital posts, to compare them with those of consultants who had GP <b>trainees</b> as senior house officers (SHOs) in their departments and to examine the use of educational objectives in the hospital component of vocational training for general practice. A confidential postal questionnaire was sent to all the GP <b>trainees</b> (165 doctors) in the hospital component of their vocational training schemes (VTS) for general practice in Trent Region and all the consultants (161 doctors) in Trent who had GP <b>trainees</b> in their SHO posts on that date. Responses were received from 136 <b>trainees</b> (82 %) and 134 consultants (83 %). Educational objectives were stated as existing in the SHO post by 31 <b>trainees</b> (23 %) and by 62 consultants (46 %). Of those doctors who said that objectives existed, 19 of the <b>trainees</b> (61 %) and 40 of the consultants (65 %) said that the objectives were useful. Only nine (29 %) of the <b>trainees</b> who stated that educational objectives existed felt that they were being put into practice by senior staff, compared with 41 (66 %) of consultants who had made that statement. Of all respondents, 113 <b>trainees</b> (87 %) and 100 consultants (77 %) agreed or strongly agreed that the use of educational objectives would be beneficial to the <b>trainees.</b> Only 10 (7 %) of <b>trainees</b> said that they received no teaching in their current posts. Forty <b>trainees</b> (32 %) and 88 consultants (67 %) said that teaching took place in protected time. Both groups cited consultants as the member of staff giving the most teaching. Ninety-six consultants (73 %) replied that it was possible for GP <b>trainees</b> to obtain study leave, but 102 <b>trainees</b> (75 %) either had experienced difficulties in obtaining study leave or had not attempted to obtain study leave. <b>Trainees</b> and consultants differed appreciably in their perceptions of the amount of assessment and feedback which was provided for GP <b>trainees.</b> The use of educational objectives in the hospital component of vocational training was felt to be beneficial by both consultants and GP <b>trainees.</b> Consultants were more likely than <b>trainees</b> to report the use of educational objectives, protected teaching time, GP-orientated teaching, ability of <b>trainees</b> to attend VTS half-day release and the provision of assessment and feedback to <b>trainees...</b>|$|R

40|$|During {{their first}} {{training}} period in general practice the authors {{felt that they}} did not encounter the balanced workload which is the foundation for learning to be a GP. Previous studies confirmed the existence of differences in overall and specific workload between <b>trainees</b> and trainers. From their own experience and from the relevant literature they addressed several factors which might affect the workload of <b>trainees.</b> A study was undertaken to determine differences in workload between <b>trainees</b> and trainers, and to investigate whether certain characteristics of practice and of <b>trainees</b> affect the workload of <b>trainees.</b> Details of surgery consultations with 34 trainee-trainer partnerships were recorded in the north of the Netherlands over 2 weeks. Questionnaires were filled in by trainers, <b>trainees</b> and practice assistants from these 34 general practices. The total number of contacts recorded was 10, 103. It was found that <b>trainees</b> see fewer elderly and female patients, less chronic and oncological conditions, but more minor illnesses. They see only 30 % of patients with problem behaviour. Factors that influence the trainees' workload, as compared to their trainers' are: list size; selection in the allocation of patients; <b>trainee's</b> experience prior to starting the training stage, and the <b>trainee's</b> sex. Except for problem behaviour, <b>trainees</b> generally see a cross-section of their trainer's practice population. Selection would provide a more balanced workload for <b>trainees...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Part-time {{training}} (PTT) is {{accessed by}} approximately 10 % of Australian {{obstetrics and gynaecology}} <b>trainees,</b> a small but increasing minority which reflects the growing demand for improved work/life balance amongst the Australian medical workforce. This survey reports the attitudes and experiences of both full-time and part-time <b>trainees</b> to PTT. Methods An email-based anonymous survey was sent to all Australian obstetrics and gynaecology <b>trainees</b> in April 2009, collecting demographic and training status data, data on personal experiences of PTT and/or <b>trainees,</b> and attitudes towards PTT. Results 105 responses were received (20 % response rate). These indicated strong support (90 %) from both full-time (FT) and part-time (PT) <b>trainees</b> for the availability of PTT. PT <b>trainees</b> {{were significantly more likely}} than FT <b>trainees</b> to be female with children. Improved morale was seen as a particular advantage of PTT; decreased continuity of care as a disadvantage. Conclusions Although limited by poor response rate, both PT and FT Australian obstetric <b>trainees</b> were supportive of part-time training. Both groups recognised important advantages and disadvantages of this mode of training. Currently, part-time training is accessed primarily by female <b>trainees</b> with family responsibilities, with many more <b>trainees</b> considering part-time training than the number that access it. </p...|$|R

No.11 EFTS absorbed No.3 EFTS's instructors, {{students and}} Wackett Trainers in April, {{shortly before the}} latter unit disbanded. The same month at Benalla, thirty-two United States Army Air Corps pilots undertook four weeks of flying in the Wacketts. On 5September 1942, one of the Wacketts crashed after apparently stalling on takeoff, killing the <b>trainee</b> and seriously injuring the pilot. The Wackett Trainers were taken out of service for upgrades in February 1943, and the school again began operating Tiger Moths.
