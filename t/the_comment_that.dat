25|$|The {{mental illness}} of George III {{is the basis}} of the plot in The Madness of King George, a 1994 British film based upon the 1991 Alan Bennett play, The Madness of George III. The closing credits of the film include <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> the illness {{suffered}} by King George has been attributed to porphyria and that it is hereditary. Among other descendants of George III theorized by the authors of Purple Secret to have suffered from porphyria (based on analysis of their extensive and detailed medical correspondence) were his great-great-granddaughter Princess Charlotte of Prussia (Emperor William II's eldest sister) and her daughter Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen. They uncovered better evidence that George III's great-great-great-grandson Prince William of Gloucester was reliably diagnosed with variegate porphyria.|$|E

25|$|On 1 November 2011 TEPCO {{said that}} xenon-133 and xenon-135 were {{detected}} in gas-samples {{taken from the}} containment vessel of reactor 2, in a concentration of 6 to 10 (or more) parts per million becquerels per cubic centimeter. Xenon-135 was also detected in gas samples collected on 2 November. These isotopes {{are the result of}} nuclear fission-reaction of uranium. Because the short half-lifes of these gases: (Xe-133: 5 days Xe-135: 9 hours), the presence could only mean that nuclear fissions were occurring at some places in the reactor. Boric-acid was poured into the reactor in an attempt to stop the fission-reactions. No significant change in temperature or pressure was found by TEPCO, so {{there was no sign of}} large-scale criticality. The reactor-cooling was continued, but TEPCO would examine the situation at reactor 1 and 3 also. Professor Koji Okamoto of the University of Tokyo Graduate School made <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> localized and temporary fission might still happen, and that the melted fuel could undergo fission, but the fuel was probably scattered around. Neutrons from radioactive materials could react with the uranium fuel and other substances. Self-sustaining chain reactions were unlikely, thanks to the huge amounts of boric acid that were poured into the reactor.|$|E

To these insects a sting has been denied by Nature; but in one large kind we find horns of a remarkable length, two-pronged at the extremities, and forming pincers, which the animal closes when it is its intention to bite." [...] The stag beetle is recorded in a Greek myth by Nicander and recalled by Antoninus Liberalis in which Cerambus is turned into a beetle: [...] "He can be seen on trunks and has hook-teeth, ever moving his jaws together.

[...] Likewise, Josef Joffe, publisher-editor of Die Zeit in Germany, said the film perpetuates the myth of the [...] "noble savage" [...] and has [...] "a condescending, yes, even racist message. Cameron bows to the noble savages. [...] However, he reduces them to dependents." [...] Slavoj Žižek argued that [...] "the film enables us to practise a typical ideological division: sympathising with the idealised aborigines while rejecting their actual struggle." [...] The Irish Times carried <b>the</b> <b>comment</b> <b>that</b> [...] "despite all the thematic elements from Hinduism, one thing truly original is the good old American ego. Given its Hollywood origins, the script has remained faithful to the inherent superiority complex, and has predictably bestowed the honor of the 'avatar' not on the movie’s native Na’vis, but on a white American marine." [...] Similarly, positing that [...] "the only good humans [...] are dead—or rather, resurrected as 'good Navi'", a writer in The Jerusalem Post thought that the film was inadvertently promoting supremacy of one race over another.|$|E
