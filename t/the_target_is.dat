5|$|After {{targeting}} another {{character and}} initiating combat, the player and his opponent will damage each other automatically with their weapons. This continues until the player stops or <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>is</b> dead. Each profession's unique nano programs, perks and research also provide combat abilities {{used by the}} player during the fight. These can heal the owner, cause additional damage, lower {{the skills of the}} enemy, blind them or otherwise hinder the enemy's ability to fight. Once <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>is</b> dead, the player is able to loot money and items from the enemy's body.|$|E
5|$|For {{implementing}} associative arrays, hash tables, a {{data structure}} that maps keys to records using a hash function, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records; most implementations require only amortized constant time on average. However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, {{as the only}} information given on a failed search is that <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>is</b> not present in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. In addition, all operations possible on a sorted array can be performed—such as finding the smallest and largest key and performing range searches.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>is</b> not in the array.|$|E
40|$|Participants made unspeeded {{temporal}} order judgments (TOJs) regarding {{which occurred}} first, anauditory or a visual target stimulus, {{when they were}} presented {{at a variety of}} different stimulus onset asynchronies. <b>The</b> <b>target</b> stimuli <b>were</b> presented either in isolation or positioned randomly among a stream of three synchronous audiovisual distractors. The largest just noticeable differences <b>were</b> reported when <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> presented in <b>the</b> middle of the distractor stream. When <b>the</b> <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> presented at <b>the</b> beginning of the stream, performance was no worse than when <b>the</b> audiovisual <b>targets</b> <b>were</b> presented in isolation. Subsequent experiments revealed that performance improved somewhat when the position of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> fixed or when <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>was</b> made physically distinctive from the distractors. These results show that audiovisual TOJs are impaired by the presence of audiovisual distractors and that this cost can be ameliorated by directing attention to the appropriate temporal position within the stimulus stream...|$|R

IFC and the World Green Building Council have partnered to accelerate green building growth in developing counties. <b>The</b> <b>target</b> <b>is</b> to scale up green buildings over a seven-year period until 20% of the property market is saturated. Certification occurs when the EDGE standard is met, which requires 20% less energy, water, and materials than conventional homes.|$|E
5|$|The minimum {{range of}} any radar system {{is due to}} its pulse width, {{the length of time}} that the {{transmitter}} is turned on before it turns off so the receiver can listen for reflections from targets. If the echo from <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>is</b> received while the transmitter is still sending, the echo will be swamped by the transmitted pulse backscattering off local sources. For instance, a radar with a pulse width of 1µs {{would not be able to}} see returns from a target less than 150m away, because the radar signal travelling at the speed of light would cover the round trip distance of 300m before that 1µs interval had passed.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning {{the target and}} the detector, and producing larger amounts of the increasingly unstable actinides needed for <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>is</b> impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors {{and the ability to}} work on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 would be a great challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in the field has been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long pause in new discoveries.|$|E

5|$|Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{believes}} that Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) {{does not know}} about his affair with her husband, but in fact she is playing dumb {{in order to keep}} Oscar off his guard while she makes arrangements to have him killed. She goes to Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) for help, without telling him the details, and he calls a fellow former volunteer sheriff's deputy named Trevor (Chris Gethard) for assistance. After Trevor shows his credentials, Angela says she wants the target murdered, which Dwight protests is too extreme, so they compromise to breaking the target's kneecaps. Dwight realizes <b>the</b> <b>target</b> <b>is</b> Oscar when Angela angrily crushes a cookie given to her by Oscar. Dwight tries to get Angela to reconsider, but Trevor has already arrived to carry out the job. Dwight rushes to get Oscar out. They run into Trevor outside. A struggle between the three men ensues, with Oscar ultimately managing to take away Trevor's lead pipe. When Trevor runs away, Oscar and Dwight are confronted by Angela, who blames Oscar for turning her husband gay. Oscar says that he was always gay, and refuses to hand the lead pipe over to Angela. She kicks him in the shin instead. Upset that they do not understand homosexuality, Dwight and Angela go to Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein), who is confounded by their outlandish questions over homosexual activity.|$|E
