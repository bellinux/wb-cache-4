5|$|Water {{levels have}} been {{recorded}} since 1875, averaging about 4,200 feet (1,280m) above sea level. Since the Great Salt Lake is a shallow lake with gently sloping shores around all edges except on the south side, small variations in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> greatly affect {{the extent of the}} shoreline. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> can rise dramatically in wet years and fall during dry years. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is also affected by the amount of water flow diverted for agricultural and urban uses. The Jordan and Weber rivers, in particular, are diverted for other uses. In the 1880s Grove Karl Gilbert predicted that the lake– then in the middle of many years of recession– would virtually disappear except for a small remnant between the islands.|$|E

5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a parking lot in the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E
50|$|The recent {{drought in}} California has {{impacted}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> in <b>the</b> Camanche Reservoir. The reservoir has {{an ability to}} hold 417,120 acre feet (AF) of water at maximum capacity. During the recent drought experienced in California, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> have been declining from the period of 2011 to 2015. This {{is due to the}} decreased amount of precipitation and snowpack melt <b>water</b> received in <b>the</b> Mokelumne River. The drought caused <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> to reach low levels in late 2015.The month showing <b>the</b> lowest <b>water</b> <b>level</b> was August, 2015 with <b>the</b> <b>water</b> volume in <b>the</b> reservoir decreasing to 81940 AF, approximately 19.6% of the reservoirs maximum capacity. <b>Water</b> <b>levels</b> have been increasing through the winter months of 2015-2016 reaching 240340 AF during April, 2016.|$|R
50|$|Another {{aspect is}} the {{hydrology}} {{which is the}} difference between dynamic and static response to recharge and abstraction. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> will rise or fall in the well during recharge and recovery. Once recharge and recovery stops <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> return to background levels, and one of the main issues is the change in static <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> after <b>the</b> dynamic response from recharge or recovery disappears.|$|R

5|$|At around 17:00 a large {{formation}} of enemies {{showed up on}} radar headed towards TG38.3. As before, {{a great deal of}} these were shot down by combat air patrol. The surviving enemy planes flew down to <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> to evade further radar detection. These planestorpedo bombers and fighterssuccessfully ambushed the formation just minutes later. Evasive maneuvers, squall weather, and poor fighter cover {{on the part of the}} Japanese helped TG38.3 escape without suffering any significant damage.|$|E
5|$|During the November to May dry season, {{power output}} {{is limited by}} the river's flow rate, as seen in the {{diagrams}} on the right. When there is enough flow, power output is limited by plant generating capacity. The maximum power-output curves were calculated based on the average flow rate at the dam site, assuming <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is 175m and the plant gross efficiency is 90.15%. The actual power output in 2008 was obtained based on the monthly electricity sent to the grid.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar's {{appearance}} in prehistory was very different.

5|$|The Cistecephalus Assemblage Zone, {{from where}} Euchambersia is known, {{represents}} a floodplain that {{was covered in}} many small, relatively straight streams. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> in these streams was probably seasonally dependent. Judging from pollen preserved in the Cistecephalus AZ, the pollen taxon Pityosporites (which probably originated from a plant similar to Glossopteris) was very common, forming some 80% to 90% of the pollen discovered (although the prevalent sediments {{would not have been}} ideal for pollen preservation).|$|E
5|$|The Mullan Road was {{constructed}} in 1862 and crossed the Snake River with a ferry crossing at Lyons Ferry until {{the construction of the}} Lower Monumental Dam downstream caused <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> to rise and longer wait times, resulting in the reconstruction of the Snake River Bridge. The current route of SR261 from Washtucna to Ritzville was designated during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937 as SSH11E.|$|E
5|$|The castle, and {{an outer}} {{enclosure}} of which little trace remains, originally took up {{almost the entire}} area of Castle Island. The present wooded, and considerably larger, island was formed in the early 19th century when the canalising of the outflow of the River Leven, which enters the Firth of Forth at the town of Leven, led to a substantial lowering of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

5|$|The dam {{discharges}} its reservoir {{during the}} dry season between December and March every year. This increases the flow rate of the river downstream, and provides fresh water for agricultural and industrial usage. It also improves shipping conditions. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> upstream drops from 175m to 145m, preparing for the rainy season. The water also powers the Gezhouba Dam downstream.|$|E
5|$|The {{life-cycle}} of the phumdis {{has generally}} been subject to seasonal variation. During the monsoon season when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> is high, the phumdis float, but during the dry season, as <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> falls, the phumdis touch the lake bed and absorb nutrients from it. When the wet season returns, they again float, and the biomass, which has enough nutrients stored in the plants' roots, survives. However, the contemporary situation, with high water levels in the lake throughout the year, has meant {{that the process of}} 'feeding' on lakebottom nutrients has been seriously disturbed, resulting in a loss of biomass and a thinning of the islands each year. In January 1999, it was reported that a large section of phumdi in the north of the park had shattered into pieces and drifted away from the park area, threatening the habitat of the sangai.|$|E

Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal flats and {{mangrove}} swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, as <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E
5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs were}} {{probably}} laid in open nests {{on the banks}} of ephemeral rivers or lakes, which could frequently flood the nesting areas and bury the eggs. The distribution of the eggs suggests that they had a long-term colonial nesting site at the Khermeen Tsav locality in the Barun Goyot Formation. At the Bayn-Dzak locality, the eggs are typically arranged in clutches, whereas elsewhere they are scattered randomly, each oriented nearly vertically in the substrate. The solitary eggs may have been laid and buried individually, similar to the nesting habits of modern megapodes. It is also possible that they were originally laid in clutches, but flooding separated them and deposited them vertically as <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>level</b> dropped. Water damage would also explain why Gobioolithus shells are frequently heavily recrystallized.|$|E
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{monitored}} {{surface subsidence}} and <b>water</b> <b>level</b> fluctuations in 10 shallow observation wells above {{a series of}} four adjacent longwall panels in southwestern Pennsylvania, for about 4 yr. This study attempted to correlate the changes in <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> within <b>the</b> observation wells to the measured vertical and horizontal ground movements associated with subsidence. Results {{of this study indicate}} that the fluctuation of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> appears to be a function of the well location relative to the mine layout and the proximity of mining. Wells are generally unaffected by mining of a preceding panel unless they are located within the angle of draw for that panel. Wells located at the centerline of a longwall panel exhibit the greatest fluctuation and head loss. This relationship may be related to the strain developed by the advancing longwall face. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> in <b>the</b> wells monitored fell at the greatest rate when the ground surrounding the well was in tension. The rate of the decline decreased as the dynamic development of the strains was changing from tension to compression. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> <b>levels</b> were found to be near the premining level before the ground was subject to maximum compressive strain.
