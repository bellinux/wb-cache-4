5|$|According to {{the creator}} of BackupHDDVD, he or she first set out to {{circumvent}} AACS to bypass a restriction in software HD DVD players which reduced the quality of AACS restricted 1080p high definition video to that of standard definition DVD video or refused to play outright unless an HDCP compliant chain of video hardware was present. At the time only a few computer monitors and video cards supported HDCP. As a result, configurations <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> high-definition HD DVD viewing in software players were exceptionally rare.|$|E
5|$|Eastern Africa {{represents}} some of {{the most}} reliable dates, due to the use of radiocarbon dating on volcanic ash deposits, as well as {{some of the}} earliest MSA sites. Faunal preservation, however, is not spectacular, and standardization in site excavation and lithic classification was, until recently, lacking. Unlike northern Africa, shifts between lithic technologies were not nearly as pronounced, likely due to more favorable climatic conditions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> for more continuous occupation of sites. Central Africa reflects similar patterning to eastern Africa, yet more archaeological research of the region is certainly required.|$|E

5|$|Ford {{oversaw the}} {{transition}} of the University of Louisville from municipal to state funding. He pushed for reforms to the state's education system, giving up his own chairmanship of the University of Kentucky board of trustees and extending voting rights to student and faculty members of university boards. These changes generally shifted administration positions in the state's colleges from political rewards to professional appointments. He increased funding to the state's education budget and gave expanded powers to the Council on Higher Education. He vetoed a measure <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> collective bargaining for teachers.|$|E
5|$|I {{consider}} {{him to be}} {{one of my best friends}} but the real thing is about managers: I think Steinman's manager is the devil and Steinman feels the same way about my manager. So, we had to communicate through managers and he refused to sign some papers <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> for the recording of Bat Out of Hell III without a hitch. So, really, I didn't sue Jim Steinman. I sued his manager.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over the {{proposed}} Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic proposal <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> individuals to sue their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), favoring instead a more limited bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient's ability to appeal HMO decisions. Many doctors in the Republican legislative caucus felt their party's bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and Tennessee Senator Bill Frist were notable exceptions. Fletcher's position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA). After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler's bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000. However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher's 53 percent. The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith.|$|E

5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a bill <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; {{despite the fact that}} the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|In the Senate, Cooper {{helped lead}} the {{opposition}} to the development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), putting him at odds with many in his party, including President Nixon. Cooper had long been an opponent of ABMs, which he believed could intensify a worldwide nuclear arms race. On August 6, 1969, a vote to suspend funding of the development of ABMs failed in the Senate by a vote of 50–51; Vice-President Spiro Agnew cast the tie-breaking vote. After this defeat, Cooper and Michigan Senator Philip Hart co-sponsored the Cooper–Hart Amendment <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> funding for research and development of ABMs, but banned deployment of a U.S. ABM system. The measure failed by three votes but increased congressional scrutiny of the Defense Department budget, leading to a reduction in funding and hastening Strategic Arms Limitation Talks with the Soviets. Cooper served as an advisor to President Nixon during the events leading up to the talks.|$|E

50|$|Conservative Party {{president}} John Walsh's {{letter to}} caucus stated that only Members of Parliament (MPs) {{would vote for}} the interim leader, but Conservative Senators {{pointed out that the}} party constitution states that the entire parliamentary caucus votes.

500|$|The fifth vessel, Warship Number 797, {{was planned}} as an {{improved}} Shinano but was never laid down. In {{addition to the}} modifications made to <b>that</b> ship, 797 <b>would</b> <b>have</b> removed the two [...] wing turrets in favor of additional 100mm guns; authors William Garzke and Robert Dulin estimate <b>that</b> this <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> for 24 of these weapons.

50|$|An {{analysis}} of the timing of Holarctic megafaunal extinctions and extirpations over the last 56,000 years has revealed a tendency for such events to cluster within interstadials, periods of abrupt warming, but only when humans were also present. Humans may have impeded processes of migration and recolonization <b>that</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> the megafaunal species {{to adapt to the}} climate shift. In at least some areas, interstadials were periods of expanding human populations.|$|R

[...] Milford had asserted before the Second Circuit <b>that</b> it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> a public group to use Aesop's fables to impart moral values to children. [...] Milford also allowed the Boy Scouts to [...] "influence a boy's character, development, and spiritual growth". [...] Likewise, the Good News Club also sought to teach moral values to children, albeit from an explicitly Christian viewpoint.|$|R

25|$|In 1991, the Philippine Senate {{rejected}} a treaty <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> a 10-year {{extension of the}} U.S. military bases in the country.

25|$|In 1917, during World War I, a rule {{allowing}} cloture of {{a debate}} {{was adopted by the}} Senate on a 76-3 roll call vote at the urging of President Woodrow Wilson, after a group of 12 anti-war senators managed to kill a bill <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> Wilson to arm merchant vessels in the face of unrestricted German submarine warfare.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan {{also decided}} to boycott these Games because the People's Republic of China (PRC) exerted {{pressure}} on the Montreal organising committee to keep the delegation from the Republic of China (ROC) from competing under that name. The ROC refused a proposed compromise <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> still <b>allowed</b> them to use the ROC flag and anthem {{as long as the}} name was changed. Taiwan did not participate again until 1984, when it returned under the name of Chinese Taipei and with a special flag and anthem.|$|R
50|$|Originally, Mickey Mania {{was planned}} {{as a game}} to be {{released}} as part of Mickey's 65th birthday. However, as <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> only <b>allowed</b> for six months to develop the game, this idea was soon scrapped {{in favor of the}} more compelling concept of Mickey traveling back in time to his own original classic cartoons and subsequently recreating the events of the aforementioned shorts in the process. The game pays tribute to Mickey's whole cartoon career (released in 1994, the year after Mickey's 65th birthday).|$|R

25|$|Sadat {{had also}} pushed forward a {{constitutional}} amendment <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> him to stand for re-election as President more than twice.

25|$|As {{a result}} of these efforts, in March 2003 the Spotsylvania County Board of Supervisors denied the {{rezoning}} application <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> {{for the development of the}} site. Immediately following the vote, the Civil War Trust and other Coalition members began working to acquire the battlefield. By working with county officials and developers, the Civil War Trust acquired 140 acres in 2004 and another 74 acres in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The inquiry {{began at}} Glasgow Sheriff Court on 22 July 2015 before Sheriff John Beckett QC. Evidence to the inquiry found {{there were no}} {{mechanical}} faults with the vehicle and that the other two crew members would {{have been unable to}} apply the handbrake because they were wearing their seatbelts. No other safety devices were fitted to the vehicle <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> a crew member not in the driver's seat to stop the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Further {{refinements}} to the protocol, {{described in}} the Zcash protocol specification, were made by Zcash project members.

50|$|With more {{repeated}} observations, {{more and}} more changes have been found; since the changes occur {{in the winter and}} spring, experts are tending to believe that gullies were formed from dry ice. Before-and-after images demonstrated the timing of this activity coincided with seasonal carbon-dioxide frost and temperatures <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>allowed</b> for liquid water. When dry ice frost changes to a gas, it may lubricate dry material to flow especially on steep slopes. In some years frost, perhaps as thick as 1 meter.|$|R
