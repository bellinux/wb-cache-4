5|$|Due {{to having}} severe PTSD and {{being unable to}} do her job {{correctly}} anymore, Cristina quits and begins bartending and eventually throws a housewarming party. Derek helps Cristina emotionally and she ultimately decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> after helping {{the victim of a}} school shooting. Yang discovers she is pregnant with Hunt's child, and decides to get an abortion. Though Hunt accompanies her to the abortion, he is extremely angry with her decision. Yang then operates on Henry Burton (Scott Foley), Altman's husband, unknown of his identity. When the surgery fails and he dies, Yang is guilt stricken upon learning of her patient's identity. Altman forgives Yang and forces Yang to realize that she did everything possible. Altman's mentorship of Yang is punishing at times, and Altman brutally emphasizes that Yang must learn patience, compassion, and the basics over the flashy surgeries Yang prefers. Altman's tutelage is successful, and Yang evolves into an aware and well-rounded surgeon because of it. Altman allows Yang {{to come up with a}} wish list of dream surgeries to fulfill before Altman resigns and moves on.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1957 Mao {{suggested}} a nationwide programme of mass collectivization, in which China's farmers would be forcibly relocated to large agricultural communes and all private property would be eliminated. Mao's theories on mass collectivization became {{the basis of the}} Great Leap Forward, a national economic plan that began in 1958 which caused a man-made famine across the country that lasted for several years. By 1959, {{tens of millions of people}} had starved to death. From October–December 1958, the economic system in the countryside broke down as farmers refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in the fields, raided government granaries for food, and in Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Qinghai, rebelled. In December 1958 China's leaders quietly decided to reverse the policies of the Great Leap.|$|E
