5|$|The Association {{itself has}} a long history, and in fact predates Manor Hall being {{originally}} formed in 1925 as the ‘Elton House Old Students’ Association’ by Winifred Armstead. In 1932, when the ladies from Elton House relocated to the newly built Manor Hall, the Association was renamed accordingly. The Association {{is run by a}} committee of volunteers and was wound up pro tem in 2005 due to incumbent committee growing too old <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> work with members being transferred to the Wills Hall Association until such a time as new officers could be found <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> work.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech was in possession of the ball, deep inside Wake Forest territory. Shortly after the quarter began, Tech failed to gain a needed first down in order <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> drive. Instead of attempting to convert the fourth down—Tech had attempted and failed on two fourth-down conversions in the third quarter—Tech instead sent in kicker Travis Bell. Bell's 34-yard attempt sailed through the goalposts, and with 12:53 remaining in the game, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead.|$|E
5|$|By 1983, Kennedy Martin {{had written}} {{the first draft of}} what would {{eventually}} become Edge of Darkness – at this stage it was called Magnox (a reference to the Magnox type of nuclear reactor) and was about trade union problems in the nuclear industry. The script was given to BBC Head of Drama Series & Serials, Jonathan Powell, who encouraged Kennedy Martin <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> development. The script would go though many changes and revisions before reaching its final form.|$|E

5|$|Heavy {{resistance}} was encountered that {{day as the}} 2/2nd Infantry Battalion advanced towards the high ground around Oivi. They were held up {{for a number of}} days until outflanking moves by the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, temporarily detached to the 25th Brigade, pushed the Japanese back and enabled the brigade <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> advance. Gorari was taken and by mid-November the brigade, having suffered 471 battle casualties since the being committed to the fighting around Kokoda, finally reached Wairopi, where the swollen Kumusi River was forded.|$|E
5|$|Making slow going amidst {{considerable}} resistance, the Australians nevertheless reached KB Mission {{late in the}} day. A {{force of}} Japanese remained there, and the Australians attacked with bayonets fixed. In the fighting that followed 60 Japanese were killed or wounded. The Australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> advance the following morning.|$|E
5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary judgment. In response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto was allowed <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> license past exhaustion, {{it would be}} able to {{dominate}} the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E

5|$|In April 1996, after {{continued}} Hezbollah rocket {{attacks on}} Israeli civilians, the Israeli armed forces launched Operation Grapes of Wrath, which {{was intended to}} wipe out Hezbollah's base in southern Lebanon. Over 100 Lebanese refugees {{were killed by the}} shelling of a UN base at Qana, in what the Israeli military said was a mistake. Finally, following several days of negotiations, the two sides signed the Grapes of Wrath Understandings on 26 April 1996. A cease-fire was agreed upon between Israel and Hezbollah, which would be effective on 27 April 1996. Both sides agreed that civilians should not be targeted, which meant that Hezbollah would be allowed <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> military activities against IDF forces inside Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|In July 1915, the Truxtun {{was on its}} way to Alaska when {{it broke}} down and was unable <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> mission. Initially, the blame fell on Callaghan, who had {{apparently}} ordered incorrect parts for the condenser. He was suspended from duty and ordered to appear before a court-martial. Subsequent investigation, however, found that another man was responsible for the error and Callaghan received a full acquittal and was reinstated. A few months later, he was appointed as commanding officer of the Truxtun, but the stress of his trial appeared to have left its mark—at the age of 25 years, his hair had already turned gray.|$|E
5|$|Members of the WSPU were {{sometimes}} heckled and derided for spoiling elections for Liberal candidates. On 18 January 1908, Pankhurst and her associate Nellie Martel {{were attacked by}} an all-male crowd of Liberal supporters who blamed the WSPU for costing them a recent by-election to the Conservative candidate. The men threw clay, rotten eggs, and stones packed in snow; the women were beaten and Pankhurst's ankle was severely bruised. Similar tensions later formed with Labour. Until party leaders made the vote for women a priority, however, the WSPU vowed <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> militant activism. Pankhurst {{and others in the}} union saw party politics as distracting to the goal of women's suffrage and criticised other organisations for putting party loyalty ahead of women's votes.|$|E

5|$|On 20–22 September, the VRS 5th Kozara and 6th Sanska brigades {{managed to}} push OG Centre back {{approximately}} , while parts of OG North had {{to withdraw from}} some areas they had captured. OG North was able <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> advance near Novi Grad and towards Ljubija against strong resistance. On 22 September, Colonel General Ratko Mladić cut short his medical treatment in Belgrade to return to Banja Luka and control the VRS more directly. The meeting between the top VRS commanders and Mladić produced a request for general mobilisation, establishment of corps-level drumhead court-martials, and a request for the SDG to leave the area—despite {{the fact that they}} had been invited by the Republika Srpska Ministry of the Interior and had been granted authority by Radovan Karadžić, the president of Republika Srpska. Finally, a VRS counteroffensive was ordered to regain the lost territory.|$|E

Sing vowed that Odex would rely on weekly reports generated by BayTSP <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> anti-piracy drive, and that it would again resort to legal action if downloaders or their ISPs did not respond acceptably.|$|E

During this time, the Australians commenced a period of training to prepare them for combat on the Western Front as it was still expected that they would be sent to England for deployment in the European theatre. As they waited, however, the Australian and New Zealand forces in Egypt at the time were formed into the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) under the command of Lieutenant General William Birdwood, and consisting of the Australian 1st Division and the composite New Zealand and Australian Division (NZ).|$|E

Ubisoft Toronto was the game's lead developer, with assistance from Ubisoft Montreal. Ubisoft Shanghai developed the game's co-operative multiplayer mode. The Toronto studio focused on the game's Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions, with the Wii U version developed by Ubisoft Shanghai.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{agreement}} and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the Congolese government have remained tense. A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> illegal exploitation of Congolese minerals. Meanwhile, Kagame blamed Kabila {{for failing to}} suppress Hutu rebels in North and South Kivu provinces. Two major insurgencies {{have occurred in the}} eastern provinces: the first, from 2005 to 2009, was led by Congolese Tutsi Laurent Nkunda, while the second, carried out by the March 23 Movement (M23) under leader Bosco Ntaganda, began in 2012; Ntaganda gave himself up to the International Criminal Court in early 2013, and peace talks have taken place, but as of May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming. Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda, a charge Kagame denies. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23; this report cites Kagame's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 15, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the Big Island of Hawaii, meaning gale force winds were possible within 36 hours; concurrently, a high surf advisory was put into effect for all eastward facing shorelines. By late on August 15, the CPHC issued a hurricane watch for {{the entire state of}} Hawaii. Early the next day, the CPHC upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the Big Island of Hawaii, as Fernanda was expected <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> westward track. When the hurricane slowed, its movement was uncertain, although all watches and warnings were canceled by August 17, when Fernanda began its northwest track. Officials opened nine shelters on the Big Island, and about 200 people stayed in them until the hurricane watches were canceled. One shelter near Hilo held 80 people due to concern of the high waves. Officials on the Big Island closed and evacuated all of the beach parks on August 15. On Molokai, 40 hikers were evacuated from a valley prone to flooding. Residents bought emergency supplies on Kauai, which had been struck by powerful Hurricane Iniki 11 months prior.|$|E
5|$|In July 1937 {{war broke}} out in {{northern}} China between China and Japan, and by August the fighting had spread {{to the city of}} Shanghai. After capturing Shanghai the Japanese Army decided on December 1 <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>its</b> military campaign to the capital city of the Nationalist government of China, Nanking, which is roughly 300 kilometers west of Shanghai. Although the Japanese succeeded in surrounding Nanking and defeating the Chinese garrison stationed there by December 13, few of the Chinese soldiers within the city formally surrendered. Instead they threw away their uniforms and weapons and hid among the city's civilian population. Over the course of its subsequent occupation of Nanking the Japanese Army hunted down the former Chinese soldiers within the city and in a large number of cases summarily executed them. At the same time soldiers of the Japanese Army also committed random acts of murder against civilians, and engaged in rape, arson, and looting. These events are collectively known as the Nanking Massacre.|$|E
