5|$|Lincolnshire, {{despite its}} {{relatively}} small size, {{is home to}} nine local public parks. Spring Lake Park, which is centered on an eponymous lake and sports a small beachhead, hosts Lincolnshire's festivities during <b>the</b> <b>Fourth</b> <b>of</b> <b>July.</b> North Park, a major sporting field and nature reserve in northeastern Lincolnshire, collaborates with Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103 to meet both the growing need for youth sports teams and extra recreational public park space; School District 103 also collaborated with the village of Lincolnshire to create an educational nature center called Rivershire Park, which is located in southeastern Lincolnshire. The nature center runs programs to educate district students and other visitors about the local ecology, alongside the natural fauna and flora of the Lake County area, and Memorial Park is a rest stop for pedestrians and cyclists traversing eastern Lincolnshire; Florsheim Nature Preserve, which sports an unusually high Floristic Quality Index rating, is shelter to endangered and threatened species of flora rarely found elsewhere in the county. Whytegate Park, an athletic complex overshadowed by nearby North Park, sports several sports courts and a fitness course, and Balzer Park {{is home to a}} short hiking trail and sports facilities. Lincolnshire's other two parks, Bicentennial Park and Olde Mill Park, are little more than playgrounds for local children.|$|E
5|$|Placed on {{an upper}} {{floor of the}} State House, the bell was rung {{in the early years}} of {{independence}} on <b>the</b> <b>Fourth</b> <b>of</b> <b>July</b> and on Washington's Birthday, as well as on Election Day to remind voters to hand in their ballots. It also rang to call students at the University of Pennsylvania to their classes at nearby Philosophical Hall. Until 1799, when the state capital was moved to Lancaster, it again rang to summon legislators into session. When Pennsylvania, having no further use for its State House, proposed to tear it down and sell the land for building lots, the City of Philadelphia purchased the land, together with the building, including the bell, for $70,000, equal to $ today. In 1828, the city sold the second Lester and Pack bell to St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church, which was burned down by an anti-Catholic mob in the Philadelphia Nativist Riots of 1844. The remains of the bell were recast; the new bell is now located at Villanova University.|$|E
