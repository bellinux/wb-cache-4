In June 1626, after an {{unsuccessful}} rebellion by his father, Aurangzeb and his brother Dara Shukoh were kept as hostages under their grandparents' (Nur Jahan and Jahangir) Lahore court. On 26 February 1628, Shah Jahan was officially declared the Mughal Emperor, and Aurangzeb returned {{to live with his}} parents at Agra Fort, where Aurangzeb received his formal education in Arabic and Persian.

25|$|In 2010, Diamond co-edited (with James Robinson) Natural Experiments of History, a {{collection}} of seven case studies illustrating the multidisciplinary and comparative approach to <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> that he advocates. The book’s title {{stems from the fact}} that it is not possible to study history by the preferred methods of the laboratory sciences, i.e., by controlled experiments comparing replicated human societies as if they were test tubes of bacteria. Instead, one must look at natural experiments in which human societies that are similar in many respects have been historically perturbed, either by different starting conditions or by different impacts. The book’s afterword classifies natural experiments, discusses the practical difficulties of studying them, and offers suggestions how to address those difficulties.|$|E
25|$|Patterson {{continued}} to study languages {{during his time}} as principal of the Agricultural and Mechanical College. Already familiar with Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, he developed a good knowledge of Sanskrit, Gothic, Anglo-Saxon, German, and French. Between 1871 and 1874, he was a frequent contributor of editorial content to local publications and newspapers, including {{a series of articles}} on tariffs and foreign policy which appeared in the Louisville Courier-Journal. In 1875, his alma mater, Hanover College, presented him with an honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree. During his later academic career, Patterson devoted more time to <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> metaphysics, and political science. In 1880, he was elected a fellow of both the British Royal Historical Society and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. In 1896, Lafayette College conferred upon him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.|$|E

25|$|Bolingbroke retired baffled and {{disappointed}} from the fray to France in June, residing principally at the château of Argeville near Fontainebleau. He now wrote his Letters on <b>the</b> <b>Study</b> <b>of</b> <b>History</b> (printed privately {{before his death}} and published in 1752), and the True Use of Retirement. In 1738, he visited England, {{became one of the}} leading friends and advisers of Frederick, Prince of Wales, who now headed the opposition, and wrote for the occasion The Patriot King, which together with a previous essay, The Spirit of Patriotism, and The State of Parties at the Accession of George I, were entrusted to Pope and not published. Having failed, however, to obtain any share in politics, he returned to France in 1739, and subsequently sold Dawley. In 1742 and 1743, he again visited England and quarrelled with Warburton. In 1744, he settled finally at Battersea with his friend Hugh Hume, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, and was present at Pope's death in May. The discovery that the poet had printed secretly 1500 copies of The Patriot King, caused him to publish a correct version in 1749, and stirred up a further altercation with Warburton, who defended his friend against Bolingbroke's bitter aspersions, the latter, whose conduct was generally reprehended, publishing a Familiar Epistle to the most Impudent Man Living.|$|E

500|$|In his Essay on a Course of Liberal Education for Civil and Active Life (1765), Lectures on History and General Policy (1788), {{and other}} works, Priestley {{argued that the}} {{education}} of the young should anticipate their future practical needs. This principle of utility guided his unconventional curricular choices for Warrington's aspiring middle-class students. He recommended modern languages instead of classical languages and modern rather than ancient history. Priestley's lectures on history were particularly revolutionary; he narrated a providentialist and naturalist account of history, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> furthered the comprehension of God's natural laws. Furthermore, his millennial perspective was closely tied to his optimism regarding scientific progress and the improvement of humanity. He believed that each age would improve upon the previous and that <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> allowed people to perceive and to advance this progress. Since <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> was a moral imperative for Priestley, he also promoted the education of middle-class women, which was unusual at the time. Some scholars of education have described Priestley as the most important English writer on education between the 17th-century John Locke and the 19th-century Herbert Spencer. Lectures on History was well received and was employed by many educational institutions, such as New College at Hackney, Brown, Princeton, Yale, and Cambridge. Priestley designed two Charts to serve as visual study aids for his [...] Lectures. These charts are in fact timelines; they have been described as the most influential timelines published in the 18th century. Both were popular for decades, and the trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the University of Edinburgh to grant him a Doctor of Law degree in 1764.|$|E

500|$|As an {{administrator}} Marlborough was also without peer; {{his attention to}} detail meant his troops rarely went short of supply – when his army arrived at its destination it was intact and in a fit state to fight. This concern {{for the welfare of}} the common soldier together with his ability to inspire trust and confidence, and his willingness to share the dangers of battle, often earned him adulation from his men – [...] "The known world could not produce a man of more humanity", observed Corporal Matthew Bishop. It was this range of abilities that makes Marlborough outstanding. Even his old adversaries recognised the Duke's qualities. In his Letters on <b>the</b> <b>Study</b> <b>of</b> <b>History</b> (1752), Bolingbroke declared – [...] "I take with pleasure this opportunity of doing justice to that great man... as the greatest general, and as the greatest minister that our country, or perhaps any other has produced, I honour". His success was made possible because of his enormous reserves of stamina, willpower and self-discipline; his ability to hold together the Alliance against France, made possible by his victories, can hardly be overestimated.|$|E

40|$|Current {{teaching}} methods for architectural history seldom embrace building technology {{as an essential}} component <b>of</b> <b>study.</b> Accepting <b>the</b> premise that architectural history is a fundamental component to the overall architectural learning environment, {{it is argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>history</b> will further enhance student knowledge. This hypothesis created an opportunity to investigate how <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>history</b> could be incorporated to strengthen present {{teaching methods}}. Strategies for teaching architectural history were analyzed with the determination that an incorporation of educational instructional design applications using object-oriented programming and hypermedia provided the optimal solution.

Yet it was his Dutch colleague, Johan Huizinga, who was primarily responsible for popularising the pessimistic view of the Late Middle Ages, with his book The Autumn of the Middle Ages (1919). To Huizinga, whose research focused on France and the Low Countries rather than Italy, despair and decline were the main themes, not rebirth.|$|E
