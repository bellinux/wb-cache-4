5|$|The Layer Pyramid (known locally in Arabic as el haram el midawwar, , meaning 'rubble-hill pyramid') is {{a ruined}} step pyramid {{dating to the}} 3rd Dynasty of Egypt (2686 BC to 2613 BC) and located in the {{necropolis}} of Zawyet El Aryan. Its ownership is uncertain and may be attributable to pharaoh Khaba.

5|$|After {{returning}} to Edmonton in 1982 and {{learning of the}} lead-level findings from the 1981 expedition, Beattie struggled to find a cause. Possibilities included the lead solder used to seal the expedition's food tins, other food containers lined with lead foil, food colouring, tobacco products, pewter tableware, and lead-wicked candles. He came {{to suspect that the}} problems of lead poisoning compounded by the effects of scurvy could have been lethal for the Franklin crew. However, because skeletal lead might reflect lifetime exposure rather than exposure limited to the voyage, Beattie's theory could be tested only by forensic examination of preserved soft tissue as opposed to bone. Beattie decided to examine the graves of <b>the</b> <b>buried</b> crewmen on Beechey Island.|$|E
5|$|Altar 19 {{was buried}} in the fill of the final version of Temple 33, {{immediately}} in front of the second version of the summit shrine. It was badly damaged and was broken into several pieces, and the majority of a sculpture depicting a seated person was chipped away. The three fragments were buried together in a way that paired the altar with <b>the</b> <b>buried</b> Stela 31; this may have maintained a relationship between the monuments that existed when they were originally on public display. The altar was crafted from limestone and is now in the site museum at Tikal. It has been dated to approximately AD 445.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, the church was buried and {{forgotten}} about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered it while tying his donkey to a nearby cherry tree. A different version places the cherry tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach <b>the</b> <b>buried</b> gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E
5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} their work. As {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries <b>the</b> <b>buried</b> ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. They believe that the craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.|$|E

40|$|The bivalve Macoma bait hica has to {{deal with}} a {{trade-off}} between predation risk and food availability in order to determine its burying depth. To know more about the phenotypic plasticity of <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth of Macoma, experiments are done in the field with regard to predator presence of the Shore crab Carcinus maenas and the shorebirds the Knot Calidris canutus and the Oystercatcher Haematopus ostraiegus. By means of transplantation experiments it is determined whether the origin and the environment of the clam are important factors influencing <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth. <b>The</b> origin of a clam has an effect; the clams originating from near <b>the</b> gully <b>bury</b> significantly deeper at the same location than the clams originating from high on the tidal flat. The environment of the clam seems to have no effect upon <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth of Macoma, only little variation in <b>burying</b> depth between <b>the</b> treatments occurred during the second experiment. This might be {{due to the fact that}} the clams were already buried deep; possibly safer from predation. To know the effect of the environment of the clam upon <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth, it is recommended to repeat this experiment. A crab predator seems to have an effect upon <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth of Macoma. In the presence of a predator the clams seem to bury deeper, but this effect is not significant. The same results come out of the experiment with the shorebirds, now only the effect of predator presence is tested. Another outcome of both experiments seem to be that the condition of a clam has a positive effect upon <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth of Macoma. With increasing condition <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth is increasing. Another experiment is done to look at the effect of clam density upon <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth of Macoma. Macoma living in a low density bury significantly deeper than those living under medium- or high-density categories do. Besides these experiments an observation on <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth of Macoma at different locations on the tidal flat during the season is done. <b>The</b> <b>burying</b> depth of Macoma is dependent on the time of the year, but also on the initial depth. Macoma that are buried deep do not react much on change in time, while the shallow living ones bury deeper. Thus differences in burying depth between Macama of different locations change in time. As predator presence seems to have an effect on <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> depth of Macoma, it is recommended to repeat this experiment and to test again the effect of 'environment' besides predator presence. The origin of a clam is of importance; it would be interesting to look whether <b>the</b> difference in <b>burying</b> depth can be inherited by their offspring. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the layer pyramid allows it to be securely dated to the time span between the reigns of king Sekhemkhet and that of king Snofru, {{the founder of the}} 4th Dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare the {{architecture of}} the layer pyramid with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, expecting the layer pyramid to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. The layer pyramid exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its substructures and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. According to these egyptologists, the layer pyramid is a clearly advanced version of <b>the</b> <b>buried</b> pyramid of Sekhemkhet.|$|E
5|$|The {{first night}} of The Seagull, at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on 17 October 1896, was a fiasco, as the play was booed by the audience, {{stinging}} Chekhov into renouncing the theatre. But the play so impressed the theatre director Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko that he convinced his colleague Konstantin Stanislavski to direct a new production for the innovative Moscow Art Theatre in 1898. Stanislavski's attention to psychological realism and ensemble playing coaxed <b>the</b> <b>buried</b> subtleties from the text, and restored Chekhov's interest in playwriting.
