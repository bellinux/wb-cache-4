A direct role for PacC in activating the expression of an alkaline-expressed gene has previously been demonstrated, but the mechanism by which alkaline ambient pH prevents the expression of any eukaryotic acid-expressed gene has never been reported. Here we show that a double PacC binding site in the promoter of the acid-expressed gabA gene, encoding g-aminobutyrate (GABA) permease, overlaps the binding site for the transcriptional activator IntA, which mediates v-amino acid induction. Using bacterially expressed fusion proteins, we have shown that PacC competes with IntA for DNA binding in vitro at this site. Thus, PacC repression of GABA permease synthesis is direct and occurs by blocking induction. A swap of IntA sites between promoters for gabA and amdS, a gene not subject to pH regulation, makes gabA expression pH independent and amdS acid expressed. A form of gene regulation common in the microbial world, enabling organisms to adapt to differing environments, is con-trol of gene expression by ambient pH. Such regulation tailor...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRyanodine and {{inositol}} 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) receptors – {{two related}} families of Ca 2 + channels responsible for release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores [1] – are biphasically regulated by cytosolic Ca 2 +[2 – 4]. It {{is thought that}} the resulting positive feedback allows localised Ca 2 +-release events to propagate regeneratively, and that the negative feedback limits the amplitude of individual events [5 – 6]. Stimulation of IP 3 receptors by Ca 2 + occurs through a Ca 2 +-binding site that becomes exposed only after IP 3 has bound to its receptor [7, 8]. Here, we report that rapid inhibition of IP 3 receptors by Ca 2 + occurs only if the receptor has not bound IP 3. The IP 3 therefore switches its receptor from a state in which only an inhibitory Ca 2 +-binding site is accessible to one in which only a stimulatory site is available. <b>This</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>ensures</b> that Ca 2 + released by an active IP 3 receptor may rapidly inhibit its unliganded neighbours, but it cannot terminate the activity of a receptor with IP 3 bound. Such lateral inhibition, which is a universal feature of sensory systems where it improves contrast and dynamic range, may fulfil similar roles in intracellular Ca 2 + signalling by providing increased sensitivity to IP 3 and allowing rapid graded recruitment of IP 3 receptors...|$|E

To date, {{only a small number}} of proteins implicated in copper homeostasis have been identified, and little is known of the protein-protein interactions required for this process. To identify other proteins important for copper homeostasis, while also elucidating the protein-protein interactions that are integral to the process, we have utilized a known copper protein, the copper ATPase ATP 7 A, as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human cDNA library to search for interacting partners. One of the ATP 7 A-interacting proteins identified is a novel protein with a single PDZ domain. This protein was recently identified to interact with the plasma membrane calcium ATPase b-splice variants. We propose a change in name for this protein from PISP (plasma membrane calcium ATPase-interacting single-PDZ protein) to AIPP 1 (ATPase-interacting PDZ protein) and suggest that it represents the protein that interacts with the class I PDZ binding motif identified at the ATP 7 A C terminus. The interaction in mammalian cells was confirmed and an additional splice variant of AIPP 1 was identified.

40|$|Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV- 1) {{assembly}} is a multistep process {{mediated by}} the viral precursor polyprotein Gag (Pr 55 Gag). Matrix (MA), which constitutes the N-terminal domain of Pr 55 Gag, is essential for membrane binding and targeting of Gag to the plasma membrane (PM). MA has a bipartite signal for membrane binding: a myristate moiety at the N-terminus and amino acid residues 17 - 31 that form a highly basic region (HBR) {{on the surface of}} MA. The N-terminal myristate is normally sequestered into the MA globular domain, and a structural change exposes myristate, thereby enhancing membrane binding. The HBR on the other hand is thought to bind acidic lipids. Previous results from the lab suggest that a PM-specific acidic lipid, phosphatidylinositol-(4, 5) -bisphosphate [PI(4, 5) P 2], is important for Gag localization to the PM. In this thesis, I have shown that Gag interacts specifically with PI(4, 5) P 2 and that this interaction is important for efficient membrane binding of Gag. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which Gag-PI(4, 5) P 2 interaction is regulated, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the MA HBR. Using this approach, we identified three lysines that facilitate membrane binding by interacting with PI(4, 5) P 2. Strikingly, mutations in two other lysines in the MA HBR enhance PI(4, 5) P 2 -independent membrane binding by exposing myristate. Thus, MA HBR has opposing roles in membrane binding. Notably, another major finding of this thesis is that RNA also negatively regulates membrane binding of Gag. In the absence but not in the presence of PI(4, 5) P 2, RNA bound to the MA HBR abolishes membrane binding of Gag. Overall, the results from this thesis suggest that the MA HBR regulates membrane binding both positively by binding to PI(4, 5) P 2 and negatively through myristate sequestration and RNA binding. <b>This</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>ensures</b> that Gag is targeted specifically to the PM, where it likely interacts with other viral and cellular molecules for efficient virus assembly and release...|$|E
40|$|Repair of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) by the {{homologous}} recombination (HR) pathway results in crossovers (COs) {{required for a}} successful first meiotic division. DSB resection is the nucleic degradation of DSB ends to expose 3 ’ single strand DNA (ssDNA), an intermediate required for HR. To investigate genes involved in meiosis, a forward genetic screen was performed to search for novel genes or informative new mutant alleles of known genes. Mre 11 is {{one member of the}} MRX/N (Mre 11 -Rad 50 -Xrs 2 /Nbs 1) complex required for meiotic DSB formation and for resection in budding yeast. In Caenorhabditis elegans, evidence for the MRX/N’s role in DSB resection is limited. We isolated the first separation of function allele in C. elegans, mre 11 (iow 1), isolated from our forward genetic screen. The mre- 11 (iow 1) mutants are specifically defective in meiotic DSB resection but not in DSB formation. The mre 11 (iow 1) mutants display chromosomal fragmentation and aggregation in late prophase I. Recombination intermediates and crossover formation is greatly reduced in mre 11 (iow 1) mutants. Irradiation induced DSBs during meiosis fail to be repaired from the early to middle prophase I in mre 11 (iow 1) mutants. Our data suggest that some DSBs in mre 11 (iow 1) mutants are repaired by the non homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway because removing NHEJ partially suppresses some meiotic defects conferred by mre 11 (iow 1). In the absence of NHEJ and a functional MRX/N, meiotic DSBs are channeled to an EXO 1 dependent form of recombination repair. Overall, our analysis supports a role for MRE- 11 in the resection of DSBs in early to middle meiotic prophase I and in blocking NHEJ. A reverse genetic screen and a yeast two hybrid screen were performed to search for genes with genetic and/or physical interactions with mre- 11. The reverse genetic screen isolated a novel meiotic gene, nhr- 2, as a partial suppressor of the meiotic defects conferred by mre- 11 (iow 1). The yeast two hybrid screen identified kin- 18 interacting with mre- 11. KIN- 18 is the C. elegans homolog of mammalian Thousand And One kinase (TAO) kinase. KIN- 18 /TAO is MAPK kinase kinase whose meiotic role was unknown. We have found that KIN- 18 is essential for normal meiotic progression as kin- 18 mutants exhibit accelerated meiotic recombination, ectopic germ cell differentiation, and enhanced levels of germline apoptosis. In C. elegans MPK- 1 activation in late pachytene is required for physiological apoptosis (nuclei removed by apoptosis serve as nursing cells for oocytes) and oocyte differentiation. The kin- 18 mutants also showed absence of MPK- 1 activation and aberrant MPK- 1 activation that includes ectopic activation in the wrong regions in the germline or more than one time of activation. The progression defects in kin- 18 mutants are suppressed by inhibiting an upstream activator, KSR- 2, of the canonical MPK- 1 signaling. Our data suggest KIN- 18 affects meiotic progression by modulating the timing of MPK- 1 activation. <b>This</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>ensures</b> the proper timing of recombination and normal apoptosis, which is required for the formation of functional oocytes. Meiosis is a conserved process; revealing that KIN- 18 is a novel regulator of meiotic progression in C. elegans will motivate hypothesis for TAO kinase’s role in the germline development in higher eukaryotes. Meiosis is a crucial for sexually reproducing organisms to maintain ploidy level {{from one generation to the}} next. Accurate chromosome segregation in the meiosis requires meiotic recombination between homologous chromosomes. Failure in recombination can lead to abnormal segregation of chromosomes in meiosis, which leads to aneuploidy. Anueploidy is a leading cause of miscarriages and attributes to chromosomal related birth defects. Meiotic recombination starts with programmed DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), followed by repair of these DSBs by {{homologous recombination}} (HR) pathway. One key step in HR is resection, a process to covert DSB ends into single strand DNA (ssDNA). To broaden our understanding of meiotic DSB resection, we used a nematode, C. elegans, as a model to investigate genes in DSB resection. We have isolated a specific mutant allele of a meiotic gene, mre- 11. Our data suggest meiotic DSB resection in C. elegans requires collaboration of mre- 11 and another gene exo- 1; efficient resection of DSB ends is important to safeguard repair of DSB by HR against other illegitimate repair pathway. In addition, we identified a gene kin- 18 by looking for genes interacting with mre- 11. Characterization of kin- 18 show meiotic recombination is tightly coordinated with germ cell progression. Our analysis provides significant improvement in the understanding of meiotic recombination in C. elegans. Given the high conservation of the two genes, mre- 11 and kin- 18, our finding may be applied to other organisms...|$|E

Inhibition of CCE by vasopressin requires NOS III and the requirement lies downstream of arachidonic acid. Activation of soluble guanylate cyclase by NO and subsequent activation of protein kinase G are required for inhibition of CCE. Stimulation of NCCE by vasopressin also requires NOS III, but the stimulation is neither mimicked by cGMP nor blocked by inhibitors of soluble guanylate cyclase or protein kinase G. We conclude that arachidonic acid formed in response to vasopressin stimulates NOS III. NO then directly stimulates Ca(2 +) entry through NCCE and, via protein kinase G, it inhibits CCE.

We confirm that, in the presence of AVP, all Ca 2 + entry occurs via NCCE, but 5 -HT, despite activating PLC and evoking release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores, stimulates Ca 2 + entry only via CCE.

Kv 4. 2 channel in vivo {{is found in}} glomeruli, where the dendrites of the cells and mossy fibers form synapses. However, immunocytochemical staining of the cultured granule cells showed that the localization of Kv 4. 2 was restricted to the cell body. I hypothesized that {{this was due to}} the lack of proper triggering signal possibly provided by the excitatory synaptic input from mossy fibers. Thus I developed a co-culture with pontine gray nucleus, an origin of mossy fiber and asked whether the Kv 4. 2 channels resumed their normal localization. In the new co- culture system, mossy fiber formed large synapsin-I positive clusters appeared on the mossy fiber, which were associated with PSD- 95 on granule cell dendrites. The synapse-like structures were formed between the mossy fibers and the granule cell dendrites. Kv 4. 2 was co-localized with this structure. Therefore, contacts with mossy fibers induced targeting of the Kv 4. 2 channels from soma to dendrites and synapses in the granule cells. Treatment of the culture with presynaptic exocytosis inhibitors, tetrodotoxin, ω-conotoxin GVIA, or botulinum A toxin, disrupted the clustering of Kv 4. 2 at the synapse-like structure. Interestingly, mossy fiber contacts induced synaptic targeting of both Kv 4. 2 and NR 1 that was a NMDA receptor subunit. The synaptic localization of Kv 4. 2 was regulated by the activation of NMDA- and/or AMPA-receptors, while activity blockage increased synaptic targeting of the NR 1 subunit. These results indicate that the synaptic targeting of the two channels/receptors is regulated in a contradictory manner by the activity. <b>This</b> differential <b>regulation</b> <b>ensures</b> effective changes in synaptic excitability and should be involved in synaptic maturation as well as in synaptic plasticity...|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{milestones}} in {{the development}} of the Horse Breeding Industry in South Africa was activated in 1948 when Cecily Norden and W.J. van der Merwe were elected as a Select Committee to organise the division of the breeds, the most important one being the Saddle Horse Breeders’ Society of South Africa.They personally did all the research and documentation of the breeding policies, constitutions, standards of conformation, regulations and inspection procedures of the light breeds now, for the first time, divided into Saddle Horses, Boerperde, Arabians and Thoroughbred Hacks. These breeds would now be judged in separate classes in the show ring, with their own strict breed rules and <b>regulations.</b> <b>This</b> would <b>ensure</b> that purity of breed and breed character could be maintained and registered officially, each in its own Breed Society, under the umbrella of the mother society, the Riding Horse Breeders' Society of South Africa.(Interestingly enough, all the Breed Meetings were held in the upper sitting room of the old Commercial Hotel in Middelburg, in clouds of cigarette smoke.) ...|$|R
