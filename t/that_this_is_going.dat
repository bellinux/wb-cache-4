Also, I felt the story needed to be told, I feel <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be an important film." [...] Benjamin Wallfisch, an Emmy and Ivor Novello-nominated composer, composed music for the movie Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain. The film was slated to release in 2010 but the lack of response from the distributors delayed the release. On the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh attended the film's premiere in Bhopal and after watching the film he announced that the state government would not charge any tax on the film's earning. Chouhan called the film [...] "very sensitive" [...] and praised the [...] "heart-rending" [...] performance given by actors. To promote awareness about the tragedy a NGO The Bhopal Medical Appeal and the film's director collaborated with mobile commerce portal Paytm and the online shopping website Snapdeal.

500|$|It was {{announced}} in January 2016 that Stone, Skarlatos and Sadler were working on a memoir titled The 15:17 to Paris, which would highlight {{the events of the}} 2015 Thalys train attack. Perseus Books Group, who will be publishing the book, described the memoir as “the gripping true story of a terrorist attack that would have killed more than 500 people if not for their actions, but it is also the story of three American boys, their friendship, and the values we hold dear.” Jeffrey E. Stern, an international journalist, will co-write the book. David Steinberger, {{president and chief executive of}} Perseus Books Group, said that he is “confident <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a film. It’s extremely cinematic, and there’s a lot of interest in the movie.” He further said that [...] "based on the material, that this was going to be an important book and one that readers were really going to respond to.” The memoir was made available to the public on August 23, 2016, almost a year after the 2015 Thalys train attack. In the acknowledgements, Stone stated that he [...] "give all the credit to God" [...] and made further acknowledgement of his family, friends, the United States Air Force, the citizens of Sacramento and the United States Armed Forces.|$|E
500|$|On 16 August 2010, Iranian {{officials}} withdrew Mohammed Soleimani {{from the}} men's under-48-kilogram category taekwondo final against Israel's Gili Haimovitz, citing an ankle injury. According to the officials, Soleimani had first hurt his ankle at the World Junior Championships in Mexico {{earlier in the}} year, and the injury had flared up again during his semifinal contest against the US's Gregory English. Soleimani was sent to hospital for an X-ray, and his ankle was put into a cast. Haimovitz was awarded the gold medal by default at a victory ceremony at the Suntec International Convention Centre from which Soleimani, the silver medallist, was absent. Interviewed later on, Soleimani said he was [...] "very sad" [...] to have missed the bout as he was [...] "sure [...] {{was going to get}} the gold medal". Israel's chef-de-mission Daniel Oren claimed that the pullout had been politically motivated. He said: [...] "It's not the first time this has happened at the Olympics. But this is a first for a medal match. To be honest, once our boy got into the final, we knew <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen. I spoke to our boy after the final and he, of course, was disappointed {{that he did not have}} a chance to win his gold through an actual fight. I feel more sorry for the Iranian boy. He must have trained hard to get to this stage and was not given a chance to fight. We are dealing with sports here, youth sports, in fact. It's a pity that politics got involved." [...] However, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: [...] "As far as the IOC is concerned, there is no sinister intent here. What we know factually is that the athlete injured his ankle and was sent to the hospital for an X-ray. Tests revealed he did not suffer anything broken, and he is all right now. So unless more factual information is available, it [...] is mere speculation." [...] This was reiterated by IOC President Jacques Rogge on 17 August: [...] "He [...] was driven to the hospital, was examined by a Singaporean doctor, totally independent, not belonging to the organisation and he diagnosed an ankle sprain. For us, that's the end of the story." [...] Previously, Iran has stated that since its existing government does not recognize Israel as a state, its policy is to withdraw from competing against the country.|$|E

Jennifer Adeeko from the organisation behind the MOBO Awards said, [...] "Within the song Lewis is able to show how spectacular her vocal range is, with her softer sounding vocals to her more powerful, belting vocals. [...] Bound {{to get a few}} guys flustered if their girlfriends listen to the track and follow the lyrics; we predict <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be one of her biggest track to date". Entertainment Weekly critic Michael Slezak wrote that [...] "while [...] "Happy" [...] is a solidly written, professionally produced song with a Velcro-ey hook, it has the emotional resonance of a so-so, big-budget romantic comedy. [...] In the hands of a singer who could achieve both technical perfection and emotional depth, 'Happy' might've been my early autumn jam. But delivered in Lewis's lovely-but-vacant style, I'm gonna have to rifle through my iPod for a more substantial diva anthem".|$|E
