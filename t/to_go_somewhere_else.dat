500|$|Arsenal {{began their}} defence {{of the league}} title against newly {{promoted}} team Nottingham Forest on 17 August 1998. A goal by Overmars, eleven minutes from the end gave Arsenal the win; Geoff Thomas equalised for Nottingham Forest after Petit headed in the opening goal. A goalless draw against Liverpool was followed by successive 0–0 draws, at home to Charlton Athletic and away to Chelsea. Stephen Hughes scored a last minute equaliser at Filbert Street on 12 September 1998 to deny Leicester City a win. After the match, Wenger admitted the club {{were looking for a}} new striker to replace Ian Wright, being impressed with Leicester City's goalscorer Emile Heskey: [...] "We will still be buying a striker but unfortunately Leicester do not want to sell Heskey so we will have <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else</b> … I'm impressed by Heskey. Today he did very well offensively and tried like crazy; too much for me." [...] In Arsenal's next match, at home to Manchester United, goals from Tony Adams, Anelka and Freddie Ljungberg helped the champions inflict a 3–0 defeat; the result was Wenger's third consecutive win over rival manager Alex Ferguson. However, in the following match, Arsenal lost {{for the first time in}} the season, against Sheffield Wednesday. Substitute Lee Briscoe scored in the 89th minute, lobbing the ball precisely over goalkeeper Alex Manninger after Sheffield Wednesday striker Paolo Di Canio was sent off for pushing the referee.|$|E

50|$|Golda Meir {{had three}} {{classrooms}} in grade 3, grade 4, and grade 5. That left it with only {{enough room for}} one class in grade 6, grade 7, and grade 8. As a result, there were about 90 students {{in each of the}} elementary grades but only 30 students in each of the middle school grades. The 60 other students had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school <b>somewhere</b> <b>else</b> after grade 5. In 2011, parents asked the school board to allow grade 6 though 8 to move into the closed Milwaukee Education Center middle school, which is adjacent to Golda Meir's property. The building previously housed the Malt House of the long-closed Schlitz Brewery. The expansion has allowed all of Golda Meir's students to remain in the school. Golda Meir added grade 9 in 2014 and will continue to add grades until the Schlitz building has a high school population of 600 students.|$|R

Other students expressed confusion or curiosity about the purpose of the encampment. 70 faculty members signed letters of support for the demonstration.|$|E

When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, she took me in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else.</b> We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speculation has {{sometimes}} focused on Rosario, Hedgepeth's roommate at the time, {{due to her}} 9-1-1 call, the last texts sent from Hedgepeth's phone to her former boyfriend suggesting [...] " [...] needs you more than you know", the woman addressed as [...] "Rosie" [...] on the voicemail conversation and her decision to leave the apartment unlocked with, she claims, a sleeping Hedgepeth inside, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> sleep <b>somewhere</b> <b>else</b> at 4:30 {{the morning of the}} killing. Although she has left North Carolina and said very little about the case since then, Gasparoli wrote in 2017 that he learned from his police sources that they still regularly speak with her, and she cooperates.

In 1991, Roadrunner had already bought a 50 percent stake of Third Mind which gave Levermore a greater financial leeway since Roadrunner paid Levermore [...] "a salary for three years to continue running the label while they financed new releases."

6000|$|Another {{specimen}} of this bushwhacking, that [...] "shoe strike." [...] Now be it understood that I do not pretend {{to know all}} about the matter. I am merely going to speculate a little about some of its phases. And at the outset, I am {{glad to see that}} a system of labor prevails in New England under which laborers can strike when they want to, where they are not obliged to work under all circumstances, and are not tied down and obliged to labor whether you pay them or not! I like the system which lets a man quit when he wants to, and wish it might prevail everywhere. One of the reasons why I am opposed to slavery is just here. What is the true condition of the laborer? I take it that it is best for all to leave each man free to acquire property as fast as he can. Some will get wealthy. I don't believe in a law to prevent a man from getting rich; it would do more harm than good. So, while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else. When one starts poor, as most do in the race of life, free society is such that he knows he can better his condition; he knows that there is no fixed condition of labor for his whole life. I am not ashamed to confess that twenty-five years ago I was a hired laborer, mauling rails, at work on a flatboat--just what might happen to any poor man's son! I want every man to have a chance--and I believe a Black man is entitled to it--in which he can better his condition; when he may look forward and hope to be a hired laborer this year and the next, work for himself afterward, and finally to hire men to work for him! That is the system. Up here in New England, you have a soil that scarcely sprouts black-eyed beans, and yet where will you find wealthy men so wealthy, and poverty so rarely in extremity? There is not another such place on earth! I desire that if you get too thick here, and find it hard to better your condition on this soil, you may have a chance <b>to</b> strike and <b>go</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>else,</b> where you may not be degraded, nor have your families corrupted, by forced rivalry with negro slaves. I want you to have a clean bed and no snakes in it! Then you can better your condition, and so it may go on and on in one endless round so long as man exists {{on the face of the}} earth! ...|$|R
