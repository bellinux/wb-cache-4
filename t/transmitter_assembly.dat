50|$|Newly {{manufactured}} {{units used}} a handset, designated E1, whose development period began in ca. 1921 and {{was completed in}} its essential features by 1927. It was primarily molded in Bakelite, but the receiver and transmitter assemblies had an aluminum metal core. Its <b>transmitter</b> <b>assembly</b> that {{was surrounded by a}} hollow enclosure known colloquially as a spit cup, which would focus sound more effectively into the transmitter. The barrier-button transmitter element exhibited a cone shape into the spit cup and is known as a bullet transmitter among collectors. This feature was eliminated about halfway through the handset production run, when in 1934 the transmitter element was changed to a more efficient type (F1) with better voice reproduction. The F1 element had a flat disk shape and was protected by a simple plastic screen as moisture barrier and a metal grill. This element became the standard transmitter of a new handset type (F) in 1937, and was in use in the Bell System until the 1960s. When this new handset became available, 202-type telephones were routinely refurbished with the new handset.|$|E

50|$|OLA has {{a single}} common {{receiver}} and two complementary <b>transmitter</b> <b>assemblies</b> that enhance {{the resolution of the}} information brought back. OLA's high-energy laser transmitter is used for ranging and mapping from 1 to 7.5 km. The low-energy transmitter is used for ranging and imaging from 0.5 to 1 km. The repetition rate of these transmitters sets the data acquisition rate of OLA. Laser pulses from both the low and high energy transmitters are directed onto a movable scanning mirror, which is co-aligned with the field of view of the receiver telescope limiting the effects of background solar radiation. Each pulse provides target range, azimuth, elevation, received intensity and a time-tag.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{vibration}} during drilling operations has a large effect on both the bottomhole assemblies and the drill bit. While large vibration levels cause reduced rates of penetration and catastrophic failures, lower levels may lead to a reduced operating life if allowed over a sufficient time period. In the past, much effort has been invested in measuring and understanding vibration. The benefits of addressing this problem are obvious and include reduced drilling time and costs, reduced maintenance, and lower equipment turnover. Many of the previous attempts to isolate MWD tools from the drilling environment have resulted in marginal improvement. The development of the Isolation Sub began with our examination of the performance of a MWD tool that was already isolated from vibration. It was determined that improved shock and vibration isolation was needed to reduce frequent maintenance and prevent the less-frequent failure. For example, the first commercial MWD tool built by Teleco Oilfield Services was a suspended tool within a drill collar. Both the sensor and <b>transmitter</b> <b>assemblies</b> were suspended by individual elastomeric isolators, and motion was restricted by elastomeric elements called shock bumper...|$|R

40|$|A {{high data}} rate laser <b>transmitter</b> <b>assembly</b> (LTA) has been {{designed}} as the source for an optical free-space communication link between the International Space Station and the 1 -meter Optical Communication Telescope Laboratory (OCTL) to be built at the Table Mountain Facility (IMF, Wrightwood, CA). The transmitter design concept uses a fiber-based master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) configuration with an average output power of 200 made at a 1550 nm transmit wavelength. This transmitter source is also {{designed to provide a}} signal at 980 nm to the Silicon-based focal plane array for the point-ahead beam control function. This novel integration of a 980 nm boresight signal allows the use of Silicon based imagers for the acquisition/tracking and point-ahead functions, yet permits the transmit signal to be at any wavelength outside the Silicon sensitivity. The LTA, a sub-system of the Flight Terminal, has been designed to have a selectable data rate from 155 - 2500 Mbps in discrete steps.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{demonstration of}} free-space {{electric power transmission}} has been conducted using non-coherent laser diode arrays as the transmitter and standard silicon photovoltaic cell arrays as the receiver. The <b>transmitter</b> <b>assembly</b> used a high-power-density array of infrared laser diode bars, water cooled via integrated microchannel heat sinks and focused by cylindrical microlenses. The diode array composite beam was refocused by a parabolic mirror over a 10 meter path, and received on a {approximately} 15 x 25 cm panel of thinned single crystal high efficiency silicon solar cells. The maximum cell output obtained was several watts, and the cell output was used to drive a small motor. Due to operating constraints and unexpected effects, particularly the high nonuniformity of the output beam, both the distance and total received power in this demonstration were modest. However, the existing transmitter is capable of supplying several hundred watts of light output, with a projected received electric power in excess of 200 watts. The source radiance is approximately 5 x 10 {sup 9 } W/m{sup 2 }-steradian. With the existing 20 cm aperture, useful power transmission over ranges to {approximately} 100 meters should be achievable with a DC to DC efficiency of greater than 10 %. Non-coherent sources of this type are readily scalable to powers of tens of kilowatts, and with larger apertures can be used directly for power transmission up to several kilometers. Future non-coherent diode laser sources may be suitable for power transmission over hundreds of kilometers. Also, the experience gained with non-coherent arrays will be directly applicable to power beaming systems using coherent diode arrays or other array-type laser sources...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} design and testing of {{a model of the}} Synchronization and Video Conversion Unit (SVCU), a subsystem of the tracking radar (TR) at Denel Overberg Test Range (OTR). The SVCU synchronizes all the radar sub-systems and also converts the returned RF target signals to digital numbers. The technology within the SVCU is outdated and spares are scarce if not unattainable. This study forms {{the first phase of the}} development of a new SVCU and will determine the specifications of the hardware needed to build the replacement. Models of the transmit and receive chain of the radar were first developed in SystemVueTM. A comprehensive literature review was then done, yielding an accurate model of the current SVCU. The radar model was run, with simulated target and scene parameters, and its output fed into the SVCU model. The output of the SVCU was then processed by a CFAR detector and gated tracking algorithms implemented in MathLang and Python. The simulated target was correctly identified in the range-Doppler plane. The tracking gates (used to measure range and Doppler) were then corrupted with jitter, rise- time and offsets. A statistical analysis was done on the effect of these impurities on the radar measurements. A new SVCU architecture, utilizing high speed ADCs and digital integrators, was then tested. The effects of non-linearities (DNL and INL) in the ADC and phase noise on the ADC sample clock on the radar measurements were analysed. The jitter on the transmit sync (TX), the ADC sample clock and tracking gates were found to be the most critical aspects of the SVCU. To meet the specified measurement accuracy of the radar, the root-sum-square of the jitter on these syncs (jitter budget) must not exceed 30 nanoseconds. A case study was then done to determine the jitter budget achievable in an FPGA-centric SVCU design. The study concluded that a jitter budget of 30 ns is achievable. Moreover, in an FPGA based design the jitter introduced by the interface sending the TX sync from the FPGA (SVCU) to the <b>transmitter</b> <b>assembly</b> will, almost entirely, determine the range accuracy of the TR. From these findings, a new SVCU, based on the RHINO board from the UCT RRSG, was recommended and the future work outlined...|$|E
40|$|The ASCENDS CarbonHawk Experiment Simulator (ACES) is a newly {{developed}} lidar developed at NASA Langley Research Center {{and funded by}} NASA's Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) that seeks to advance technologies critical to measuring atmospheric column carbon dioxide (CO 2) mixing ratios {{in support of the}} NASA Active Sensing of CO 2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS) mission. The technology advancements targeted include: (1) increasing the power-aperture product to approach ASCENDS mission requirements by implementing multi-aperture telescopes and multiple co-aligned laser transmitters; (2) incorporating high-efficiency, high-power Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs); (3) developing and incorporating a high-bandwidth, low-noise HgCdTe detector and transimpedence amplifier (TIA) subsystem capable of long-duration autonomous operation on Global Hawk aircraft, and (4) advancing algorithms for cloud and aerosol discrimination. The ACES instrument architecture is being developed for operation on high-altitude aircraft and will be directly scalable to meet the ASCENDS mission requirements. These technologies are critical towards developing not only spaceborne instruments but also their airborne simulators, with lower platform requirements for size, mass, and power, and with improved instrument performance for the ASCENDS mission. ACES transmits five laser beams: three from commercial EDFAs operating near 1. 57 microns, and two from the Exelis oxygen (O 2) Raman fiber laser amplifier system operating near 1. 26 microns. The three EDFAs are capable of transmitting up to 10 watts average optical output power each and are seeded by compact, low noise, stable, narrow-linewidth laser sources stabilized with respect to a CO 2 absorption line using a multi-pass gas absorption cell. The Integrated-Path Differential Absorption (IPDA) lidar approach is used at both wavelengths to independently measure the CO 2 and O 2 column number densities and retrieve the average column CO 2 mixing ratio. The ACES receiver uses three fiber-coupled 17. 8 -cm diameter athermal telescopes. The <b>transmitter</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of five fiber-coupled laser collimators and an associated Risley prism pair for each laser to co-align the outgoing laser beams and to align them with the telescope field of view. The backscattered return signals collected by the three telescopes are combined in a fiber bundle and sent to a single low noise detector. The detector/TIA development has improved the existing detector subsystem by increasing its bandwidth to 4. 7 MHz from 500 kHz and increasing the duration of autonomous, service-free operation periods from 4 hours to > 24 hours. The new detector subsystem enables the utilization of higher laser modulation rates, which provides greater flexibility for implementing advanced thin-cloud discrimination algorithms as well as improving range-determination resolution and error reduction. The cloud/aerosol discrimination algorithm development by Langley and Exelis features a new suite of algorithms for the minimization/elimination of bias errors in the return signal induced by the presence of intervening thin clouds. Multiple laser modulation schemes are being tested in an effort to significantly mitigate the effects of thin clouds on the retrieved CO 2 column amounts. Full instrument development concluded in the spring of 2014. After ground range tests of the instrument, ACES successfully completed six test flights on the Langley Hu- 25 aircraft in July, 2014, and recorded data at multiple altitudes over land and ocean surfaces with and without intervening clouds. Preliminary results from these test flights will be presented in this paper...|$|E

The design, assembly and test of the flight Radio Frequency Electronics Subsystem (RFES) for this instrument has been completed and is presented here.
