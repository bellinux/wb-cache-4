5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} hydrogen chloride {{and the formation of}} <b>titanium</b> <b>oxides</b> and oxychlorides, as described above for the production of TiO2. Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive.|$|E
25|$|The 1,850-year-old Penokean {{magmatism}} in Wisconsin represents margin-type igneous activity terminated by collision. Some of the Penokean granites show {{iron enrichment}} {{similar to the}} magnetite series, rather than the low-oxygen concentration of the magnetic <b>titanium</b> <b>oxides.</b> Penokean-age rocks in the northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan contain areas of low-pressure, low- to high-temperature metamorphism.

500|$|Observations by the {{orbiting}} Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope initially {{limited the}} planet's albedo (or reflectivity) below 0.3, {{making it a}} surprisingly dark object. (The geometric albedo has since been measured to be 0.038 ± 0.045.) In comparison, Jupiter has a much higher albedo of 0.52. This would suggest that HD 209458 b's upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is Jupiter's, or else has no clouds and Rayleigh-scatters incoming radiation like Earth's dark ocean. Models since then have shown that between {{the top of its}} atmosphere and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. [...] This implies an outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud; usually thought to consist of vanadium and <b>titanium</b> <b>oxides</b> like red dwarfs ("pM planets"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The Rayleigh-scattering heated hydrogen rests {{at the top of the}} stratosphere; the absorptive portion of the cloud deck floats above it at 25 millibars.|$|E

The incorporation of the <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles increased the visible light absorption of the <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanotube based DSSC system because of the increased light absorption resulting from the increased surface area.

40|$|A {{new kind}} of one-dimension {{attapulgite}} (APG) @ <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles was prepared via kinetics-controlled coating method. By simply altering the ammonia content and reaction time to control the kinetics of hydrolysis and condensation of tetra-n-butyl titanate (TBOT) in ethanol/ammonia mixtures, amorphous <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles can adhere to the APG rods firmly, and the thickness of uniform amorphous <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> shells can be adjusted from 0 to 40 nm. The obtained APG@ <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanorods were applied as a new electrorheological (ER) fluid, which showed a promising ER activity. The yield stresses of the APG@ <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> nanorod (40 -nm shell thickness) ER fluid under electric field was 2. 1 times of the granular <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> ER fluid and 4. 1 times of the APG ER fluid.

Anatase nano <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> of about 20 nm in the diameter was obtained for 48 h with pH= 9 at 240 °C by the hydrothermal method.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of second-generation <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> photocatalysts which absorb UV-visible light and work as efficient photocatalysts under irradiation {{of light in the}} UV-visible light regions were successfuly carriedout by applying advancedmetal ion-implantation techniques. <b>Titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> catalysts were implanted with various transition-metal ions by a high-voltage acceleration technique, then calcined in O 2 at around 723 – 823 K to produce photocatalysts capable of absorbing visible light, the extent of such redshift depending on the kind and amount of metal ion implanted. The transition-metal ion implanted <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> photocatalysts, specifically using V, Mn, or Cr ions, were successful in carring out various photocatalytic reactions such as the decomposition of NOX and the reaction involving the decomposition of H 2 O at 295 K, significantly under irradiation with visible light longer than 450 nm. In outdoor field reactivity tests, these V or Cr ion-implanted <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> photocatalysts showed four to three times higher photocatalytic reactivity for those photocatalytic reactions under solar beam irradiation, as compared with the original unimplanted <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> photocatalyst.

The liquid-phase {{photocatalytic}} oxidation of l-octanol in oxygenated acetoniaile on highly dispersed <b>titanium</b> <b>oxide</b> catalysts anchored onto transparent Vycor {{glass was}} {{compared with that}} obtained on the standard TiO 2 powder.
