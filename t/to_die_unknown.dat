50|$|As the finds {{are slowly}} catalogued and removed Carter becomes close to Canarvon's {{daughter}} Evelyn but his strictness begins to alienate his team. Tutankhamun {{was married to}} his own sister but the union failed to produce an heir to secure {{the future of the}} kingdom. Stories of the curse begin to circulate as Carter breaks through into the burial chamber to reveal an intact tomb. As Lacau threatens to take over the excavation and several of the experts quit Canarvon questions Carter over his leadership and his relationship with Evelyn. When he came of age Tutankhamun took over control of the kingdom from his military advisor Ay only <b>to</b> <b>die</b> from <b>unknown</b> causes shortly thereafter. Carter rushes to Canarvon's death-bed where the two make-up. Upon Tutankhamun's death Ay seized the throne and married the widowed queen. Carter, disappointed by Evelyn's engagement to another man, returns to continue his work. Tutankhuman's death came before the royal tomb could be completed so he was hastily buried in the tomb Ay had prepared for himself. Lacau takes over the running of the tomb in 1924 when Carter and his team stop work to protest continued Egyptian interference.|$|R
50|$|He is {{believed}} <b>to</b> have <b>died</b> of <b>unknown</b> causes on 25 October 1400, {{but there is}} no firm evidence for this date, as it comes from the engraving on his tomb, erected more than one hundred years after his death. There is some speculation—most recently in Terry Jones book Who Murdered Chaucer? : A Medieval Mystery—that he was murdered by enemies of Richard II or even on the orders of his successor Henry IV, but the case is entirely circumstantial. Chaucer was buried in Westminster Abbey in London, as was his right owing to his status as a tenant of the Abbeys close. In 1556, his remains were transferred to a more ornate tomb, making Chaucer the first writer interred in the area now known as Poets Corner.|$|R
40|$|During animal development, {{the proper}} {{regulation}} of apoptosis requires the precise {{spatial and temporal}} execution of cell-death programs, which can include both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways 1, 2. While the mechanisms of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell killing have been examined extensively, how these pathways are coordinated within a single cell that is fated <b>to</b> <b>die</b> is <b>unknown.</b> Here we show that the C. elegans Sp 1 transcription factor SPTF- 3 specifies the programmed cell deaths {{of at least two}} cells, the sisters of the pharyngeal M 4 motor neuron and of the AQR sensory neuron, by transcriptionally activating both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic pathways. SPTF- 3 directly drives the transcription of the gene egl- 1, which encodes a BH 3 -only protein that promotes apoptosis through the activation of the CED- 3 caspase 3. In addition, SPTF- 3 directly drives the transcription of the AMPK-related gene pig- 1, which encodes a protein kinase and functions in apoptosis of the M 4 sister and AQR sister independently of the pathway that activates CED- 34, 5. Thus, a single transcription factor controls two distinct cell-killing programs that act in parallel to drive apoptosis. Our findings reveal a bivalent regulatory node for caspase-dependent and caspase...|$|R

6000|$|This {{dramatic}} conception has not, of course, been attained per saltum. Nor {{has it been}} {{borrowed from}} Nietzsche or from any man born beyond the Channel. The late Samuel Butler, in his own department the greatest English writer of {{the latter half of}} the XIX century, steadily inculcated the necessity and morality of a conscientious Laodiceanism in religion and of an earnest and constant sense of the importance of money. It drives one almost to despair of English literature when one sees so extraordinary a study of English life as Butler's posthumous Way of All Flesh making so little impression that when, some years later, I produce plays in which Butler's extraordinarily fresh, free and future-piercing suggestions have an obvious share, I am met with nothing but vague cacklings about Ibsen and Nietzsche, and am only too thankful that they are not about Alfred de Musset and Georges Sand. Really, the English do not deserve to have great men. They allowed Butler <b>to</b> <b>die</b> practically <b>unknown,</b> whilst I, a comparatively insignificant Irish journalist, was leading them by the nose into an advertisement of me which has made my own life a burden.
