5|$|Although Hancock won Georgia's {{popular vote}} easily, {{there was an}} {{irregularity}} in that state’s electoral votes. According to Article II, Section 1, clause 3 of the Constitution, “The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.” In 1792, Congress had set the date for the Electoral College {{to vote on the}} first Wednesday in December, which in 1880 fell on December 1. However, Georgia’s electors failed to cast their ballots on December 1, instead voting on the following Wednesday, December 8. Congress chose to count Georgia's vote in the official tally anyway; had <b>they</b> <b>not</b> done so, Hancock’s electoral vote would have been 144, not 155.|$|E
5|$|As title holders, Manchester City were {{entitled}} to defend the Cup Winners' Cup in the 1970–71 season. Had <b>they</b> <b>not</b> won the trophy, they would still have been qualified for European competition, as City's victory in the 1970 League Cup granted {{a place in the}} Fairs Cup. As a UEFA-organised competition, the Cup Winners' Cup took precedence over the Fairs Cup, and so the club took a place in the former. In the first round Manchester City almost suffered an upset at the hands of Linfield, from Belfast. City held a one-goal lead after the first leg, but Linfield twice took the lead in the second leg. The match finished 2–1 to Linfield, and Manchester City progressed on the away goals rule. Honvéd were the opposition in the second round. Manchester City won both legs, the score 3–0 on aggregate.|$|E

5|$|At this point, {{the entire}} Austrian force, {{including}} Klenau's column, withdrew into Ulm {{and its environs}} and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II, V, VI Corps, Ney's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard, numbering close to 80,000 men. Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia. Again, {{as he had been}} at Mantua, Klenau was caught in a siege from which there was no escape, and again, he helped to negotiate the terms, when, on 21 October, Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry.

5|$|Heading {{into the}} negotiations, {{there was still}} no {{resolution}} within the Kennedy Administration of the question of whether to pursue a comprehensive or partial ban. In an effort to achieve the former, Britain proposed reducing the number of mandated inspections to allay Soviet concerns, but Harriman believed such a reduction would have to be paired with other concessions that Khrushchev would be able to show off within the Soviet Union and to China. Withdrawing PGM-19 Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey would have been an option, had <b>they</b> <b>not</b> already been removed {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis. In meetings prior to the negotiations, Kennedy informed Harriman that he would be willing to make concessions on the Berlin question.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the {{operations}} room at RAF Uxbridge was disturbed by {{a visit from}} Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

However, at 10:30 the first German aircraft triggered the alarm at Chain Home radar station at Dover. The filter room at Stanmore recognised the formation as hostile.

5|$|On April 9, 2013, media {{reported}} that Apple Inc. had prohibited {{the sale of}} issue 12 of Saga through iOS, because two panels that depicted oral sex between men in a small, in-set image violated Apple's restrictions on sexual content. This resulted in criticism by artists and writers, who pointed to similarly explicit content in previous issues and in other works sold through iTunes. William Gibson and others suggested that the restriction could have occurred specifically because the drawings in question depicted gay sex. A day later, digital distributor Comixology announced {{that it had been}} <b>they,</b> <b>not</b> Apple, who had chosen not to make the issue available based on their interpretation of Apple's rules, and that after receiving clarification from Apple, the issue would now be sold via iOS.|$|E

If the less prominent portion of the Kepler-14 binary system had not been detected, Kepler-14b's mass would have been incorrect by nearly 60%, and its radius too small by about 10%.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere the Germans were attacking A, C and the French troops. CTroop had ambushed the Germans, {{moving forward}} to attack and then fought off a second attack. The {{attack on the}} French {{position}} {{was supported by a}} tank, which they only managed to knock out with a PIAT after it had got behind them. In both these attacks the commandos were involved in hand-to-hand combat to keep the Germans from overrunning their positions. From 11 June the German pressure on the commando line lessened. They were still subject to artillery and mortar fire but there were no more infantry attempts to dislodge them. In the days since landing No. 4 Commando had taken 50 percent casualties. Before the landings 1st Special Service brigade had been informed they would be withdrawn in a few days, after the Allies had broken out from the beachhead. Problems capturing Caen meant the commandos and airborne division had to remain to secure the left flank along the line of the Orne. They did not get relieved for 82 days, during which <b>they</b> <b>not</b> only held the left flank but on 18 August started their own break out. With No. 4 Commando leading the first village liberated was Bavent followed by Beaumont en Auge. Breuzville was entered over the night of 25/26 August and Boulleville the following day. Here they remained until 6 September when the brigade was withdrawn and sent back to Britain, for 14 days leave.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that <b>they</b> <b>not</b> be given routinely.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1, with only the {{shattered}} remnants of E Company at hand, the US 9th Infantry Regiment, US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Lawrence B. Keiser in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment. The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to Yongsan. The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around Yongsan on the northwest. Disorganized US forces were ordered to pull back to Yongsan. The road to Miryang came south out of Yongsan, bent around the western tip of this mountain, and then ran eastward along its southern base. In its position, <b>they</b> <b>not</b> only commanded the town but also its exit, the road to Miryang. North Koreans had also approached Yongsan from the south.
