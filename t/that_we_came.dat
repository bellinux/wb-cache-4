2500|$|The Congress of Soviets officially {{established}} the Soviet Union in December 1922. Sergey Kirov, {{speaking at the}} Congress, proposed building a congress palace [...] "on the sites of palaces once owned by bankers, landlords, and tsars". Very soon, Kirov said, existing halls would be too small to fit the delegates from new republics of the Union. The palace [...] "will be just another push for the European proletariat, still dormant...to realize <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> for good and forever, that the ideas... of communism are as deeply rooted here as the wells drilled by Baku oilers".|$|E

2500|$|According to Zajonc, the mere-exposure {{effect is}} capable of taking place without {{conscious}} cognition, and that [...] "preferences need no inferences". This statement by Zajonc has spurred much research {{in the relationship between}} cognition and affect. Zajonc explains that if preferences (or attitudes) were merely based upon information units with affect attached to them, then persuasion would be fairly simple. He argues {{that this is not the}} case: such simple persuasion tactics have failed miserably. Zajonc states that affective responses to stimuli happen much more quickly than cognitive responses, and that these responses are often made with much more confidence. He states that thought (cognition) and feeling (affect) are distinct, and that cognitions are not free from affect, nor is affect free of cognition. Zajonc states, [...] "...the form of experience <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to call feeling accompanies all cognitions, that it arises early in the process of registration and retrieval, albeit weakly and vaguely, and that it derives from a parallel, separate, and partly independent system in the organism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{ready to}} take the city on the morning of May 26th, a white flag {{appeared}} on the city walls at 10:00am. Gough sent interpreter Peter Perring Thoms, on secondment from British Plenipotentiary and Superintendent of Trade Charles Elliot, {{to find out what it}} meant. When a Mandarin explained that the Chinese wanted peace, Gough notes in his official report: [...] "I had it explained that, as General commanding the British, I would treat with none but the General commanding the Chinese troops, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> before Canton much against the wishes of the British nation, but that repeated insults and breaches of faith had compelled us to make the present movement, and that I would cease from hostilities for two hours to enable their General to meet me and Sir Le Fleming Senhouse." [...] When no general appeared, the next day British forces prepared once more for the attack on Canton. This time, a message arrived from Charles Elliot announcing that he had come to an agreement with the Governor-general of Canton, Yu Baochen (余葆纯) according to the following key points: ...|$|E
2500|$|On 2 May 1945, Hatsutaka was escorting {{a tanker}} when {{attacked}} by [...] and [...] [...] At 2249, Hatsutaka detected Baya with her Type 22 radar and began closing. 2305, Baya fired two torpedoes at Hatsutaka, with both missing. [...] At 2307, Hatsutaka {{opened fire on}} Baya with [...] "20mm, 40mm, and 2 or 3 4.7 inch guns at range of 1100 yards." [...] and noted at 2308 that [...] "Jap gunnery poor but plenty of it. Tracers passing down {{both sides of the}} periscope shears and overhead. 4.7 inch appeared to be both common and fused, as it was ricochetting alongside and over the stern as well as bursting overhead which was thought at first to be starshells." [...] At 2309, Baya fired another three torpedoes, with Hatsutaka combing the tracks. When Hatsutaka turned on the searchlight at 2320, Baya submerged and fired another torpedo at her, missing again. At 2325, when Baya surfaced, she secured the searchlight and again commenced firing on Baya and dropped six depth charges at 2329, shaking Baya violently. [...] At 2333, the range opened and Baya informed Lagarto that she had been driven off by the escort's gunfire. Baya noted that [...] "It is nothing short of a miracle <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> through so much gunfire without a single hit.

2500|$|Pyarelal of the Laxmikant-Pyarelal duo {{quoted in}} an {{interview}} that [...] "Rajesh Khanna was lucky for us and we were lucky for him too. From the 1969 Do Raaste to the 1986 Amrit, we gave hits together both as films and as music scores.... When we went on our first overseas concert tour in 1984, he came and danced to three songs. He was very particular about his music and would take a tape home if he could not assess a song. He would then give his feedback after a day or two. But if he liked a song at the sitting, he would loudly shout [...] "Wah! Wah!" [...] in appreciation…. It was God’s blessing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>came</b> up with such a vast range of hit songs for him, including in his home productions Roti and films like Chhailla Babu, Chakravyuha, Fiffty Fiffty, Amar Deep and Anurodh. Incidentally, he had a stake in Mehboob Ki Mehndi too. He had great interest in music and a terrific sense of melody too. His music is dominated by Pancham (R.D. Burman) and us and we accepted Shakti Samanta’s Anurodh only because Rajesh Khanna had some misunderstanding with Pancham then, {{and did not want to}} work with him." [...] Khanna would always request music directors to fit in Kishore Kumar wherever possible. In fact, Kishore was very reluctant to sing [...] "Waada Tera Waada" [...] in Dushman and suggested to Laxmikant-Pyarelal to get it sung by Rafi. Then Laxmikant made Kishore meet Rajesh Khanna and Khanna winked at Laxmikant and told Kishore that in that case the song should be scrapped. On hearing this, Kishore immediately agreed to sing it by himself for Khanna.|$|E
