5|$|To counter {{powerful}} neighbors {{such as the}} Kingdom of Dali (934–1253), the Song made {{alliances with}} tribal groups in southwest China which served as a protective buffer between <b>their</b> <b>borders</b> and Dali's. As long as these ethnic tribal groups paid tribute to the Song court and agreed to follow the course of its foreign policy, the Song agreed to grant military protection and allow the tribal leaders hereditary, autonomous local rule. During the 1050s, the Song put down local tribal insurrections along <b>their</b> <b>borders</b> with the Lý dynasty of Đại Việt, while their relations with Tai peoples and alliances with local clan leaders in the southern frontier led to a border war with Lý from 1075 to 1077.|$|E

5|$|The Commonwealth's magnates viewed reform with {{suspicion}} and neighboring powers, {{content with the}} deterioration of the Commonwealth, abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on <b>their</b> <b>borders.</b> With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directlythe Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 and the Prussian Army and Imperial Austrian Army had 200,000 each.|$|E
5|$|The Persians had {{the sympathy}} of several Greek city-states, {{including}} Argos, which had pledged to defect when the Persians reached <b>their</b> <b>borders.</b> The Aleuadae family, who ruled Larissa in Thessaly, saw the invasion {{as an opportunity}} to extend their power. Thebes, though not explicitly 'Medising', was suspected of being willing to aid the Persians once the invasion force arrived.|$|E

5|$|The state's 14 {{districts are}} {{distributed}} among six regions: North Malabar (far-north Kerala), South Malabar (northern Kerala), Kochi (central Kerala), Northern Travancore, Central Travancore (southern Kerala) and Southern Travancore (far-south Kerala). The districts which serve as administrative regions for taxation purposes are further subdivided into 75 taluks, which have fiscal and administrative powers over settlements within <b>their</b> <b>borders,</b> including maintenance of local land records. Kerala's taluks are further sub-divided into 1,453 revenue villages.|$|E
5|$|Current {{taxonomy}} recognises four subspecies: M. s. splendens in Western Australia, M. s. musgravei {{in central}} Australia (subspecies previously recognised as M. s. callainus), M. s. melanotus in inland eastern Australia and M. s. emmottorum in southwestern Queensland. Initially, {{the three were}} considered separate species as they were described far from <b>their</b> <b>borders</b> with other subspecies. However, as the interior of Australia was explored, it became apparent there were areas of hybridisation where subspecies overlapped. Thus in 1975, the first three forms below were reclassified as subspecies of Malurus splendens.|$|E
5|$|In Taylor's view, {{the best}} way forward was to admit California as a state rather than a federal territory, as it would leave the slavery {{question}} out of Congress's hands. The timing for statehood was in Taylor's favor, as the Gold Rush was well underway {{at the time of}} his inauguration, and California's population was exploding. The administration dispatched Rep. Thomas Butler King to California, to test the waters and advocate on behalf of statehood, knowing that the Californians were certain to adopt an anti-slavery constitution. King found that a constitutional convention was already underway, and by October 1849, the convention unanimously agreed to join the Union—and to ban slavery within <b>their</b> <b>borders.</b>|$|E

5|$|Soviet Russia, {{while at}} the time {{publicly}} supporting Polish and Lithuanian independence, sponsored communist agitators working against {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic, and considered that its eastern borders should approximate those of the defunct Congress Poland. Poles and Lithuanians, on the other hand, inspired by memories of the greatness of the erstwhile Grand Duchy of Lithuania, part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, saw <b>their</b> <b>borders</b> as lying much farther east. The leader of the Polish forces, Józef Piłsudski, discerned an opportunity for regaining territories that were once the part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and since then were part of the Prussian Empire, shaken by the 1917 Revolution and the ongoing Russian Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The Know Nothings' main {{political}} issue was nativism, but Daniels remained {{focused more on}} prohibition. In 1857, he promoted a law permitting the local option, which would let individual counties in the state chose whether to enact prohibition of alcohol within <b>their</b> <b>borders,</b> {{but it did not}} pass. That year he was elected to a four-year term in the Maryland Senate. He resigned part-way through his term, in 1858, to practice law in Baltimore. Two years later, he married Ellen Young Guiteau, daughter of a Congregational minister. By 1864, Daniel had joined the Republican Party. That year, he was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention, which produced the Maryland Constitution of 1864.|$|E
5|$|The New Kingdom pharaohs {{established}} {{a period of}} unprecedented prosperity by securing <b>their</b> <b>borders</b> and strengthening diplomatic ties with their neighbours, including the Mitanni Empire, Assyria, and Canaan. Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his grandson Tuthmosis III extended {{the influence of the}} pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen. Between their reigns, Hatshepsut generally promoted peace and restored trade routes lost during the Hyksos occupation, as well as expanding to new regions. When Tuthmosis III died in 1425BC, Egypt had an empire extending from Niya in north west Syria to the fourth waterfall of the Nile in Nubia, cementing loyalties and opening access to critical imports such as bronze and wood.|$|E

5|$|The Polish Army {{pushed back}} {{and came in}} contact with the Lithuanians in the contested Suwałki Region. The {{diplomatic}} negotiations broke down. The Lithuanians claimed to be defending <b>their</b> <b>borders,</b> while Poland did not recognize the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty and claimed that the Lithuanians had no rights to these territories. Poland also accused the Lithuanians of collaborating with the Soviets and thus violating the declared neutrality in the Polish–Soviet War. In the ensuing hostilities, the towns of Suwałki, Sejny, and Augustów changed hands frequently. The diplomatic struggle, both directly between the two states and in the League of Nations, intensified.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{force was}} superior, but faced severe {{logistical}} problems. Count Paskevich's army {{was too big}} to sustain on food confiscated from captured lands. It relied on provisions transported from Russia, either directly through Polish territory or theoretically neutral Prussia. The epidemic of cholera brought to Poland and East Prussia by Russian soldiers forced the Prussian authorities to close <b>their</b> <b>borders</b> to Russian transports. To avoid starving his army, Paskevich ordered two permanent bridges built across the Vistula, in Góra and Podgórze. Only the latter one had been completed {{by the start of}} the Russian assault of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{reforming}} the Commonwealth gained traction from the mid-17th century; it was however viewed with suspicion {{not only by}} its magnates but also by neighboring countries, which had been content with {{the deterioration of the}} Commonwealth and abhorred the thought of a resurgent and democratic power on <b>their</b> <b>borders.</b> With the Commonwealth Army reduced to around 16,000, it was easy for its neighbors to intervene directly (The Imperial Russian Army numbered 300,000 troops overall; The Prussian Army and Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire, 200,000 each).|$|E

5|$|The {{question}} of the New Mexico–Texas border was unsettled {{at the time of}} Taylor's inauguration. The territory newly won from Mexico was under federal jurisdiction, but the Texans claimed a swath of land north of Santa Fe and were determined to include it within <b>their</b> <b>borders,</b> despite having no significant presence there. Taylor sided with the New Mexicans' claim, initially pushing to keep it as a federal territory, but eventually supported statehood so as to further reduce the slavery debate in Congress. The Texas government, under newly instated governor P. Hansborough Bell, tried to ramp up military action in defense of the territory against the federal government, but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|These moves {{were met}} with some criticism, as the {{preserved}} counties were created to sustain a stable and continuing layout, irrespective of interim local government reviews affecting principal areas. This led to some areas, such as the Aberconwy district, moving to a preserved county {{it had never been}} administered by in the past, and therefore these moves went generally unreported due to the preserved county's limited status. The Boundary Commission proceeded to retain the eight preserved counties, and modified <b>their</b> <b>borders</b> in 2003 to match with the incumbent principal area boundaries. The 2003 arrangement brings towns such as Llandudno, Conwy and Betws-y-Coed into the preserved county of Clwyd.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the sixteen}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Maine. Before statehood, Maine was officially part of the state of Massachusetts and was called the District of Maine. Maine was granted statehood on March 15, 1820 as part of the Missouri Compromise. Nine of the sixteen counties had <b>their</b> <b>borders</b> defined while Maine was still part of Massachusetts, and hence are older than the state itself. Even after 1820, the exact location of the northern border of Maine was disputed with Britain, until the question was settled and the northern counties signed their final official form, the Webster-Ashburton Treaty, signed in 1842. Almost all of Aroostook County was disputed land until the treaty was signed.|$|E
