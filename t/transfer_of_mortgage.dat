40|$|We {{explore the}} capital {{structure}} and governance of a mortgage-insuring securitization utility operating with government reinsurance for systemic or 'tail' risk. The structure we propose for {{the replacement of}} the GSEs focuses on aligning incentives for appropriate pricing and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> risks across the private sector and between the private sector and the government. We present the justification and mechanics of a vintage-based capital structure, and assess the components of the mortgage guarantee fee, whose size we find is most sensitive to the required capital ratio and the expected return on that capital. We discuss the implications of selling off some of the utility's mortgage credit risk to the capital markets and how the informational value of such transactions may vary with the level of risk transfer. Finally, we explore how mutualization could address incentive misalignments arising out of securitization and government insurance, as well as how the governance structure for such a financial market utility could be designed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the politics of neoliberalism and financialization {{in the context of the}} UK mortgage market. The analysis addresses an often implied but conceptually and empirically neglected feature in the otherwise booming social sciences literature on financial markets and the global financial crisis: how political struggles shape economic space. It does this against the background of the construction of the UK mortgage market which, as opposed to its American counterpart, is still underresearched. The thesis addresses these shortcomings by engaging the theory of Ernesto Laclau and the associated logics approach of the Essex School of Political Discourse Theory. It provides a detailed genealogical analysis of the transformations in the mortgage market during the three decades leading up to the financial crisis emphasising the significance of hegemonic struggles and ideology in its constitution. Empirically, the thesis investigates the transformation of the mortgage market from a ‘sheltered circuit’ dominated by a building society price cartel in the 1970 s to a sphere that is increasingly driven by global financial markets. It is argued that at the heart of these transformations was the neo-liberalist deregulation in the name of the signifier ‘freedom’ which, in the neoliberalist age, became almost exclusively equated with ‘free markets’. The demutualisations of the 1990 s are presented as an outcome of neoliberalist deregulation leading to a fundamental shift of power in the market. In return for improved access to capital markets and powered by ideological discourses, the demutualisation of 10 societies resulted in a massive <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> assets to the stock market and contributed significantly to the financialization of mortgages. The struggles and resistance surrounding these events illustrate their contingent nature. However, the proposed re-mutualisation of Northern Rock had been squandered amidst a re-affirmation of neoliberalist ideology centring on the market as the best provider of mortgages...|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis [...] which arose in great measure from millions of bundled mortgage loans which randomly commingled arrays of toxic subprime mortgages with soundly underwritten “normal” loans and marketed securities derived from these bundles—led {{directly to the}} foreclosure epidemic we continue to face. The bursting of the derivatives bubble which spawned this epidemic has now revealed a major legal pitfall in mortgage foreclosure laws. A traditional legal rule forces the foreclosing lender to produce the original signed mortgage note {{to prove that it}} holds the legal right to foreclose or otherwise enforce remedies on the defaulted debt. This is the so-called “payment rule” of negotiable instruments law. But because of the bundling, securitization, and global remarketing of mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) the normal chain of current ownership of any particular mortgage debt is now often unable to be traced. However, if the modern mortgage industry is to survive—and many believe that its survival is an essential goal of society—while protecting the rights of all involved in mortgage enforcement cases, {{there needs to be a}} solution to this problem. This timely article demonstrates how the nation’s courts have struggled to put a bandage on the problem. In the course of that struggle our courts have given disparate, even self-contradictory treatment to the “payment rule. ” The Court of Appeals of North Carolina is one of many such courts, handing down two schizophrenic holdings regarding the “payment rule” within weeks of one another. This article examines these inconsistent holdings, their implications for mortgage enforcement law, and presents various proposed solutions. The article offers a new fair and balanced solution the problem, which meets the three essential goals: (1) public transparency in harmony with policy underlying nearly two centuries of states’ recording acts; (2) fairness to individual mortgage debtors; (3) promoting the certainty and efficiency of the financial industry’s ability to enforce borrowers’ obligations by foreclosure. Regarding the solutions available, some are fatally complex or politically impossible, but some are more readily at hand. This article spotlights how the adoption of the Uniform Commercial Code’s revised Section 3 - 602 could alleviate the problem but state legislatures may continue to balk at this step. In the years since 2002 only 10 state legislatures have adopted this sensible solution, illustrating the political problem. This otherwise sensible solution would likely be blocked by intense lobbying from the lending industry as it seeks to avoid notice and filing delays in bundling and transferring of MBS. Some national commentators propose removing mortgages from the realm of negotiable instruments law altogether, the two laws being mutually irrelevant. Although removing mortgages from the realm of negotiability has some minor impact on Holder in Due Course rules, it does not render them untransferrable. Such a change merely requires reasonable notice to the note debtor of each such transfer. This article concludes that instead of trying to motivate the Legislature to eliminate negotiability from all mortgage notes, the optimal solution is to encourage legislators to enact the revised U. C. C. Section 3 - 602, which would eliminate the double payment threat embodied in the payment rule Regardless of the political outcome—pro or con—of a UCC reform, state legislatures should take the minimal step of mandating that notice of <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> notes must be accomplished by mail to the borrower and recording of that notice in the land records of the county where the mortgage itself is recorded. In accord with the best national thinking on the matter, this will give the mortgage ownership status much needed transparency. Moreover, recording all such transfers would provide notice of the transfer and give much needed transparency to mortgage note ownership, thereby preventing the “lost in the MBS bundling” that has created our present crisis...|$|E

40|$|The {{mortgage}} foreclosure crisis raises legal questions {{as important as}} its economic impact. Questions that were straightforward and uncontroversial a generation ago today threaten the stability of a 13 trillion mortgage market: Who has standing to foreclose? If a foreclosure was done improperly, what is the effect? And what is the proper legal method for transferring mortgages? These questions implicate the clarity of title for property nationwide and pose a too-big-to-fail problem for the courts. The legal confusion stems from the existence of competing systems for establishing title to mortgages and transferring those rights. Historically, mortgage title was established and transferred through the 2 ̆ 2 public demonstration 2 ̆ 2 regimes of UCC Article 3 and land recordation systems. This arrangement worked satisfactorily when mortgages were rarely transferred. Mortgage finance, however, shifted to securitization, which involves repeated bulk <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>mortgages.</b> To facilitate securitization, deal architects developed alternative 2 ̆ 2 contracting 2 ̆ 2 regimes for mortgage title: UCC Article 9 and MERS, a private mortgage registry. These new regimes reduced the cost of securitization by dispensing with demonstrative formalities, but {{at the expense of}} reduced clarity of title, which raised the costs <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> enforcement. This trade-off benefitted the securitization industry at the expense of securitization investors because it became apparent only subsequently with the rise in {{mortgage foreclosure}}s. The harm, however, has not been limited to securitization investors. Clouded mortgage title has significant negative externalities on the economy as a whole. This Article proposes reconciling the competing title systems through an integrated system of note registration and mortgage recordation, with compliance as a prerequisite to foreclosure. Such a system would resolve questions about standing, remove the potential cloud to real-estate title, and facilitate mortgage financing by clarifying property rights...|$|R

40|$|This article reviews what we {{know about}} {{transferring}} ownership and the right of enforcement of nonnegotiable notes. The focus will be on notes secured by mortgages, since this is likely the context in which most modern nonnegotiable notes are created. There has been a vast amount of litigation about the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> negotiable <b>mortgage</b> notes in the past half decade, greatly expanding our understanding, but there has been little development involving nonnegotiable notes. Hence, it is helpful to compare negotiable and nonnegotiable notes, with particular emphasis on how each is transferred.

We should learn from the sub-prime debt crisis in the United States to enhance supervision in the credit derivatives market, we should research thoroughly the pricing theory of credit derivatives under conditions of incomplete information to achieve optimal pricing, and we should build a more effective model to better resemble the real financial market.|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in 2007 the {{mortgage}} industry nearly collapsed. Large numbers of lenders {{went out of}} business and the rest were forced to eliminate all of the loan programs that were most prone to foreclosure. [...] These foreclosures were mostly caused by the packaging and selling of subprime and other risky <b>mortgages.</b> The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> ownership from <b>mortgage</b> lender to third party investor proved to be disastrous. Lenders wrote risky loans and sold them without being directly affected by the borrowers inability to pay. This practice prompted mortgage lenders to lower the requirements <b>of</b> <b>mortgage</b> approval to the lowest levels in history. Lenders sold pools <b>of</b> these <b>mortgage</b> loans to investment firms who packaged and resold them in the market in the form of bond issues. The investment firms weren't naive to the quality <b>of</b> the <b>mortgages,</b> so they purchased credit default swaps (a type of insurance product without technically being insurance)for protection of inevitable default. In fact, credit default swaps were created during this time and didn't exist prior to the housing boom. This resulted in millions of unqualified people obtaining mortgages. Another major factor of [...] "mortgage meltdown" [...] was caused by the Bond Rating Agencies. The agencies rated subprime mortgage pools as [...] "investment grade" [...] which opened up an almost unlimited supply of large investors (mutual funds, pension funds and even countries)to purchase these bond issues (The investment grade rating duped money managers into thinking the bonds were less risky then they actually were). When homeowners began to default on their mortgage payments the bonds were proven to be too risky for investment. This led investment companies to cease purchasing newly originated mortgage pools. In addition, investment firms came to see that the credit default swaps weren't true protection and were essentially worthless. The lenders could no longer sell off the newly originated mortgages. This halted the regeneration of capital necessary for these mortgage banks to lend money. In fact, well over 200 mortgage banks were either forced to close or went bankrupt. This crisis was dubbed the [...] "Credit Crunch" [...] and the subprime mortgage crisis.|$|R
