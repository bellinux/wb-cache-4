25|$|Crickets are {{a common}} subject of children's books on nature and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large {{transparent}} jar or a small <b>terrarium</b> {{with at least two}} inches of damp soil on the bottom. There must be plenty of shelter where the crickets can hide; children's books and industrial breeders recommend egg-crate shells. The top of the <b>terrarium</b> must be tightly covered with a lid or nylon mesh.|$|E
50|$|Modernisation {{began in}} 2002 through to 2013, all <b>terrariums</b> were {{replaced}} by biotope <b>terrariums.</b> Biotope <b>terrariums</b> are replicas of the primary animals' natural habitat, including plants, fish and animals. Tropicarium Kolmarden now has over 20 biotope <b>terrariums</b> containing a large variety of reptiles, amphibians and mammals.|$|R
50|$|The Verein der Aquarien- und Terrarienfreunde e.V. (Friends‘ {{association}} of aquariums and <b>terrariums)</b> converted a former horse barn to house 3 <b>terrariums</b> and 12 pools. The pools range in volume from 500 liters (132 US gallons) to 3000 liters (792 US gallons), {{and they are}} divided into 5 salt water and 7 fresh water pools. This section of the park is also dependent on donations to exist, because entry is free.|$|R

25|$|A.gravesii was {{produced}} by artificial hybridization in 1954–1955 by Thomas Darling, Jr., who provided {{a detailed account of}} the process. Spores of the two parental species were sown on damp peat moss and kept largely in the shade, except for a few hours of morning sun. Gametophytes developed, and the young sporophytes that grew from them were large enough to remove in autumn. They were transplanted into a well-drained, gravelly loam. They were raised in a humid <b>terrarium</b> exposed to morning sunlight, with a layer of tissue to shade them from direct sunlight. Of the A.gravesii in the mixed population, one reached maturity in August 1955; two others did not mature until June 1956. Difficulties were encountered due to aphid infestation and various diseases promoted by excess moisture.|$|E
25|$|Highland {{forms are}} those species that grow in {{habitats}} generally higher in elevation, and thus exposed to cooler evening temperatures. Lowland forms are those species growing nearer to sea level. Both forms respond best to rainwater (but some tap water works {{as long as}} it is flushed monthly with rainwater or water low in dissolved solid and chemicals), bright light (though some species can grow in full sun), a well-drained medium, good air circulation and relatively high humidity, although easier species such as N.alata can adapt to lower humidity environments. Highland species must have night-time cooling to thrive in the long term. Chemical fertilisers are best used at low strength. Occasional feeding with frozen (thawed before use) crickets may be beneficial. <b>Terrarium</b> culture of smaller plants, such as N.bellii, N.×trichocarpa and N.ampullaria, is possible, but most plants will get too large over time.|$|E

25|$|The {{first such}} game created {{in this fashion}} is Escape Goat 2, the sequel to Escape Goat, by MagicalTimeBean. This {{included}} a humorous video introducing both the game and Double Fine's program, which was filmed {{during the week of}} the 2014 Game Developers Conference in March 2014. For the second title, Last Life by Rocket Science Amusements, Double Fine helped to prepare and present a Kickstarter campaign to help funding the final development of the title. The third title announced under this program was Mountain by David OReilly, a procedural <b>terrarium</b> that provides an ambient, minimalist, zen-like experience full of secrets and mysteries. In August 2014, Double Fine announced that a fourth game would be released under the program, the multiplayer beat 'em up Gang Beasts by Boneloaf, which launched into Steam Early Access on August 29, 2014. The latest addition to the Double Fine Presents program is GNOG by KO_OP, a puzzle adventure to be released in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{beginning}} of Elephant Odyssey is the Fossil Portal, an artificial tar pit that periodically drains to reveal man-made Pleistocene-era bones. The path turns {{a corner and}} opens up at the Mammoth Passage Plaza, with exhibits for jaguars and African lions to the left, an exhibit that has housed two-toed sloths to the right, and {{the tip of the}} elephant exhibit, with a large wading pool, straight ahead. The path continues to the left along the pool, passing by the jaguar exhibit on the left. The northern end of the elephant pool drains into the Mixed Species Exhibit, which houses tapirs, capybaras, and guanacos. The path meets up with the elephant exhibit again before it reaches the Elephant Care Center, where visitors can watch keepers care for the animals. Next is an exhibit for secretarybirds with grasses, a tree and a statue of the extinct Daggett's eagle nearby. Afterwards, the path goes down a crevasse with a wall embedded with vivaria for dung beetles and diving beetles, among other aquatic insects. The path tunnels below the elephant exhibit to reach the other side, where it continues between the elephant exhibit and a creek for native reptiles and amphibians. Just past the source of the stream is a restaurant and gift shop, and after that is a couple of exhibits for pronghorns, horses, and camels. Next the path splits between a playground, a rattlesnake <b>terrarium,</b> and a California condor aviary with artificial rock spires and a stream. The paths then reunite and join the rest of the zoo.|$|E

500|$|An {{earlier version}} of [...] "Full on Idle", Title TKs eighth track, was {{released}} on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal {{expressed an interest in}} redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of [...] "Full on Idle" [...] sound almost the same, but The Village Voices Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardians Betty Clarke cited the line [...] "Obey your colorist, bleach it all away" [...] as an example of Title TKs amusing, off-center lyrics. On [...] "Sinister Foxx", Deal repeatedly sings [...] "Has anyone seen the iguana?" [...] She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: [...] "Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty <b>terrarium</b> ... Every time I go to a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana." [...] Another line, [...] "I'm in beer class every Thursday night", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a [...] "sexy menace", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time, Khan also {{made use of}} illusory camera tricks. For example, the opening scene of Ishaan {{collecting}} fish outside his school was shot on location and at Film City. Shots focusing on Ishaan {{took place at the}} former, while those involving the gutter <b>terrarium</b> were filmed at a water tank at the latter. The tank's water often became murky because the mud would rise to the top, forcing production to constantly empty and refill it. Due to this hindrance, the scene took eight hours to film. The film's next sequence involved Ishaan playing with two dogs. To compensate for the [...] "absolutely petrified" [...] Safary, most joint shots used a body double, though other portions integrated close-up shots of the actor. Ishaan's nightmare—he becomes separated from his mother at a train station and she departs on a train while he is trapped in a crowd—was filmed in Mumbai on a permanent railway-station set. To work around the train set piece's immobility, production placed the camera on a moving trolley to create the illusion of a departing train. For the sequences related from the mother's point of view—shot from behind the actress—Chopra stood on a trolley next to a recreated section of the train's door.|$|E

2500|$|Brachypelma {{species are}} docile tarantulas which {{are easy to}} keep in a <b>terrarium.</b> [...] The best-known species in this genus are the Mexican red knee tarantulas B.hamorii and B.smithi, curly hair B.albopilosum, and the Mexican red rump B.vagans. They feed on smaller {{invertebrates}} and occasionally vertebrates, but while insects are the norm, they may also eat lizards or frogs. These species, like most tarantulas, are cannibalistic, so in captivity, individuals must be kept singly, though brief captive introductions of a mate for breeding purposes can prove unproblematic, {{so long as they}} are separated once mating has occurred.|$|E
