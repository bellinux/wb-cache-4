Zhang Heng was also the first <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock (which gradually slowed the timekeeping) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel.|$|E

5|$|In Roman Egypt {{during the}} 2nd century CE, Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars {{had shown that}} the planet appeared to move 40% faster {{on one side of}} its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a point offset {{from the center of the}} planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform rate of rotation. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars. Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection Almagest, which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.|$|E
