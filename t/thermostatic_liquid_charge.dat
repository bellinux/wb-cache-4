While, American soldiers have recently developed better methods and protocols for detecting these devices before they can detonate, they often still pose as a significant risk to the bomb squads that are tasked with neutralizing them. In response to this, experts are now looking at using shaped charges to drive jets of incompressible fluids, like water, into IEDs in order {{to break up the}} components of the bomb without initiating a dangerous secondary explosion. My objective was and, as this project will continue into next year, is to discover what types of <b>liquid</b> shaped <b>charges</b> will produce the longest, best-penetrating jet for breaking up shielded IEDs (i. e.

Taking advantage of the great disparity between the dielectric constants of liquids and gases, capacitance sensors are used for void fraction measurements. Since it is difficult to control the phase content of a liquid-gas mixture in a micro heat pipe, a calibration technique based on a traveling water-air interface due to evaporation is introduced. The integrated sensor capacitance for pure water is found to depend on measurement frequency, temperature and ion concentration, exhibiting trends that are different front previous reports. The measured temperature and void fraction distribution along the heat pipes are consistent with the two-phase flow patterns recorded during the microsystem operation...|$|R

However, the vaporisation-compression-type refrigerating machines cause heavy pollution to the environment (gap of ozone layer problem), there-fore the interest in the cold air refrigerating machines has been greatly aroused lately. In the paper, the operation, theory and application possibilities of the cold air refrigerating machines are dealt with, especially considering the air- conditioning of motor vehicles.

30|$|The test {{facility}} consisted of mixer-viscometer, a gas addition system, a cooling system, a <b>liquid</b> <b>charge</b> system, cleaning solvent charge systems, and a data acquisition system. The gas charging system {{consisted of a}} pressurized gas bottle (usually 1800 psi), a pressure regulator, gas cooling bath and a mass flow meter. Operating pressure was preset using the pressure regulator. The gas through the preset pressure regulator was routed through an ice bath to cool it before it was metered. A Porter series 200 mass flowmeter was used to meter the flow rate and total volume of gas added to the vessel. The <b>liquid</b> <b>charging</b> system consisted of a simple funnel through which liquids {{were added to the}} vessel. The <b>liquid</b> <b>charge</b> could also be done using the cleaning system especially if it was desired to add liquid when the vessel was already pressurized. The cleaning and venting system consisted of a pump, bottom valve, drain trough and a vent. The pump could be used to draw liquid from the selected tank and send it to the vessel. The liquid could be a reactant or just cleaning solvent. The bottom valve was used to let in liquids into the vessel or drain from it. The drain trough was used to collect wastes after the experiments. The cooling system consisted of a chiller, the gas temperature control bath and a cooling jacket. The chiller was used to heat, cool or maintain temperature of the vessel contents. The gas temperature bath was intended to pre-cool the gas on hot days when the ambient temperatures were extremely high. The cooling jacket was the main heat exchange point between the chiller and the vessel contents. The shaft magnetic coupling was cooled to prevent heating due to friction. The mixing system consisted of a motor drive, torque sensor, and impeller. The vessel was 3.25 ″ internal diameter, 10 ″ height and rated for a maximum working pressure of 3000 psi. It was equipped with gas inlet and outlet valves, a sampling/drain valve at the bottom, pressure gage, safety/relief valve, and internal thermocouple. A ¼ HP variable speed motor was used to rotate the mixing shaft from 0 to 1900  rpm. A rotary shaft non-contact torque sensor model 01424 was used to measure torque directly from the shaft. A helical-blade impeller with two ¼ pitch blades was used for mixing vessel contents. The helical blades impeller was found to be more sensitive to viscosity change and hydrate formation during the trial tests. It also reduces the formation of a vortex during mixing. The process control and data acquisition system was developed using Factory Talk integrated suite software from Rockwell Automation. The recorded variables were shaft rotational speed, torque on shaft, chiller temperature, gas bath temperature, vessel temperature, vessel pressure, gas injection rate and totalized gas volume.

Thus the backflow and background contributions to S(k, co) of the liquid and solid phases of 4 He, and also that to S(k) of liquid 3 He and of liquid 4 He, are expected to be similar, which is consistent with existing data.

Ethanol fuel is widely used by flex-fuel light vehicles in Brazil and as oxygenate to gasoline in the United States. Ethanol can be blended with gasoline in varying quantities up to pure ethanol (E 100), and most modern gasoline engines well operate with mixtures of 10 % ethanol (E 10). E 100 consumption in an engine is higher than for gasoline since the energy per unit volume of ethanol is lower than for gasoline.

The application areas range from titanium parts elaboration for the aeronautic industry or the medical prosthesis to the silicon purification for photovoltaic industry. But even if this elaboration tool is used since a long time its main disadvantage is linked to its low energetic efficiency. Thanks to the progresses made in the recent years by the modeling tools, especially in 3 D multiphysics like the finite elements solver Comsol which is used here, it is now possible to much better understand the phenomena involved in these cold crucible configurations and hence to optimize them in a next future.
