25|$|Nucleotide binding is {{required}} to ensure the electrostatic and/or structural integrity of the active site {{and contribute to the}} formation of an active NBD dimer. Binding of ATP is stabilized by the following interactions: (1) ring-stacking interaction of a conserved aromatic residue preceding the Walker A motif and the adenosine ring of ATP, (2) hydrogen-bonds between a conserved lysine residue in the Walker A motif and the oxygen atoms of the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP and coordination of these phosphates and some residues in the Walker A motif with Mg2+ ion, and (3) γ-phosphate coordination with side chain of serine and backbone amide groups of glycine residues in the LSGGQ motif. In addition, a residue that suggests the <b>tight</b> <b>coupling</b> of ATP binding and dimerization, is the conserved histidine in the H-loop. This histidine contacts residues across the dimer interface in the Walker A motif and the D loop, a conserved sequence following the Walker B motif.|$|E

500|$|The branch-line coupler {{consists}} of two parallel transmission lines physically coupled together with two or more branch lines between them.

[...] High impedance lines have narrow tracks and this usually limits the design to three sections in planar formats due to manufacturing limitations.

40|$|The mRNA {{encoding}} repressor cI of phage lambda is {{the only}} known E. coli message which starts directly with the initiation AUG codon. The ability of in vitro synthesized cI mRNA fragments (150 or 400 nts) to form ternary initiation complexes has been studied using the toeprint method. In the presence of tRNA(Met) f, these fragments are capable of forming the ternary complexes at the 5 '-terminal AUG codon not only with 30 S subunits but also with undissociated 70 S ribosomes (70 S <b>tight</b> <b>couples).</b> In the latter case, no binding at other positions of cI mRNA can be detected at all. The starting region of cI mRNA has a single stranded conformation and is highly enriched in A-residues. This feature of cI mRNA RBS is suggested {{to be the main}} factor which allows cI mRNA to form the initiation complex with the ribosome. Unlike 30 S subunits, the binding to 70 S <b>tight</b> <b>couples</b> is not affected by any of the initiation factors, although it is as efficient as that to 30 S subunits supplemented with the factors. 30 S subunits prefer to associate with the internal RBSs of the preformed mRNA molecules, provided that they are not sequestered by the secondary structure. In contrast, 70 S <b>tight</b> <b>couples</b> tend to avoid extra sequences upstream of the codon directed to the P site and occupy a position {{as close as possible to}} the 5 '-end of the message. This has been found to be the case both for tRNA(Met) f and for elongator tRNA(Glu) 2. The structural features of mRNA RBSs which influence their different binding for 30 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRibosomal {{proteins}} {{participating in}} intersubunit RNA-protein contacts (directly interacting with RNA {{of the opposite}} subunit) were determined by means of ultraviolet-induced cross-links in pre- and post-translocated ribosomal complexes, {{as well as in}} the free 70 S ribosome (<b>tight</b> <b>couple)</b> of E. coli. In these 3 complexes at least LI and L 9 proteins interact with 16 S RNA, while S 6, S 9 / 11 and S 15 react with 23 S RNA. All these proteins (‘hinge-joint’ proteins) are clustered on the small protuberance of the 50 S subunit and on the platform of the 30 S subunit. Reduction in the number of other (variable) intersubunit RNA-protein contacts in the course of transition from the <b>tight</b> <b>couple</b> to the pre- and, finally, to the post-translocated state, demonstrates gradual loosening of intersubunit interactions in 70 S ribosome. Such a loosening (‘opening’) of the 70 S ribosome is determined by conformational changes in ribosomal subunits and/or in their relative arrangement, conjugated with alteration of the functional state of the ribosomal complex.

2500|$|Another {{clinical}} {{case that}} would a priori suggest a module for modularity in visual processing is visual agnosia. The well studied patient DF {{is unable to}} recognize or discriminate objects owing to damage {{in areas of the}} lateral occipital cortex although she can see scenes without problem – she can literally see the forest but not the trees. Neuroimaging of intact individuals reveals strong occipito-temporal activation during object presentation and greater activation still for object recognition. Of course, such activation could be due to other processes, such as visual attention. However, other evidence that shows a <b>tight</b> <b>coupling</b> of perceptual and physiological changes suggests activation in this area does underpin object recognition. Within these regions are more specialized areas for face or fine grained analysis, place perception and human body perception. Perhaps some of the strongest evidence for the modular nature of these processing systems is the double dissociation between object- and face (prosop-) agnosia. However, as with color and motion, early areas (see [...] for a comprehensive review) are implicated too, lending support {{to the idea of a}} multistage stream terminating in the inferotemporal cortex rather than an isolated module.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—While {{heterogeneous}} CPU/GPU {{systems have}} been traditionally implemented on separate chips, each with their own private DRAM, heterogeneous processors are integrating these different core types on the same die with access to a common physical memory. Further, emerging heterogeneous CPU-GPU processors promise to offer <b>tighter</b> <b>coupling</b> between core types via a unified virtual address space and cache coherence. To adequately address the potential opportunities and pitfalls that may arise from this <b>tighter</b> <b>coupling,</b> {{it is important to}} have a deep understanding of application- and memory-level demands from both CPU and GPU cores. This paper presents a detailed comparison of memory access behavior for parallel applications executing on each core type in tightly-controlled heterogeneous CPU-GPU processor simulation. This characterization indicates that applications are typically designed with similar algorithmic structures for CPU and GPU cores, and each core type’s memory access path has a similar locality filtering role. However, the different core and cache microarchitectures expose substantially different memory-level parallelism (MLP), which results in differ-ent instantaneous memory access rates and sensitivity to memory hierarchy architecture.

To this end, we collected functional MRI data from 43 children and young adults while they attempted to retrieve or suppress retrieval of previously learned associations. Seed-based functional connectivity analyses revealed a largely right-lateralized dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-cingulate-parietal-hippocampal network that exhibited strongly correlated activity during retrieval suppression.

40|$|Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a {{pervasive}} neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by 3 clusters of age-inappropriate cardinal symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. These clinical/behavioural symptoms {{are assumed to}} result from disturbances within brain systems supporting executive functions including working memory (WM), which refers {{to the ability to}} transiently store and flexibly manipulate task-relevant information.

In the present study, we recorded WM-related cerebral activity during a memory updating N-back task using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in control children and never medicated, prepubescent children with ADHD but without comorbid symptoms. Despite similar updating performance than controls, children with ADHD exhibited decreased, below baseline WM-related activation levels in a widespread cortico-subcortical network encompassing bilateral occipital and inferior parietal areas, caudate nucleus, cerebellum and functionally connected brainstem nuclei.
