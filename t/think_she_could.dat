25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she got hurt or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E
500|$|Natasha starts dating Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) and she {{believes}} that they are perfect for each other. Novakovic said that they [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and added [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find a guy that would tolerate her like Andrew does. She thinks he's the only guy she could possibly be with." [...] Natasha thinks that school and studying is not cool and is happy that Andrew feels the same, until Summer Hoyland joins their class and Andrew becomes interested in his studies. Natasha fears that she could lose her control over Andrew. Summer later asks Natasha {{if there is anything}} else, other than the physical aspect, to her relationship with Andrew. Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her stop and think about what she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship to have to be about communicating and understanding each other. Andrew does not take the new direction of the relationship well. Novakovic said that Natasha believes the relationship between her neighbours, Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), is something to be inspired by. She added [...] "That's what she wants to look forward to, but she's getting way ahead of herself. Andrew likes her but he isn't as serious as she is." [...] Novakovic opined that Andrew and Natasha [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and that Natasha's relationship with Andrew had been one of her favourite storylines.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2013, Womack {{said that}} she would not rule out a return to EastEnders, and even though Maslen was due to leave, she said Ronnie would still have reasons to return with Roxy still being there. She said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go back if Jack wasn't there, because it was always the Mitchell sisters. I know Ronnie had a love affair and she got married, but what I loved about the {{character}} was her relationship with her sibling. It was nice being with another woman and doing most of our scenes together. That was a relationship on the show I really enjoyed. There are no plans [...] at the moment but I definitely wouldn't rule it out. I love the show and I love the character. I miss the character enormously." [...] On 17 May 2013, show bosses announced that Womack would return to EastEnders as Ronnie for six months. It was said that Ronnie's return will form a major part of summer and autumn storylines. Speaking of her comeback, Womack said: [...] "I am thrilled to be returning to the role of Ronnie for the next six months. Ronnie is coming out of prison and her reappearance in [...] Square is going to create havoc. I can't wait to be a Mitchell once again!" [...] EastEnders executive producer Lorraine Newman added: [...] "We're delighted to announce Samantha Womack's return to Albert Square. The Mitchell sisters are a fabulous pairing and it will be an absolute delight to have Ronnie and Roxy back together on screen. However, Ronnie's departure wasn't without controversy for many residents in Walford, and her return will be sure to ruffle quite a few feathers." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 4. The {{therapist}} {{asks the}} client about what <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do to counteract those crossed relations, {{in order to}} improve communication relationships with those people, and makes suggestions to her, if she has no ideas.|$|R
50|$|In Wonder Woman #600, Atlee appears {{alongside}} fellow teen heroines Batgirl and Supergirl {{as part of}} an all-female team {{designed to}} repel a faux-alien invasion. After the battle is over, Atlee proclaims that <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> take Wonder Woman in a fight, a notion that Stargirl scoffs at.|$|R
60|$|Lady Lillycraft now {{and then}} {{complains}} of it, in great confidence, to her friends, but hushes up the subject immediately, if Mrs. Hannah makes her appearance. Indeed, she has been so accustomed to be attended by her, that <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not do without her; though one great study of her life, is to keep Mrs. Hannah in good-humour, by little presents and kindnesses.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I go {{away from}} here an' leave Wildfire for Lucy--do you <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> keep him? Wouldn't Bostil take him from her?" ...|$|E

50|$|House {{eventually}} realizes Charlotte feigned her illness, {{but then}} her liver fails. Thirteen does an MRI on her, but her spleen ruptures {{in the middle}} of it. House <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, so Thirteen and Taub run her AAT proteins. Foreman takes time off. Her proteins come back normal. She then tries to commit suicide by taking a whole bunch of drugs so that Eddie can have her heart.|$|R
50|$|Natalia accepts Frank's proposal. The wedding occurs shortly thereafter. Prior to the wedding, at Gus' graveside, a visibly distraught Olivia {{is forced}} by Natalia {{to tell her}} why Olivia is so upset. Olivia screams through her sobs that she {{is in love with}} Natalia. Despite an emotionally {{intimate}} moment after Olivia's declaration of love, Olivia convinces Natalia that marrying Frank is best because Natalia deserves a better life than Olivia <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> provide her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only {{ring the}} water out of her clothes," [...] whispered Mrs Hayward to her husband, [...] "it might do her some good, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems to be. She's kind of demanding. She {{wanted a}} little car of her own, but I didn't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{keep up with}} me, not on a long hike." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{she knew}} so well--she was so superior; and with Alick and her uncle {{to keep her}} above them," [...] said Rachel; [...] "I cannot <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have done such things." ...|$|E
60|$|Rilla sat looking {{blankly at}} the baby. It was absurd to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{take care of}} it. But--that poor little, frail, dead mother who had worried about it--that dreadful old Meg Conover.|$|E
60|$|If Miss Mackenzie could thereby have {{provided}} {{for all the}} negro soldiers' orphans in existence, I do not <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> at that moment have solicited {{him to make a}} purchase.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} {{pleasant}} to <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go away whenever she pleased {{and leave her}} house {{in the care of}} two such ladies as Miss Eleanor Thorpedyke and her sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "So Bessie told me," [...] said Fanny, {{still feeling}} {{that she had been}} taken in and the brother unkindly used; [...] "but I can't <b>think</b> how <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> when you don't like it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing base, Aunt Janet. My father's {{daughter}} would not willingly be base. I do not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> Moreover, had I ever done anything base I {{should not be}} here, for--for--I {{should never have been}} Rupert's wife!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> get in if she tried. The really disreputable {{people in}} Society are so exclusive. I wonder, Julien, if I shall {{be allowed to}} come out and dine with you when I am Madame Christophor's secretary?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucy Calvert is, no doubt, a {{good deal}} more anxious than I am that he should escape, and it would be only natural if you wished to earn her thanks. I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> be very nice, and her eyes are wonderfully blue." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{could not}} be Mr. Fotheringham, the only poet <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>think</b> of, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only beg to be told.|$|R
6000|$|Rose saw {{his purpose}} to the uttermost line. He had built this {{to keep her}} at home. How little he knew her now, to <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> marry and bring her husband home to this place! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I must, Frank, for one moment, {{to justify}} myself. I {{could not have}} excused myself in letting Mary <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> become your wife if I had not hoped that good might come of it." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{made the}} little bride quite sad to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{do nothing to}} show her love for the old man's heart. She used {{to think about it}} as she sat all alone during the long days, for her husband was almost always out.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Outhouse did {{attempt to}} show {{him that it was}} his fault; but while she was doing so he left the house. [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go back to him," [...] said Mrs. Outhouse to her husband. [...] "He is quite insane upon this matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, I don't {{think she}} does. If {{she had done}} so, I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have been so cool and {{collected}} all at once. I am sure I couldn't if I had been in her place. She met him just as she might have met any intimate acquaintance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they always}} remain veiled," [...] stammered Alan, {{though he was}} not {{referring}} to their faces, and as the words passed his lips he wondered what the Asika would <b>think</b> if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see a ballet at a London music-hall.|$|R
60|$|To speak by the card, I {{want these}} things to hurry to Italy to an English lady. She is a {{neighbor}} of mine outside of Florence, and has a great garden and <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> raise corn for her table if she had the right ammunition. I myself feel a warm interest in this enterprise, both on patriotic grounds and because I have a key to that garden, which I got made from a wax impression. It is not very good soil, still I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> can grow enough for one table and I am {{in a position to}} select the table. If you are willing to aid and abet a countryman (and Gilder thinks you are,) please find the signature and address of your petitioner below.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, mother, {{she would}} not make me happy. I was mad enough {{for a moment to}} <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do so--for a moment I did think so. There was one {{occasion}} on which I would have asked her to take me, but--" ...|$|R
60|$|I fancy it {{was hard}} enough even then. The Story Girl did not care a whit, but Cecily rather squirmed under the curious glances that were cast at her. She {{afterwards}} {{told me that she}} really did not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have endured it if she had been alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{a shadow}} of doubt," [...] said Phineas. [...] "I will not say that Mr. Kennedy is mad; but the {{condition}} of his mind is such in regard to Lady Laura that I do not <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> live with him in safety. He is crazed about religion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, my lad," [...] said Bartle tenderly, [...] "it's heavy--it's heavy. But {{you must}} {{remember}} this: when you thought of marrying her, you'd a notion she'd got another sort of a nature inside her. You didn't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have got hardened in that little while to do what she's done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot <b>think</b> where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{have been}} going," [...] said Clym to some one. [...] "She had evidently walked a long way, {{but even when}} she was able to speak just now she would not tell me where. What do you really think of her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my mother,--yes; and you {{may tell}} me too, if you please, that Captain Culpepper was there. I do love my mother dearly; but do you <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make up for your absence?" [...] And his voice was very tender, and so were his eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Beatrice and Sidney Webb persuaded Charlotte {{to donate}} £1,000 to the London School of Economics library and the {{endowment}} of a woman's scholarship. Charlotte also joined the Fabian Society. Beatrice later commented: [...] "By temperament {{she is an}} anarchist, feeling any regulation or rule intolerable, a tendency which has been exaggerated by her irresponsible wealth... She is a socialist and a radical, not because she understands the collectivist standpoint, but because she is by nature a rebel. She is fond of men and impatient of most women, bitterly resents her enforced celibacy but <b>thinks</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not tolerate the matter-of-fact side of marriage. Sweet tempered, sympathetic and genuinely anxious to increase the world's enjoyment and diminish the world's pain." ...|$|R
