40|$|Methods for {{authoring}} Web-based multimedia presentations {{have advanced}} considerably with the improvements provided by HTML 5. However, authors of these multimedia presentations still lack expressive, declarative language constructs to encode synchronized multimedia scenarios. The SMIL <b>Timesheets</b> {{language is a}} serious contender to tackle this problem as it provides alternatives to associate a declarative timing specification to an HTML document. However, in its current form, the SMIL <b>Timesheets</b> language does not meet important requirements observed in Web-based multimedia applications. In order to tackle this problem, this paper presents the ActiveTimesheets engine, which extends the SMIL <b>Timesheets</b> language by providing dynamic client- side modifications, temporal linking and reuse of temporal constructs in fine granularity. All these contributions are demonstrated {{in the context of}} a Web-based annotation and extension tool for multimedia documents.
