40|$|Termination is an {{important}} issue in the theory of term rewriting. In general termination is undecidable. There are nevertheless several methods successful in special cases. In [5] we introduced the notion of total termination: basically terms are interpreted compositionally in a total well-founded order, {{in such a way that}} rewriting chains map to descending chains. Total termination is thus a semantic notion. It turns out that most of the usual techniques for proving termination fall within the scope of total termination. This paper consists of two parts. In the first part we introduce a generalization of recursive path order presenting a new proof of its well-foundedness without using Kruskal's theorem. We also show that the notion of total <b>termination</b> <b>covers</b> this generalization.

However, effects of cover crops in local farming systems are varied and can be affected by timing and method of <b>cover</b> crop <b>termination.</b> We conducted two field studies each in Upper Marlboro and Beltsville, Maryland between 2013 and 2014. The study consisted of three cover crop and one Fallow(F) treatments. Cover crop treatments were Early-Kill (EK) and Late-Kill in which the cover crop was killed with a post-emergent herbicide in late April and May, respectively; and flail mow (FM), in which a flail mower was used to terminate the cover crop in late May.

40|$|International audienceThe many {{different}} proxy {{records from the}} European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica (EPICA) Dome C ice core allow {{for the first time}} a comparison of nine glacial terminations in great detail. Despite the fact that all <b>terminations</b> <b>cover</b> the transition from a glacial maximum into an interglacial, there are large differences between single terminations. For some terminations, Antarctic temperature increased only moderately, while for others, the amplitude of change at the termination was much larger. For the different terminations, the rate of change in temperature is more similar than the magnitude or duration of change. These temperature changes were accompanied by vast changes in dust and sea salt deposition all over Antarctica. Here we investigate the phasing between a South American dust proxy (non-sea-salt calcium flux, nssCa 2 +), a sea ice proxy (sea salt sodium flux, ssNa+) and a proxy for Antarctic temperature (deuterium, δD). In particular, we look into whether a similar sequence of events applies to all terminations, despite their different characteristics. All proxies are derived from the EPICA Dome C ice core, resulting in a relative dating uncertainty between the proxies of less than 20 years. At the start of the terminations, the temperature (δD) increase and dust (nssCa 2 + flux) decrease start synchronously. The sea ice proxy (ssNa+ flux), however, only changes once the temperature has reached a particular threshold, approximately 5 °C below present day temperatures (corresponding to a δD value of − 420 ‰). This reflects to a large extent the limited sensitivity of the sea ice proxy during very cold periods with large sea ice extent. At terminations where this threshold is not reached (TVI, TVIII), ssNa+ flux shows no changes. Above this threshold, the sea ice proxy is closely coupled to the Antarctic temperature, and interglacial levels are reached at the same time for both ssNa+ and δD. On the other hand, once another threshold at approximately 2 °C below present day temperature is passed (corresponding to a δD value of − 402 ‰), nssCa 2 + flux has reached interglacial levels and does not change any more, despite further warming. This threshold behaviour most likely results from a combination of changes to the threshold friction velocity for dust entrainment and to the distribution of surface wind speeds in the dust source region...|$|R

40|$|Cover crop-based, organic {{rotational}} no-till (CCORNT) {{corn and}} soybean production {{is becoming a}} viable strategy for reducing tillage in organic annual grain systems in the mid-Atlantic, United States. This strategy relies on mechanical <b>termination</b> of <b>cover</b> crops with a roller-crimper and no-till planting corn and soybean into cover crop mulches. Here, we report on recent research that focuses on integrated approaches for crop, nutrient and pest management in CCORNT systems that consider system and regional constraints for adoption in the mid-Atlantic. Our research suggests that no-till planting soybean into roller-crimped cereal rye can produce consistent yields. However, constraints to fertility management have produced less consistent no-till corn yields. Our research shows that grass-legume mixtures can improve N-release synchrony with corn demand and also improve weed suppression. Integration of high-residue inter-row cultivation improves weed control consistency and may reduce reliance on optimizing cover crop biomass accumulation for weed suppression. System-specific strategies are needed to address volunteer cover crops in later rotational phases, which result from incomplete <b>cover</b> crop <b>termination</b> with the roller crimper. The paucity of adequate machinery for optimizing establishment of cash crops into thick residue mulch remains a major constraint on CCORNT adoption.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Crop {{rotation}} and cover crop can be important means for enhancing crop yield in rainfed {{areas such as}} the lower Coastal Bend Region of Texas, USA. A trial was conducted in 1995 as part of a long-term cropping experiment (7 years) to investigate the effect of oat (Avena sativa L.) cover and rotation on soil water storage and yield of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.). The trial design was a RCB in a split-plot arrangement with four replicates. Rotation sequences were the main plots and oat cover crop the subplots. Cover crop reduced sorghum grain yield. This effect was attributed to a reduced concentration of available soil N and less soil water storage under this treatment. By delaying <b>cover</b> <b>termination,</b> the residue with a high C/N acted as an N sink through competition and/or immobilization instead of an N source to sorghum plants. Crop rotation had a significantly positive effect on sorghum yield and this effect was attributed to a significantly larger amount of N concentration under these rotation sequences...|$|R
40|$|The {{inclusion}} of cover crops into cropping systems brings both {{direct and indirect}} costs and benefits to the farm. A myriad of {{studies have examined the}} economic benefits of cover crops in multiple cropping systems by comparing them to systems without cover crops. To date, economic research pertaining to the economic impact of the level of cover crop biomass has yet to be examined. Thus, {{the purpose of this paper}} was to assess the economic impact of different amounts of biomass associated with growing high residue cover crops in a corn-cotton conservation tillage system. An experiment examining planting and <b>termination</b> dates of <b>cover</b> crops and its effects on cover crop biomass, cash crop yields and weed suppression in corn-cotton conservation systems was conducted at two sites in Alabama and one site in Florida. A mathematical model incorporating the direct and indirect effects of cover crops, such as weed suppression and provision of nitrogen to the soil, was estimated using the experimental data. Findings suggest that rye and crimson clover cover crops used in a conservation tillage system can, in fact, be profitable to a farmer if managed properly and if economically viable levels of biomass are obtained from the cover crops. Taking into account potential cost savings, the minimum amount of cover crop biomass needed to be profitable for rye prior to cotton was 4, 897 lbs per acre and for crimson clover prior to corn was 2, 680 lbs per acre...|$|R
40|$|Weather {{observations}} form {{a crucial}} part of meteorological forecasts and are also used as input to climate models and for monitoring long-term climate trends and changes. But coverage at sea is much less dense spatially and temporally, especially at high latitudes. Passive underwater acoustics has been established for several decades as a good and reliable tool to monitor the weather. The frequency spectra of different weather types have been well documented and acoustic disdrometers have been developed in several research environments. Nevertheless, many questions remain about the validity of some of these measurements, the best analysis approaches and the combination of different weather processes. This is particularly true in polar regions, where the loud and complex acoustics of ice-related processes adds to the difficulty of the task. This thesis focuses on the analysis of a broadband dataset acquired in an Arctic fjord (Kongsfjord, Svalbard), in summer 2007. Taken at 6 locations {{from the mouth of the}} fjord to the glaciers at its <b>termination,</b> measurements <b>cover</b> the combination of varying levels of rain (from none to light rain), wind (from none to 11 km/h), ice (from none to growlers and bergy bits), shipping (from none to a large cruise ship) and animal activity (including whales and diving seabirds). The recordings covered frequencies from 100 Hz to 48 kHz. Principal-Components Analysis identified 3 distinct frequency bands mostly related to noise from wind, rain and ice. Laboratory-based tank experiments were conducted to assess the physical sources of these components (from 100 Hz to 100 kHz), confirming the acoustic role of ice and the relevance of the frequency bands identified by Principal-Component Analysis. These experiments also identified for the first time the role of higher (up to 45 kHz) acoustic frequencies in the identification of ice-related processes such as scraping, colliding and melting. Principal-Component Analysis is shown to be a valuable and rigorous tool for identifying weather processes at sea, especially in complex combinations of wind, rain, ice and other factors. Analyses at frequencies higher than generally used also offer the potential of identifying specific processes associated to the melting of glaciers and icebergs. This has paved the way for field measurements at glaciers around Svalbard in summer 2009. The approach presented here is now considered by the Meteorological Office (UK) for inclusion on operational present-weather sensors attached to moored or drifting buoys in polar and high-latitude regions in general.

40|$|Rollers {{may provide}} a viable {{alternative}} to herbicides for terminating cover crops, however, excessive vibration generated and transferred to the tractor hinders adoption of this technology in the U. S. To avoid excessive vibration, producers must limit their operational speed, which increases time and cost of rolling. The effect of speed on rye (Secale cereale L.) termination rate, vibrations and cotton yield was tested for two roller designs during the 2004 - 2005 growing season. A triple-section roller (4. 1 m wide) with long straight bars (straight bar roller) and a smooth roller with an oscillating crimping bar (smooth roller/crimper) were evaluated at speeds of 3. 2 and 6. 4 km h- 1. <b>Cover</b> <b>termination</b> and cotton yield were recorded. In 2004, higher rye termination rates resulted from the straight bar roller (96 %) in comparison with the smooth roller/crimper (94 %). Three weeks after rolling, both rollers had effectively terminated rye without use of herbicides. The smooth roller/crimper transferred lower vibration levels to the tractor’s frame than the straight bar roller at both speeds. No differences in cotton yield were found between roller types, speeds and chemical treatment (glyphosate) except for lower cotton yield recorded for the smooth roller/crimper at the speed of 3. 2 km h- 1. Cotton yield in 2004 was decreased by hurricane Ivan and these results might not be representative for normal weather conditions. Under typical weather conditions in 2005, higher cotton yield resulted following straight bar roller and glyphosate application, and might be associated with higher soil moisture availability due to faster termination of rye...|$|R

An experiment was conducted between 2009 and 2011 near Mead, Nebraska, where mixtures of two (2 CC), four (4 CC), six (6 CC), and eight (8 CC) cover crop species, or a summer annual weed mixture were included in a sunflower– soybean–corn rotation. Cover crops were terminated in late May using a field disk or sweep plow undercutter. Undercutting cover crops increased soil NO 3 –N (0 – 20 cm) by 1. 0 and 1. 8 mg NO 3 –N kg– 1 relative to disk incorporation in 2010 and 2011, respectively.

Despite differences in productivity between spring cover crop mixtures and weed communities, crop yield was not different among these treatments; thus, profitability of the weed mixture–undercutter treatment combination was greatest due to reduced input costs...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing concern}} of soil health and {{long-term}} sustainability has {{increased interest in}} no-till and cover crops in the Midwest. Some of the challenges with no-till in the Midwest can be higher soil moisture and lower soil temperatures at cash crop planting in the spring, planter adjustment issues, and lack of immediate economic benefit. Cover crops also {{have some of the}} same issues along with extra cost of seed and <b>termination,</b> mismanagement of <b>cover</b> crops, and lack of knowledge on the benefits and costs. This project was begun in order to quantify the effects of no-till and cover crops on soil chemical and physical properties and on some cash crop properties. There were seven sites in Indiana with treatments comparing cover crops to no cover crop controls, and one site with a tillage and cover crop comparison. Three of the sites were Purdue research farms and the other four were farmer cooperator fields. Measurements taken included cover crop biomass and nitrogen (N) concentration, soil nitrate-N (NO 3 -N) and ammonium-N (NH 4 -N) concentrations, soil aggregate stability, soil water retention, soil penetration resistance, corn stalk NO 3 -N concentration, and corn and soybean yield. Because this study only had one or two years of cover crop growth, many of the results were not significantly different between cover crop and no cover crop. The cover crops did take up N in the fall and spring which was reflected in lower soil NO 3 -N concentrations in the treatments with cover crops. There were not many differences in the soil physical properties and no differences in the cash crop properties. The main difference in soil physical properties were between no-till and conventional till treatments, with no-till having better aggregate stability and higher soil bulk density, and lower total porosity than the conventional treatment. Two years may not be enough time to demonstrate the cover crop effects on the soil and cash crop properties. More research and time is needed to quantify the effects of cover crops on soil health over the long term. ...|$|R
40|$|Most {{muskmelon}} (Cucumis melo L.) {{production in}} the upper Midwest relies on intensive tillage and plasticulture. An alternative system starts {{with the use of}} a roller-crimper to terminate winter cover crops, thus forming a thick organic mulch. Then, all tillage performed is restricted to a narrow strip in which muskmelons are transplanted. Cover crops and strip-tillage can increase soil health, suppress weeds, and improve net profitability. Muskmelons are an important crop for vegetable growers and are among the top consumed produce items in the U. S. Foodborne illness outbreaks of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes associated with muskmelon consumption have resulted in consumer fatalities, and negatively impacted the livelihood of producers. A study was carried out over two seasons (2014 - 15 and 2015 - 16) to assess the effect of cover crops and tillage on the performance of muskmelon production. Data was collected on cover crop growth, soil temperature, soil moisture, weed biomass, the concentration of nitrate-nitrogen in leachate, soil nutrient concentrations, muskmelon plant growth, soil microbial biomass carbon, soil microbial functional diversity, muskmelon yield, net profitability, and fruit quality. Our goal was to take a comprehensive view of the differences between the use of cover crops [no cover, cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), and cereal rye-hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) ] with conventional tillage and strip-tillage. We also assessed how treatments would affect the survival of soilborne Listeria innocua, a non-pathogenic surrogate for the human pathogen L. monocytogenes, either applied near the time of cover crop planting or near <b>cover</b> crop <b>termination.</b> We hypothesized that cover crop based ST would increase soil moisture, reduce weed biomass, reduce nitrate-nitrogen leaching, increase soil microbial biomass carbon, increase microbial functional diversity, and fruit quality, without sacrificing yield or net profitability. We also tested the hypothesis that cover crop mulch would prevent the contamination of muskmelon fruits by soilborne L. innocua. In one year, the earlier <b>termination</b> of <b>cover</b> crops in conventional tillage plots and also the use of a rye-vetch biculture lowered the C:N ratio of cover crop biomass. Cover crops and strip-tillage did reduce weed biomass, though not consistently over both years. In-row soil moisture was higher in strip-tillage, and in-row soil temperature was higher in conventional tillage. Strip-tillage occasionally reduced the concentration of NO 3 -ÃÂÃÂ¬-N in leachate, this effect was inconsistent and only observed at a few sampling dates for only one year of the study. Rye-CT increased microbial biomass carbon over no cover-CT. During one year of the study, microbial functional diversity increased in rye and rye-vetch plots. The proportion of fruits that were marketable was increased under strip-tillage, as were several measures of fruit quality, but only in 2016. Populations of L. innocua introduced to the field in Oct. were able to overwinter and were detected the following May. The survival of May-applied L. innocua was measured in the first year of the study and showed that populations were reduced under both rye and rye-vetch cover crops. Treatments had no effect on the contamination of fruits at harvest. An economic analysis had mixed results, no cover strip-till plots had the lowest profit in both years, and rye strip-tillage and rye-vetch strip-tillage out performed their respective conventional tillage treatments in one year...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: INTRODUCTION Crop {{insurance}} {{has become}} an important tool for managing economic and environmental risk in the agricultural sector, {{and one of the}} largest sources of Federal subsidies to agricultural producers. This research examines the near- and long-term risks to agricultural producers, and seeks to identify and evaluate potential policy opportunities within the federal crop insurance program to improve the climate adaptation capacity of insured farms. The crop insurance program contains several structural barriers to sustainable, adaptive management practices, including a lack of soil and water conservation requirements common to other farm support programs (remedied in the Agricultural Act of 2014), and stringent planting date requirements which discourage farmers from using cover crops to protect their soil from erosion and enhance fertility, as well as diversify their farms (both economically and biologically) and increase climate resiliency. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Reinstate conservation compliance requirements for eligibility to receive federal subsidies towards crop insurance coverage (successfully passed in the Agricultural Act of 2014). 2. Provide farmers who plant cover crops with an additional “buffer” period after their policy’s final planting date to allow appropriate <b>termination</b> of the <b>cover</b> crop without jeopardizing the insurance coverage on their primary crop. ANALYSIS & METHODS To evaluate the economic impacts of requiring conservation compliance for eligibility to receive crop insurance subsidies, I constructed a cost benefit analysis at the national scale, including cash flows for the economy as a whole, the government, and affected farmers. My analysis focuses on the marginal impact of the program, quantifying only the marginal costs and benefits of implementing the program on farms which are not currently participating in any other Farm Bill programs requiring conservation compliance, and which will be coming under the compliance requirement for the first time due to their use of subsidized crop insurance. This eliminates all farms which would be subject to the requirement {{whether or not it was}} added to the crop insurance program, and thus more accurately quantifies the impact of the policy change within the context of other interrelated farm support programs. Due to the lack of data from the field regarding the dynamics of planting date restrictions and cover cropping decisions, I could not construct a national-scale cost benefit analysis to evaluate my second policy recommendation. I instead created a farm-scale cost benefit model to compare the performance of a commodity mono-crop with a dual, cover crop and commodity crop system. The model takes into account the unique economic, social, and biological attributes of the farm using yield, acreage, crop selection, planting dates, management practices, and insurance parameters to produce estimates of the costs and benefits at the farm level. RESULTS The results of my analysis show that conservation compliance, even under the most conservative scenario, provides a net benefit to farmers and to the economy as a whole for a comparatively modest initial investment on the part of farmers and the government. In my moderately conservative cost benefit analysis scenario, reinstating the conservation compliance requirements in association with crop insurance provides an incremental net benefit of at least $ 4, 411 per acre in present value terms, with over $ 780 per acre of those benefits accruing to the farmer. The cover crop analysis did not provide any generalizable results, however it does suggest that a buffer period within the planting date restrictions for farmers growing cover crops may help mitigate the risk of cover crops interfering with the profitability of farmers’ primary commodity crop, and thus remove one of the barriers to adoption. I recommend a pilot test of this policy change, with rigorous measurement and evaluation of the impacts on farm revenue, insurance and subsidy payments, and environmental outcomes. CONCLUSIONS With impending near- and long-term threats of climate change, the crop insurance program should balance the need for rigid management requirements to ensure an appropriate baseline level of risk mitigation and management with the flexibility to allow farmers to experiment with new management practices to find what works best in their new climate context. The benefits of the conservation compliance requirement vastly outweigh the costs, and provide a cost-effective mechanism for improving adaptive capacity on already vulnerable agricultural lands. While the planting date buffer period is a promising mechanism for increasing the use of cover crops and improving farmers’ capacity to develop new adaptive risk management strategies at the local level, additional research and field testing is needed to determine the impact of relaxing the constraint on actual adoption rates in the field...|$|R
40|$|Low soil {{fertility}} in the Eastern Cape Province (EC) {{is attributed to}} poor agricultural management, which reduces organic matter, among other factors. Conservation agriculture (CA), consisting of no-till, soil cover and rotations, is being promoted to improve soil quality and productivity. Soil biological parameters respond to the overall effects of management on the physical and chemical components of soil. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effects of oat (Avena sativa) and grazing vetch (Vicia dasycarpa) cover crops on soil biological activity after five years under CA and evaluate light organic matter fractions, MBC and activities of selected enzymes as early indicators of organic matter build up under in no-till maize based CA system. The study was based on soil samples collected from a five year trial with rotations of maize and sole covercrops and two younger trials (4 and 28 months) with oat and grazing vetch bicultures. In the five year old trial, oat and grazing vetch were planted at four fertiliser regimes (i) Fertilizer applied to cover crops and maize (F 1), (ii) fertilizer applied to cover crops only (F 2), (iii) fertilizer applied to maize only (F 3) and (iv) no fertilizer applied (F 4)) to give a 2 × 4 factorial plus control laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications. Fertilizer was applied at 10 kg P ha- 1, as a compound (6. 7 % N; 10 % P; 13. 3 % K) at planting and grazing vetch was inoculated with Rhizobium legunominosarium biovar viciae. Oat was top dressed using limestone ammonium nitrate (LAN – 28 % N) at 7 weeks after planting (WAP) to make a total of 45 kg N ha- 1. Three weeks after <b>termination</b> of the <b>cover</b> crops, all plots were split in half and maize was planted and fertilizer applied at 0 and 60 N kg ha- 1. A third of the N was applied at planting (6. 7 % N; 10 % P; 13. 3 % K). In the biculture trials, the treatments were 90 % oat + 10 % vetch, 70 % oat + 30 % vetch, 50 % oat+ 50 % vetch, 100 % vetch and 100 % oat and laid out in a RCBD with three replicates. Only basal fertilizer was applied to the cover crop at planting at 13. 34 kg N ha- 1, 20 kg P ha- 1 and 26. 66 kg K ha- 1 using 2 : 3 : 4 (30 + 0. 5 % Zn) compound fertiliser. After <b>cover</b> crop <b>termination,</b> SC 701 maize variety was planted, and fertilised at 60 kg N ha- 1 with a third of the N applied as a basal. In the five year old trial, oat and vetch gave significantly (P < 0. 05) higher MBC and activities of all soil enzymes measured than the weedy fallow at 0 - 5 and 5 - 20 cm depths. Fertilization of cover crop (F 2) and maize (F 3) gave similar MBC. The F 4 in cover crops gave similar dehydrogenase activity with F 3 under weedy fallow and that for vetch rotation was the same for F 3 in oat. The F 4 for grazing vetch had similar β-glucosidase activity as F 1 and similar urease activity as F 1, F 2 and F 3 of oat rotations. Acid and alkaline activity in F 1 had similar results to F 2. In the younger trials, biculture treatments did not improve total C, and N when compared with the weedy fallow. Dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, arylsulphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities were higher in the 28 month trial compared to the 4 month one while urease was higher in the 4 -month old trial. Treatments with more than 50 % oat content had higher acid phosphatase activity in the 4 - than 28 month old trial. Effects of cover crop, as the main factor, was significant in all enzymes (P < 0. 05), with 70 % oat + 30 % vetch treatment having the highest dehydrogenase and arylsulphatase while for alkaline phosphatase it had similar results to 90 % oat + 10 % vetch. For β-glucosidase and urease, effects of cover crop as the main factor were also significant with sole vetch giving the highest activity for both enzymes. Acid phosphatase activity was highest in sole oat. Particulate OM was highest in the 100 % oat treatment and declined with decrease in the proportion of oat in the biculture. The 50 % oat + 50 % vetch treatment had similar POM to the 70 % oat + 30 % vetch in the 4 month old trial and to the 90 % oat + 10 % vetch in the 28 months old trial in the 0 - 5 cm depth (P < 0. 05). In the 5 - 20 cm depth, the 70 % oat + 30 % vetch treatment had similar POM to the 90 % oat + 10 % vetch in the 28 month old trial. The 70 % oat+ 30 % vetch had greatest WSC and MBC followed by the 90 % oat + 10 % vetch, with the 50 % oat + 50 % vetch being similar to 100 % vetch and 100 % oat (MBC only). The 28 months old trial had greater POM and WSC than the 4 months trial. The findings of this study imply that the use of grazing vetch and fertilization of cover crops only improves soil biological activity, represented by MBC and enzyme activities, after 5 years of maize-cover crop rotations in low input conservation agriculture system. Bicultures, particularly the 70 % oat + 30 % vetch, work better than their sole crops in improving organic matter fractions, MBC and enzyme activities and that POM, WSC, MBC, enzyme activities are useful early indicators of soil organic matter build-up of CA systems...|$|R
