5|$|Members {{who would}} become famous {{included}} George Burns and Bucharest-born Edward G. Robinson, who had his Bar Mitzvah there in 1906. Robinson would later laugh that his propensity for taking <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> demonstrated when he gave the longest Bar Mitzvah speech {{in the history of}} the congregation—"but the men sat still and listened".|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of July 2, all of the {{remaining}} elements of both armies had arrived: Stuart's cavalry, George Pickett's division, and John Sedgwick's VI Corps. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> set for the bloody climax of the three-day battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth stage}} was run without the {{incidents}} that plagued {{the first three}} stages. Pothier, Maurice and César Garin and Beaugendre reached Bordeaux together, and <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> decided by the final kilometre in the velodrome, where Pothier recorded the fastest time.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> {{of timber}} boards. Over <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> a {{proscenium}} decorated with timber mouldings. Above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> a timber catwalk, from {{which can be}} seen the substantial timber king-post roof trusses.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> over 5000 sq ft. Dressing rooms <b>are</b> under <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> A sound {{station with}} view of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> at <b>the</b> {{back of the}} ground level seating.|$|R
30|$|The {{review of}} policy {{changes can be}} divided into {{different}} periods. <b>The</b> first <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> from 1930 s to 1970 s. <b>The</b> second <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> about <b>the</b> 1980 s. <b>The</b> third <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> about 1990 s and <b>the</b> final <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> from 2000 s to the present.|$|R
5|$|The trial {{started on}} February 4, 2013. Blythe testified {{that when he}} wanted to see the club before the concert, Lamb of God's {{technician}} told him that the club was terrible and messy. According to Blythe, the technician went on, saying that <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> small, there were too many people, and that it was rather dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E
5|$|As an {{homage to}} the venue, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> {{decorated}} with roses. The multi-leveled set-up consisted of New York City fire escape routes. Other parts of the stage had a ladder reaching the mezzanine floors and a replica of an F train carriage. Gaga's wardrobe was also rose themed, with leotards, hats and jackets, and instruments adorned with red roses. The main set list for the residency encompassed songs from The Fame, The Fame Monster, Born This Way, and Artpop. Some tracks were performed in acoustic versions.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> {{accessed}} from <b>the</b> hall {{by a set}} of movable steps. On {{either side}} are curving walls ornamented with battens that conceal the side wings. The sounding board above <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> clad in stained plywood. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> floor <b>is</b> raked and curves outwards, clad in polished timber boards with footlights concealed beneath a removable timber board. Curtains line the wings and rear wall of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> and <b>the</b> ceiling structure is exposed.|$|R
50|$|If normal cubes or {{advantage}} cubes {{fall off}} the end of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> without being cleared, the number of fallen cubes will be calculated on the block scale (i.e. a counter is increased by 1). Every time the number of fallen cubes exceed that of the block scale, a row of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> lost (thereby reducing the number of rows the cubes have to travel to fall off). This number is equal to the width of <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> minus one. On <b>the</b> first <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> 4 cubes wide, so the limit is 3; on <b>the</b> final <b>stage,</b> <b>the</b> limit <b>is</b> 6 because <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> 7 cubes wide. If a normal or advantage cube falls {{off the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>stage,</b> that set <b>is</b> not considered perfect (see below).|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> {{always in}} <b>the</b> centre with the {{audience}} arranged on all sides, and is most commonly rectangular, circular, diamond, or triangular. Actors may enter and exit through the audience from different directions or from below <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> usually on an even level with or below the audience in a [...] "pit" [...] or [...] "arena" [...] formation.|$|R
5|$|As {{the number}} of {{expected}} participants grew, the rally was moved from {{the grounds of the}} Washington Monument to the east end of the Mall facing the Capitol. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> {{on the east side of}} the rally with an open back, allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances. In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd to spread out rather than press against the main stage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small {{advantage}} over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no lead-out trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came past him and took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had been badly positioned and was only able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not taking}} part in this edition of the Giro, Tondó {{had participated in the}} 2010 edition and was a popular, well-liked rider. Race leader and {{eventual}} winner Alberto Contador, along with many others, rode the stage 16 individual time trial with black armbands. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> preceded by a minute of silence. Tondó's teammate Branislau Samoilau posted a time that was provisionally best much of the day and was visibly overcome with emotion when interviewed by assembled media after his ride. Contador, who won the time trial, dedicated the victory to Tondó, as the two were acquainted despite never having been teammates.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> a {{platform}} below the objective which supports the specimen being viewed. In {{the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> a hole through which light passes to illuminate <b>the</b> specimen. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> usually has arms to hold slides (rectangular glass plates with typical dimensions of 25×75 mm, on which the specimen is mounted).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> noticeably less circular, {{similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> used in season two.|$|R
5|$|In {{the third}} stage, four cyclists (Julien Gabory, Henri Gauban, Gaston Tuvache and Maurice Carrere) were disqualified {{for taking the}} train. The Ballon d'Alsace, which {{had been the first}} real {{mountain}} in the Tour de France the previous year, was featured again. Just as the year before, it was mounted first by Pottier. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> also won by Pottier, more than 45 minutes ahead of the rest.|$|E
5|$|Porte {{therefore}} won {{both the}} stage and the overall victory in the race, his first general classification victory since he won Paris–Nice in 2013. Kwiatkowski's fifth place on <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> enough to ensure both second place overall (30 seconds behind Porte) and victory in the young rider classification. Špilak finished on the same overall time as Kwiatkowski in third place, with Costa also on {{the same time in}} fourth.|$|E
5|$|The FCI {{refused to}} suspend Petacchi, and he {{returned}} to racing in late July. Their decision, however, was not made to exonerate Petacchi, but rather {{because they did not}} believe they should hear the case, instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi testified to the court, stating that the hot and humid day on which <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> the run had made it so that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler, but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.|$|E

5|$|Contador {{continued}} to be troubled by his injury during stage 8, which finished on the climb of the Campitello Matese. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> won by Beñat Intxausti (Movistar), {{who was in the}} day's early breakaway and attacked on the final climb. Astana again rode hard to put pressure on the other riders; eventually a group formed of Contador, Aru, Porte and Landa. Landa then attacked and finished second on the stage, 15 seconds ahead of the other three riders. He therefore moved up into fifth place overall, while Contador increased his lead over Aru by winning bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint. Stage 9 was also won by a rider from a breakaway: Paolo Tiralongo (Astana) took a solo victory. Aru, Contador, Porte and Landa were again alone in a group {{towards the end of the}} stage; although they came to the finish together, Aru took a second out of the others in the sprint. This moved him to three seconds behind Contador. The following day was the first rest day of the race.|$|E
5|$|His next fight {{took place}} on January 7, 2006 at Madison Square Garden in New York City against Carlos Baldomir. For Judah, the fight {{was viewed as a}} tuneup bout that would lead to a lucrative bout between Judah and WBC Light Welterweight Champion Floyd Mayweather, Jr., which was {{tentatively}} scheduled for April. Judah entered the fight as a 10-to-1 favorite over Baldomir. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> set when Judah unsportingly punched Baldomir on the thigh during the prefight introductions instead of touching gloves to show sportsmanship. The early rounds of the fight were close, but as the rounds passed, Judah was doing less than necessary to win, while Baldomir kept applying pressure on Judah. In round seven, Judah was hurt by a right hand and Baldomir landed a series of right hands to Judah's head along the ropes during the tenth round. Baldomir defeated Judah by unanimous decision with scores of 115–113, 114–113 and 115–112 from the three judges.|$|E
5|$|In a {{significant}} {{contrast to the}} political scene in South Vietnam, the North Vietnamese government in Hanoi were far more occupied with their military effort. The North Vietnamese Transportation Group 559, then {{under the leadership of}} Major-General Phan Trong Tue, was ordered to open a new transportation and communication lines through southern Laos and South Vietnam. The purpose was to facilitate the movement of troops and material through the Pathet Lao-occupied section of the Ho Chi Minh trail. They were supported by 1,500 workers from the Ministry of Transportation and 7,600 volunteers. By the end of 1965, the strength of Group 559 had grown to 24,400 personnel organised in six battalions of motor vehicles, one battalion of boats, 18 battalions of combat engineers, four battalions of anti-aircraft artillery and guard units. In addition to the expansion of their logistical abilities, the North Vietnamese also decided to establish five infantry divisions and one artillery in South Vietnam. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> set for a major military struggle with American and other allied forces.|$|E

5|$|Shuffle! {{had much}} pre-sale hype as the {{development}} team was largely composed of {{former members of}} BasiL, including Hiro Suzuhira and Aoi Nishimata, the illustrators for Shuffle!. Shuffle! was released at {{around the same time}} as Fate/stay night, a highly anticipated visual novel by Type-Moon. The limited edition of Shuffle! was the second highest-selling computer game for the last two weeks of January 2004 the top 50 best-selling Bishōjo games semi-monthly sales chart in Japan, behind Fate/stay night. It then ranked 18th and 50th in February before dropping off the chart in {{the first two weeks of}} March at 40th. The regular edition of the PC version of Shuffle! premiered at 9th in the chart in the last two weeks of February. It then ranked 5th and 40th in March, before its last appearance at 49th in the first half of April. Shuffle! On <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> <b>was</b> released on October 20, 2005 and sold well (for a visual novel) during its first week, selling 29,732 copies by October 23.|$|E
5|$|The Circus Starring Britney Spears, {{commonly}} referred to as the Circus Tour, was the seventh concert tour by American singer Britney Spears. It was launched in support of her sixth studio album, Circus (2008). Rumors of a tour arose as early as October 2007, after Spears released her fifth studio album Blackout; however, it was cancelled due to unknown reasons. The tour was officially announced in December 2008, with dates for American and British venues revealed. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> composed of three rings and set in-the-round to resemble an actual circus. Fashion designers Dean and Dan Caten created the costumes. A giant cylinder screen was set above the stage to showcase videos and backdrops. Effects were provided by Solotech. Magician Ed Alonzo joined Spears during the second act. The setlist was composed generally from her albums In the Zone, Blackout and Circus. Spears announced she would tour Australia {{for the first time in}} June 2009.|$|E
5|$|The Dangerously in Love Tour was {{the debut}} concert tour by American {{recording}} artist Beyoncé. Although the tour {{was intended to}} showcase songs from her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love, (2003) the set list also contained a special segment dedicated to Beyoncé's girl group Destiny's Child and featured songs from her 2003 film The Fighting Temptations. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>was</b> simple and featured a large LED screen in the back that displayed video images of Beyoncé and her dancers, {{as well as some}} images from her music videos and some prerecorded images. The tour was reviewed negatively by Dave Simpson of The Guardian who graded it with two stars out of five. The Dangerously in Love Tour only reached Europe and Beyoncé's performance, at the Wembley Arena in London, was filmed and later released on the CD/DVD Live at Wembley (2004).|$|E
5000|$|What do I need a movie for? <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> on {{a higher}} level in every way, and a more {{satisfying}} medium.
