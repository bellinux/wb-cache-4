5|$|<b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>End</b> of London, {{also known}} simply as <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>End,</b> {{is an area of}} Central, East London and London Docklands, England; east of the Roman and medieval walls of the City of London, and north of the River Thames. <b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>End</b> is the {{historic}} core of wider East London but is not defined by any universally accepted boundaries, though the various channels of the River Lea are often considered to be the eastern boundary.|$|E
5|$|The {{relevance}} of Strype's {{reference to the}} Tower was more than geographical. <b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>End</b> was the major part of an area called the Tower Division, which had {{its roots in the}} Bishop of London's historic Manor of Stepney and owed military service to the Tower of London.

5|$|A common {{preference}} is {{to include the}} modern borough of Tower Hamlets, and the former parish and borough of Shoreditch (this includes Hoxton and Haggerston {{and is now the}} southern part of the modern London Borough of Hackney).

50|$|Prior to 1908, several semi-pro {{and amateur}} teams {{dominated}} the Akron football scene. The most dominant {{of these was}} a team known as <b>the</b> Akron <b>East</b> <b>Ends.</b> <b>The</b> <b>East</b> Ends' dominance of Ohio football went unmatched until the Massillon Tigers paid several ringers from the recently disbanded Pittsburgh Stars to defeat <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Ends</b> in 1903.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>Ends</b> were on <b>the</b> {{verge of}} winning the 1903 OIC on a common-opponent tiebreaker over the Shelby Blues. However, the Massillon Tigers began making {{a run for the}} title. Akron {{initially}} dismissed Massillon, telling them to [...] "go play for a couple of years" [...] before trying to challenge <b>the</b> <b>East</b> <b>Ends.</b> However, Akron was unable to match Massillon's margin of victory over Canton. <b>The</b> <b>East</b> <b>Ends</b> defeated Canton 17-6, while Massillon defeated that same team 16-0. Akron felt compelled to play and beat Massillon and prove itself worthy of the state title. A game was scheduled and <b>East</b> <b>Ends</b> appeared to be in luck when several Massillon starters fell victim to injury. However, the Tigers replaced its injured stars by buying the roster of the Pittsburgh Stars, the champions of the 1902 National Football League. In a game that had the feel of being one step short of a full-out riot, Akron lost to Massillon, 11-0, for the Ohio Independent Championship.|$|R
