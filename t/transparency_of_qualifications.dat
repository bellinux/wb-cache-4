The project aimed to facilitate increased transparency {{and reliability of}} information about qualification frameworks across the APEC region, share knowledge and skills and identify future areas of collaboration. A qualifications framework is an instrument for classifying qualifications according {{to a set of}} criteria for levels of learning outcomes. Considerable benefits are expected of national qualification frameworks (NQFs). If backed by a good system of quality assurance, they can support the development of workers’ skills, facilitate educational and labour market mobility, and help improve the access of individuals to higher and different levels of education and training over their lives. Education and training providers and authorities are able to design more consistent and linked qualifications when descriptors of qualifications are developed within NQFs. Employers benefit in their recruitment and training of staff when they can understand and have confidence in qualifications. The international recognition of an economy’s qualifications can be enhanced by the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualifications</b> to which an NQF can contribute.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} principle that EQF and ECVET {{have in common}} is the description of qualifications in terms of learning outcomes. The background for implementing this outcome-based approach in the European education and training systems, however, is quite diverse. This situation is addressed by the CREDIVOC project, which involves partners from Austria, Finland, France, Germany and Ireland and focuses on the identification, testing and transfer of instruments {{that can be used for}} the recognition and accreditation of learning outcomes from initial and continuing vocational education and training for further education. The present publication is the major outcome of the first phase of the project, which aimed at the production of a general overview of the accreditation procedures and instruments in the partner countries. To this end, national case studies concerning the accreditation of vocational learning outcomes in Austria, Finland, France, Germany and Ireland have been carried out by the project partners. In order to allow for comparison between the different national approaches a common analytical framework was adopted.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} preliminary {{outcomes of}} a European Commission funded project which brings together industry, academics and practitioners in an innovative project {{to create an}} international forum of learning. SIGNALL II builds on the successes of SIGNALL I (a Leonardo da Vinci project). It is promoted by Interesource Group (Ireland) Limited partnered with the Centre for Deaf Studies, Trinity College Dublin (Ireland), Irish Deaf Society (Ireland), Finnish Association of the Deaf (Finland), University of Sussex (UK), the Foundation for the Promotion of Entrepreneurship, Lodz,(Poland) and Grant Advisor, Brno (Czech Republic). SIGNALL 2 aims to utilise the experience, results, partnership alliances and the relationships built up with supporters and user groups from SIGNALL I and to develop an accredited digital course on Perspectives on Deafness (POD). Accreditation leads to the transfer of credit points (under the European Credit Transfer System) amongst participating third level educational establishments promoting international mobility in education and the <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualifications.</b> Experiential and evidenced-based material will illustrate experiences of deafness by using digitized case studies and video materials. The course will be offered as a distance-learning programme with fully accessible (signed, subtitled) course content in each partner country on-line. This is essential given that Deaf people are the most under-represented group accessing third level education, for example, [17], [5], and is challenging given the linguistic diversity of the European Union. For example, signed languages differ from territory to territory, even where spoken languages are the same (i. e. Britain and Ireland have very different natural signed languages ? British Sign Language and Irish Sign Language). The core content for the `Perspectives on Deafness? course has been created by the Centre for Deaf Studies (CDS) at Trinity College Dublin. CDS has actively engaged {{in the development of}} digital learning assets to support traditional delivery of programmes, and are actively engaged in the development of blended learning diplomas and degrees. European perspectives are added, allowing for the exploration of shared ? and differing- experiences of Deafhood [14] across Europe as well as notions of d/Deafness as a medical, social, cultural, and historical construct. Human rights perspectives are also explored in this wide reaching course. This paper outlines the background to the development of this course, outlining rationale, content, creation of digital materials, the nature of international involvement and the challenges to creating a repository of digital courseware that will be accessible and relevant to Deaf and hearing students and employers across the European Union, and beyond...|$|E
40|$|This {{study will}} {{contribute}} {{to a better understanding}} of the development of the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), a new policy solution proposed at the European level, with its stated aim being to create more <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualifications</b> across Europe by providing a standardized translation tool. The research problem of this study is to identify the main factors that have led to the introduction, development and implementation of the EQF. The study composes of four articles and an extended abstract. In this study, the EQF is conceptualized as a process of standardization, a process that can take different functions – the symbolic, instrumental and informational function. To zoom into the process of standardization, the analytical toolbox relies on three key themes that are based on an overall institutional perspectives. The first theme concerns decision-making about standards in the context of various formal and informal rules. Decision-making is conceptualised as a coupling between problems and solutions. This coupling is outlined according to four possible patterns: historical contingency, rational problem solving, solution driven normative process, and processes of chance. The second theme examines how specific structures can become institutionalized, in that they become taken-for-granted, acquire legitimacy and assure stable access to resources. The third theme is focused on the coupling between problems and solutions in a multi-level context, with emphasis on the scope of change and degree of coupling, highlighting possible patterns for how a European policy solution can be coupled to national policy problems. These three themes form a basis for examining the process through which the EQF was introduced, the intergovernmental structures that have been developed on European level, and the national processes that have taken place. Methodologically, the EQF is viewed as a case, and an unlikely case. The study has examined the process of developing a national qualifications framework (NQF) in three countries (Estonia, Ireland, and Norway). In Ireland the NQF was developed before the EQF, in Estonia and Norway the NQF was developed as a response to European initiatives. In addition, these countries provide a mix of other similarities and differences (EU attachment, policymaking context, NQF status, etc). The study is qualitative and relied on document analysis and expert interviews as data sources. The main time frame for the collected data here is from approximately year 2002 to 2013. The findings of this study are threefold. First, part examines the origins and development of the EQF. The analysis indicated a dual source for the EQF, with an expanding lifelong learning agenda in the EU, and the Bologna process as a source of inspiration. The analysis highlighted how the process of introducing the EQF was dialectic – being both problem driven and solution driven at times, and that serendipity and path-dependencies played a role at other times. The various interests that have been incorporated have also lead the EQF as a policy solution to be characterised by internal tension. Second, the study has examined the changing function of the EQF advisory group (EQFAG). The study shows how the EQFAG went through a process of rapid creation of procedures and norms, and fast expansion of informal power, to the extent that this can be considered stretching of the subsidiarity principle. Third, the study shows how national processes can vary substantially in how far European solutions are coupled to national policy problems. The distinct nature of processes that take place as a consequence of European initiatives is highlighted, and how this can lead to ad-hoc processes and weak links to national policy domain. The study shows how local policymaking traditions have an effect on the coupling of problems and solutions, where actor composition and interests have considerable effect on the process. From a standardization lens, the study discuses the EQF in light of the three functions. First, examining the symbolic function, the EQF can be seen to create common language, placing various educational systems in one larger meta-system, all of these represent an idea of a closer integrated Europe in the area of education. However, the EQF is not a very coherent and unified expression of values. The study proposes a view of “EU on demand”, where member states can pick and choose various ideas packed into the EQF. Second, examining the instrumental function, the EQF as a means for standardization can also be seen as a new mode of policymaking, where the Commission has taken the role of the standardizer, representing a more indirect mode of policymaking. Third, examining the informational function, the EQF is frequently presented as value-free, technical, the ultimate Babel fish that instantly translates any set of European educational qualifications into another set of qualifications. The case studies in this study have shown that this neutrality is to a large extent illusory...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} goals of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) is to {{facilitate}} the mobility of citizens, assuring the <b>transparency</b> and competitiveness <b>of</b> <b>qualifications</b> across Europe.

5000|$|Due to the {{shortage}} of the precious resource water {{and the consequences of}} the climate change, numerous European policies have been developed and adopted for the protection and sustainable utilisation of water, creating a huge demand in vocational training. Economic factors like privatisation and increasing cost pressure in water management are further increasing these educational needs, leading to the demand for VET opportunities and products that are as short and tailor‐made as possible.The situation of vocational training in water management was addressed by the WACOM instrument, which attempted to define the needed competences and qualifications for the different tasks, working places and employees within the water sector. In this way, WACOM strove to lead to a supposed increase in the volume of mobility throughout Europe as well as to a higher <b>transparency</b> and recognition <b>of</b> <b>qualifications</b> and competences. The project aimed at creating general as well as particular modular VET opportunities and products in the water management concerning the addressed competences and qualifications.

40|$|The {{hospitality}} and tourism industry is characterised by its dynamic and multi-disciplinary nature. Providing {{hospitality and}} tourism {{students with the}} requisite skills and competencies {{to meet with the}} demands of this complex industry has many challenges. Hospitality and tourism educators are charged with effectively meeting such demands. This extended abstract outlines the particular issues and challenges for education and training in hospitality, tourism and culinary arts and proposes that the development of Occupational and Professional Standards would facilitate the development of industry relevant curriculum. While the focus on Irish higher education discourse {{in recent years has been}} dominated by the needs of the knowledge economy, as supported and facilitated through STEM disciplines, recent government initiatives have also recognised the role of tourism in the provision of employment in the regions (Department of Transport Tourism and Sport, 2015). The review of apprentice training in Ireland has identified new disciplines to be added to the portfolio of programmes, and have included the areas of hospitality and tourism. The Expert Group for Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) has extended its research to the tourism industry through the tendering of a project on future skills needs for the sector. While the initial remit was on the provision of programmes at “Levels 4 & 5, with progression to Level 6 ” (Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Research Tender Document, 2015), identifying a gap in hospitality and tourism education at the lower end of the academic spectrum, it has become clear that the range of activities in tourism education are far broader and more complex than identified by the DJEI for inclusion in the research. This is understandable given the focus of industry representative bodies on the entry level culinary positions in policy discourse. However, both initiatives appear to underestimate the important and significant contribution that the Higher Education sector make to the provision of skilled personnel for the industry, as well as the executive education and research provided by these same institutions. An alternative proposal for research and collaboration was previously initiated by the IoT sector, following discussions with Education and Training Boards (further education), Institutes Of Technology Ireland, Qualifications & Quality Ireland and Fáilte Ireland in Killybegs in November 2013. This proposal involved a review of programme provision across a range Level 3 – 9. QQI have prepared a position paper to provide a framework for discussion. Ó hAnnracháin (2011) has critically evaluated the significant transformations which tourism education (hospitality, tourism and culinary arts) has undergone during the last decade. Since 2009, all full-time vocational education programmes offered in the Institute of Technology (IoT) sector at Level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ) have migrated to higher education programmes, with application routes via the Central Applications Office (CAO) system. Following this move, alternative vocational programmes have been proposed and supported by industry and educators alike. These programmes currently or will soon form the remit of AONTAS (adult education), Education and Training Boards, SOLAS (formerly FÁS) and the new Apprenticeship Council, as well as continuing provision through the IoT sector. The changes have occurred on an ad hoc basis, resulting in a complex and convoluted system. This structure does not provide a clear framework of the knowledge, skills and competencies that graduates of the various programmes, at Level 3 – 9 on the NFQ, should be able to demonstrate in the workplace. This lack of clarity poses particular problems for industry when recruiting staff and assessing their level of qualifications for positions within organisations. As noted by Wang and Tsai (2014) there may also be a gap between the actual competencies of hospitality graduates and the expectations held by industry professionals. Quality education and training programmes should be directly linked to the needs of the workplace and the overall economy. Occupational standards can make a major contribution to the design of such programmes. Currently there are no National Occupational Standards for the hospitality industry in Ireland. Quality and Qualifications Ireland (2013) has acknowledged that there is a dearth of occupational standards in Ireland and that a new and more coherent national approach to occupational standards is needed. QQI, in a 2014 position paper for the sector also believe that the Culinary Arts, Hospitality, and Tourism fields would benefit from the establishment of a system of agreed standards and guidelines concerning educational qualifications and occupations. Occupational standards for the hospitality and tourism industries have been established in many jurisdictions (e. g. the UK, Canada and Australia). The EQF Project (2008) has examined international best practice examples of national occupational standards within the context of adapting educational standards towards European Qualifications Framework compatibility. The establishment of occupational standards, enabling comparisons between nations would be a significant advancement towards <b>transparency</b> <b>of</b> <b>qualifications</b> within Europe. The rationale for developing occupational standards has been postulated by Fretwell, Lewis and Deij (2001), amongst others. Such standards are regarded as “an essential link between workplace employment requirements and human capital development” (ibid: 3). There are significant advantages for all stakeholders in the adoption of National Occupational Standards. The numerous benefits include clarity, benchmarking, acknowledgement of best practice, transparency, consultation and increased productivity. This paper argues the need to develop occupational standards as a mechanism for the creation of a hospitality and tourism training and education framework. The identification and establishment of a framework of occupational standards would allow educational institutes to develop curricula that would then match with industry’s expectations on a consistent basis. This study will follow the position outlined by QQI, who stated in their 2014 position paper for the sector, that the three fields of culinary arts, hospitality and tourism present different kinds of challenges from a qualifications system’s perspective. Culinary Arts is a relatively self-contained discipline whereas Tourism is multi-disciplinary and the Hospitality field is intermediate on this spectrum. It is imperative that occupational standards are developed which are discipline specific, for example culinary arts as opposed to generic tourism industry occupational standards. Zopiatis (2010) contends that culinary arts, despite its importance is vastly under researched in terms of competencies. This research is timely given the national policy on the creation of regional education clusters (HEA, 2011, 2014) where collaboration between the various education and training bodies is required to provide a coherent education system of tertiary education in Ireland. It is clear from the extant literature that a collaborative approach between industry, academia and other stakeholders is required to ensure the sustainable development of education programmes, across a variety of levels, results in an effective and efficient system that is fit for purpose. The next stage of this project will outline a development path in terms of the establishment of occupational standards for hospitality and tourism practitioners and educators focusing in the first instance on Culinary Arts...|$|E
40|$|The Bologna {{process is}} {{intended}} to culminate {{in the formation of}} the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) by 2010. Its aim is to facilitate the mobility <b>of</b> people, the <b>transparency</b> and recognition <b>of</b> <b>qualifications,</b> quality and development of a European dimension to higher education, and the attractiveness of European institutions for third country students. This paper provides an overview of progress towards implementation in EHEA member states using official documents and interview data from faculty teaching computing in countries represented at the ITiCSE 2006 meeting. The key areas where the structures established by the Bologna process are problematic for computing education arise from the rapidly changing nature of the curriculum. It seems that the maturity and capability criteria, as well as the manner in which learning outcomes are specified, being developed within the Bologna process are too general. This endangers the properties <b>of</b> <b>transparency</b> and mobility that the process intends to promote. Progression and prerequisite knowledge in computing degrees can be very specific. For instance, generic learning outcomes for an introductory programming course quite rightly will not specify the programming language, or languages, used to implement algorithms. However, suppose a student intends to study an advanced algorithms and data structures course in which Java is the language of implementation which has an introductory course in programming as a prerequisite. If the introductory course language was Standard ML it is not clear that the prerequisite course actually provides the student with a suitable background. These types of complexities are typical of computing, where early subject curricula are not standardised nationally or internationally, and create significant hurdles for realising the Bologna objectives...|$|R

On the one hand a role model was developed to define a set of roles for the whole software development cycle using technical, methodical, social and media competencies and declaring degrees <b>of</b> <b>qualification</b> necessary to fill a role. On the other hand the process of planning a project has been enhanced. A future project is analysed and defined by project characteristics. These project characteristics demand certain employees' skills which can be mapped to the skills defined for the roles and therefore roles necessary for the project can be derived. We can now select the most suited employee for the role and hereby have an applicable mechanism to select the members of a project team. Furthermore the activities assigned to a role are defined already in the project planning phase and most importantly these activities and the skills are transparent to all project team members and actually to the whole company. Besides this, necessary training demands can easily be determined...|$|R

The results allow us to observe an improvement between 2015 and 2016, as well as the dierences between what they proclaim in their electoral programs and the reality of their portals <b>of</b> <b>transparency.</b> ...|$|R
