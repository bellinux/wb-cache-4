40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to seek a way to improve the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> crack forces in {{concrete}} using fibre technology. When straight fibres are added to a concrete mix, the direction of the fibres can be influenced by the mould, balling together and random orientation. This may result in a smaller percentage of fibres being effective when compared to that which it was originally designed for, when coping with post crack forces in concrete. The closed loop fibre technology is designed to place the fibres in an orientation and position where they will be of most benefit, thus reducing the likelihood of having fibres in concrete where they will not be of structural benefit and as a result of this, they will maximise the engineering qualities of the fibre addition. Beams were manufactured with a fixed addition of fibres by weight, and then they were tested for toughness (energy absorption) using a three point test, recording load and deflection. As an additional measure of the beams ability to absorb energy, a drop hammer test was used to analyse the energy absorbed and the total impact energy dissipated. The findings showed a significant improvement in performance when closed loop fibres were used, when compared to an equal dose of straight steel fibres. This work is significant in that the closed loop fibres are not commercially available at this present time and this research assists in a new product development. Closed loop fibres use lower amounts of steel than straight fibres for an equivalent performance to be achieved. They therefore have sustainability credentials with regard to carbon footprint and use of raw materials in construction and building...|$|R

40|$|Aim We {{set out to}} {{determine}} the potential contribution of community pharmacists to improve the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> care of patients from secondary to primary care settings. Method We systematically reviewed the literature on interventions that involved community pharmacy post discharge. We considered all relevant studies, including both randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, irrespective of patient population. Our primary outcome was any impact on patient and medication outcomes, while the secondary outcome was to identify intervention characteristics that influenced all reported outcomes. Results We retrieved 14 studies that met our inclusion criteria. There were four studies reporting outcomes relating to the identification and rectification of medication errors that were significantly improved with community pharmacy involvement. Other patient outcomes such as medication adherence and clinical control were not unanimously positively or negatively influenced via the inclusion of community pharmacy in a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> care <b>post</b> discharge intervention. Some inconsistencies in implementation and process evaluation of interventions were found across the reviewed studies; this limited the accuracy with which true impact could be considered. Conclusions There is evidence that interventions including a community pharmacist can improve drug related problems after discharge, however, impact on other outcomes is not consistent. Further studies are required which include process evaluations to fully describe {{the context of the}} intervention so as to better determine any influencing factors. Also applying more stringent controls and closer adherence to protocols in both intervention and control groups would allow clearer correlations to be made between the intervention and the outcomes...|$|R

50|$|In his {{new role}} as the deputy {{commissioner}} in Ahmedabad, Sharma was asked to assist the Crime Branch of Ahmedabad in investigating the Gulberg Society and Naroda Patiya cases. Noting the allegations of complicity by police officers and political leaders in the riots, he suggested that their mobile phone records be examined to ascertain their movements. Accordingly, mobile phone 'call data records' (CDR) were requested from the local phone companies AT&T Wireles and CelForce. The Crime Branch chief, P. P. Pandey, asked Sharma to process the data himself since it was his idea, which required him to copy the data onto his home computer. Before he could complete the processing, Sharma was <b>transferred</b> out <b>of</b> his <b>post</b> again, in early July. He said that he handed over the CD's containing the data to Pandey through a messenger, but they became untraceable afterwards. Several years after the event, the Gujarat government claimed that Sharma did not submit the CDs and charged him with misconduct.|$|R
