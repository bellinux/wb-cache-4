5|$|DAB+ is a {{major upgrade}} to DAB, widely used in other {{countries}} in Europe. It was first tested in the United Kingdom in 2013 before regular services were launched in 2016.

Estimates given by multiplex operator Switch Digital suggests that a third of radio sets in 2016 were DAB+ compatible.|$|E

5|$|State Route 125 (SR 125) is a {{state highway}} in the US state of California. As a freeway, it runs from Otay Mesa Road (former SR 905) in Otay Mesa near the U.S.–Mexico border to SR 52 in Santee. SR 125 serves as an {{additional}} north–south route in the San Diego metropolitan area, also connecting SR 54, SR 94, and Interstate 8 (I-8). The definition of the route continues to SR 56, but this portion has not been constructed, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> to do so.|$|E
5|$|The lower-level express platforms, while {{built with}} the rest of the station, were only {{operated}} between 1968 and 1976 when express service was operated along the line. They were permanently removed from service in 1992, and support facilities were added to the platforms. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> to restore express service to the station, even with the proposed introduction of rush-hour F express service on the IND Culver Line in fall 2017 (see below).|$|E
5|$|It {{was planned}} that SR67 {{would be the}} eastern {{terminus}} of SR56. On December30, 1980, the City of Poway included SR56 in the city plan extending east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR56 to SR67, although the City of Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in the city. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> to construct the portion of SR56 east of I-15. Several arterial roads connect {{the eastern end of}} the SR56 freeway with SR67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (CRS5), and Poway Road (CRS4).|$|E

5|$|Passenger {{services}} at the station declined following the Second World War, and the Beeching Report recommended the complete closure of the Portishead line. Passenger {{services at}} Clifton Bridge ended on 7 September 1964, with goods services following on 5 July 1965, although the line saw occasional traffic until 1981. Most of the station was demolished, leaving some remains of the platforms, a retaining wall and the footbridge. Regular freight trains through the station began to run again in 2002 when Royal Portbury Dock {{was connected to the}} rail network. The line is due to be reopened to passenger traffic in 2019 as part of MetroWest, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> to reopen the station.|$|E

5|$|The route {{originally}} {{ended at}} Route 27 {{at the border}} between Highland Park and New Brunswick, but was extended northward to then-County Route 514 Spur (CR514 Spur), now CR622, in 1983. The freeway through New Brunswick was constructed during the 1980s over the Delaware and Raritan Canal. Route 18 was further extended to Hoes Lane in Piscataway in 2004 and presently ends at I-287 in Piscataway. The route south of exit 6A in Wall was also originally intended to extend to the Brielle Circle and terminate at Route 34, Route 35, and Route 70 but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> to do so currently.|$|E

5|$|The Anthony Roll was {{originally}} {{a set of}} three separate vellum rolls. It exists today {{in the form of}} a bound volume containing the first and third rolls while the second roll is preserved in its original form. The three original rolls were made up out of a total of 17 individual membranes glued to the back of the next membrane. The membranes were of a width of 70cm (27 ½ inches) and a height varying from 79 to 96cm (31 to 37 ¾ inches). After receiving the first and third rolls Pepys had his clerks cut the rolls up and bound in a single volume as a book, now known as Pepys 2991. The transformation of the two rolls created a horizontal page structure, and some of the ornamentation that was cut in process was copied into the volume by hand. Pepys also inserted abstracts between the two rolls and a summarizing table that was not Anthony's, but pre-dated Pepys' binding of the rolls. This radical treatment of the original document has damaged some of the illustrations and is today deprecated. The first three illustrations of the Henry Grace à Dieu, Mary Rose and Peter Pomegranate were all too large to fit on one page and were therefore converted to two-page spreads. The resulting bend down the centre of the illustrations led to noticeable loss of detail. Despite this, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>plans</b> to attempt a recreation of the original structure of the first and third rolls. The second roll, British Library Additional MS 22047, is still in its original condition with the exception of a written endorsement by Mary Fox from 1857 and some damage caused by an application of chemicals to reveal faded writing.|$|E
