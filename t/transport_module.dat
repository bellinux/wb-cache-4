5000|$|The Scarab STM (Sport <b>Transport</b> <b>Module)</b> was a 3-wheeled car {{designed}} and manufactured, in the United States of America, around 1975. The car was manufactured by Fiberfab, a company founded by Warren [...] "Bud" [...] Goodwin. The vehicle was a reverse trike design utilizing VW Beetle front suspension {{married to a}} rear motorcycle running gear. The scarab is considered the most rare of the Fiberfab line, with unconfirmed reports that only 6 were ever produced.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic unit}} of framing in SDH is a STM-1 (Synchronous <b>Transport</b> <b>Module,</b> level 1), which {{operates}} at 155.520 {{megabits per second}} (Mbit/s). SONET refers to this basic unit as an STS-3c (Synchronous Transport Signal 3, concatenated). When the STS-3c is carried over OC-3, it is often colloquially referred to as OC-3c, {{but this is not}} an official designation within the SONET standard as there is no physical layer (i.e. optical) difference between an STS-3c and 3 STS-1s carried within an OC-3.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Transport</b> <b>Module</b> is {{equipped}} with two propulsion systems: a solar electric ion drive engine and a standard bipropellant chemical propulsion system using MMHMON3. The chemical propulsion system {{will be used for}} Earth escape and then it will be pyrotechnically isolated, and the solar electric ion engine will take over for the cruise phase. The twin QinetiQ T6 ion thrusters operate at maximum combined throttle of 290 mN. The MTM supplies electrical power for the two hibernating orbiters as well as for its solar electric propulsion system.|$|E

50|$|The fifth {{season of}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles aired in 1991. First being {{located on the}} Volcanic Asteroid in Dimension X where it {{remained}} throughout season 4, {{for most of this}} season, the Technodrome is frozen at the North Pole. The <b>transport</b> <b>modules</b> from season 3 are reused, this time to drill underneath Canada and into New York City.|$|R
50|$|Season 1 (1987):With the Technodrome located under New York City during season 1, {{there is}} no need for {{independent}} <b>transport</b> <b>modules.</b> In the episode A Thing About Rats, the Shredder uses a kind of transport elevator which extends, but remains connected to, the Technodrome. This type is also used in the arcade game and the Archie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Adventures comics.|$|R
50|$|The BA 2100, or Olympus, is a {{conceptual}} {{design for a}} larger, heavier, and more capable expandable space station module, or interplanetary human <b>transport</b> <b>module,</b> by Bigelow Aerospace. The larger BA 2100 would extend the volume and capabilities of the BA 330 module, which is under development {{as part of the}} Bigelow Commercial Space Station. As with the BA 330 module, the number in the name refers to the number of cubic meters of space offered by the module when fully expanded in space.|$|E
50|$|Lockheed Martin has {{proposed}} the Jupiter space tug, to {{be derived from}} designs of two earlier Lockheed Martin spacecraft—Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution Mission and the Juno—as well as a robotic arm from MDA derived from technology used on Canadarm, the robotic arm technology previously used on the Space Shuttle. In addition to the Jupiter space tug itself, the Lockheed concept includes the use of a new 4.4 m-diameter cargo <b>transport</b> <b>module</b> called Exoliner for carrying cargo to the ISS. Exoliner is based on the earlier ESA-developed Automated Transfer Vehicle, and is to be jointly developed with Thales Alenia Space.|$|E
50|$|The Synchronous <b>Transport</b> <b>Module,</b> level 1 (STM-1) {{frame is}} the basic {{transmission}} format for SDH—the first level of the synchronous digital hierarchy. The STM-1 frame is transmitted in exactly 125 µs, therefore, there are 8,000 frames per second on a 155.52 Mbit/s OC-3 fiber-optic circuit. The STM-1 frame consists of overhead and pointers plus information payload. The first nine columns of each frame make up the section overhead and administrative unit pointers, and the last 261 columns make up the information payload. The pointers (H1, H2, H3 bytes) identify administrative units (AU) within the information payload. Thus, an OC-3 circuit can carry 150.336 Mbit/s of payload, after accounting for the overhead.|$|E
50|$|SDH {{has become}} the primary {{transmission}} protocol in most PSTN networks. It was developed to allow streams 1.544 Mbit/s and above to be multiplexed, {{in order to create}} larger SDH frames known as Synchronous <b>Transport</b> <b>Modules</b> (STM). The STM-1 frame consists of smaller streams that are multiplexed to create a 155.52 Mbit/s frame. SDH can also multiplex packet based frames e.g. Ethernet, PPP and ATM.|$|R

5000|$|During season 3 of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon, the Technodrome {{is located}} at the Earth's core, and <b>transport</b> <b>modules</b> are used to drill up to the streets. This season also {{features}} the episode [...] "Turtles at the Earth's Core", with a deep underground cave where dinosaurs live, and a crystal of energy that works like the Sun to keep the dinosaurs alive.As Krang, Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady steal the crystal to power the Technodrome, the trouble begins.|$|R
50|$|The staff then {{revealed}} {{their plan}} to the recruit: the evacuation plan involved construction of an advanced space teleporter. However, there were problems with the <b>transport</b> <b>module</b> {{and it did not}} function properly. The scientists theorised that they can get what they need by stealing the UCS' teleportation technology. The UCS started to abandon their European bases and withdraw to America. Their central computer, GOLAN, monitored all transmissions, so they had to act quickly and stealthily. They managed to sneak in a force into America from Portugal, but not without problems. The UCS was seemingly aware of their plans, evidenced by a massive attack in Portugal and the fact that their troops were gathering near the LC landing site.|$|E
5000|$|On May 21, 2008, the gas liquid {{separator}} pump failed on the 7-year-old toilet in Zvezda, although {{the solid waste}} portion was still functioning. The crew attempted to replace various parts, {{but was unable to}} repair the malfunctioning part. In the interim, they used a manual mode for urine collection. [...] The crew had other options: to use the toilet on the Soyuz <b>transport</b> <b>module</b> (which only has capacity for a few days of use) or to use urine-collection bags as needed. A replacement pump was sent from Russia in a diplomatic pouch so that Space Shuttle Discovery could take it to the station as part of mission STS-124 on June 2.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the latest results {{for a new}} kind of {{continuous}} conveyor, which consists of small-scale, multi-directional <b>transport</b> <b>modules</b> [12]. Each of these modules is considerably smaller than the packets and can convey in any direction. If a large number of these modules are combined into a matrix, the emerging network solves transport tasks through cooperation of the modules. The resulting conveyor system is able to perform tasks such as transporting, rotating, separating and merging as well as buffering and sequencing [7]. In this article, the mechanical realization and algorithms for controlling the modules are shown.|$|R
40|$|Most sunrise {{industries}} in production {{have at least}} one thing in common: More and more of their products are becoming smaller and smaller. Quite often too small for existing manufacturing concepts and plants. "AMMS" is a new concept designed for the versatile small lot fabrication typical for microproduction. Its heart is a miniaturized modular kit concept which allows to quickly generate many different process sequences for a number of different applications. Using standardized media interfaces all process-, handling- and <b>transport</b> <b>modules</b> can be integrated on a common platform concept. They can be configurated as well as monitored by one central control system...|$|R
