Dozens of clandestine saloons opened, fueled by barrels of illicit liquor, often transported by railroad. Tillman appointed dispensary constables, who tried to seize such shipments, to be frustrated {{by the fact that}} the South Carolina Railroad was in federal receivership, and state authorities could not confiscate goods entrusted <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> of Tillman's constables were white, placing him at a disadvantage in dealing with the alcohol trade among African Americans. Some of the constables tried going undercover by blacking their faces like minstrels; later, Tillman hired an African-American detective from Georgia.|$|E

25|$|The Jews {{suffered}} much {{during the}} great conquests of Moulay Rashid, who united the separate parts of Morocco into one single state, and wished to add <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> northwest Africa. According to Chénier, when Al-Raschid took the city of Marrakech in 1670, at {{the desire of the}} inhabitants he caused the Jewish counselor and governor of the ruling prince Abu Bakr, together with the latter and his whole family, to be publicly burned, in order to inspire terror among the Jews. He also tore down the synagogues of the city, expelled many Jews from the Berber region of Sus and treated them tyrannically. His demands on the Jews in the way of taxes were enormous; he had them collected by Joshua ben Hamoshet, a rich Jew, to whom he was under obligations for various services and whom he appointed chief over the Jews. He even ordered the Jews to supply wine to the Christian slaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} {{of the war in}} Europe in September 1939 did not immediately affect the status of the Armée de l’Air in French Indochina because it had the task of defending a wide area of Southeast Asia, including the future Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. And yet its array of airplanes seemed inadequate to perform any kind of real defense against any incursion by an enemy, because there were less than 100 airplanes available <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> obsolescent or obsolete. In September 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria. This was an area of northeast China, which encompassed the provinces of Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang. Nearly six whole years later, in July 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War had begun. As yet, the French colonial authorities were hoping that the Japanese would not be brazen enough to take on the might of a European power. However, it became increasingly likely after the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, since Japan was part of the Axis alliance and thus Germany’s ally.|$|E

500|$|Elaine Jordan argues, in her 1988 {{analysis}} of Tennyson's works, that the poem's depiction of [...] "self-infolding [...] is a negation which involves the drawing-in of forces in order perhaps to assert the self differently. Mariana {{is the most}} powerful expression, very early, of such a moment, though its assertiveness exists only as strong gloom in image and rhythm, not as narrative possibility except in the desire for an end <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> preferred over patience." [...] In 2002, Ruth Glancy writes, [...] "In the last stanza, Mariana's grip on the present is loosening, and Tennyson's mastery of sound and images is evident (even in this early poem) in his description of the house that echoes her utter desolation". Anna Barton, in her 2008 analysis, declares Mariana [...] "the most famous heroine of the 1830 volume" [...] and that both The Ballad of Oriana and [...] "Mariana" [...] are [...] "poems of greater substance that develop the poetic that Tennyson begins to establish in his briefer songs." ...|$|E
500|$|On Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, [...] "Lovers in Japan" [...] {{transitions}} seamlessly into {{a second}} track entitled [...] "Reign of Love". In an interview with Q magazine, bassist Guy Berryman explained that the band could not {{make up their minds}} about the track listing, as they had discussed that they wanted to keep the album concise with a total of ten tracks and an intended length of under 42 minutes. Champion further stated, [...] "We just preferred to have less titles and more stuff. The album as a whole has got the most on it, but it’s the shortest. We wanted to make it almost impossible for you to not listen <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in one go."

[...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that the real triumph was Ocean's song structure: [...] "verses and hooks collapse onto each other, rhymes pop up out of nowhere, and the singer acts like minutely balancing a 10-minute concept piece is no big deal." [...] Chris Richards of The Washington Post Company described the track as a [...] "righteous funk opus that spans nearly 10 minutes", commented that it [...] "is loaded with metaphorical riddles, drawing parallels between Cleopatra and a 21st-century prostitute.

500|$|Howard {{originally}} envisioned Maximus as the [...] "ultimate super-cop", jokingly {{referring to}} the character as [...] "the Tommy Lee Jones of horses". Attempting to make Maximus feel like a [...] "fresh" [...] character, the filmmakers researched several historical horses from both animated and live-action films {{to ensure that the}} character would be unique and different enough from his predecessors. Greno explained that [...] "Maximus ... could have easily slipped into the category of, 'Oh, I've seen that before.'" [...] To prevent this, the filmmakers referenced [...] "a board with photos of all the different animated horses that had been done". Howard explained that Maximus was originally conceived as a [...] "pretty serious" [...] character, but eventually developed into a funnier and more likeable horse as the animators continued to draw him with dog-like attributes. Both Pascal and Maximus, who according to the Austin American-Statesman are responsible for providing the film with the majority of its comic relief, were eventually written into the film by screenwriter Dan Fogelman. Analyzing the characters' roles in the film, HitFix observed that [...] "There's a simplicity <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> that I admire, and you throw in a few anthropomorphized animals so everyone laughs a lot, and that's the Disney recipe".

[...] Coghill himself has described himself as a [...] "superhero". He has also stated that he shares the band's hatred of band photos. Coghill says he shares the stereotype of drummers being the most [...] "out there" [...] member of the band. He says this is true because [...] "We have so much energy...We’re stuck up the back and we’re more likely to do stupid shit to get rid of it." [...] In 2008, Coghill studied a mixture of politics and law at Griffith University. He is currently a journalist for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.|$|E
500|$|... "Something New" [...] was {{recorded}} in May 2012 and produced by Girls Aloud's long-time collaborator Brian Higgins. The uptempo dance song and was written in A major with a time signature in common time and a tempo of 115 beats per minute. [...] "Something New" [...] opens with Cole and Nadine Coyle singing [...] "Go, girls, g-g-go, go, go / We girls gonna take control / You boys better know, know, know / We girls gonna run this show" [...] over a piano melody. According to The Sun contributor Alison Maloney, [...] "after a generic dance beat kicks in, {{the rest of the}} track is a mish-mash of rap and mixed solos." [...] As the chorus begins, the five girls join together and sing, [...] "All I want is something new / Something I can hold on to / I don’t wanna talk / I just wanna dance / Baby let it drop / Catch me if you can." [...] Maloney deemed that the moment where the track's style returns [...] "to the more recognisable Girls Aloud sound." [...] It ends with the group shouting, [...] "Boy you better watch your back / Cause we're the leaders of the pack." [...] A reviewer for Heat notice similarities to David Guetta productions and compared it to songs by Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga. Michael Cragg of The Guardian compared the verse's structure to the one of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] (2007), and thought that [...] "Something New" [...] echoed the group's previous single, [...] "Something Kinda Ooooh" [...] (2006), {{not only because of the}} title, [...] "but it also has the same slightly demented feel <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> distorted backing vocals, strange rap sections and a brilliantly effortless chorus that soars out of an amazing bridge bit." [...] Most critics also had a similar perception to Cragg regarding the song's [...] "odd" [...] structure, which is noted as [...] "typical" [...] and the group's [...] "signature style".|$|E
