25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E
500|$|Cohn and Levithan's novel {{contained}} many musical references, including {{songs by}} The Cure and Green Day, as did Scafaria's screenplay, which she originally submitted {{with a mix}} CD featuring her ideas for the film's soundtrack, including songs by The Black Keys, Bloc Party, and Frou Frou. In the final cut of the film, however, most of the music was chosen by Sollett, editor Myron Kerstein and music supervisor Linda Cohen. Sollett said that he [...] "got lucky" [...] with the songs {{that he was able}} to choose because, within the financiers and the studio, [...] "there was nobody in that group who knew all that much about music or the music <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the film". His objective when selecting the music was to find [...] "the best music you haven't heard yet", primarily from bands based in New York City. While filming in New York, he emailed songs [...] "right out of my iTunes [...] " [...] which he thought would suit particular scenes to Kerstein, who was in Los Angeles assembling the film as it was shot.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 June 2010, {{following}} England's {{departure from}} the 2010 FIFA World Cup competition in South Africa, the UK's Culture and Sport Secretary Jeremy Hunt praised the England fans for their behaviour during the competition, saying [...] "I mean, not a single arrest for a football-related offence, and the terrible problems <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> Heysel and Hillsborough in the 1980s seem now to be behind us." [...] He later apologised and said [...] "I know that fan unrest played no part in the terrible events of April 1989 and I apologise to Liverpool fans and {{the families of those}} killed and injured in the Hillsborough disaster if my comments caused any offence." [...] Margaret Aspinall, chairperson of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, asked for a face to face meeting with Hunt before deciding if she would accept the apology.|$|E

6000|$|I {{remember}} a clock of this latter type, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> {{the house when}} I was a boy, routing us all up at three o'clock one winter's morning. We had finished breakfast at ten minutes to four, and I got to school a little after five, {{and sat down on}} the step outside and cried, because I thought the world had come to an end; everything was so death-like! ...|$|E
60|$|Although I {{remember}} this conversation now, {{my head was}} in confusion at the time, and my power of attention hardly did more than enable me to understand that he entered into these particulars to divert me. With the same kind intention, manifestly, he often spoke to me of indifferent things, while his face was busy with the one object <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> view. He still pursued this subject as we turned in at the garden-gate.|$|E
60|$|Men whom I {{had never}} seen before shook me by the hand as if we were friends of long standing, and had much to say in praise of the past day's work. Doctor Warren {{seemingly}} made it his especial business to greet each of us in turn, and repeated again and again that he was not surprised because of our having shown ourselves men, since he knew the day we carried his message to Lexington <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> us the making of soldiers.|$|E

"He {{says that}} it is delicious, but {{suddenly}} he has remembered what I too forgot, that the doctor at Motril forbade us to touch wine for fear lest we should worsen the hurts <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the shipwreck.

[...] And taking up a jug of water that stood upon the table, he filled an empty cup with it and drank, then passed it to Peter, while the host looked at them sourly.|$|E
6000|$|That privates should obey, {{and that}} they should be smartly punished if they disobey, this one can {{understand}} very well. But to say obey for ever and ever--to say that Private John Styles is, by some physical disproportion, hopelessly inferior to Cornet Snooks--to say that Snooks shall have honors, epaulets, and a marble tablet if he dies, and that Styles shall fight his fight, and have his twopence a day, and when shot down shall be shovelled into a hole with other Styleses, and so forgotten; and to think <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> {{the course of the last}} war some 400,000 of these Styleses, and some 10,000, say, of the Snooks sort--Styles being by nature exactly as honest, clever, and brave as Snooks--and to think that the 400,000 should bear this, is the wonder! ...|$|E
60|$|There we have copied her: {{would to}} Heaven <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> some other matters! It is the fashion now {{to call her}} a despot: but unless every monarch is to be branded with that epithet whose power is not as {{circumscribed}} as Queen Victoria's is now, we ought rather to call her the most popular sovereign, obeyed of their own free will by the freest subjects which England has ever seen; confess the Armada fight to have been as great a moral triumph {{as it was a}} political one; and (now that our late boasting is a little silenced by Crimean disasters) inquire whether we have not something to learn from those old Tudor times, as to how to choose officials, how to train a people, and how to defend a country.|$|E

60|$|A {{hundred miles}} or so farther on these villages ceased and thenceforward we only {{encountered}} some nomads, little bushmen who lived on game which they shot with poisoned arrows. Once they attacked us and killed two of the Mazitu with those horrid arrows, against the venom of which no remedy <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> our medicine chest proved of any avail. On this occasion Savage exhibited his courage if not his discretion, for rushing out of our thorn fence, after missing a bushmen with both barrels {{at a distance of}} five yards--he was, I think, the worst shot I ever saw--he seized the little viper with his hands and dragged him back to camp. How Savage escaped with his life I do not know, for one poisoned arrow went through his hat and stuck in his hair and another just grazed his leg without drawing blood.|$|E
60|$|All {{the while}} I was {{bringing}} up the long arrears of play which I had not enjoyed in the toil-years at Dayton, {{and was trying to}} make my Spanish reading serve in the sports <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the woods and by the river. We were Moors and Spaniards almost as often as we were British and Americans, or settlers and Indians. I suspect that the large, mild boy, the son of a neighboring farmer, who mainly shared our games, had but a dim notion of what I meant by my strange people, but I did my best to enlighten him, and he helped me make a dream out of my life, and did his best to dwell in the region of unrealities where I preferably had my being; he was from time to time a Moor when I think he would rather have been a Mingo.|$|E
60|$|Immediately we halted; {{and though}} {{it was at a}} great distance, we fired, and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, {{following}} our shot full gallop, resolving to fall in among them sword in hand; for so our bold Scot that led us, directed. He was, indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with that vigour and bravery on this occasion, and yet with such a cool courage too, that I never saw any man in action fitter for command. As soon as we came up to them, we fired our pistols in their faces, and then drew; but they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable; the only stand any of them made was on our right, where three of them stood, and, by signs, called the rest to come back to them, having a kind of scimitar in their hands, and their bows hanging at their backs. Our brave commander, without asking any body to follow him, galloped up close to them, and with his fusil knocked one of them off his horse, killed the second with his pistol, and the third ran away; and thus ended our fight; but we had this misfortune attending it, viz. that all our mutton <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> chase got away. We had not a man killed or hurt; but, as for the Tartars, there were about five of them killed; how many were wounded, we knew not; but this we knew, that the other party was so frighted with the noise of our guns, that they fled, and never made any attempt upon us.|$|E
2500|$|Toronto Police Association President Mike McCormack {{said of the}} Danzig Street shooting: [...] "It {{changed the}} way we gather intelligence, do {{investigations}} and it really brought the whole issue of gang culture and some of the challenges <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>in</b> policing to the forefront." ...|$|R

60|$|But modern thought {{also hit}} my second human tradition. It {{went against the}} fairy feeling about strict limits and conditions. The one thing it loved to talk about was {{expansion}} and largeness. Herbert Spencer would have been greatly annoyed if any one had called him an imperialist, and therefore it is highly regrettable that nobody did. But he was an imperialist of the lowest type. He popularized this contemptible notion {{that the size of}} the solar system ought to over-awe the spiritual dogma of man. Why should a man surrender his dignity to the solar system any more than to a whale? If mere size proves that man is not the image of God, then a whale may be the image of God; a somewhat formless image; what one might call an impressionist portrait. It is quite futile to argue that man is small compared to the cosmos; for man was always small compared to the nearest tree. But Herbert Spencer, in his headlong imperialism, would insist <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> some way been conquered and annexed by the astronomical universe. He spoke about men and their ideals exactly as the most insolent Unionist talks about the Irish and their ideals. He turned mankind into a small nationality. And his evil influence can be seen even in the most spirited and honourable of later scientific authors; notably in the early romances of Mr. H.G.Wells. Many moralists have in an exaggerated way represented the earth as wicked. But Mr. Wells and his school made the heavens wicked. We should lift up our eyes to the stars from whence would come our ruin.|$|E
60|$|In {{the next}} place {{we are to}} observe, that among the many things which I brought out of the ship in the several voyages, which, as above mentioned, I made to it, I got several things of less value, but not all less useful to me, which I omitted setting down before; as in particular, pens, ink, and paper, several parcels in the captain's, mate's, gunner's, and carpenter's keeping, three or four compasses, some {{mathematical}} instruments, dials, perspectives, charts, and books of navigation; all which I huddled together, whether I might want them or no. Also I found three very good Bibles, which {{came to me in}} my cargo from England, and which I had packed up among my things; some Portuguese books also, and among them two or three popish prayer-books, and several other books; all which I carefully secured. And I must not forget, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> the ship a dog and two cats, of whose eminent history I may have occasion to say something in it's place; for I carried both the cats with me; and as for the dog, he jumped out of the ship of himself, and swam on shore to me the day after I went on shore with my first cargo, and was a trusty servant to me many years; I wanted nothing that he could fetch me, nor any company that he could make up to me; I only wanted to have him talk to me, but that he could not do. As I observed before, I found pen, ink, and paper, and I husbanded them to the utmost; and I shall shew, that while my ink lasted, I kept things very exact; but after that was gone I could not, for I could not make any ink by any means that I could devise.|$|E
60|$|This fancy {{example is}} alphabetically and indeed artificially simple; but, having {{used it for}} convenience, I could easily give similar {{examples}} not of fancy but of fact. I had occasion recently to attend the Christmas festivity of a club in London for the exiles {{of one of the}} Scandinavian nations. When I entered the room the first thing that struck my eye, and greatly raised my spirits, was that the room was dotted with the colours of peasant costumes and the specimens of peasant craftsmanship. There were, of course, other costumes and other crafts in evidence; there were men dressed like myself (only better) in the garb of the modern middle classes; there was furniture like the furniture of any other room in London. Now, according to the ideal formula of the ordinary internationalist, these things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>in</b> common ought to have moved me to a sense of the kinship of all civilisation. I ought to have felt that as the Scandinavian gentleman wore a collar and tie, and I also wore a collar and tie, we were brothers and nothing could come between us. I ought to have felt that we were standing for the same principles of truth because we were wearing the same pair of trousers; or rather, to speak with more precision, similar pairs of trousers. Anyhow, the pair of trousers, that cloven pennon, ought to have floated in fancy over my head as the banner of Europe or the League of Nations. I am constrained to confess that no such rush of emotions overcame me; and the topic of trousers did not float across my mind at all. So far as those things were concerned, I might have remained in a mood of mortal enmity, and cheerfully shot or stabbed the best dressed gentleman in the room. Precisely what did warm my heart with an abrupt affection for that northern nation was the very thing that is utterly and indeed lamentably lacking in my own nation. It was something corresponding to the one great gap in English history, corresponding to the one great blot on English civilisation. It was the spiritual presence of a peasantry, dressed according to its own dignity, and expressing itself by its own creations.|$|E

60|$|In {{some parts}} of this interminable forest, where the light breaks through the foliage, we see {{suspended}} from the trees the wonderful air-plants or orchids.
