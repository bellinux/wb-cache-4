5|$|All <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> {{cases of}} {{homotopy}} groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E
5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

Located close to Sera and facing south, {{it has a}} yellow retreat house which was built first for the Tsongkhapa. <b>The</b> <b>interesting</b> story of this house is that a local 'site-spirit' (gzhi bdag) used to visit Tsongkhapa through a narrow window in the house. Tsong kha pa’s mural image is seen here on the wall, which is {{credited}} with special powers as an “image that speaks” or known as speaking-statue (gsung byon ma). It was Tsongkhapa's favourite hermitage where he spent substantial time and composed his magnamopus, the “Great Commentary on the Prajñāmūla (Rtsa shes Dīk chen). He also taught here.

5|$|The game's setting {{received}} positive responses. Carter {{thought that}} the verticality nature of the game's map created obstacles for players when they were traveling between places. However, he praised <b>the</b> <b>interesting</b> lore and wildlife found within the world, {{as well as the}} game's long draw distance. Harmon had similar comments, praising the game's graphics and Kyrat's culture. Harmon {{thought that the}} hilly landscape of the game's world gave players a sense of exploration, and hence made traversal enjoyable. Wilson thought, however, that the game's setting was not as compelling as the tropical setting of Far Cry 3. Nevertheless, she praised the Shangri-la section, which she thought had changed the game's landscape drastically. Matt Bertz from Game Informer praised the game's setting, which he thought was vibrant, varied and rich. Ludwig Kietzmann from Joystiq praised the content found within the world, and thought that the world itself was absorbing and interesting.|$|E
