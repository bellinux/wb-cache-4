5|$|His {{body was}} cut down {{after an hour}} by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's {{trousers}} and stockings according to his rights. The body was taken back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the doors were shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E
5|$|Once he is released, Samuel {{returns to}} his {{ministry}} and attempts to heal {{a woman in a}} wheelchair. However, she suffers a seizure and dies, which leads to Samuel's second arrest. An autopsy reveals the woman died of cyanide poisoning, whilst Mulder and Scully find evidence that the swarm of locusts, which were actually common grasshoppers, was guided by someone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> through the building's ventilation system. Mulder believes Samuel to be innocent. However, the local sheriff, Maurice Daniels, allows two of his men to beat Samuel to death in his cell.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Post Office and Courthouse {{occupies}} the entire block bounded by Seventh and Grant {{streets and the}} Pennsylvania Railroad. The most significant exterior elevation faces Grant Street and contains <b>the</b> primary entrance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms</b> and offices.|$|R

5|$|The inquest into Sandra Rivett's death {{opened on}} 13November 1974 and {{was led by}} the Coroner for Inner West London, Gavin Thurston. Two {{witnesses}} were called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> which was packed with reporters; Roger Rivett, who confirmed that he had identified his wife's body, and the pathologist, Keith Simpson, who confirmed that Rivett had died from being hit {{on the head with}} a blunt instrument. At Ranson's request, the hearing was then adjourned. Further adjournments were made on 11December 1974 and 10March 1975, before a full inquest was scheduled for 16June 1975.|$|E
5|$|When Berkman {{was brought}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> on September19, {{the jury had}} already been empaneled. The {{district}} attorney had selected the jury without allowing Berkman to examine prospective jurors, and the judge had no objection to the unusual procedure. Berkman was charged with six counts: felonious assault {{with the intent to}} kill Frick; felonious assault with the intent to kill Lawrence Leishman, who had been in Frick's office {{at the time of the}} attack; feloniously entering the offices of the Carnegie Steel Company on three occasions; and unlawfully carrying concealed weapons. Berkman pleaded not guilty to all charges.|$|E
25|$|The {{east and}} west wings of {{the third floor of}} the {{courthouse}} are separated and unconnected due to the high ceiling of the main courtroom on the second floor beyond the courtroom's balcony. The east wing on both sides of the central stairway from the second floor leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> balcony are storage and mechanical spaces. The small stairway on the west wing from the second floor opens into a storage area with potential office usage. This area has an additional stairway leading into the building's attic and clock house tower. The floor is narrower than the courtroom on each end of the building and above the rooftop in all of the courthouse's corner quadrants.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Rîmaru {{was sentenced}} <b>to</b> death, with <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> erupting in applause when the penalty was pronounced. He appealed, but the Supreme Tribunal upheld the sentence.|$|R
25|$|On day one, Fritzl entered <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> {{attempting}} <b>to</b> {{hide his}} face from cameras behind a blue folder, {{which he was}} entitled to do under Austrian law. After opening comments, all journalists and spectators were asked <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> whereupon Fritzl lowered his binder. Fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges {{with the exception of}} murder and grievous assault by threatening to gas his captives if they disobeyed him.|$|R
50|$|By 2010 the {{courthouse}} had been remodeled and upgraded. It still lacked <b>the</b> capacity <b>to</b> accommodate large crowds. In 2009 actor Charlie Sheen {{was charged with}} several felonies after allegedly holding a knife <b>to</b> <b>the</b> throat of wife Brooke Mueller on Christmas Day in their rented Aspen home. In advance of his appearances at {{the courthouse}} in summer of that year, where he eventually pleaded guilty <b>to</b> a misdemeanor, <b>the</b> city and county imposed limitations on access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> courthouse and media presence in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> Judge James Boyd issued a Decorum Order limiting attendance at <b>the</b> hearings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom's</b> legal capacity of 60. The media was further limited to 20 seats, four of which were reserved for Aspen's local media and the remaining 16 allocated by lottery. He specifically alluded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building's age <b>to</b> justify those limitations.|$|R
25|$|Thomas Dodd was a {{prosecutor}} for the United States. There was an immense amount of evidence backing the prosecutors' case, especially since meticulous {{records of the}} Nazis' actions had been kept. There were records taken in by the prosecutors that had signatures from specific Nazis signing for everything from stationery supplies to Zyklon B gas, which was used to kill the inmates of the deathcamps. Thomas Dodd showed a series of pictures <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> after reading through the documents of crimes committed by the defendants. The showing consisted of pictures displaying the atrocities performed by the defendants. The pictures had been gathered when the inmates were liberated from the concentration camps.|$|E
25|$|In the {{epilogue}} {{the characters}} are taking Arthur to a 'quiet and idyllic planet' when they come across a half-mad journalist. He tells them {{that he was at}} a court case and a witness there was given too much of a truth drug and started to tell all truth, which was driving everybody there mad. They go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> in the hope of learning the question of Life, the Universe and Everything from him. They discover he is finished (there was little truth to tell) and he has forgotten it all, except that knowledge of the Ultimate Question and Ultimate Answer is mutually exclusive. He then attempts to tell Arthur where God's last message to His creation is, though dies seemingly before Arthur is able to memorise the location.|$|E
25|$|On 20 July 2007, Ramush Haradinaj's {{application}} for provisional release {{during the summer}} court recess was denied. He was granted a second exceptional provisional release over the Christmas court recess. The trial chamber rendered its decision on 3 April 2008; not guilty. Defenders of Haradinaj, Balaj and Lahi Brahimaj have not taken a single witness of the defence to the stand considering that unnecessary. The prosecution was unable to bring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> three planned witnesses. One of them was committed to a mental health institution {{at the time he}} was called to testify. Another, Shefqet Kabashi, refused to testify citing the OTP's failure to live up to the conditions set for his testimony. Haradinaj's full acquittal, however, was palled by whispers that witnesses had been intimidated. In fact, during the first trial two witnesses failed to attend and it was feared their evidence could have been determinative to the outcome.|$|E
50|$|The building's {{main entry}} {{is set in}} the middle of the front tower. After walking through the vestibule, one can turn {{immediately}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left and climb a staircase <b>to</b> <b>the</b> second-story <b>courtroom.</b> Extensive artwork is present in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> including murals of interactions between Indians and Americans during the county's earliest years, multiple oil paintings, and wood carvings, plus a dome with stained glass.|$|R
50|$|The U-shaped {{third floor}} has a light court which opens <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear. <b>The</b> <b>courtroom</b> is at <b>the</b> {{end of the}} west wing. At the center rear of the light court is the freight {{elevator}} penthouse. The roof along the north side is gabled and the roofs along the east wing {{and half of the}} west wing are truncated gables. The end of the east wing is hipped. <b>The</b> <b>courtroom,</b> located at <b>the</b> end of the west wing, has a flat roof. The second floor center light court extends down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first-floor skylights, and this roof is also flat.|$|R
50|$|The Old Supreme Court Chamber is {{the room}} {{on the ground floor}} of the North Wing of the United States Capitol.

25|$|The retry of Deck’s penalty phase {{began on}} April 29, 2003, {{where he was}} brought into court wearing shackles. The defense objected to Deck being visibly restrained, stating that Deck’s {{behavior}} did not justify shackles. The defense stated the only justification for shackling Deck {{would have been if}} he caused a disturbance in the courtroom. However, he did not. The defense also suggested other measures that the court could have taken to ensure safety instead of shackling Deck. These measures included adding extra security guards <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> and having the people who wanted to sit in the gallery walk through metal detectors. However, the defense’s objections were overruled. Deck’s attorneys once again objected during voir dire. Deck’s defense thought that asking jurors if the shackles biased them was not enough to ensure that Deck would receive reliable sentencing. The court overruled the objection again, stating “The objection that you’re making will be overruled. He has been convicted and will remain in legirons and belly chain.” The jury once again sentenced Deck to death.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{was used}} to frame the new areas of the {{building}} as the additions had to be sympathetic to but not similar to the original building exterior. To maintain {{the integrity of the}} original building, the brick exterior of the Old Courthouse was left undisturbed. Some leniencies were allowed in order for current building codes to be met; however, strict requirements, as set out by Alberta Historical Resources, were followed when it came to restoring and renovating the original courtroom, which now serves as Council Chambers. The wood panelling covering {{the lower half of the}} walls needed to remain intact, as did the original cast iron radiators (which now tie in to the geothermal heating and cooling system). The only changes made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> were the restoration of the wall paint to its original 1920 splendour and the installation of a new carpet. The result of this renovation was a fabulous new City Hall that provides both employees and citizens the opportunity to showcase this beautiful community structure.|$|E
500|$|Proceedings {{began on}} 28 October 1867, {{in front of}} Mr Justice Blackburne and Mr Justice Mellor. Twenty-six {{appeared}} in court {{on the first day}} in front of a grand jury, which found that there was a prima facie case against all of the defendants for murder, felony, and misdemeanour. It was decided to charge the five [...] "principal offenders"– Allen, Larkin, Gould (O'Brien), Shore (Condon), and Maguire– under one indictment. They were therefore brought back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> the following day, when their trial proper began, despite none of them having fired the fatal shot.|$|E
50|$|Inside the Courthouse {{additions}} and alterations {{have been}} generally less sensitive. The East Light Court has been enclosed at <b>the</b> first level <b>to</b> accommodate a new courtroom. A second large courtroom was added {{on the second}} floor at the west end, two floors below one of the two original courts. These spaces have no historical significance but are adequate and appropriate for their new use. Three other courts have been added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building, which are of insufficient size and deficient shape for their purpose. Except for the Clerk's Office, functions not directly tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Courtrooms</b> have been relocated to renovated spaces, lessening the logic and integrity of the building.|$|R

500|$|In {{response}} to questions posed by The Guardian and handed to the band via their lawyer, Pussy Riot accused Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church of orchestrating the case. Samutsevich said in December 2012 that [...] "more than anything, what many people didn't see during the trial were those moments when our 'right to defence' was violated. It's not that we were helpless, it was a situation of despair." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she continued: [...] "The trial was built {{in such a way}} that we couldn't defend ourselves. They didn't listen to us. We could have sat downstairs, where you wait till you're taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> and not go in at all and everything would've gone the same way. The fact that we took part physically [...] didn't actually change anything." ...|$|E
500|$|The Ace Attorney Investigations {{spin-off}} series {{splits the}} gameplay into investigation phases and rebuttal phases, {{the latter of}} which is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> trials of the main series. During the investigation phases, the player searches for evidence and talks to witnesses and suspects. Things the player character notices in the environment are saved as thoughts; the player can use the [...] "logic" [...] system to connect two such thoughts {{to gain access to}} new information. At some points, the player can create hologram reproductions of the crime scene, through which they can discover new information that would otherwise be hidden. Ace Attorney Investigations 2 introduces [...] "logic chess", where the player interrogates witnesses in a timed sequence that is visualized as a game of chess, with the player aiming to destroy the other character's chess pieces. To do this, they need to build up their advantage in the discussion by alternating between speaking and listening, and then choose to go on the offensive.|$|E
500|$|During trial {{proceedings}} for the Otterstrom {{murder on}} April 2, 1985, Gardner attempted {{to escape from}} custody with a revolver smuggled into the Metropolitan Hall of Justice at Salt Lake City. Jim Kleine of the Salt Lake City Fire Department believed that the gun was passed to Gardner as he was being escorted into the courthouse from the underground parking lot. Gardner was immediately shot in the chest by guard Luther Hensley. Gardner then wounded unarmed bailiff George [...] "Nick" [...] Kirk in the abdomen. After running <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> archives, Gardner confronted attorneys Robert Macri and Michael Burdell. According to Macri, after Gardner pointed the gun at him, he changed aim to Burdell, who had been doing pro bono work for his church. Burdell yelled, [...] "Oh, my God," [...] when Gardner {{shot him in the}} eye. Gardner made his way outside the building, where he was surrounded by dozens of police officers. Gardner threw the gun away, dropped and yelled: [...] "Don’t shoot, I don’t have a gun." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 1998, 16-year-old Mario Padilla and his 14-year-old cousin, Samuel Ramirez stabbed Mario's mother, Gina Castillo, 45 times, killing her. The case {{became known}} as the [...] "Scream murder" [...] and fell under intense media {{scrutiny}} after the boys claimed they were inspired by Scream and Scream 2. The pair confessed to needing the money acquired from Gina's murder to fund a killing spree, which would include purchasing two Ghostface costumes, as well as a voice-changer used by the character in the film. During their trial, psychologist Madeline Levine who studied the effect of violence on children, stated, [...] "There were a whole bunch of reasons why they acted out that way. But did the movie provide a blueprint? Absolutely." [...] The case was expected to highlight the effect of violent films on teenagers. [...] However, presiding judge John Cheroske ordered that evidence pertaining to Scream be barred and that the case not be referred to as the [...] "Scream murder", refusing media access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> intending that the case was tried as murder and nothing else.|$|E
500|$|Between June and December 1860, Benjamin {{was almost}} entirely {{absorbed in the}} case of United States v. Castillero, that was tried in San Francisco during the latter part of that period. The case {{concerned}} a land grant by the former Mexican government of California. Castillero had leased part of his land to British mining companies, and when American authorities ruled the grant invalid, they hired Benjamin; he spent four months in San Francisco working on the case. The trial began in October, and Benjamin gave an address lasting six days. The local correspondent for the New York Times wrote that Benjamin, [...] "a distinguished stranger", drew the largest crowds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and [...] "the Senator is making this terribly tedious case interesting". Benjamin sailed for New York once the case was submitted for decision in early November. The court's ruling, rendered in January 1861, was substantially for the company but, not satisfied, it appealed. It lost the case entirely to an adverse decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, three justices dissenting, the following year. [...] Benjamin was by then a Confederate Cabinet officer, and could not argue the case. His co-counsel filed his brief with the court.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Bart the Murderer" [...] finished 31st {{in the ratings}} for the week of October 7–13, 1991, with a Nielsen rating of 13.4, equivalent to approximately 12.5 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. John Orvted of Vanity Fair named it the eighth best episode of The Simpsons because of the [...] "inspired" [...] Mafia satire and because it [...] "goes deeper into Bart's ongoing conflict with authority figures." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the scene in which Skinner explains his disappearance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> calling it Skinner's [...] "finest hour" [...] on the show. Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed named the episode the best in the third season, and commented that there are [...] "many priceless moments" [...] in it, such as Homer's meeting with the Springfield Mafia. Meyers also praised Swartzwelder's script. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict commented that how an episode that starts with Bart having a bad day can lead to him being tried for murder {{as the head of the}} local Mafia [...] "is just one of the amazing monuments to this show's superiority." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract for <b>the</b> volume Contributors <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Divine <b>Courtroom</b> in Comparative Perspective treat one of {{the most}} {{pervasive}} religious metaphors, that of <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom,</b> in both its historical and thematic senses.

Contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> volume primarily center upon three related facets of the divine courtroom: the role of <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom</b> in <b>the</b> earthly legal system; <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom</b> as <b>the</b> site of historical justice; and <b>the</b> divine <b>courtroom</b> as <b>the</b> venue in which God is called to answer for his own unjust acts...|$|R
