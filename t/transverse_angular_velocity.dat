40|$|Abstract: One of {{the main}} {{simplifying}} assumptions made {{in the study of}} the attitude motions of a rocket-type variable mass system is that the motion of the fluid products of combustion relative to the rocket body, as these fluid particles exit the rocket’s combustion chamber, remains symmetric with re-spect to the rocket axis, and the fluid particles have no transverse motion relative to the rocket body. This assumption brings about a tremendous sim-plification of the equations that govern the attitude motion of a rocket, and is thus very attractive. Yet, one recognizes that such an assumption becomes questionable if the rocket body is allowed to spin. This paper examines the validity of this common assumption. The paper attempts to reconstruct what is lost when this assumption is made, and quantifies the effects on attitude dynamics predictions. Results obtained show that this assumption is in fact reasonable. Although internal fluid whirling motion can cause deviations in spin rate predictions, the actual effects are not dramatic. There is a noticeable impact on the frequencies of the <b>transverse</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> components, but the amplitude of the <b>transverse</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> vector is largely unaffected...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} minimum-time {{attitude}} {{control of a}} spinning missile is addressed. The missile is mod-eled as a rigid body which is symmetric about one axis. The missile is assumed to have a large roll rate about this axis of symmetry. Control is achieved by a single reaction jet which, when fired, provides a constant moment about a transverse axis. Distur-bance torques {{are assumed to be}} zero. The equa-tions of motion are written under these assumptions. The missile is assumed to have some arbitrary initial <b>transverse</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> and it is desired to take it to some final attitude in minimum time while re-ducing the <b>transverse</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> to zero. This problem is formulated as an optimal control prob-lem. Instead of taking the conventional approach of solving a two point boundary value problem, we con-sider an alternative approach. This approach deals with the specific case where only two thruster firings are sufficient to change the attitude of the missile in minimum time. By iterating on the switch times and integrating the state equations, we can compute the thruster firing times for a given set of boundary con-ditions. Some examples are included to illustrate the application of the concepts presented. We conclude by proposing a mechanization of this control scheme and pointing out some further research directions. 1...|$|E

The dual-spin system {{consists of a}} slowly rotating or despun main body, a momentum wheel (or rotor) which is accelerated by a torque motor to change its initial angular velocity relative to the main part to some high terminal value, and a nutation damper. A closed-form solution for {{the case of a}} symmetrical satellite indicates that when the nutation damper is physically constrained from movement (i. e., by use of a mechanical clamp) the magnitude of the vector sum of the <b>transverse</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> components remains bounded during the wheel spin-up under the influence of a constant motor torque.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation of the effects of mass loss on the attitude behavior of spinning bodies in flight. The principal goal is to determine whether there are circumstances under which the motion of variable mass systems can become unstable in the sense that their <b>transverse</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> become unbounded. Obviously, results from a study of this kind would find immediate application in the aerospace field. The first part of this study features a complete and mathematically rigorous derivation of a set of equations that govern both the translational and rotational motions of general variable mass systems. The remainder of the study is then devoted to the application of the equations obtained to a systematic investigation of the effect of various mass loss scenarios on the dynamics of increasingly complex models of variable mass systems. It is found that mass loss can {{have a major impact on}} the dynamics of mechanical systems, including a possible change in the systems stability picture. Factors such as nozzle geometry, combustion chamber geometry, propellant's initial shape, size and relative mass, and propellant location can all have important influences on the system's dynamic behavior. The relative importance of these parameters on-system motion are quantified in a way that is useful for design purposes...|$|R
40|$|The {{extended}} Navier-Stokes theory {{accounts for}} the coupling between the translational and rotational molecular degrees of freedom. In this paper, we generalize this theory to non-zero frequencies and wavevectors, which enables a new study of spatio-temporal correlation phenomena present in molecular fluids. To discuss these phenomena in detail, molecular dynamics simulations of molecular chlorine are performed for three different state points. In general, the theory captures the behavior for small wavevector and frequencies as expected. For example, in the hydrodynamic regime and for molecular fluids with small moment of inertia like chlorine, the theory predicts that the longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> intrinsic <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> correlation functions are almost identical, which is also seen in the molecular dynamics simulations. However, the theory fails at large wavevector and frequencies. To account for the correlations at these scales, we derive a phenomenological expression for the frequency dependent rotational viscosity and wavevector and frequency dependent longitudinal spin viscosity. From this we observe a significant coupling enhancement between the molecular <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> and translational velocity for large frequencies in the gas phase; this is not observed for the supercritical fluid and liquid state points.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an approach for realizing a phase difference measurement {{of a new}} gyro. A silicon micromachined gyro was mounted on rotating aircraft for aircraft attitude control. Aircraft spin drives the silicon pendulum of a gyro rotating at a high speed {{so that it can}} sense the <b>transverse</b> <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> of the rotating aircraft based on the gyroscopic precession principle when the aircraft has transverse rotation. In applications of the rotating aircraft single channel control system, such as damping in the attitude stabilization loop, the gyro signal must be kept in sync with the control signal. Therefore, the phase difference between both signals needs to be measured accurately. Considering that phase difference is mainly produced by both the micromachined part and the signal conditioning circuit, a mathematical model has been established and analyzed to determine the gyro’s phase frequency characteristics. On the basis of theoretical analysis, a dynamic simulation has been done for a case where the spin frequency is 15 Hz. Experimental results with the proposed measurement method applied to a silicon micromachined gyro driven by a rotating aircraft demonstrate that it is effective in practical applications.

40|$|The {{detailed}} {{fluid mechanics}} of sperm propulsion are fundamental {{to our understanding}} of reproduction. In this paper, we aim to model a human sperm swimming in a microscope slide chamber. We model the sperm itself by a distribution of regularized stokeslets over an ellipsoidal sperm head and along an infinitesimally thin flagellum. The slide chamber walls are modelled as parallel plates, also discretized by a distribution of regularized stokeslets. The sperm flagellar motion, used in our model, is obtained by digital microscopy of human sperm swimming in slide chambers. We compare the results of our simulation with previous numerical studies of flagellar propulsion, and compare our computations of sperm kinematics with those of the actual sperm measured by digital microscopy. We find that there is an excellent quantitative match of <b>transverse</b> and <b>angular</b> <b>velocities</b> between our simulations and experimental measurements of sperm. We also find a good qualitative match of longitudinal velocities and computed tracks with those measured in our experiment. Our computations of average sperm power consumption fall within the range obtained by other authors. We use the hydrodynamic model, and a prototype flagellar motion derived from experiment, as a predictive tool, and investigate how sperm kinematics are affected by changes to head morphology, as human sperm have large variability in head size and shape. Results are shown which indicate the increase in predicted straight-line velocity of the sperm as the head width is reduced and the increase in lateral movement as the head length is reduced. Predicted power consumption, however, shows a minimum close to the normal head aspect ratio...|$|R

40|$|The silicon micromechanical gyroscope, {{which will}} be {{introduced}} in this paper, represents a novel MEMS gyroscope concept. It {{is used for the}} damping of a single-channel control system of rotating aircraft. It differs from common MEMS gyroscopes in that does not have a drive structure, itself, and only has a sense structure. It is installed on a rotating aircraft, and utilizes the aircraft spin to make its sensing element obtain angular momentum. When the aircraft is subjected to an angular rotation, a periodic Coriolis force is induced in the direction orthogonal to both the angular momentum and the <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> input axis. This novel MEMS gyroscope can thus sense <b>angular</b> <b>velocity</b> inputs. The output sensing signal is exactly an amplitude-modulation signal. Its envelope is proportional to the input <b>angular</b> <b>velocity,</b> and the carrier frequency corresponds to the spin frequency of the rotating aircraft, so the MEMS gyroscope can not only sense the <b>transverse</b> <b>angular</b> rotation of an aircraft, but also automatically change the carrier frequency over the change of spin frequency, making it very suitable for the damping of a single-channel control system of a rotating aircraft. In this paper, the motion equation of the MEMS gyroscope has been derived. Then, an analysis has been carried to solve the motion equation and dynamic parameters. Finally, an experimental validation has been done based on a precision three axis rate table. The correlation coefficients between the tested data and the theoretical values are 0. 9969, 0. 9872 and 0. 9842, respectively.
