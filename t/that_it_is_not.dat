5|$|In Shodokan Aikido, randori differs in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{performed}} with multiple persons with defined roles of defender and attacker, but between two people, where both participants attack, defend, and counter at will. In this respect it resembles judo randori.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium {{does not}} have a {{biological}} role, as it has a short half-life and occurs only in small traces naturally.

5|$|The Age of Reason {{is divided}} into three sections. In Part I, Paine {{outlines}} his major arguments and personal creed. In Parts II and III he analyzes specific portions of the Bible in order to demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the revealed word of God.|$|E

5|$|While {{employing}} anekāntavāda, the 17th century Jain scholar Yasovijaya stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> anābhigrahika (indiscriminate {{attachment to}} all views as being true), which is effectively {{a kind of}} misconceived relativism. In Jain belief, anekāntavāda transcends the various traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism.|$|E
5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} view is <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{the formal}} {{structure of the}} Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but {{the presence of a}} practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. This may not be the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E

5|$|Chaitanya Krishna {{confirmed}} his {{inclusion in the}} cast {{by the end of}} March 2014. In late April 2014, Naresh was chosen {{to play an important role}} in the film, which he later described as one of the best roles of his career. Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He did not feel that he was being typecast and he accepted the role, adding <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> often that a Malayalam actor gets a chance to act in the Telugu films.|$|E
5|$|Drake {{stars in}} 2012's , which is {{released}} on Sony's PlayStation Vita. The game's events take place sometime before those of Drake's Fortune, though developers have stated <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a prequel to Drake's Fortune {{but rather a}} separate original story. Nathan Drake was also on the shortlist for being a guest character in Street Fighter x Tekken, however the idea was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a distinct substance.|$|E

5|$|In Pakistan, the {{breeding}} {{range of the}} dusky crag martin overlaps that of the subspecies P. f. peloplasta of pale crag martin, but that species breeds much higher in the mountains. This altitudinal separation means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known whether the two closely related martins could hybridise, which would cast doubts {{as to whether they}} were distinct species. Dusky crag martins from Burma and Thailand have been described as a separate darker subspecies, P. c. sintaungensis (originally Krimnochelidon concolor sintaungensis, Baker, 1832), {{but it is not clear}} that the difference is greater than that between individual martins of the nominate subspecies.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas of}} Pakistan where its range {{overlaps}} {{with that of}} the dusky crag martin, the pale crag martin breeds at a higher altitude. Its range does not overlap there with the Eurasian crag martin, which is found high in the Himalayas, but where both occur in Iran, the pale crag martin favours more arid habitats. In North Africa, the Eurasian species is again found at a higher level. The separation by altitude and aridity means <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known whether the closely related Ptyonoprogne martins could hybridise. If they were shown to do so, it would cast doubts on their specific distinctness.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E
