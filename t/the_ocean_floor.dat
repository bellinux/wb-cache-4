5|$|Magnetometers detect minute {{deviations}} in the Earth's {{magnetic field}} caused by iron artifacts, kilns, {{some types of}} stone structures, and even ditches and middens in archaeological geophysics. Using magnetic instruments adapted from airborne magnetic anomaly detectors developed during World War II to detect submarines, the magnetic variations across <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> have been mapped. Basalt — the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> — contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. The distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners {{as early as the}} late 18th century. More important, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these magnetic variations have provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials record the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|Scotch bonnets are predators; {{they search}} for their food on sandy {{stretches}} of <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> where they consume echinoderms such as sand dollars, sea biscuits, and other sea urchins (such as Echinocardium cordatum), drilling into their tests {{with the aid}} of sulfuric acid.|$|E

5|$|In Darwin's global hypothesis, vast {{areas where}} the seabed was being {{elevated}} were marked by fringing reefs, sometimes around active volcanoes, and similarly huge areas where <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> was subsiding were indicated by barrier reefs or atolls based on inactive volcanoes. These views received general support from deep sea drilling results in the 1980s. His idea that rising land would be balanced by subsidence in ocean areas has been superseded by modern plate tectonics, {{which he did not}} anticipate.|$|E

50|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{information}} about {{variations in the}} Earth's magnetic field was gathered largely by means of research vessels. But the complex routes of <b>ocean</b> cruises rendered <b>the</b> association of navigational data with magnetometer readings difficult. Only when data were plotted on a map did it become apparent that remarkably regular and continuous magnetic stripes appeared on <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Seamounts provide {{habitats}} and spawning grounds for these larger animals, including numerous fish. Some species, including black oreo (Allocyttus niger) and blackstripe cardinalfish (Apogon nigrofasciatus), {{have been shown}} to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else on <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> Marine mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> or below <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} manganese ore is pyrolusite (MnO2). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial {{relation to the}} iron ores. Land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, Gabon and Brazil. According to 1978 estimate, <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor</b> has 500 billion tons of manganese nodules. Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|Shipwreck {{refers to}} {{the remains of a}} ship that have been wrecked, found either on land, beached or sunken {{at the bottom of the}} sea. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization {{estimated}} that over 3 millions of shipwrecks are spread across <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors.</b> Many artifacts can be found through shipwrecks; artifacts such as gold, jewelry, spears, swords, ceremonial axes and hundreds of other objects.|$|R
50|$|The {{eventual}} rifting of {{the continents}} created new oceans and seafloor spreading, which produces warmer, less dense oceanic lithosphere. Due to its lower density, hot oceanic lithosphere will not lie {{as deep as}} old, cool oceanic lithosphere. In periods with relatively large areas of new lithosphere, <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> come up, causing the eustatic sea level to rise. The result was {{a greater number of}} shallower seas.|$|R
5|$|Around 2 {{million tonnes}} of nickel are {{produced}} annually worldwide. The Philippines, Indonesia, Russia, Canada and Australia are the world's largest producers of nickel, {{as reported by}} the US Geological Survey. The largest deposits of nickel in non-Russian Europe are located in Finland and Greece. Identified land-based resources averaging 1% nickel or greater contain at least 130 million tons of nickel. About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits. In addition, extensive deep-sea resources of nickel are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> particularly in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|As {{technology}} improved, {{measurement of}} depth, {{latitude and longitude}} became more precise and it became possible to collect more or less continuous sets of data points. This allowed researchers to draw accurate and detailed maps of large areas of <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> Use of a continuously recording fathometer enabled Tolstoy & Ewing {{in the summer of}} 1947 to identify and describe the first abyssal plain. This plain, south of Newfoundland, is now known as the Sohm Abyssal Plain. Following this discovery many other examples were found in all the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor,</b> {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E

Due to structure {{and shape of the}} teeth Ptyctodus would easily be able to crush shellfish like organisms that were at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors,</b> therefore mainly fed off of that. They also must have been very great swimmers to be able to escape predators like arthrodires.|$|R

5|$|Growth is slow, and the veligers {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the veligers mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|E
5|$|In July 1937, the Atlantic Monthly {{accepted}} a {{revised version of}} an essay, The World of Waters, that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as Undersea, was a vivid narrative of a journey along <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon & Schuster, impressed by Undersea, contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in Under the Sea Wind (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued—her features appeared in Sun Magazine, Nature, and Collier's.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Proterozoic, the supercontinent Pannotia {{had broken}} apart into the smaller continents Laurentia, Baltica, Siberia and Gondwana. During periods when continents move apart, more oceanic crust is formed by {{volcanic}} activity. Because young volcanic crust is relatively hotter and less dense than old oceanic crust, <b>the</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>floors</b> rise during such periods. This causes the sea level to rise. Therefore, {{in the first half of}} the Paleozoic, large areas of the continents were below sea level.|$|R
