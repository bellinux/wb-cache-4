5|$|Until 1976, federal <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> were {{virtually}} non-existent for {{buildings on the}} National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> that promote preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal <b>tax</b> <b>incentives.</b> A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, {{as well as those}} located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.|$|E
5|$|Owners of income-producing {{properties}} listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or {{of properties}} that are contributing resources within a National Register Historic District may {{be eligible for}} a 20% investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of the historic structure. The rehabilitation may be of a commercial, industrial, or residential property, for rentals. The <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation <b>Tax</b> <b>Incentives</b> program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State Historic Preservation Offices, and the Internal Revenue Service. Aside from the 20% tax credit, the tax incentive program offers a 10% tax credit for rehabilitation to owners of non-historic, non-residential buildings constructed before 1936.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} phenomenal growth in Irish {{property}} values in residential, commercial and office property {{over the last}} decade. During this period, the supply of new residential properties has nearly quadrupled. In parallel, prices on aggregate rose significantly during the period, as demand outstripped supply. Major city centre areas have been rejuvenated while the borders, and midlands have seen a major uplift in construction activity. The reasons for these changes are numerous. Property based <b>tax</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes, both area-based and activitybased have contributed to increased levels of construction activity. Many of these <b>tax</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes are due {{to come to an}} end in July 2006.

The National Park Service determines which properties meet NNL criteria and, after notifying the owners, makes nomination recommendations. The Secretary of the Interior reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NNL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation. Both public and privately-owned properties can be designated as NNLs. Owners may object to the nomination of the property as a NNL. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties via <b>tax</b> <b>incentives,</b> grants, monitoring of threats, and other means.|$|E

For company cars there is a corporate car tax free for 2 years and a recovery of 80% of the value added tax (VAT) on E85 vehicles. Also, E85 fuel price is set significantly lower than diesel or gasoline, resulting in E85 at € 0.80, diesel at €1.15, and gasoline at €1.30 per liter, as of April 2007. By May 2008, France had 211 pumps selling E85, even though the government made plans for the installation of up to 500 E85 pumps by year end 2007.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, Nasser nationalized all {{remaining}} British and French {{assets in}} Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and phosphate industries. When efforts to offer <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> and attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them {{a part of his}} economic development organization. He stopped short of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in private hands. This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization. Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt's largest enterprise, providing the country with product {{and tens of thousands of}} jobs. Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.|$|E
5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led to a complete re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film <b>tax</b> <b>incentives</b> in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
