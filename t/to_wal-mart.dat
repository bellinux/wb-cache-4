5|$|In 1995, Gretzky {{sold the}} card <b>to</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> and Treat Entertainment for $500,000. The two {{companies}} {{intended to use}} the card as the grand prize in a promotional contest. The card was sent all across the United States, as part of Wal-Mart's plan to rejuvenate the baseball card market. On February 24 of the following year, the 122nd anniversary of Wagner's birthday, the grand prize drawing for the card was held on CNN's Larry King Weekend. At around 9:00 P.M., Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, one of King's guests on the show, pulled out {{the name of one}} Patricia Gibbs, a postal worker living in Hollywood, Florida. After spending hours unsuccessfully trying to contact Gibbs, King's staff finally got through to her phone, and informed Gibbs of her prize. Treat Entertainment and Wal-Mart gave the card to Gibbs a few weeks later at a Wal-Mart store in Miramar, Florida. Gibbs could not afford the taxes on the card, so she decided to consign the card to an auction later on. She consigned the card to Christie's, a New York-based auction house better known for selling famous artworks.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} Wal-Mart’s {{pricing practices}} and its inﬂuence on competitors’ input cost transmission. Previous attempts <b>to</b> analyze <b>Wal-Mart’s</b> pricing {{strategy in the}} United States have been limited by the company’s refusal to provide scanner data to third party research ﬁrms such as AC Nielsen. This is the ﬁrst study <b>to</b> observe <b>Wal-Mart’s</b> prices {{over an extended period}} of time. Using weekly-store level price data between 2001 and 2006 that government oﬃcials collected in 12 Mexican cities, I ﬁnd that Wal-Mart adjusts its prices 1 / 3 - 3 times slower to wholesale price increases than other retailers and responds 5 - 7 times faster to wholesale price decreases than its competitors. This evidence is robust to the comparison of <b>Wal-Mart</b> <b>to</b> other hypermarkets that oﬀer “every day low prices” and to potential endogeneity of Wal-Mart’s location choices. All retailers respond asymmetrically to wholesale cost changes. However, retailers other than Wal-Mart respond twice as fast to wholesale price increases than <b>to</b> decreases, while <b>Wal-Mart</b> behaves in the opposite way. I ﬁnd no evidence that proximity <b>to</b> a <b>Wal-Mart</b> supercenter or the level of competition aﬀects the speed of price adjustment of retailers.

To make his model work, he emphasized logistics, particularly locating stores within a day's drive proximity <b>to</b> <b>Wal-Mart's</b> regional warehouses, and distributed through its own trucking service. Buying in volume and efficient delivery permitted sale of discounted name brand merchandise. Thus, sustained growth from 1977's 190 stores to 1985's 800 was achieved.|$|R

500|$|The {{most famous}} T206 Honus Wagner is the [...] "Gretzky T206 Honus Wagner" [...] card. [...] The card's odd texture and shape led to {{speculation}} {{that it was}} altered. The Gretzky T206 Wagner was first sold by Alan Ray to a baseball memorabilia collector named Bill Mastro, who sold the card two years later to Jim Copeland for nearly four times the price he had originally paid. Copeland's sizable transaction revitalized interest in the sports memorabilia collection market. In 1991, Copeland sold the card to ice hockey figures Wayne Gretzky and Bruce McNall for $451,000. Gretzky resold the card four years later <b>to</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> and Treat Entertainment for $500,000 for use as the top prize in a promotional contest.|$|E
500|$|Midge {{was sold}} [...] "pregnant" [...] with Nikki, {{who was a}} tiny baby inside Midge's {{magnetic}} removable womb. This led to some controversy with some consumers saying that the doll was inappropriate for children, or that it promoted teen pregnancy. Another cause for this controversy was that Midge did not initially have a wedding ring, but this was later fixed. She also was packaged without Alan. Customers complaining about the doll led <b>to</b> <b>Wal-Mart</b> pulling the Happy Family line off their shelves. [...] A new version of this Midge was produced for Wal-Mart, this time not pregnant and with a cardboard cut-out display of Alan and Ryan standing next to her inside the box. The Happy Family Line included everything from a talking house, a backyard swimming pool, neighborhood market, and playground.|$|E

A commercial during Quahog's local news is then played, parodying the theme to the 1971 children's television series The Electric Company. While Stewie and Brian attack the store, the manager of Superstore USA runs to hide in the bathroom before being crushed by the billboard in front of him. This is a reference to the Jurassic Park scene where the attorney also hides in a bathroom before being eaten by the T-Rex.
