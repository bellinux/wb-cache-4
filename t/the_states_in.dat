5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, France, Switzerland and San Marino were the only European nations to have a republican form of government.

5|$|Because the Bill of Rights did not {{initially}} {{apply to the}} states, and federal criminal investigations were less common {{in the first century}} of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century.

5|$|In 1986, <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> the Great Lakes region {{created the}} LMCT {{as part of}} a larger program of tourist routes in the region; US141 carries the LMCT between the {{northern}} I-43 junction in the Green Bay area north to the split with US41 at Abrams. In the first years of the 21st century, US141 was expanded to a four-lane expressway northward from Abrams to Oconto Falls. A further upgrade in 2006 expanded the highway to four-lanes northward to Beaver. On April 7, 2015, the segment of US141 that runs concurrently with US41 on the west side of Green Bay designated a part of I-41 by the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E
5|$|In the United States it was {{imported}} {{very early}} in the 18th century and cultivated for its medicinal and piscicide properties.

5|$|After {{the close}} of the session, Sherman {{returned}} to Ohio to campaign for the Republican nominee for governor there, former governor Rutherford B. Hayes. The issue of specie payments was debated in the campaign, with Hayes endorsing Sherman's position and his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor William Allen, in favor of increased circulation of greenbacks redeemable in bonds. Hayes won a narrow victory and was soon mentioned as a possible presidential candidate in 1876. The controversy over resumption carried into the presidential election. The Democratic platform that year demanded repeal of the Resumption Act, while the Republicans nominated Hayes, whose position in favor of a gold standard was well known. The election of 1876 was very close, and the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated. Louisiana was one of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> which both parties claimed victory, and Grant asked Sherman and a few other men to go to New Orleans and ensure the party's interests were represented.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915 Dyer {{was through}} with Australia, the New Zealand Truth {{reporting}} that he had left by 4 December, and by Christmas Eve the American press were already announcing his arrival in <b>the</b> <b>States.</b> <b>In</b> January, Dyer was in San Francisco, where he fought local boxer Bob McAllister, losing on points in a four-round contest. He then travelled to the East Coast and to New York, and on 6 May 1916 {{he was back in}} the ring, in a ten-round fight with local boxer Tommy Maloney. The fight went the distance ending in a draw, though local newspapers gave the decision to Maloney. After the fight Dyer entertained the crowd with an operatic song.|$|E

Morehead refused to sign the final document produced by the convention {{because he did not}} agree with all the statements it contained.

5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to <b>the</b> <b>states.</b> <b>In</b> 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E
5|$|States are {{the primary}} subdivisions of the United States, and possess a number of powers and rights under the United States Constitution, such as {{regulating}} intrastate commerce, running elections, creating local governments, and ratifying constitutional amendments. Each state has its own constitution, grounded in republican principles, and government, consisting of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. All states and their residents are represented in the federal Congress, a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Each state is represented by two Senators, while Representatives are distributed among <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>in</b> proportion {{to the most recent}} constitutionally mandated decennial census. Additionally, each state is entitled to select a number of electors to vote in the Electoral College, the body that elects the President of the United States, equal to the total of Representatives and Senators in Congress from that state. Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution grants to Congress the authority to admit new states into the Union. Since the establishment of the United States in 1776, the number of states has expanded from the original 13 to the current total of 50, and each new state is admitted on an equal footing with the existing states.|$|E

Williams returned to <b>the</b> <b>States</b> <b>in</b> December 1945 and was discharged from the Marines on January 28, 1946. On May 2, 1952, Williams was recalled to active duty due to the Korean War. After completing jet refresher training in the F9F Panther at Cherry Point, North Carolina, Williams joined VMF-311 in Korea. He flew 37 combat missions and had a narrow escape when he crash-landed a flak-damaged aircraft. Among the decorations he received was the Air Medal with two Gold Stars for meritorious achievement. Williams returned to the States and relieved from active duty with the rank of captain on July 28, 1953.
