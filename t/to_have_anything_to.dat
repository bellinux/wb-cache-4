5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between January and April 1996, {{the story}} begins with the New York Police Department using Brock's wife, Ann, to trap him. Brock sends the symbiote to Ann, turning her into She-Venom again and letting her escape. In issue #3, Ann is afraid of the symbiote's influence and refuses <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Brock while he wears it. This plotline is resolved in The Amazing Spider-Man Vol.2 #19 (2000), in which Ann's experience with the symbiote triggers her suicide. The story includes contemporary Spider-Man Ben Reilly trying to bring Venom to justice.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} awaiting Mary Godwin in England was {{fraught with}} complications, {{some of which}} she had not foreseen. Either before or during the journey, she had become pregnant. She and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with her. The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations.|$|E
5|$|When Marge {{takes the}} family to the Family Fun Center, she notices Nelson acting like a bully, {{especially}} when he knocks Milhouse off the track and wins a BB gun from stolen prize tickets. Bart and Nelson attempt to be friends, but Marge forbids Bart {{to hang out with}} Nelson. Bart goes to Nelson’s house anyway and starts using Nelson's new BB gun. When Nelson pressures Bart to shoot a bird in a nest, Bart accidentally kills the bird. Marge is furious that Bart killed an animal, but instead of punishing him, she refuses <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with his destructive ways.|$|E

6000|$|... "What a fool {{she must}} <b>have</b> been ever <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the}} man! She is so self-willed and {{independent}} too, that one is more minded to say it serves her right than pity her." ...|$|R

5|$|After his return, Lad is bred {{with another}} prize-winning collie, Lady, {{and they have}} two male puppies which are named Little Lad and Wolf. Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they {{are old enough to}} leave their mother & she chooses Little Lad. However, Jackson White (Jack Daly), a poacher Lad fought and chased off the {{property}} before, sets fire to barn out of vengeance. Elizabeth is injured and Little Lad is killed but not Wolf. Lad later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad's gold trophy from the dog show. Angela is initially inconsolable over the loss of her puppy Little Lad, and refuses <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Wolf. After he is nearly lost in another accident, she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Herodotus.|$|E
25|$|Welland's {{original}} script also featured, {{in addition}} to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist Douglas Lowe, who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay.|$|E
50|$|Moments later, Ian Murdoch, a {{mathematics}} {{professor at}} The Gables, comes up behind them. He {{has not seen}} the attack, and has only just arrived at the beach from the school. Holmes sees {{a couple of people}} far up the beach, but thinks they are much too far away <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with McPherson's death. Likewise, the few fishing boats off the beach are too far out.|$|R
60|$|When William {{returned}} to his foster-father he informed him {{that he did not}} mean <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> do with the smuggling.|$|R

25|$|Hodgson {{joined the}} University of London's Officers' Training Corps. Refusing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the}} sea despite his {{experience}} and Third Mate's certificate, he received a commission as a Lieutenant in the Royal Artillery. In 1916, he was thrown from a horse and suffered a broken jaw and a serious head injury; he received a mandatory discharge, and returned to writing.|$|E
25|$|Mr. & Mrs. Barry: Diana's parents. Mr. Barry farms. Near {{the end of}} the book, {{he offers}} to rent some tracts to help out Anne and Marilla, after Matthew's passing. Mrs. Barry has a severe personality, expecting her {{children}} to follow strict rules. After Anne accidentally gets Diana drunk, Mrs. Barry rejects the girl, forbidding Diana <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with Anne. This sanction is repealed after Anne saves Minnie May.|$|E
25|$|Blood {{addresses}} relations forged {{between the}} Japanese and the Burmese during World War II. A young Japanese woman visits Burma {{to find her}} half-brother, the child of her father, {{an officer in the}} Japanese army, and a Burmese mother. Her half-brother initially refuses <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with her because he believes that his father raped his mother. A joint production with the Japanese turned this novel into a film which had its 2003 premiere in Japan.|$|E

25|$|Cockburn {{commanded}} {{a squadron of}} warships for the landings in Walcheren in July 1809 during the Walcheren Campaign. He took command of the third-rate HMS Implacable {{off the coast of}} Spain in January 1810 and sailed to Quiberon Bay with a small squadron whose mission was to arrange the escape of the King of Spain, whom the French had imprisoned at the Château de Valençay. The mission failed when Ferdinand refused <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the British. Cockburn was promoted to commodore, hoisting his broad pennant in the fourth-rate HMS Grampus in November 1811.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Kassel, on his 66th birthday, Rundstedt {{received}} a cheque from Hitler for 250,000 Reichsmarks. This was part of Hitler's policy of buying the continuing loyalty of his senior commanders. Many found this offensive, but none turned down these gifts. Rundstedt {{tried to do the}} next best thing by failing to cash the cheque. By February this was attracting adverse comment in Berlin, and Rundstedt then cashed it. Some writers have sought to connect Rundstedt's acceptance of this money with his continuing refusal to support the resistance movement against Hitler's regime within the German Army. In fact Rundstedt refused <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the money, handing it over to his daughter-in-law, and it was still untouched at his death in 1953.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{communities}} or {{branches that}} had their headquarters outside the country, {{such as the}} Jesuit and Franciscan orders, were henceforth ordered to terminate their activities in Albania. Religious institutions were forbidden <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with {{the education of the}} young, because that had been made the exclusive province of the state. All religious communities were prohibited from owning real estate and they were also prohibited from operating philanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals. Although there were tactical variations in Enver Hoxha's approach to each of the major denominations, his overarching objective was the eventual destruction of all organized religion in Albania. From 1945 to 1953, the number of priests was drastically reduced and the number of Roman Catholic churches was decreased from 253 to 100, and all Catholics were stigmatized as fascists.|$|E

25|$|On 27 August 1803, Durutte {{received}} {{promotion to}} general of division {{in spite of}} Napoleon Bonaparte's dislike of officers from Moreau's army. He {{became a member of}} the Légion d'Honneur on 11 December 1803 and a commander of the Légion on 9 June 1804. His former relationship with Moreau, who was exiled from France, then caused trouble. When asked to put his signature on a document agreeing with Napoleon's appointment as emperor of France, Durutte remained true to his republican beliefs and refused to sign. When his officers also offered to join him in defiance, he dissuaded them so their careers would not be ruined. After this incident, apparently no one wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with him except Marshal Louis-Nicolas Davout, who gave him command of the island of Elba. He remained in this isolated post for three years.|$|E
25|$|Even 18th century {{physicians}} {{expected that}} obstetrics {{would continue to}} grow, the opposite happened. Obstetrics entered a stage of stagnation in the 19th century, which lasted until about the 1880s. The central explanation {{for the lack of}} advancement during this time was substantially due to the rejection of obstetrics by the medical community. The 19th century marked an era of medical reform in Europe and increased regulation over the medical profession. Major European institutions such as The College of Physicians and Surgeons considered delivering babies ungentlemanly work and refused <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with childbirth as a whole. Even when Medical Act 1858 was introduced, which stated that medical students could qualify as doctors, midwifery was entirely ignored. This made it nearly impossible to pursue an education in midwifery and also have the recognition of being a doctor or surgeon. Obstetrics was pushed to the side.|$|E
25|$|Naomi and Liam {{start their}} {{relationship}} fresh. Naomi admits to Liam {{that she has}} been feigning interest in things he likes and that she needs to be true to herself, even if it means their relationship won't work. This is what Liam wants, and their relationship becomes more stable; however, when Naomi is forced to come clean over false rumors she spread claiming that she was sexually harassed by a teacher, Mr. Cannon, Liam decides that he needs a break from her. During this time, Annie and Liam become closer and he consoles her after she overhears her mother, Debbie, confessing to her father, Harry, that she kissed her yoga instructor. His consolation causes Annie to believe that Liam is flirting with her, but realizing that this was not his intent, Annie instead advises Liam to stay with Naomi, as she does not want to ruin her friendship again over a boy. Liam begins to have his own troubles when his father returns, pretending that he wants to have a relationship with his son. But when Liam steals very valuable coins from his stepfather in hopes of starting a life with his father, he abandons Liam. Naomi becomes distracted by her pregnant sister Jen returning to town and causing trouble for Naomi. Naomi finds out that Ryan is the father of Jen's baby, and informs him of his impending fatherhood. Jen does not want Ryan <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the future of their baby, but Ryan is insistent that he should be involved. After Liam breaks up with her, a devastated Naomi is raped by Mr. Cannon, who tells her that after her initial false accusations, nobody will believe her. Mr. Cannon and Naomi had been working on a digital media project when they had become close and worked after hours on a project. This is also when Naomi was attacked by Mr. Cannon. Dixon leaves for Australia with Ivy after witnessing his parents having another argument. Harry informs Debbie that he was fired as principal of West Beverly after covering up an incident at school for Dixon. Annie reveals to Liam about the hit-and-run, and he encourages her to confess. Jasper is jealous that Annie and Liam are spending so much time together and sets fire to Liam's boat that he has been working on for a very long time. Liam sees this and attacks Jasper as the police arrive.|$|E
50|$|Kikuchi's father, a fisherman, {{was killed}} by an American {{submarine}} attack only two weeks before Japan's surrender ended World War II. With a reason to hold a grudge against Americans, when contacted by American missionaries of the LDS Church after the war he was initially resistant <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with them, but was responsive to the message and was baptized at age 16. Three years after his baptism, Kikuchi began service as a missionary in his own country, serving for three and one half years.|$|R
5000|$|Leeds <b>had</b> {{done nothing}} <b>to</b> foster good {{relations}} with the newly independent United States of America: two future Presidents, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, as envoys from the United States, both complained of his obstructive attitude and [...] "aversion <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with us". While Adams, who was rather Anglophile by inclination, was prepared to forgive and forget, Jefferson was not, and {{it can be argued that}} Leeds's only lasting achievement was to foster Jefferson's implacable hostility as President to Great Britain and its rulers.|$|R

500|$|The trio {{travelled}} for six weeks, from 28 July to 13 September 1814, through France, Switzerland, Germany, and the Netherlands (which {{is referred}} to as [...] "Holland"); however, they were forced to return to England due to financial considerations. The situation upon their return was fraught with complications: Mary had become pregnant with a child who would soon die, she and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with her.|$|E
500|$|On {{his arrival}} in Jamaica, the 12-man Assembly of Jamaica voted Morgan an annual salary of £600 [...] "for his good {{services}} to the country"; the move angered Carbery, who did not get on with Morgan. Carbery later complained of his deputy that he was [...] "every day more convinced of... imprudence and unfitness <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with civil government". Carbery also wrote to the Secretary of State to bemoan Morgan's [...] "drinking and gaming at the taverns" [...] of Port Royal.|$|E
500|$|By 1924, many UFA Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) {{wanted to}} see Greenfield leave office, both because they were {{frustrated}} with his failings and because they thought it likely that a Greenfield-led government would be defeated in the next election. [...] Their first attempt to replace him failed when Brownlee, their intended replacement, refused <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> do with the plan, but a second attempt, in 1925, was successful when Brownlee agreed to take office if Greenfield personally requested that he do so. [...] Greenfield had not wanted the job in the first place, and agreed to resign in Brownlee's favour.|$|E
