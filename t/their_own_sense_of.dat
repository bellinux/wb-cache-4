[...] The [...] "almost mythical" [...] Human Project is turned into a [...] "metaphor for the possibility of the evolution of the human spirit, the evolution of human understanding." [...] Without dictating how the audience should feel {{by the end of the}} film, Cuarón encourages viewers to come to their own conclusions about the sense of hope depicted in the final scenes: [...] "We wanted the end to be a glimpse of a possibility of hope, for the audience to invest <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hope into that ending.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{significance}} of family photography for African Americans in the Jim Crow South through {{an examination of the}} photograph collection kept by the Popes, a middle-class African American family of Raleigh, NC. Drawing from multiple disciplines including social history, material culture, and visual culture, the study argues that portraiture represents a crucial yet under-examined arena for the construction of black identity and the expression of political agency under segregation. Findings include that the production, display, and distribution of photographs by families like the Popes represented political acts of opposition to images of blacks created by the dominant culture, as well as examples of African Americans taking control over <b>their</b> <b>own</b> representation in response to white supremacist stereotypes. Meanwhile, these photographs also fulfilled important personal functions, allowing blacks to shape <b>their</b> <b>own</b> legacy and to define and affirm <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> beauty, self-worth, and belonging...|$|R

Ordinary people often find themselves caught between the moral frameworks of capitalism, Maoism, and the Chinese tradition. This ethnographic study of the village of Zhongba (in Hubei Province, central China) {{is an attempt to}} grasp the ethical reflexivity of everyday life in rural China. Drawing on descriptions of village life, interspersed with targeted theoretical analyses, the author examines how ordinary people construct <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> lives and their futures in everyday activities: building houses, working, celebrating marriages and funerals, gambling, and dealing with local government. The villagers confront moral uncertainty; they creatively harmonize public discourse and local practice; and sometimes they resolve incoherence and unease through the use of irony. In so doing, they perform everyday ethics and re-create transient moral communities at a time of massive social dislocation...|$|R

[...] Inspired by their experiences working on sit-coms, the writers also looked to create [...] "a network of strong characters" [...] to surround Parker with in the film. In October 2015, Watts said he was looking to make the film a coming-of-age story to see the growth of Parker, citing Say Anything..., Almost Famous, and Can't Buy Me Love as some of his favorite films in that genre. It was this aspect of the film that had initially got Watts interested in directing it, as he had already been looking to make a coming-of-age story when he heard that the new Spider-Man would be younger than previous incarnations. Watts re-read the original Spider-Man comics in preparation for the film, and [...] "came to a new realization about why he was so popular originally: He gave a different perspective on this world that they were building. He was introduced in the ‘60s, when they had already built a crazy spectacular Marvel Universe ... to give a regular person’s perspective on it.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{individual}} and collective ways in which hip hop {{is involved in the}} shaping of social and cultural worlds among youth in Huancayo, Peru. Through the lenses of identity and performative sites, this thesis examines the intersections of agency, politics, and power in the practices and performance of hip hop in Huancayo. Anthropological theories of youth, identity, and globalization are utilized to examine the ways in which hip-hoppers forge identities through hip hop culture and discourses of authenticity, and rearticulate <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> cultural identity and difference. An analysis of the narratives of the historical development and specific sites of performance of hip hop in Huancayo highlights the localized experiences and contexts which shape youth identities and hip hop performance. The linking of articulations of identities to the tensions of performative sites illustrates how hip-hoppers negotiate numerous points of authority and levels of politics through a process of legitimation, which shapes their capacity for individual and collective action and expression through hip hop. ...|$|R

2500|$|Olson, Jason, Ferrari, and Hutcheson (2005) {{reviewed}} the existent literature on four mutual-help organizations (Alcoholics Anonymous, Oxford House, GROW, and Schizophrenics Anonymous). They {{suggest that the}} processes of change framework found within the transtheoretical model of intentional behavior change (Prochaska, Diclemente, and Norcross, 1992) is a useful model to conceptualize the activities of mutual-help organization members throughout their journey of mental health recovery. They explicitly link social liberation, {{the last of the}} ten processes of change articulated by the model (the others being: consciousness raising, self-reevaluation, helping relationships, self-liberation, environmental reevaluation, dramatic relief/emotional arousal, stimulus control, reinforcement management, and counterconditioning) to the helper-therapy principle, along with a related concept known as bidirectional support (Maton, 1988). Per Olson et al. (2005), social liberation [...] "involves the person in recovery focusing attention away from oneself and developing a broader recognition of social issues that contributed to the targeted problem" [...] which encourages [...] "recovering individuals to take more helping-related attitudes toward others who face similar problems" [...] (p.174). In reviewing the research conducted among members of these four self-help/mutual-help organizations, they identify three different mechanisms which might underlie the therapeutic effect of mutual-help: (1) when an individual helps another, the helper's social functioning improves because the act of providing help to another allows the helper to work through their own difficulties; (2) when an individual helps another, the helper's social functioning improves because the act of providing help to another allows the helper to reinforce their own personal learning about recovery; and/or (3) when an individual helps another, the helper experiences an increase in <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> competence and usefulness to others and enables the helper to adopt a [...] "strength-based roles that have not been fully exercised in other areas of life" [...] (p.175).

As suggested by a study by Maton and Salem (1995), this idea is most succinctly expressed by way of an axiom of GROW which is often recited at meetings: [...] "If you need help, help others." ...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates where {{potentialities}} {{for research}} on identities lie {{in a foreign language}} learning setting in which learner identity has not been well explored. The present paper examines how foreign language learners see and understand <b>their</b> <b>own</b> identities, using data from online-discussions on identity by learners of Japanese at a Korean university. These online-discussions were conducted as a part of classroom activities that aim to let learners increase awareness of other perspectives on the discussion topic through interactions with their classmates. The process through which learners exchange opinions with peers online is examined, and the discourses they select for talking about identities are focused on. Qualitative analysis of the data reveals that learners first conceptualize the term "identity" on <b>their</b> <b>own,</b> and then begin to show <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> self about "who they are" through interactions with peers. From the analysis of extracts of their descriptions about identities, we find that learners come to see the connection between Japanese learning and their identities. We also find that even in a foreign language learning setting, if given opportunities to talk about their identities, this in itself offers learners a discursive environment in which they can further construct their identities...|$|R
