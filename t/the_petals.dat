5|$|Like other fairywrens, male {{variegated}} fairywrens {{have been}} observed carrying brightly coloured petals to display to females {{as part of a}} courtship ritual. In this species, <b>the</b> <b>petals</b> that have been recorded have been yellow. Petals are displayed and presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory.|$|E
5|$|While poorly documented, {{chemical}} communication {{is believed to}} be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on <b>the</b> <b>petals</b> of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females were attracted to these groups so {{it seems likely that the}} males were producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|Young {{leaves and}} shoots of the durian are {{occasionally}} cooked as greens. Sometimes the ash of the burned rind {{is added to}} special cakes. <b>The</b> <b>petals</b> of durian flowers are eaten in the North Sumatra province of Indonesia, while in the Moluccas islands the husk of the durian fruit is used as fuel to smoke fish. The nectar and pollen of the durian flower that honeybees collect is an important honey source, but {{the characteristics of the}} honey are unknown.|$|E

5|$|During the {{reproductive}} season, males {{of this and}} other fairywren species pluck yellow petals, which contrast with their plumage, and show them to female fairywrens. <b>The</b> <b>petals</b> often form part of a courtship display and are presented to a female in the male fairywren's own or another territory. Males sometimes show petals to females in other territories even outside the breeding season, presumably to promote themselves. Fairywrens are socially monogamous and sexually promiscuous: pairs will bond for life, though {{both males and females}} will regularly mate with other individuals; a proportion of young will have been fathered by males from outside the group. Young are often raised not by the pair alone, but with other males who also mated with the pair's female assisting.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{ordered the}} Burmese Ruby Tiara in 1973, {{and it was}} made by Garrard & Co. using stones from her private collection. It is {{designed}} {{in the form of}} a wreath of roses, with silver and diamonds making <b>the</b> <b>petals,</b> and clusters of gold and rubies forming the centre of the flowers. A total of 96 rubies are mounted on the tiara; they were originally part of a necklace given to her in 1947 as a wedding present by the people of Burma (now Myanmar), who credited them with having the ability to protect their owner from sickness and evil. The diamonds were also given to her as a wedding present, by the Nizam of Hyderabad and Berar, who possessed a vast jewellery collection of his own.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. <b>The</b> <b>petals</b> of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this fact has been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E
40|$|A {{collapsible}} dish structure {{composed of}} a plurality of rows of rigid radial petal assemblies concentric with the axis of <b>the</b> dish. <b>The</b> <b>petal</b> assemblies consist of a center petal and two side <b>petals,</b> <b>the</b> center <b>petal</b> hinged on an axis tangent to a circle concentric with the axis of the dish and <b>the</b> side <b>petals</b> hinged to <b>the</b> center <b>petal</b> at their mating edge. <b>The</b> center <b>petal</b> is foldable inwardly and <b>the</b> side <b>petals</b> rotate about their hinges such that the collapsed dish structure occupies a much smaller volume than the deployed dish. Means of controlling {{the shape of the}} dish to compensate for differential expansion of the deployed dish are also provided...|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} usually borne singly in leaf axils and lack a stalk. There are 5 green, narrow {{triangular}} sepals 2-5 mm long. <b>The</b> 5 <b>petals</b> are 7-12 mm long and joined at their lower end {{to form a}} tube. The tube and <b>the</b> <b>petal</b> lobes on its end are lilac-coloured, lack spots and are glabrous on the outside. <b>The</b> lower, middle <b>petal</b> lobe and <b>the</b> inside of <b>the</b> <b>petal</b> tube is covered with long, soft hairs.|$|R
2500|$|The {{flowers are}} borne singly, rarely in pairs, on curved stalks [...] {{long in the}} leaf axils. There are 5 cream-coloured to pinkish-purple, {{lance-shaped}} to egg-shaped sepals. The sepals are sticky, mostly glabrous and usually [...] long. <b>The</b> five <b>petals</b> are [...] and joined at their lower end, forming a bell-shaped tube. <b>The</b> <b>petal</b> tube is lilac-coloured to mauve or pinkish purple, rarely white and is spotted with purple. <b>The</b> <b>petal</b> tube has glandular hairs on the outside but {{the outside of the}} lobes is often covered with many long, thin hairs. The inside of the lobes is glabrous, except for the lower one which is covered with long thin hairs. The inside of <b>the</b> <b>petal</b> tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens do not protrude beyond the end of <b>the</b> <b>petal</b> tube. Flowering occurs from July to October and is followed by fruit which are hard, hairy, oval shaped and [...] long.|$|R
5|$|Groups {{and lines}} of flowers {{are present in}} each level; {{approaching}} these with the petal causes them to bloom and a new petal to trail the first. When the player approaches certain flowers or groups of flowers, changes are made to the game world. These include opening new areas, transforming dead grassy areas to bright green fields, or activating wind turbines. These changes generally result in new flowers sprouting for the player to interact with. Flying through each flower results in a musical chime that harmonizes with the music. The music itself dynamically adjusts as changes are made to the world. The more flower petals the player has trailing the lead petal, the faster <b>the</b> <b>petals</b> move. It is impossible for the player to lose a level or any progress. The game features no enemies, hit points, or time limits. A single play-through of the game takes approximately one hour.|$|E
5|$|The Liliaceae are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous in {{the case}} of Medeoleae) {{flowering}} plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged (inflorescence) along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower {{at the tip of the}} stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both <b>the</b> <b>petals</b> and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of 'petals', that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts (superior). There are three fused carpels (syncarpus) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing in a dark room, dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing a flowing maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a pleated red organza dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic arrangements are intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue {{down on the floor and}} leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the camera pans out. She proceeds to wave to a distant person and then plucks <b>the</b> <b>petals</b> out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E

40|$|The starch {{distribution}} pattern and decline in starch content of Sonia rose petals were examined by starch-iodine staining. Flowers were harvested {{and held in}} 150 mg/L of sodium dichloroisocyanurate (DICA) or 150 mg DICA/L + 2 % (w/v) sucrose, or were left on the plant. Starch was degraded initially from the outer margins of <b>petals,</b> then from <b>the</b> interveinal area nearest <b>the</b> <b>petal</b> margins, and finally towards <b>the</b> <b>petal</b> bases. Starch was first lost from <b>the</b> outermost <b>petal</b> and then sequentially towards <b>the</b> innermost <b>petals.</b> <b>The</b> rate of starch degradation was slowest in flowers left on the plant, intermediate in flowers harvested and kept in DICA + sucrose, and most rapid in flowers harvested and held in DICA...|$|R

5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of Hellenization {{can be seen in}} Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-rising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250–125 BC) (in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan) and the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC – 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). Some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the Buddha appeared at this time, perhaps modeled on Greek statues of Apollo in the Greco-Buddhist style. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan, while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like <b>the</b> <b>petals</b> of a flower. The Yavanajataka (lit. Greek astronomical treatise) and Paulisa Siddhanta texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} {{and size of}} petals is an important character in the taxonomy of Poranthereae. In most species, <b>the</b> <b>petals</b> of staminate flowers are almost {{as large as the}} sepals, and <b>the</b> <b>petals</b> of pistillate flowers are much smaller.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, petals {{would become}} loose and {{fall to the}} stage floor. Nijinsky's servant Vasili would collect <b>the</b> <b>petals</b> and sell them as souvenirs.

25|$|Species of Mandragora are {{perennial}} herbaceous plants. They {{have large}} vertical tap-roots, sometimes forked. Their stems are short or virtually absent. The leaves form a rosette {{at the base}} of the plant. The flowers are sometimes borne on a short stalk (scape), and are solitary, with whorls of five parts. The sepals are joined at the base, as are <b>the</b> <b>petals,</b> both in the shape of a lobed bell. The stamens are shorter than <b>the</b> <b>petals,</b> joined to the floral tube towards the base. The ovary has two chambers (locules). After fertilization, a yellow or orange fruit forms (botanically a berry).|$|E
