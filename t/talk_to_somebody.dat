These features include: [...] "Direct Call", or the handset's ability to recognise when a user wants to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> instead of messaging them, if they bring the phone to their head; [...] "Social Tag", a function that identifies and tags people in a photo and shares photos with them; and [...] "Pop Up Play", which allows a video and other applications to occupy the screen at the same time. In addition, the SIII can beam its screen to a monitor or be used as a remote controller (AllShare Cast and Play) and share photos with people who are tagged in them (Buddy Photo Share).|$|E
500|$|While imprisoned, Kemper {{has participated}} {{in a number of}} interviews, {{including}} a segment in the 1982 documentary The Killing of America, as well as an appearance in the 1984 documentary Murder: No Apparent Motive. His interviews are notable for their contribution to understanding the mind of serial killers, with FBI profiler John E. Douglas describing Kemper as [...] "among the brightest prison inmates" [...] he ever interviewed and capable of [...] "rare insight for a violent criminal." [...] Kemper is also forthcoming about the nature of his crimes and has said that he participated in the interviews to save others like himself from killing; stating {{at the end of his}} Murder: No Apparent Motive interview: [...] "There's somebody out there that is watching this and hasn't done that – hasn't killed people, and wants to, and rages inside and struggles with that feeling, or is so sure they have it under control. They need to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> about it. Trust somebody enough to sit down and talk about something that isn't a crime; thinking that way isn't a crime. Doing it isn't just a crime, it's a horrible thing, it doesn't know when to quit and it can't be stopped easily once it starts." [...] He also conducted an interview with French writer Stéphane Bourgoin in 1991.|$|E
500|$|The creators {{wanted to}} make Kim as {{believable}} as possible. Schooley's and McCorkle's own daughters inspired them to conceive Kim as a [...] "character with dimension ... that girls could watch and appreciate." [...] McCorkle was quick in deciding very early on that Kim {{does not belong to}} a spy organization, nor does she possess any superpowers. Although admitting that the character's accomplishments are generally [...] "implausible," [...] Schooley and McCorkle wanted Kim to remain relatable to young viewers, and avoided making her [...] "impervious" [...] like superheroes by giving her [...] "real problems and teen issues." [...] McCorkle described Kim as [...] "incredibly competent in the action world but challenged in the real world by all the things we all have trouble with", including embarrassment, school work and family. Schooley explained that [...] "What makes Kim effective in the action world is gymnastics, cheerleading, physical activity, something that any kid, any girl, in the world could do." [...] Additionally, the character is skilled in 17 different types of kung fu. At one point an indestructible supersuit complete with special abilities was created for Kim, but the outfit was ultimately abandoned to avoid contradicting with the character's [...] "she can do anything" [...] motto. Elaborating on her role in the pilot, Schooley believes that [...] "Kim's mix of tenacity, intelligence and heart makes for a very strong female role model for kids," [...] however, [...] "Sure she can save the world, but that doesn't help her a bit when she comes face-to-face with her latest school crush." [...] Furthermore, the writers envisioned the character having her own website and hand-held communicator – named the [...] "Kimmunicator" [...] after the character – with video chat, both of which were considered revolutionary back in 2000, a time when few young people owned cellphones. Kim's use of advanced technology represents her ability to [...] "effortlessly hop around the world and get back in time for dinner. Which is pretty unrealistic, but it’s what kids can do on the internet now. They can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> anywhere".|$|E

6000|$|As to his {{literary}} likings, {{they appear in}} his own confessions. He revelled in Dickens, but, about Thackeray--well, I would rather have <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else! <b>To</b> my amazement, he was of those (I think) who find Thackeray [...] "cynical." [...] "He takes you into a garden, and then pelts you with"--horrid things! Mr. Stevenson, on the other hand, had a free admiration of Mr. George Meredith. He did not so easily forgive the longueus and lazinesses of Scott, as a Scot should do. He read French much; Greek only in translations.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked off}} in dudgeon, and, {{until they were}} on their way to London again, treated the mate with marked coldness.

In the quietness of the cabin, over a satisfying pipe, he planned out in a kindly and generous spirit careers for both the ladies he was not going to marry. The only thing that was wanted to complete their happiness, and his, was that they should fall in with the measures proposed.|$|R

60|$|One of {{the many}} things Mike could never {{understand}} in Psmith was his fondness for getting into atmospheres that were not his own. He would go {{out of his way}} to do this.

Psmith, on the contrary, seemed to be bored by them, and infinitely preferred <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> who lived in quite another world. Mike was not a snob. He simply had not the ability to be at his ease with people in another class from his own. He did not know what <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> them about, unless they were cricket professionals.
