5|$|The Nazi war {{economy was}} a mixed economy that {{combined}} {{a free market}} with central planning.

At the peak there were approximately 900 T-62s in service. Currently 100 are in service and 70 are stored.|$|R
5|$|During the 1990s, the Eurasian {{integration}} process was slow, possibly {{due to the}} economic crisis experienced after the dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> size of the countries involved (Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan cover an area of about 20 million km²). As a result, numerous treaties have been signed by member states to establish the regional trading bloc gradually.|$|E
5|$|Following the Allies' May 1945 victory, the Soviets {{effectively}} occupied Central and Eastern Europe, while strong US and Western {{allied forces}} remained in Western Europe. In Germany and Austria, France, Britain, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States established zones of occupation and a loose framework for parceled four-power control.|$|E
5|$|The M9 {{was used}} in World War II, the Arab-Israeli War of 1948, the Korean War, the Suez Crisis, and many other conflicts. The {{production}} of M9s was leased to other countries, like most other IH half-tracks produced in World War II.

5|$|With {{relations}} deteriorating between <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States, {{the three}} western Allies met in March 1948 to merge their zones of occupation {{and allow the}} formation of what became the Federal Republic of Germany, commonly known as West Germany. Meanwhile, the eastern Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic, commonly known as East Germany.|$|E
5|$|With the {{background}} of a buildup in tensions between <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States, and the deployment of Soviet RSD-10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe, NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany. This deployment would have placed missiles just 10minutes' striking distance from Moscow.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s, {{reflecting}} {{both the}} threat of possible invasion by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> realities of nuclear warfare, Swiss military doctrine changed to that of a dynamic (mobile) defense that included missions for the Swiss Air Force outside of its territory, in order to defeat standoff attacks and nuclear threats, including the possibility of defensive employment of air-delivered nuclear weapons. However the inability to field an air force of sufficient capability to carry out such missions led to a return of traditional doctrine.|$|E

5|$|By early 1985, Reagan's anti-communist {{position}} {{had developed}} into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrinewhich, in addition to containment, formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments. Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union. Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims {{from around the world}} to participate in the jihad against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Cheney {{publicly}} {{expressed concern}} that nations such as Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, could acquire nuclear components {{after the collapse of}} the Soviet Union in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> disintegration of the Warsaw Pact obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Gierek government's growing {{difficulties}} led also {{to increased}} {{dependence on the}} Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomułka's rule. The constitution, amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after protests by intellectuals and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, many {{claims of}} the {{discovery}} of nobelium were made from laboratories in Sweden, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States. Although the Swedish scientists soon retracted their claims, the priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and it was not until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) credited the Soviet team with the discovery, but retained nobelium, the Swedish proposal, as the name of the element due to its long-standing use in the literature.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, many {{claims of}} the {{synthesis}} of lawrencium of varying quality were made from laboratories in <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, and while the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established lawrencium as the official name for the element and gave the American team credit for the discovery, this was reevaluated in 1997, giving both teams shared credit for the discovery but not changing the element's name.|$|E
5|$|Large {{stockpiles}} of weapons-grade plutonium were built up by both <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States during the Cold War. The U.S. reactors at Hanford and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina produced 103tonnes, {{and an estimated}} 170tonnes of military-grade plutonium was produced in the USSR. Each year about 20tonnes of the element is still produced as a by-product of the nuclear power industry. As much as 1000tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|Lê Duẩn visited China from 20–25 November 1977 to seek aid. CPC Chairman Hua Guofeng {{stated that}} Sino/Vietnamese {{relations}} had deteriorated because they held different principles.

Lê Duẩn countered that the only difference was how they viewed <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> United States. Following his visit, China (Xinhua) condemned COMECON. China halted all economic development projects between May and July 1978. During this period total Chinese aid to Vietnam amounted to $300 million.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{reacted to}} the growing {{strength}} of Trotsky's supporters with a major political massacre of people within <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> assassination of Trotsky's supporters and family abroad. He had agents go through historical documents and photos in order to attempt to erase Trotsky's memory from the history books. According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to anti-semitism to whip up sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew). Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The Angolan Civil War was notable {{due to the}} {{combination}} of Angola's violent internal dynamics and massive foreign intervention.

Moreover, the Angolan conflict became closely intertwined with the Second Congo War in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, {{as well as with}} the South African Border War.|$|E
