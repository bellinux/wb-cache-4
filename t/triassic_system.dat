40|$|Whether {{there is}} an {{effective}} deep-buried lacustrine <b>Triassic</b> petroleum <b>system</b> in the Junggar Basin, NW China, has been enigmatic and debated for a long time. Here we conduct an oil-source correlation to address this issue. Results show that the extracted bitumens from the Triassic mudstones in the central basin have distinctive stable carbon isotope and biomarker compositions compared to the Permian-sourced and Jurassic-sourced hydrocarbons, the other two recognized sources {{in the study area}}. These characteristics include δ 13 C value of - 30. 46 ~- 26. 30 ‰, β-carotane/maximum n-alkane of 0. 22 – 0. 41, Pr/Ph of 1. 00 – 1. 51, C 24 tetracyclic terpane/C 26 tricyclic terpane of 0. 43 – 0. 96, Ts/Tm of 0. 34 – 0. 64, gammacerane/C 30 hopane of 0. 10 – 0. 14, and regular steranes C 27 > C 28 < C 29 with C 29 sterane in dominance (40 – 50 %). These suggest that the Triassic mudstones in the study area host fresh lacustrine organic matters with high input of higher plants. The Triassic-reservoired crude oils and extracts can be divided into two types. Through oil-source correlation, we infer that both type A and type B oils are derived from mixed Permian and Triassic source rocks. Linear regression analysis shows that the contribution from Triassic mudstones to type A and B oils is 67 % and 31 %, respectively. This implies that the deep-buried Triassic lacustrine mudstones in the Junggar Basin may have some oil-generation potential and thus might represent a new case of <b>Triassic</b> petroleum <b>systems</b> in China and deserves a more detailed and thorough study in future exploration and exploitation...|$|R

40|$|An {{integrated}} heavy-mineral, mineral-chemical and zircon-dating {{study of}} the Triassic succession exposed on the south Devon coast, {{in the western part}} of the Wessex Basin, indicates derivation from a combination of granitic and metasedimentary lithologies of ages of mostly over 550 Ma. These sources were probably located at a relatively proximal location near the southern margin of the basin. Derivation from more distal sources in the Armorican Massif or local Variscan sources to the west appears unlikely in view of the scarcity of Permo-Carboniferous (Variscan-age) zircons. The Budleigh Salterton Pebble Bed Formation was derived from a different combination of source lithologies than the Otter Sandstone Formation, the former including staurolite-grade metasediments that were absent in the catchment area of the Otter Sandstone. The Devon coast succession has provenance characteristics that differ from equivalent sandstones further east in the Wessex Basin, and from sandstones in the East Irish Sea Basin to the north. These differences indicate that sediment supply patterns to the linked <b>Triassic</b> basin <b>systems</b> in southern Britain are complex, involving multiple distinct sub-catchment areas, and that heavy-mineral studies have considerable potential for unravelling these sub- -catchment area sources...|$|R

40|$|Originally {{identified}} as an ornithischian dinosaur, Crosbysaurus harrisae {{has been found in}} New Mexico, Arizona, and its type locality in Texas, as well as in North Carolina. The genus has been reassessed by other workers in light of reinterpretations about the postcrania of another putative Triassic ornithischian, Revueltosaurus. The understanding of Triassic dental faunas has become more complicated by the extreme convergence between pseudosuchian archosaurs and ornithischian dinosaur dental morphologies. We report here on a new specimen of Crosbysaurus (MNA V 10666) from the Chinle Formation at Comb Ridge in southeastern Utah. This new specimen is assigned to Crosbysaurus sp. {{on the basis of the}} unique compound posterior denticles, labiolingual width, and curvature. While MNA V 10666 does not help resolve the affinities of Crosbysaurus, it does represent the extension of the geographic range of this taxon for approximately 250 kilometers. This is the first record of the genus Crosbysaurus in Utah and as such it represents the northernmost known record of this taxon. This indicates that Crosbysaurus was not limited to the southern area of the Chinle/Dockum deposition but instead was widespread across the Late <b>Triassic</b> paleoriver <b>systems</b> of western Pangea.

40|$|Abstract. – Middle Triassic arc-related extensional {{tectonics}} in {{the western}} Tethys generated a complex pattern of intra-and backarc basins. We studied volcano-sedimentary successions of subsided continental-margin blocks (Mts. <umberak and Ivan 71 ica) and of dismembered incomplete ophiolite sequences interpreted as remnants of a backarc basin (Mts. Medvednica and Kalnik) in northwestern Croatia. We dated the successions with radiolarians, conodonts, foraminifers, algae, and sponges. The continental margin experienced a phase of accelerated subsidence in the late Anisian that was approximately coincident {{with the onset of}} intermediate and acidic volcanism; pelagic sediments with volcaniclastics accumulated atop subsided carbonate platforms. These relatively shallow basins were later infilled completely by prograding platforms in the late Ladinian-Carnian. In the backarc basin, sea-floor spreading initiated near the Anisian-Ladinian boundary and continued into the late Carnian. Pillow basalts were erupted and interlayered with radiolarian cherts and shales. The studied area was a part of a larger <b>Triassic</b> arc-backarc <b>system</b> preserved in the southern Alps, Alpine-Carpathian Belt, Dinarides, and Hellenides.

30|$|With the {{continuous}} development of oilfield exploration, it becomes increasingly difficult, {{starting from the}} source rock, to find primary oil and gas pools, resulting in a stalemate in petroleum exploration. Meanwhile, secondary hydrocarbon pools are considered an important domain for high-efficiency reservoirs in recent years, because of their large exploration area, high quality, shallow burial depth and rapid productivity construction. In recent years, there have been significant breakthroughs in exploring for secondary oil and gas pools {{both at home and}} abroad, for example, the Middle–Upper Devonian (Frasnian) and <b>Triassic</b> petroleum <b>system</b> in the Midwest of the Ghdames Basin, North Africa (Underdown and Redfern 2008), multi-billion barrel accumulation of heavy oil discovered in the Prudhoe Bay-Kuparuk area of the Arctic Alaska, North America (Bird and Houseknecht 2011), the Vuktyl oilfield in the Timan-Pechora Basin, Russia (IHS 2009), and the Upper Cretaceous Sarvak reservoir in the Azadengan oil field, southwest Iran (Du et al. 2016). In China, there also have been many discoveries, such as the Carboniferous and Triassic hydrocarbon pools in the Northern Tarim Basin (Zhu et al. 2013 a, b), the Neogene oil and gas pools in the Bohai Bay and Qaidam Basins (Xu et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2003; Li et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015), the Jurassic natural gas in the Western Sichuan Foreland Basin (Ye et al. 2017), the industrial oil flow discovered in the Damoguaihe Formation in the Hailar Basin (Dong 2011), and the bead-like secondary oil and gas pools in the Heidimiao oil layer in the Songliao Basin (Huang and Guo 2014; Han et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|During the dismembering of the Pangea supercontinent, middle–late Triassic sub-volcanic {{alkaline}} rocks were emplaced in central Sicily. These rocks have an alkali basaltic composition and show OIB-like incompatible element patterns in primitive mantle-normalized diagrams (e. g., enrichments in HFSE and LREE coupled with high HFSE/LILE ratios), {{as well as}} slightly positive epsilon Nd values. Only subtle effects of crustal contamination at shallow depths emerge from geochemical data. These characteristics are very different compared with the Permian calcalkaline magmas from elsewhere in SW Europe still carrying the geochemical signature of modifications related to the Variscan orogeny. The mineralogical, geochemical and isotopic compositions of the investigated samples from central Sicily are also different from the coeval shoshonitic volcano-plutonic formations of Southern Alps (Dolomites). The incompatible element composition and Nd isotopic ratios are consistent with low-degree partial melting of a moderately depleted asthenospheric mantle source, with a negligible involvement of the thinned continental crust. The studied alkaline basalts represent the only known evidence of {{a segment of the}} <b>Triassic</b> rift <b>system</b> associated with early Pangea breakup in central Sicily. The close similarity of the central Sicily Triassic alkali basalts with coeval basalts emplaced along former orogenic sutures across the peri-Mediterranean area suggests a common origin related, at least partly, to asthenospheric passive upwelling following the tectonic collapse of the Variscan Belt. These rocks provide new constraints on the spatial–temporal distribution, magma source evolution and geodynamic meaning of the widespread Permo-Triassic basic magmatism developed {{after the end of the}} Variscan Orogeny in southwestern Europe...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} correlations between palaeodiversity and sampling proxies.

We find that proxies for sedimentary rock volume and accessibility do not correlate with palaeodiversity until the removal of facies-related preservational and palaeoecological factors.

Significant correlations between worker effort and palaeodiversity are detected, although {{this is likely to}} be a result of the preferential sampling of formations already known to be rich in fossils.

40|$|Source rocks {{from the}} lower part of the Triassic Kurrachine Dolomite Formation were {{investigated}} in order to establish their role in the Petroleum System of the Hayan Block. Recent deep well discoveries accentuate the Triassic Kurrachine Dolomite Formation as a major play for hydrocarbon accumulations. The characteristic play definition is shown for the Hayan Block based on three defined elements: petroleum charge system, the source-reservoir formation characteristics and the trap-seal type. According to geochemical analyses, Triassic source rocks are of good generative potential, but they are not abundant (only thin layers were estimated). It was presumed that hydrocarbon generation and migration occurred from deeper Middle-Lower Palaeozoic Formations. Exploration results show that the generative potential of the Triassic source rocks in the Hayan Block was underestimated. Correlation and calibration of the petrophysical parameters from well logs and geochemical analyses show a much larger volume of mature source rocks than that predicted purely from geochemical analyses. The Kurrachine Dolomite Formation resistivity of 20 Ωm is typical of the area, and it represents the threshold value (Net Pay cutoff criteria) between immature and mature source rocks. Net Pay thickness (effective thickness), of mature and generative source rock intervals, exceeds more than 150 m in some wells. A calculated volumetric characteristic of source rocks indicates their high hydrocarbon generating capability. Intensive tectonic activity formed fractured zones as favourable reservoir rocks, so in some areas, practically no or very short migration pathways exist. Expelled hydrocarbons (within explored area) have not been accumulated into discrete reservoirs, thus the system is generating oil in situ. The results accentuate the existence of a key <b>Triassic</b> Petroleum <b>System</b> in the area of the Hayan Block.

The amount and structural style of inversion is provided in this paper by a three-dimensional approach to the relationship between inversion of rift-related structures and spatial variations in late Cenozoic stress fields.

We present a 3 -D approach for studying the tectonic inversion of the sub-basin master fault associated with strike-slip–reverse to strike-slip faulting stress regimes. We suggest that the inversion of Triassic extensional structures, striking NNW to WNW, occurred during the Plio–Pleistocene in those areas with strike-slip–reverse to strike-slip faulting stress regime, while in the reverse faulting stress regime domain they remain fossilized.

40|$|From the stratigraphic {{point of}} view the Tretto and Mount Summano area belongs to the so called “Recoarese”, a region {{including}} the upper Agno, the Leogra and the Posina valleys. The Recoarese differs from the neighbouring areas because it contains the southernmost outcrop of the Southalpine crystalline basement. On the basement a thick mainly sedimentary succession lies, which represents the time interval from the upper Permian to lower Miocene. The <b>Triassic</b> <b>system</b> makes exclusive the Recoarese: during the Triassic time this area was mainly a marine environment located on the northern border of a wide emerged area, at present buried beneath the Po Plain alluvial deposits. Detrital inputs from the continent fed the basin, while marginal marine environments were favourable to ecological niches. Marine, coastal and continental facies alternated continuously with time. This {{was due to the}} special paleogeographic location, which registered also slight sea level fluctuations. The recent recognition that most of these fluctuations are eustatic oblige to re-interpret the Recoaro Triassic rocks in terms of sequence stratigraphy. The contribution given by our area is surprising, if we consider that the sequence stratigraphy can interpret global scale events. The outcrop of the crystalline basement and Permo-Triassic units in the Recoarese results from erosion of a block tectonically uplifted during the Neogene shortening of the Southalpine chain. The Mount Summano is carved on an anticline with a steep southern limb developed in the hanging wall of the Bassano Line, which is a SSE-verging thrust. The Tretto valley results from selective erosion of the relatively low resistant rocks underlying the Dolomia Principale.

40|$|Crevasse splay {{complexes}} in floodplain sequences {{are potential}} low net-to-gross tough gas reservoirs. The porosity and permeability of these reservoirs is low, but lateral amalgamation by compensational stacking can create extensive lobe-shaped sediment bodies with reservoir potential. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to characterize the development of crevasse complexes by describing lithology, morphology and grain size distribution of ancient fluvial systems in outcrop. A sequence stratigraphic interpretation of these systems is made. Crevasse splays in a lacustrine interval in the Cornudella Formation (M. Eocene, Tremp-Graus Basin, NE Spain) and crevasse splays in the Huesca fluvial fan (E. Miocene, Ebro Basin, NE Spain) were studied and sampled. Literature research, fieldwork, core study and grain size analysis are the main methods used for the research described in this thesis. The results are compared to contemporary crevasse splays in the Rio Colorado system, Altiplano Basin, Bolivia and to cores and wireline logs of a fluvial <b>Triassic</b> <b>system</b> in the West Netherlands Basin. These systems have similar depositional environments. In the Huesca fluvial fan system paleosol bound stratigraphic units consist of crevasse complexes, fluvial channels and overbank deposits. The crevasse complexes are coarsening upward and are interpreted as transitional avulsion stratigraphy coalescing along a feeder channel. The stacking patterns observed in the studied intervals can be self organising and need no allogenic forcing. Models relying on autogenic controls show similar stratigraphy. The vertical trends and gamma ray response in the Huesca fluvial system {{are similar to those}} of the cores from the West Netherlands Basin. The quantitative results of the 3 -D outcrop studies can be used to make predictions from 1 -D cores. Hydrocarbon production from these crevasse complexes may be possible, but is likely to need artificial enhancing due to low porosity and permeability. Connectivity with fluvial channels is common and is possibly beneficial to production. The studied outcrops may serve as an analogue to enhance 3 -D reservoir architecture modelling and improve production of these reservoirs.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to analyse the Norian-Rhaetian intraplatform basin {{in the area of}} M. Zenone (Tremosine, BS), {{highlighting}} the stratigraphic relationships between the different mapped Formations, that are the Dolomia Principale and Calcare di Zorzino Fms. A detailed geological survey (1 : 10. 000) was carried out in attempt to reconstruct the original sedimentary basin, recognizing four different lithofacies, here considered as different units: Dolomia Principale s. s., Calcare di Zorzino s. s., Breccia and Dolomitized Bioherm. The result of such analysis points to heteropic relationships between the lithofacies, {{due to the fact that}} the near-margin Breccia bordered between the basinal limestone and the carbonate platform and bio-constructed mounds are contained in the Calcare di Zorzino limestone, which proves that different early mounds (which later formed the Bioherm) grew alongside with the Calcare di Zorzino Formation. The relationships between the lithofacies throughout the area in exam appear to be slightly affected by alpine tectonic. The faults recognized during the survey testified a <b>Triassic</b> extensional tectonic <b>system,</b> successively reactivated as strike-slip faults. An attempt to a biostratigraphical analysis was carried out, although without success. However, the only collected conodont fragment from 2 samples of the Calcare di Zorzino (4 -kg-each) permits to understand the maturity of the organic matter. This fragment has CAI= 1, 5 (Conodont Alteration Index), which brought to the conclusion that the oil present in fractures and cavities of the rocks migrated from other Formations, probably from the Argillite di Riva di Solto, located northward...|$|R
40|$|Phanerozoic granitoids are {{widespread}} in the Korean Peninsula and form {{a part of the}} East Asian Cordilleran-type granitoid belt extending from southeastern China to Far East Russia. Here we present SHRIMP zircon U-Pb ages and geochemical and Nd isotopic compositions of Late Paleozoic to Early Jurassic granitoid plutons in the northern Gyeongsang basin, southeastern Korea; namely the Jangsari, Yeongdeok, Yeonghae, and Satkatbong plutons. The granite and associated gabbroic rocks from the Jangsari pluton were coeval and respectively dated at 257. 3 ± 2. 0 Ma and 255. 7 ± 1. 4 Ma. This result represents the first finding of a Late Paleozoic pluton in South Korea. Three granite samples from the Yeongdeok pluton yielded a slightly younger age span ranging from 252. 9 ± 2. 5 Ma to 246. 7 ± 2. 1 Ma. Two diorite samples from the Yeonghae pluton gave much younger ages of 195. 1 ± 1. 9 Ma and 196. 3 ± 1. 6 Ma. An Early Jurassic age of 192. 4 ± 1. 6 Ma was also obtained from a diorite sample from the Satkatbong pluton. The mineral assemblage and Al 2 O 3 /(Na 2 O + K 2 O) versus Al 2 O 3 /(CaO + Na 2 O + K 2 O) relationship indicate that all the analyzed plutons are subduction zone granitoids. Enrichments in large-ion-lithophile-elements and depletions in high-field-strength-elements of these plutons are also concordant with geochemical characteristics typical for the subduction zone magma. The presence of Late Permian to Early <b>Triassic</b> arc <b>system</b> is in contrast with the conventional idea that the arc magmatism along the continental margin of the Korean Peninsula has commenced from Early Jurassic after the termination of Triassic collisional orogenesis. The epsilon-Nd(t) values of the granitoid plutons are consistently positive (2. 4 - 4. 6), suggesting that crustal residence time of the basement beneath the Gyeongsang basin is relatively short. Moreover, the reevaluation of previously-published data reveals that geochemical compositions of the Yeongdeok pluton are compatible with those of high-silica adakites; La/Yb = 37. 5 - 114. 6, Sr/Y = 138. 2 - 214. 0, SiO 2 = 62. 9 - 72. 0 wt. %, Al 2 O 3 = 15. 5 - 17. 0 wt. %, Sr = 562 - 1173 ppm, MgO = 0. 4 - 1. 6 wt. %, Y = 3 - 6 ppm, Yb = 0. 18 - 0. 45 ppm, and Eu/Eu* = 0. 92 - 1. 31. The occurrence of adakites in southeastern Korea, and presumably in the Hida belt of central-western Japan, is indicative of a hot subduction regime developing at least partly along the East Asian continental margin during the Permian-Triassic transition period...|$|R
