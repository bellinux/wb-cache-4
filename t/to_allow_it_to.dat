5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The meat is {{considered}} unsuitable {{to eat in}} some areas, while in other areas it is considered {{an important source of}} protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the National Science Foundation granted $11 {{million to}} modify an A-10 for weather {{research}} for CIRPAS at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and {{in collaboration with}} scientists from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SDSM), replacing SDSM's retired North American T-28 Trojan. The A-10's armor is expected <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> survive the extreme meteorological conditions, such as 200mph hailstorms, found in inclement high-altitude weather events.|$|E

5|$|A Nintendo 3DS {{version of}} the game, titled 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was {{released}} {{as part of the}} 3D Classics line in 2013. This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of the game, is not emulated; rather, the game's code was restructured <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of the 3DS system's stereoscopic 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash move, a CRT-style filter, and the option to start the game from any level.|$|E

5|$|Although Kawasaki's theorem {{completely}} {{describes the}} folding patterns that have flat-folded states, {{it does not}} describe the folding process needed to reach that state. For some folding patterns, {{it may be necessary}} to curve or bend the paper while transforming it from a flat sheet to its flat-folded state, rather than keeping the rest of the paper flat and only changing the dihedral angles at each fold. For rigid origami (a type of folding that keeps the surface flat except at its folds, suitable for hinged panels of rigid material rather than flexible paper), additional conditions are needed on a folding pattern <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> move from an unfolded state to a flat-folded state.|$|E
5|$|Chesham {{also had}} {{extensive}} goods facilities, particularly for coal; the goods yard was initially {{equipped with a}} mobile 5-ton crane, replaced by a fixed 8-ton crane between 1898–1900. The outward transport of watercress, a major local industry, also generated significant traffic. During the electrification of the line in 1957–60 the station was equipped with a bay platform for passenger trains, <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> accommodate both through services to and from Baker Street and the Chalfont& Latimer–Chesham shuttle simultaneously. This bay platform was closed on 29 November 1970 {{and is now a}} garden.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because it provided a base nunatak for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E
5|$|Preservation of {{the outer}} {{parts of the body}} was {{normally}} achieved through a combination of resins and animal skin wrappings. The resins were prepared with a mixture of minerals, plants, and fats. These were spread across the body prior <b>to</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> dry, either in the sun or through smoking. Finally, the deceased was wrapped in animal skins and laid to rest. The number of animal skins used in wrapping corresponded with the individual’s social status, with kings being wrapped with up to 15 skins.|$|R

5|$|In 1959 the Defense Department ordered {{one more}} {{study on the}} basic Zeus system, this time by the PSAC. They put {{together}} a heavyweight group {{with some of the}} most famous and influential scientists forming its core, including Hans Bethe who had worked on the Manhattan Project and later on the hydrogen bomb, Wolfgang Panofsky, the director of the High-Energy Physics Lab at Stanford University, and Harold Brown, director of the Lawrence Livermore weapons lab, among similar luminaries. The PSAC report was almost a repeat of the RBIG. They recommended that Zeus should not be built, at least without significant changes <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> better deal with the emerging problems.|$|E

5|$|Like the Storm II, the Mark III was {{initially}} {{available only to}} the military with versions set to be delivered to the Israel Police in 2009. A civilian version would only be released if the local tax code was modified <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> compete with foreign imports of the same class. AIL states that if such a thing would happen, a petrol engine version could be offered. Regarding Export markets, the Storm 3 has already seen use in several countries, especially in its armored version.|$|E

5|$|Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt, arriving on 8 April 1906, {{where she was}} given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909. Her engines and boilers were reconditioned, her mainmast was removed and she received additional six-inch guns. Six more guns in lightly armored casemates were added on the upper deck, positioned on each side in the intervals between the main-deck six-inch guns. In addition the bow gun {{was moved to the}} upper deck <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> fire to each side. This increased the ship's broadside by four guns.|$|E
5|$|The African crake (Crex egregia) is {{a bird in}} {{the rail}} family that breeds in most of sub-Saharan Africa away from the arid south and southwest.

This crake is a partial migrant, {{moving away from the}} equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> breed elsewhere.

5000|$|A {{flying fox}} {{is a small}} cable car, often {{propelled}} by gravity, and used as an item of children's play equipment and more rarely for other purposes. The term flying fox is Australian English and New Zealand English. In other countries, it {{is also known as}} a zip-line or zip-wire.

5|$|The Navy, however, {{still had}} a {{requirement}} for a ship capable of defeating enemy cruisers and the original concept was revived as Project 69. The proposed size of the ship continually escalated as the requirement was revised <b>to</b> <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> fight larger ships like the German s. The preliminary design was finally approved in January 1939 and two ships were laid down in November 1939, before the detailed design had even been approved.|$|E

In 2014, the museum hosted Streamliners at Spencer, with notable 1930s - 1950s era locomotives gathered around the Bob Julian Roundhouse turntable for a four-day event. Streamliners at Spencer included the Class J 611 Steam Passenger locomotive, visiting from the Virginia Museum of Transportation.
