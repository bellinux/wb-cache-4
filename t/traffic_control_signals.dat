40|$|Abstract—Real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> is an {{integral}} part of the urban <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> system, and providing effective real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> for a large complex traffic network is an extremely challenging distributed control problem. This paper adopts the multiagent system approach to develop distributed unsupervised <b>traffic</b> responsive <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> models, where each agent in the system is a local traffic signal controller for one intersection in the traffic network. The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism. The second multiagent system is developed by integrating the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem in fuzzy neural networks (NN). The problem of real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> is especially challenging if the agents are used for an infinite horizon problem, where online learning has to take place continuously once the agent-based traffic signal controllers are implemented into the traffic network. A comprehensive simulation model of a section of the Central Business District of Singapore has been developed using PARAMICS microscopic simulation program. Simulation results show that the hybrid multiagent system provides significant improvement in traffic conditions when evaluated against an existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> algorithm as well as the SPSA-NN-based multiagent system as the complexity of the simulation scenario increases. Using the hybrid NN-based multiagent system, the mean delay of each vehicle was reduced by 78 % and the mean stoppage time, by 85 % compared to the existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> algorithm. The promising results demonstrate the efficacy of the hybrid NN-based multiagent system in solving large-scale <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> problems in a distributed manner.

40|$|SUMMARY The traffic {{congestion}} problem {{in urban areas}} is worsening since traditional <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems cannot provide] efficient traffic regulation. Therefore, dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) recently has received increasing attention. This study devised a multi-agent architecture, the Adaptive and Cooperative Traffic light Agent Model (ACTAM), for a decentralized <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> system. The proposed architecture comprises a data storage and communication layer, a traffic regulation factor processing layer, and a decision-making layer. This study focused on utilizing the cooperation of multi-agents and the prediction mechanism of our architecture, the Forecast Module, to forecast future traffic volume in each individual intersection. The Forecast Module is designed to forecast traffic volume in an intersection via multi-agent cooperation by exchanging traffic volume information for adjacent intersections, since vehicles passing through nearby intersections were believed to significantly influence the traffic volume of specific intersections. The proposed architecture can achieve dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control.</b> Thus, total delay time of the traffic network under ACTAM can be reduced by 37 % compared to the conventional fixed sequence <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> strategy. Consequently, <b>traffic</b> congestion in urban areas can be alleviated by adopting ACTAM. key words: intelligent agents, multi-agent systems (MAS), decentralized <b>control,</b> dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, traffic {{congestion}} has become a growing concern due to increasing vehicle ownerships in urban areas. Intersections {{are one of the}} major bottlenecks that contribute to urban traffic congestion. Traditional <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> systems cannot adjust the timing pattern depending on road traffic demand. This results in excessive delays for road users. Adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> in a connected vehicle environment has shown a powerful ability to effectively alleviate urban traffic congestions to achieve desirable objectives (e. g., delay minimization). Connected vehicle technology, as an emerging technology, is a mobile data platform that enables the real-time data exchange among vehicles and between vehicles and infrastructure. Although several reviews about <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> or connected vehicles have been written, a systemic review of adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> in a connected vehicle environment has not been made. Twenty-six eligible studies searched from six databases constitute the review. A quality evaluation was established based on previous research instruments and applied to the current review. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to critically review the existing methods of adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> in a connected vehicle environment and to compare the advantages or disadvantages of those methods. Further, a systematic framework on connected vehicle based adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> is summarized to support the future research. Future research is needed to develop more efficient and generic adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>control</b> methods in a connected vehicle environment...|$|R
40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals</b> are {{valuable}} devices {{for the control}} of motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Because they assign {{the right of way}} to the various traffic movements, traffic signals exert a profound influence on traffic flow. <b>Traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>signals,</b> when properly located and operated, usually have {{one or more of the}} following advantages: 1. They can provide for the orderly movement of traffic. 2. Where proper physical layouts and control measures are used, they can increase the traffic handling capacity of the intersection. 3. They can reduce the frequency of certain types of crashes, especially the right-angle type. 4. Under favorable conditions, they can be coordinated to provide for continuous or nearly continuous movement of traffic, at a definite speed, along a given route. 5. They can be used to interrupt heavy traffic at intervals to permit other traffic, vehicular or pedestrian, to cross. Even though warranted, if not properly placed, operated, or maintained, the following can result: • Excessive delay may be caused. • Disobedience of the signal indication is encouraged. • The use of less adequate routes may be induced in an attempt to avoid the signal. • Crash frequency (especially the rearBend type) can be significantly increased...|$|E
