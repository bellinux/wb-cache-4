25|$|In early May 1973, the Vinh wiretap went silent. Damage to {{the relay}} was suspected. There were seven {{unsuccessful}} attempts {{to replace the}} relay between 8 May and 16 June 1973, though not by the Hughes 500P. The CIA's use of the black helicopter from Area 51 <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on the Paris Peace Talk discussions and other intelligence had ended.|$|E
25|$|This {{case was}} one of the first trials widely covered by the media. Newspapers from Chicago would report on it daily, and some of them would try <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on the jury deliberation. At the time, the case was called the celebrity case and is {{credited}} with putting murder trials in the media. This case also {{was one of}} the first to use forensic experts to solve a crime.|$|E
25|$|The FBI {{participated in}} the Venona Project, a pre-World War II joint project with the British <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on Soviet spies in the UK and the United States. They did not {{initially}} realize that espionage was being committed, but the Soviet's multiple use of one-time pad ciphers (which with single use are unbreakable) created redundancies that allowed some intercepts to be decoded. These established that espionage was being carried out.|$|E

25|$|The Vinh wiretap was an American espionage {{operation}} of the Vietnam War. From 7 December 1972 through early May 1973, CIA telephone intercepts of North Vietnamese military communications were supplied to American diplomat Henry Kissinger. As border phone lines were well watched, {{the decision was made}} to tap a military multiplex line in the Vietnamese heartland near Vinh. The CIA used a black helicopter to set a clandestine wiretap <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on Paris Peace Talks discussions and other intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The kunai {{was a heavy}} pointed tool, {{possibly}} {{derived from}} the Japanese masonry trowel, which it closely resembles. Although it is often portrayed in popular culture as a weapon, the kunai was primarily used for gouging holes in walls. Knives and small saws (hamagari) were also used to create holes in buildings, where they served as a foothold or a passage of entry. A portable listening device (saoto hikigane) was used <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on conversations and detect sounds.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} that a smart TV is vulnerable to attacks. Some serious security bugs have been discovered, and some successful attempts to run malicious code to get unauthorized access were documented on video. There {{is evidence}} {{that it is possible}} to gain root access to the device, install malicious software, access and modify configuration information for a remote control, remotely access and modify files on TV and attached USB drives, access camera and microphone. There have also been concerns that hackers may be able to remotely turn on the microphone on a smart TV and be able <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on private conversations.|$|E
50|$|IM {{connections}} sometimes {{occur in}} plain text, making them vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping.</b> Also, IM client software often requires {{the user to}} expose open UDP ports to the world, raising {{the threat posed by}} potential security vulnerabilities.|$|R
50|$|Governments {{have also}} been accused of adding such malware to {{software}} themselves. According to documents released by Edward Snowden, the NSA has used covert partnerships with software companies to make commercial encryption software exploitable <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping,</b> or <b>to</b> insert backdoors.|$|R
50|$|Because it {{uses the}} HTTPS protocol, it can be {{considered}} to be secure <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping</b> and man-in-the-middle attacks, but it has the disadvantage of requiring the users to connect to particular IP addresses, making it fairly easy to block by almost any firewall.|$|R
25|$|Florinda, Hellena, and Valeria enter, in {{different}} disguises. Hellena {{says that she}} is not in love, but she cannot stop thinking about Willmore. The women see Belvile, Blunt, and Frederick approach, but the fact that Willmore is not with them causes the women to hide and <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on the men. Belvile, Blunt and Frederick have come to retrieve Willmore from Angellica because he has been inside with her for two hours. Willmore comes out and brags about having enjoyed Angellica's charms for free. A servant of Lucetta's enters and takes Blunt back with him to Lucetta's lodgings.|$|E
25|$|His strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, senses, flexibility, durability, endurance, and {{swimming}} are extraordinary {{in comparison to}} normal men. He has wrestled full grown bull apes and gorillas, lions, rhinos, crocodiles, pythons, sharks, tigers, man-size seahorses (once) and even dinosaurs (when he visited Pellucidar). Tarzan is a skilled tracker and uses his exceptional senses of hearing and smell to follow prey or avoid predators, and kills only for food, yet is a skilled thief when raiding African tribal villages or hunting parties that Tarzan has judged to be brutal and deserve no pity, taking their spears, shields, bows, knives, and most importantly, metal arrowheads. A keen sense of hearing allows him <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on conversations between other people near him.|$|E
25|$|According to {{professor}} Jan Arild Audestad, at the standardization process {{which started in}} 1982, A5/1 was originally proposed to have a key length of 128 bits. At that time, 128 bits was projected to be secure for at least 15 years. It is now believed that 128 bits would in fact also still be secure until the advent of quantum computing. Audestad, Peter van der Arend, and Thomas Haug says that the British insisted on weaker encryption, with Haug saying he {{was told by the}} British delegate that this was to allow the British secret service <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> more easily. The British proposed a key length of 48 bits, while the West Germans wanted stronger encryption to protect against East German spying, so the compromise became a key length of 54 bits.|$|E
40|$|Wireless {{networking}} {{is inherently}} insecure. From jamming <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping,</b> from man-inthe middle to spoofing, {{there are a}} variety of attack methods that can be used against the users of wireless networks. Modern wireless data networks use a variety of cryptographic techniques such as encryption and authentication to provide barriers to such infiltrations...|$|R
50|$|Password-authenticated key {{agreement}} systems allow {{two or more}} {{parties that}} agree on a password (or password-related data)to derive shared keys without exposing the password or keys to network attack.Earlier generations of challenge-response authentication systemshave also been used with passwords, but these have generallybeen subject <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping</b> and/or brute-force attacks on the password.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- We propose an {{authentication}} scheme resistant <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping</b> attacks. Users select an alphanumeric password with {{a length of}} 9 - 15 symbols. They can use this password in the traditional manner from a secure client. The same password {{can also be used}} from a non-secure client in a manner highly resistant <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping</b> attacks. Although more complex than traditional password entry, in our tests 11 out of 13 users had overall success rates of 80 % and above, and 12 of the 13 users had 100 % success rates after the initial learning stage. The average authentication time is 1 - 2 minutes, depending on the password length. Like all similar {{authentication scheme}}s reported to date, this scheme is too cumbersome for general use, but could be useful for special situations and with motivated users...|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} and unique property of {{quantum key distribution}} {{is the ability of}} the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system. A third party trying <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using quantum superpositions or quantum entanglement and transmitting information in quantum states, a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to be secure (i.e. the eavesdropper has no information about it), otherwise no secure key is possible and communication is aborted.|$|E
25|$|When the United States later {{took control}} of Japan's South in World War II, Japanese {{officials}} tactically sought to exploit Kagoshima's more northern position, its advancement in shipping technology, and most notably the Satsugū dialect's mutual unintelligibility {{as a method of}} cryptographic communication between Japan and Germany. Dozens of international phone calls had been made using the Satsugū dialect, and despite being able <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on the conversations being sent back and forth, the United States was unable to determine the language spoken. The use of the Satsugū dialect to further obfuscate communication during both the Second World War and possibly the period of the earlier Satsuma Domain has led to a popular belief that Satsugū was created as an artificial language and promoted for the purpose of being unintelligible in order to thwart enemy spies.|$|E
25|$|This {{scaled-down}} Liddy {{plan would}} lead eventually to attempts <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington, D.C., {{and to the}} Watergate scandal. The burglars' first break-in attempt in late May 1972 had been successful, but several problems had arisen with poor-quality information from their bugs, {{and they wanted to}} photograph more documents. Specifically, the burglars were interested in information they thought was held by Lawrence F. O'Brien, head of the DNC. On their second attempt to break in, on the night of June 16–17, 1972, the burglars were discovered by hotel security. After the arrests of the burglars, Dean took custody of evidence and money from the White House safe of E. Howard Hunt, Jr., who had been supervising the Watergate burglaries, and later destroyed some of the evidence before it could be found by investigators.|$|E
30|$|Cooperative communications, {{in which}} {{multiple}} nodes {{help each other}} transmit messages, has been widely acknowledged as {{an effective way to}} improve system performance [1 – 3]. However, due to the broadcast property of radio transmission, wireless communication is vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping</b> which consequently makes security schemes of great importance as a promising approach to communicate confidential messages.|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} remote user {{authentication}} is proposed that requires only public {{information to be}} stored at the verifying host. Like the S/KEY scheme, the new technique uses only symmetric cryptography and is resistant <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping,</b> but, unlike S/KEY, it is resistant to host impersonation attacks. The avoidance of asymmetric cryptographic techniques makes the scheme appropriate for low cost user authentication devices...|$|R
50|$|WEP is a {{deprecated}} algorithm {{to secure}} IEEE 802.11 wireless networks. Wireless networks broadcast messages using radio, {{so are more}} susceptible <b>to</b> <b>eavesdropping</b> than wired networks. When introduced in 1999, WEP was intended to provide confidentiality {{comparable to that of}} a traditional wired network. A later system, called Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) has since been developed to provide stronger security.|$|R
25|$|As a baby, Harry was in {{the room}} when Voldemort's fatal Killing Curse backfired. Voldemort's soul had been {{weakened}} and destabilised by his continuous murders and the creation of his previous Horcruxes. Harry became a Horcrux when a fragment of Voldemort's soul attached itself to him after the unsuccessful curse. The lightning bolt-shaped scar on Harry's forehead {{is a direct result of}} this attempted murder, and the connection that formed as a result is used to explain several important plot points. Throughout the series, Harry is able to receive insight into Voldemort's mental and emotional states, allowing the reader <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on the series' primary antagonist. This insight is usually accompanied by pain in the scar on Harry's forehead. Through Voldemort, Harry also inherited the ability to speak and understand Parseltongue. It is also revealed by Rowling in an interview that Harry's frequent pain in his scar when Voldemort is either active, nearby, or feeling strong emotions, is really the trapped bit of soul yearning to depart from Harry's body and rejoin its master's soul.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a report}} written in 2011 by Vanity Fair {{contributing}} editor David Rose, Afghan Wireless's founder Ehsan Bayat had acted as a confidential informant for the American Federal Bureau of Investigation's Joint Terrorism Task Force since 1998. In a joint endeavor with the National Security Agency known as Operation Foxden, the FBI intended to install equipment into Afghan Wireless's infrastructure that would allow American intelligence agencies <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on cell phone calls in Afghanistan. While the operation was in its planning stages, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 13129, which prohibited US citizens from {{doing business with the}} Taliban. In the interests of completing Operation Foxden, the FBI and NSA aided Bayat and his British partners in circumventing the executive order's ban by transferring ownership of Afghan Wireless to a shell company based in Liechtenstein. Before the plan could be put in place, the American Central Intelligence Agency raised objections to Operation Foxden, citing their traditional preeminence over the FBI in conducting foreign intelligence gathering. The operation was finally authorized to move forward on September 8, 2001—but the September 11 attacks just three days later and the subsequent invasion of Afghanistan rendered the project moot.|$|E
25|$|Grimwood's {{impressive}} debut novel, Breakthrough (Ballantine, 1976), {{was heavily}} influenced by EC Comics, concluding its blend of science fiction, reincarnation and horror elements with a surprising and unpredictable twist ending. Cured of epilepsy by a breakthrough in medical technology, 26-year-old Elizabeth Austin has miniature electrodes implanted in her brain. She can control her seizures by pressing an external remote to activate the electrodes. Adjusting to a normal life, she is ready to patch up a troubled marriage and resume her abandoned career. However, {{as part of the}} implant operation, Elizabeth gave her consent for the insertion of extra electrodes, featuring experimental functions unknown to science. When one of those electrodes is stimulated, Elizabeth experiences memories which are not her own. She discovers the remote has given her the ability <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on her previous life 200 years in the past, and she keeps this a secret from her doctor. Intrigued, she finds the earlier existence appealing and begins to spend more and more time there. Eventually, she discovers that the woman in the past is a murderess who is plotting to kill Elizabeth's husband in the present.|$|E
50|$|Van Eck {{phreaking}} is {{the process}} of remotely displaying the contents of a CRT or LCD by detecting its electromagnetic emissions.

25|$|Operation Nifty Package was an {{operation}} launched by Navy SEALs to prevent Noriega's escape. They sank Noriega's boat and destroyed his jet, {{at a cost}} of four killed and nine wounded. Military operations continued for several weeks, mainly against military units of the Panamanian army. Noriega remained at large for several days, but realizing he had few options {{in the face of a}} massive manhunt and a $1 million reward for his capture, he obtained refuge in the Vatican diplomatic mission in Panama City. The U.S. military's psychological pressure on him and diplomatic pressure on the Vatican mission, however, was relentless, as was the playing of loud rock-and-roll music day and night in a densely populated area. The report of the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff maintains that the music was used principally to prevent parabolic microphones from being used <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> on negotiations, and not as a psychological weapon based around Noriega's supposed loathing of rock music. Noriega finally surrendered to the U.S. military on 3 January 1990. He was immediately put on an MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft and flown to the U.S.|$|E
25|$|By 1905 {{it could}} be stated that the {{national}} Government were supportive {{of the idea of}} setting up a University in Bristol. Here, two piece of fortune occurred. The Blind Asylum on Queen's Rd at the top of Park Street, where the Wills Memorial Building now stands, came up for sale. Travers picked up a telephone line which was shared with the Asylum and was able <b>to</b> <b>eavesdrop</b> and hear the conversation which stated that the Trustees were preparing to sell. Although with a price of £40,000 for the land it seemed unlikely the College could afford to purchase the plot, on 11 January 1906, William Travers was told by Lewis Fry that he had been promised the money to purchase the plot by several members of the Fry family and Wills Family: his brother Joseph Storrs Fry (£10,000), cousin Francis Fry (£5,000), Sir William Henry Wills (£10,000) and Sir Fredrick Wills (£5,000). It was the Wills and Fry families who were the chief benefactors of what became the University of Bristol. Joseph Storrs Fry was a successful businessman but the wealth of the Fry family was small in relation to that of the Wills. Frederick Wills had sat on University College councils and between 1900 and 1906 was the sitting MP for Bristol North, the seat that was previously occupied by Lewis Fry. William Henry Wills was first chairman of Imperial Tobacco and his families personal estate was estimated to make the Wills family one of the richest families in the land.|$|E
