5|$|Harrison was unpopular {{with the}} party and the country, and many of Blaine’s old {{supporters}} encouraged him to run for the nomination. Blaine had denied any interest in the nomination months before his resignation, but some of his friends, including Senator Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania and James S. Clarkson, chairman of the Republican National Committee, <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> false modesty and worked for his nomination anyway. When Blaine resigned from the cabinet, his boosters were certain that he was a candidate, but the majority of the party stood by the incumbent. Harrison was renominated on the first ballot, but die-hard Blaine delegates still gave their champion 182 and 1/6 votes, good enough for second place.|$|E
5|$|Only {{recently}} {{promoted to}} {{general manager of}} the New Jersey system, Stanley had been reluctant to take the position in London and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> one year only, provided he would be free to return to America {{at the end of the}} year. He told the company's senior managers that the company was almost bankrupt and got resignation letters from each of them post-dated by six months. Through better integration of the separate companies within the group and by improving advertising and public relations, he was quickly able to turn the fortunes of the company around, while the company's chairman, Sir Edgar Speyer, renegotiated the debt repayments. In 1908, Stanley joined the company's board and, in 1910, he became the managing director.|$|E
5|$|Richard's reign {{began in}} 1483. At {{the request of}} his brother Edward IV, Richard was acting as Lord Protector for his son Edward V. Richard had Parliament declare Edward V illegitimate and ineligible for the throne, and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> himself. Richard lost {{popularity}} when {{the boy and his}} younger brother disappeared after he incarcerated them in the Tower of London, and his support was further eroded by the popular belief that he was implicated in the death of his wife. Across the English Channel in Brittany, Henry Tudor, a descendant of the greatly diminished House of Lancaster, seized on Richard's difficulties so that he could challenge his claim to the throne. Henry's first attempt to invade England was frustrated by a storm in 1483, but on his second attempt he arrived unopposed on 7 August 1485 on the southwest coast of Wales. Marching inland, Henry gathered support as he made for London. Richard mustered his troops and intercepted Henry's army south of Market Bosworth in Leicestershire. Thomas, Lord Stanley, and Sir William Stanley brought a force to the battlefield, but held back while they decided which side it would be more advantageous to support.|$|E

He forgot that Compton was out of form and out of luck. Instead of the ball going to the rails, it was missed completely and poor Tallon, with his arms full of stumps and bails, had to drop the lot and take the ball.|$|E

500|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus {{remained}} part of {{the royal}} collection of the Dukes of Bavaria for centuries. By the late 18th century, it was regularly featured in public galleries at the Schleissheim Palace. The painting was one of 72 taken to Paris in 1800 by the invading armies of Napoleon I [...] (1769–1821), who was a noted admirer of Alexander the Great. The Louvre held it until 1804, when Napoleon declared himself Emperor of France and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> his own use. When the Prussians captured the Château de Saint-Cloud in 1814 as {{part of the}} War of the Sixth Coalition, they supposedly found the painting hanging in Napoleon's bathroom.|$|E

500|$|Lennon {{then started}} taking LSD {{on a regular}} basis, {{as well as his}} daily use of cannabis. After much {{encouragement}} from him, Cynthia agreed to try LSD one more time, but the adverse effects were the same. Although she said at the time she would never take the drug again, she relented and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the last time a few weeks later, {{on the way to a}} party at Epstein's country house in Warbleton, East Sussex. Although she hated the psychological effects of the drug, from this point she could see the change taking place in her husband: [...] "It was like living with someone who had just discovered religion ... Tensions, bigotry, and bad temper were replaced by understanding and love". In 1970, Lennon confessed he had probably taken LSD one thousand times since 1965, saying: [...] "I used to just eat it all the time". [...] In the decades ahead, Cynthia would always maintain that John's drug use was the beginning of the end for the couple.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the film}} were mostly positive, but there was some {{confusion}} of critics which {{did not know how}} to respond to the film. Some critics <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a historical film instead of a historical fiction. The New York Dramatic Mirror was one such outlet, which stated that they could not verify the authenticity of the story, but found the picture was excellent and artistic. Ever the one to highlight technical faults, the Mirror highlighted the original paintings error in the use of the flag as well as the film's omission of snow. The Morning Telegraph understood the historical fiction being presented and praised the production though they also highlighted technical issues in the splitting of the troops on the landing and the poor pulling of a prop cannon. The Billboard praised the film's acting and photography, but did not specifically refer to whether the film was fictional when it stated, [...] "An incident from history at the period of the Revolution is the makeup of this picture." [...] Some of the highest praise was given by the reviewer of The Moving Picture World which stated, [...] "The story is so well told that the audience is held almost spellbound in places as the reel moves through the changing scenes. It is admirably done, staging, acting and photography combining to make an exceptionally attractive picture of this patriotic subject." ...|$|E

2500|$|This {{aspect of}} Gill's life was little known until {{publication}} of the 1989 biography by Fiona MacCarthy. The 1966 biography by Robert Speaight mentioned none of it.

2500|$|There {{has been}} some {{historical}} controversy over whether Albert Einstein {{was aware of the}} Michelson–Morley results when he developed his theory of special relativity, which pronounced the aether to be [...] "superfluous." [...] In a later interview, Einstein said of the Michelson–Morley experiment, [...] "I was not conscious it had influenced me directly... I guess I just <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> granted that it was true." [...] Regardless of Einstein's specific knowledge, the experiment is today considered the canonical experiment in regards to showing the lack of a detectable aether.|$|E
2500|$|Following Kant, some {{philosophers}} {{have considered}} the relationship between aprioricity, analyticity, and necessity to be extremely close. According to Jerry Fodor, [...] "Positivism, in particular, <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> granted that a priori truths must be necessary...." [...] However, since Kant, the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions had slightly changed. Analytic propositions were largely taken to be [...] "true by virtue of meanings and independently of fact", while synthetic propositions were not—one must conduct some sort of empirical investigation, looking to the world, to determine the truth-value of synthetic propositions.|$|E

2500|$|Jesuit author Felix Just {{also finds}} {{similarities}} between many other Greco-Roman moral writings {{and four of}} the later New Testament epistles (letters). The biblical Household Codes contain instructions for particular groups of people within Christian families or [...] "Households" [...] {{as to how they}} should treat other members of their Household. He writes that most people in the first-century Roman Empire <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> granted that a pater familias had absolute authority and control over his Household. Thus, the secular examples of such [...] "Household Codes" [...] usually just indicated how slaves, children, or wives should act toward their masters, fathers, or husbands, respectively. They quite rarely also tell the adult men how they should treat the slaves, children, or wives who are members of their household.|$|E
2500|$|This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville {{understood}} it, had {{a population}} devoted to [...] "middling" [...] values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America {{was so different}} from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and <b>took</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> granted.
