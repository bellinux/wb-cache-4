5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters that players {{did not want to}} become, but he later found that players enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, whose job is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from <b>The</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side</b> <b>to</b> the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E

With A-Force outlawed, Loki is set to be crowned the new baroness of Arcadia but is preemptively attacked by A-Force. After Loki is defeated, she releases a final blast of energy that breaches the Shield thus allowing the zombie horde on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> enter.|$|E
25|$|The two {{headings}} of {{the tunnel}} workings met on 4 June 1976 when two pilot tunnels were drilled through to <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> check the alignment. Though the official hole-through ceremony had been planned for 17 June, the dignitaries had to be content with shovelling some of the rubble as the TBM had again jammed with loose rock. Mr. L. Dillon, a project supervisor, became {{the first person to}} walk the tunnel end-to-end on 21 June.|$|E

25|$|To further {{restrict}} access, the British built two defended {{positions on}} either side of the northern end of the Inundation, not only to guard against a surprise attack but to prevent desertion by disgruntled members of Gibraltar's garrison. The Advance Guard Room was built on the east side on the foundations of an earlier Spanish fortification which had controlled movement across the strip of land adjoining the Morass. After William Green became Gibraltar's Senior Engineer in 1761, he had the Advance Guard Room (renamed Forbes' Barrier) more heavily fortified and also had the Bayside Barrier constructed on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> control access to the causeway. Both were surrounded by palisades.|$|E
25|$|We {{claim that}} the {{defendant}} is not guilty, but as the court has excluded any testimony, except as to the one issue {{as to whether he}} taught that man descended from a lower order of animals, and we cannot contradict that testimony, there is no logical thing to come except that the jury find a verdict that we may carry to the higher court, purely as a matter of proper procedure. We do not think it is fair to the court or counsel on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> waste a lot of time when we know this is the inevitable result and probably the best result for the case.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of planets {{orbiting}} in the CHZs of red dwarf stars, the extremely close distances to the stars cause tidal locking, {{an important factor in}} habitability. For a tidally locked planet, the sidereal day is as long as the orbital period, causing one side to permanently face the host star and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> face away. In the past, such tidal locking was thought to cause extreme heat on the star-facing side and bitter cold on the opposite side, making many red dwarf planets uninhabitable; however, three-dimensional climate models in 2013, showed that the side of a red dwarf planet facing the host star could have extensive cloud cover, increasing its bond albedo and reducing significantly temperature differences between the two sides.|$|E

25|$|The {{buildings}} are named for David Flett DuPont, who contributed {{a million dollars}} toward the improvement of athletic facilities, whose bequest also facilitated the building of twelve outdoor tennis courts. DuPont, as the two {{buildings are}} collectively known, was the third athletic building constructed on campus, and the second component {{of what is now}} the DAPER Complex (often collectively known as the Z-Center). The Athletic Center (W32) is connected to and immediately west of the Gymnasium (W31), and adjacent on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the Rockwell Cage and the Zesiger Center. W32 houses MIT's fencing, pistol, and rifle teams, while W31 is home to gymnastics, volleyball, and wrestling (although they may compete in the Rockwell Cage). The T-club Lounge is located at the DuPont Athletic Center and is the main venue for DAPER exercise classes.|$|E
25|$|The bullet time {{effect is}} similar but {{slightly}} more complicated, incorporating temporal motion so {{that rather than}} appearing totally frozen, the scene progresses in slow and variable motion. The cameras' positions and exposures were previsualized using a 3D simulation. Instead of firing the cameras simultaneously, the visual effect team fired the cameras fractions of a second after each other, so that each camera could capture the action as it progressed, creating a super slow-motion effect. When the frames were put together, the resulting slow-motion effects reached a frame frequency of 12,000 per second, {{as opposed to the}} normal 24 frames per second of film. Standard movie cameras were placed at the ends of the array to pick up the normal speed action before and after. Because the cameras circle the subject almost completely in most of the sequences, computer technology was used to edit out the cameras that appeared in the background on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side.</b> <b>To</b> create backgrounds, Gaeta hired George Borshukov, who created 3D models based on the geometry of buildings and used the photographs of the buildings themselves as texture.|$|E

"We {{neared the}} fort itself in approaches, which took a great effort, since {{at that time}} there was great cold, and in {{addition}} to that the situation around the fort is rocky, which caused significant upturn; however, despite the difficulty, the approaches have brought us to the sea strait, which is right under the city itself, at the distance of a musket's shot, with which bags full of fur were very helpful, where there were bare rocks. And for <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> ... <b>to</b> perform the approaches, Major-General Bergholtz was sent out with six regiments, which were also nearing the city with approaches." ...|$|E

They find the owner, who confesses to killing the women because they rejected him, and kidnapped and tortured Mathis's partner when he discovered the culprit. Repeatedly at the hotel, Peter receives calls with static, strange noises, and clicks, which he suspects are coming from Newton. In the end, Peter decides and prepares to head back to Boston, but is approached by Newton, who has brought [...] "Mr. Secretary", the man from <b>the</b> <b>Other</b> <b>Side,</b> <b>to</b> see Peter.

500|$|On the foggy {{morning of}} October 6, Sir Henry Clinton landed 2,100 men at Stony Point {{on the west}} side of the Hudson and, with the {{assistance}} of a Loyalist guide, marched them up onto a local rise called the [...] "Timp". [...] After descending <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> a place called Doodletown, they encountered a scouting party that Governor Clinton had sent out for reconnaissance, which retreated toward Fort Clinton after a brief exchange of fire. [...] Sir Henry then divided his force into two attack groups to take the forts. [...] A force of about 900 men under Lieutenant Colonel Campbell, composed of the 52nd and 57th regiments, a detachment of Hessian chasseurs, and about 400 Loyalists led by Beverley Robinson, began the [...] trek around the gorge toward Fort Montgomery, while Sir Henry waited with the remaining 1,200 men at Doodletown before starting on the trail to Fort Clinton in order to give Campbell time to make the longer journey before beginning simultaneous attacks on the two forts.|$|E
500|$|Several {{accounts}} of the sinking have been preserved that describe the incident, but the only confirmed eyewitness account is the testimony of a surviving Flemish crewman written down by the Holy Roman Emperor's ambassador François van der Delft in a letter dated [...] According to the unnamed Fleming, the ship had fired all of its guns of one side and was turning to present the guns on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> the enemy ship, when she {{was caught in a}} strong gust of wind, heeled and took in water through the open gunports. In a letter to William Paget dated , former Lord High Admiral John Russel claimed that the ship had been lost because of [...] "rechenes and great negligence". Three years after the sinking, the Hall's Chronicle gave the reason for the sinking as being caused by [...] "to much foly... for she was laden with much ordinaunce, and the portes left open, which were low, & the great ordinaunce unbreached, so that when the ship should turne, the water entered, and sodainly she sanke." ...|$|E

500|$|Antequera rallied the Paraguayan militia in response, while Zavala {{sent his}} {{lieutenant}} governor Baltasar García Ros to marshall both Jesuit mission Indians, his own troops from Buenos Aires, and reinforcements from Villa Rica. [...] Zavala had hoped {{a peaceful resolution}} might still be possible, but García Ros was not well received by the Paraguayans. [...] He had briefly served as interim governor of Paraguay from 1706-1707, and {{was known to be}} a great supporter of the Jesuits. [...] He had worked with the Jesuit armies of mission Indians before in fighting the Portuguese, where the Jesuits gained his admiration with their support; he had also allegedly ignored a royal award of 300 mission Indians to the settlers in the encomienda while interim governor to please the Jesuits. [...] Meanwhile, in Asunción, the Jesuits were run out of their college by a mob of citizens, and given 3 hours to leave by the cabildo. [...] The armies exchanged hostile letters, and it seemed briefly that a show of force might persuade <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>side</b> <b>to</b> back down. [...] However, on August 25, 1724, the Paraguayans misinterpreted Indians celebrating the feast of St. Luis as preparations for a military attack. [...] The Paraguayans attacked the dancing and parading Indians, and won a complete victory with the element of surprise. [...] Hundreds of Indians were killed, all of the arms, ammunition, and papers were taken, and the royal army was forced into full retreat. [...] A band of citizens of Villa Rica who arrived late as reinforcements surrendered immediately, and saw their leader executed. [...] The victory came unexpectedly cheap, as well; only five settlers were killed, and 20 wounded. [...] 150 captured mission Indians were distributed to the settlers in encomienda servitude.|$|E
