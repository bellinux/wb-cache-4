Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>them</b> adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation of populations by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E

[...] Thompson says [...] "The {{book is a}} response to the common intuition that inequality between the races must be caused by discrimination or exploitation of the disadvantaged group by the better off, necessitating reparations or corrective intervention in the market economy. [...] Sowell insists instead that differences in productive capabilities explain the differences in outcomes." [...] Thompson writes, [...] "Rather like Booker T.

2500|$|Eric Rofes {{author of}} the book, A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer?, argues that the {{inclusion}} of teachings on homosexuality in public schools will {{play an important role}} in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals. [...] As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take radical approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality. According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that [...] "something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur."The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from anti-gay rights activists such as John Briggs. Former California senator, John Briggs proposed Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be [...] " [...] the corruption of the children's minds". The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>them</b> come to terms with their sexual orientation. Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as Out There and Committee for Gay Youth, stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation.|$|E
