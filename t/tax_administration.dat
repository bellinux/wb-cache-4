5|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the federal government would be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal <b>tax</b> <b>administration</b> by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E

They also stated that the cause of the bankruptcy was that Autolink had not let them make a private placement of NOK 10 million. The new company received an operation and safety licence from the inspectorate in January 2009, and plans to start operation again in February. On 9 April 2010, the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate withdrew Ofotbanen's operating certificate because it was not economically sound to operate.

5|$|Start won the 2012 Norwegian First Division {{and were}} {{promoted}} to the top league for their 2013 season. Start Stadion {{had been involved in}} a legal suit with the Norwegian <b>Tax</b> <b>Administration</b> over whether value added tax was to be paid for the stadium's naming rights. The company lost the case both in Agder Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, resulting in the company having to pay NOK9 million in taxes. As the company did not have such values, it was forced to filed for bankruptcy on 23 May 2013. At the time the company had a debt of NOK107 million. At the time the municipality has commenced negotiations with Sparebanken Sør to purchase the stadium. Football economist Tor Geir Kvinen stated that Sparebanken Sør had by then spent NOK200 million on subsidizing Start and that in reality the municipality and bank were funding the repeated deficits in the club. The municipality announced a plan in October 2013, whereby they would purchase the bank's NOK54 million loan for NOK44 million and receive all the shares in the stadium company. The bank would then buy the naming rights for ten more years for NOK10 million and yet unsold commercial property. The municipality would then be owed NOK64 million by the stadium company, up from NOK46 million.|$|E

25|$|This {{tax fraud}} filing, related to Pinochet's {{and his family}} secret bank {{accounts}} in the United States and in Caribbean islands, for an amount of USD $27million, shocked the Pinochetist sector of the Chilean public opinion more than the accusations of human rights abuses. Ninety percent of these funds would have been raised between 1990 and 1998, when Pinochet was Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and would essentially have come from weapons traffic (when purchasing Belgian Mirage fighter aircraft in 1994, Dutch Léopard tanks, Swiss Mowag tanks or by illegal sales of weapons to Croatia, {{in the middle of}} the Balkan war; the later case has been connected by the Chilean justice with the assassination of Colonel Gerardo Huber in 1992).

40|$|<b>Tax</b> <b>administrations</b> need {{to become}} more {{efficient}} due to a growing workload, higher demands from citizens, 	and, in many countries, staff reduction and budget cuts. The novel field of analytics has achieved successes in improving 	efficiencies {{in areas such as}} banking, insurance and retail. Analytics, which is often described as an extensive use of data, 	statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and 	actions (Davenport and Harris, 2007 : 7), fits well in <b>tax</b> <b>administrations,</b> that typically have access to large volumes of data. 	In this paper we will answer the question how analytics contributes to a Compliance Risk Management approach a major 	trend in taxpayer supervision in the last decade. The main tasks within compliance risk management include risk 	identification, risk analysis, prioritization, treatment, and evaluation. The answer of the research question gives more 	insight in what we can expect from analytics, and will assist <b>tax</b> <b>administrations</b> that want to improve their analytical 	capabilities. Attention is paid as well to limitations of analytics. Findings include that over half of the activities in taxpayer 	supervision can be supported by analytics. Additionally, a match is presented between supervision activities and specific 	analytical techniques that can be applied for these activities. The article also contains a short case study of the Netherlands 	<b>Tax</b> and Customs <b>Administration</b> on selection of VAT refunds with analytical techniques...|$|R
