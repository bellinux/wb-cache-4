2500|$|Ice {{hockey pucks}} of {{regulation}} [...] diameter and [...] thickness {{may be used}} as mechanical vibration dampening isolators in places such as feet for light industrial air compressors, and air conditioning units because they are of regulation materials and therefore consistent manufacture, size and shape, and are constructed of a repeatable and consistent vulcanized rubber material. [...] Since the material is rubber, it may be drilled out or milled easily to a fixed depth as rubber feet or used as rubber spacer or gasket material. [...] A very common use of a slotted hockey puck is as an adaptor between the metal foot of a <b>trolley</b> <b>jack</b> and the sill (rocker panel) of an automobile. [...] The sill has a spot-welded lip which fits into the slot of the puck and would otherwise be bent or marked by the metal foot. [...] Hockey pucks have been used to level furniture, beverage refrigeration systems, and as paper weights or door stops. [...] The hockey puck has many uses other than its original, intended purpose by virtue of its consistent physical properties.|$|E
50|$|Bowe's two CAMS Gold Stars in 1984 and 1985 saw him {{finally get}} the {{attention}} of the Australian touring car establishment. In mid-1985 he was contacted by New Zealander Mark Petch to join the Mark Petch Motorsport Volvo 240 Turbo team during the 1985 Australian Endurance Championship. Bowe co-drove with the teams lead driver Robbie Francevic at the Sandown 500 and the Bathurst 1000. They were a DNF at Sandown after the differential in the Volvo locked solid underneath Bowe {{at the entrance to the}} pits on lap 60 (the car had to be pushed into the pits with the rear end supported by a <b>trolley</b> <b>jack).</b> At Bathurst the turbocharged Volvo was considered the only car capable of matching the speed of the three V12 Jaguar XJS' run by Tom Walkinshaw Racing. The Volvo qualified fifth fastest after Hardie's Heroes (set by Francevic), and after running second and third in the early laps, was destined to spend time in the pits having the alternator replaced, losing many laps. The car failed to finish after running out of fuel on lap 122. Despite it being only the second time he had driven the Volvo, and not having previously driven at the Mount Panorama Circuit, Bowe proved to be as quick in the car at Bathurst as Francevic until late in the final qualifying session when the team put on a set of qualifying tyres and Francevic set the third fastest time.|$|E
30|$|The {{variation}} of moisture content during {{the duration of}} the trials was determined by weighing each stack at 1 to 4 Â week intervals (non-destructive sampling). Stacks were weighed by temporarily placing portable stock scales under the pallets. Each pallet was lifted on one side with a <b>trolley</b> <b>jack</b> in order to place the scale under it. Then the pallet was lowered on the scale plate to obtain a reading. Weight data were used to calculate moisture content, on the assumption that any decrease in pallet weight was directly related to moisture content loss. Weight data were re-calibrated once each trial was complete using the gravimetric moisture content values obtained following destructive sampling {{at the end of the}} trials.|$|E
40|$|The {{transhipment}} {{method is}} using a cable trolley system. The two ships are moving on parallel way inthe same direction, between them is suspended carrying the trolley wire. Transhipment of goods is made usingcontainer boxes which are caught by the <b>trolley</b> load <b>jacks.</b> The method offers the advantage of highproductivity, regardless of sea conditions. Basically, the system is usable at high degree of agitation of the sea. Slack in the cable carrier is assured by an automatic tension-adjusting device...|$|R
