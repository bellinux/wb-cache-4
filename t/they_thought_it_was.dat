5|$|As some {{scientists}} such as Dlussky believed Sphecomyrma {{was not an}} ant, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> solitary and semi-communal. Further statements include that the morphology of sphecomyrmines would prevent workers from transporting larvae or engaging in trophallaxis (transfer of food between two nestmates) with them. However, wasps with antennal proportions similar to sphecomyrmines are able to feed their own larvae. The presence of the metapleural gland also shows that Sphecomyrma was a eusocial (the highest level of organisation of animal sociality) insect and lived in colonies, as this gland possibly acts as a disinfectant in order to nest in soil and leaf litter without infecting the colony's nestmates and brood. The large eyes, long appendages and thin exoskeleton suggests that workers were epigaeic, where they foraged above ground and out in the open. Fossil evidence further suggests that they foraged socially with other worker ants.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{shortly after}} the release of Christmas Nights in November 1996. Producer Yuji Naka wanted to create a game which {{involved}} saving people rather than killing them. Sonic Team chose to connect the game with firefighting as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an effective way of having players identify with heroism. Burning Rangers received mostly positive reviews. Critics unanimously commended the game's soundtrack and audio, with the voice navigation system receiving particular praise. The response to the graphics was mixed, with some critics asserting that it had the best visuals on the Saturn, although it was noted for its poor collision detection and occasional glitching. The game was among the final five Saturn titles released in America.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines was {{completed}} in September 1990. The game did not go through quality assurance, and as a result, a major bug that caused the game to crash was discovered near completion. The bug occurred when the player tried to reverse on the first race, and escaped notice because none of the testers thought to do so as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so easy. It was determined that just one binary bit was wrong, and a device that functioned like a miniature Game Genie was installed on the cartridges to correct it, as {{by the time the}} bug was discovered, there were plenty of ROM chips containing the bugged version. Micro Machines was released for the NES by Camerica in 1991. Nintendo wanted development halted because Codemasters did not have a licence from them, and sued Galoob over the sales of the Game Genie. Courts ruled in Galoob's favour (Nintendo appealed, but the ruling was upheld), but the legal issues meant that sales of the NES version were not as good as hoped.|$|E

5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> some kind of gang slaying.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a safer community. At {{the time of the}} abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

25|$|The Harmonites did not {{mark their}} graves with headstones or grave markers, because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{unnecessary}} to do so; however, one exception is George Rapp's son Johannes' stone marker in Harmony, Pennsylvania, which was installed by non-Harmonites {{many years after}} the Harmonites left that town. Today, Harmonist graveyards are fenced in grassy areas with signs posted nearby explaining this practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{incident}} was largely met with disbelief and {{laughter from the}} passengers {{and some of the}} flight attendants, as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an exercise. Passengers described two of the hijackers as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar situation could arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly.|$|E

25|$|On 18 September 2011, {{the killing}} of a monkey on the Westville campus was {{reported}}. Witnesses reported seeing four of five male students trapping a monkey inside a communal kitchen inside one of the campuses halls of residence. The students were alleged to have started beating the animal with a stick, continuing to do so until <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> dead. Witnesses said the animal then began to crawl away with a broken spine, the students were alleged to have continued hitting the monkey until it was dead. One witness said 'monkey was screaming so loudly that it could be heard inside some of the residence blocks'.|$|E
25|$|The {{perpetrator}} {{then moved}} to Raudeliūnas' home, which was closest to his own house. The next victims were Vanda Raudeliūnienė and her visiting daughter Dalia Kalibatienė, who was a senior lieutenant with the Ministry of National Defence. The Kalibaitis family lived in Salininkai near Vilnius and were visiting the family. Zavistonovičius also killed a dog which attempted to defend the women. He fetched a mattress from his own house so {{he would not have}} to lay down on cold winter ground and took cover to ambush Antanas Raudeliūnas, his son-in-law Mindaugas Kalibatas, and his grandsons Vilius and Tadas. The men were gathering wood in a nearby forest. They heard the shots but were not immediately concerned as <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> hunters who frequented the forests. When the four men came out of the woods, Zavistonovičius first shot Mindaugas Kalibatas in the chest, but the bullet grazed, ripping a piece of flesh but not causing more serious internal damage. The perpetrator then shot Vilius as he ran to help his father. When the gunman approached them, Kalibatas and his other son Tadas attacked him, grabbed his rifles and beat him until he collapsed.|$|E
500|$|Another {{effect of}} Operation Mincemeat was that Germans became wary of deception.

5000|$|The Doors were {{considered}} as a potential performing band but canceled at the last moment.

60|$|The six {{boys were}} still some {{distance}} from the house when they saw a man come out on the veranda and wave his hand to them. At first <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might <b>be</b> Sam Rover. But then, of a sudden, Jack let out a yell.|$|R
500|$|Before {{writing and}} {{composing}} [...] "Clocks", the band had already written 10 songs for the album. However, because A Rush Of Blood To The Head was nearing completion, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{too late to}} include the new song on it. Hence, they recorded a demo and saved it with other unfinished tracks, labeling it [...] "Songs for #3"; the band intended these tracks for what would be their third album.|$|E
500|$|L. Frank Baum's first {{published}} short story was [...] "They Played a New Hamlet" [...] (1895). When Baum had been touring New York State {{in the title}} role, the actor playing the ghost fell through the floorboards, and the rural audience thought {{it was part of}} the show and demanded that the actor repeat the fall, because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> funny. Baum would later recount the actual story in an article, but the short story is told from the point of view of the actor playing the ghost.|$|E
500|$|By 2003, guitarist Dimebag Darrell {{and drummer}} Vinnie Paul Abbott were not {{pleased with the}} {{difficulties}} heavy metal band Pantera was experiencing. Abbott described the performance level of Pantera's vocalist, Phil Anselmo, as [...] "hit and miss, depending on what type of chemicals he was on." [...] Following the release of Pantera's 2000 album Reinventing the Steel, Anselmo and bassist Rex Brown started to focus on their side projects and did not discuss or record any further Pantera material, while Darrell and Vinnie wanted to continue to write and play music. <b>They</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{time to move on}} and, upon disbanding Pantera, began writing new material.|$|E

500|$|In April 2005, {{the band}} {{launched}} a club tour, which lasted until late May. Although on previous tours Audioslave occasionally played cover songs, they deliberately avoided playing their former bands' songs to avoid using those songs as a [...] "crutch" [...] to [...] "help sell and break Audioslave" [...] as their {{aim was to}} establish the band as an [...] "independent entity." [...] After achieving that goal, <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> [...] "time to own those histories," [...] and began performing a selection of the two bands' most popular songs (such as [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] and [...] "Bulls on Parade") on the tour.|$|E
500|$|Tom Chambers was {{approached}} about assuming {{the role of}} Sam by BBC casting director Julie Harkin, who was also responsible for casting fellow Holby City newcomers Rakie Ayola as Kyla Tyson and Luke Roberts as Joseph Byrne. Chambers has revealed that he sent a video of himself performing a Fred Astaire tap dance routine to over 800 stage and television directors and producers in the [...] UK, explaining: [...] "Julie Harkin in casting at Holby saw it {{and gave me a}} call because <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unusual. Originally I went up for a small role as an American doctor, but after the audition they said come back next week to audition for a bigger part and that was it!" [...] Upon assuming the role of Sam, Chambers revealed that he had once been an avid viewer of Holby City's sister show, Casualty, recalling watching it as far back as 1991.|$|E
500|$|The Afghan company {{contracted}} to bring heavy construction equipment delayed its arrival to until 13 July. It {{was decided that}} soldier labor {{with the aid of}} an engineer squad and a Bobcat front end loader already at Bella would be good enough to prepare an initial defense in the six days until heavier equipment arrived. The number of men at the base was judged enough to defend against intelligence estimates that placed the insurgent forces in the local area at only about 150 experienced fighters, though they did not know that attackers would be backed up by other guerrilla groups from neighboring regions as far away as Pakistan and Kashmir. While <b>they</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible the base might be attacked while the camp was being prepared, they thought it unlikely. Platoon Sergeant Dzwik later remarked [...] "I was expecting harassing fire from any one of the high ground in every direction.
