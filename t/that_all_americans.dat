The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 was an early component of the Democrats' agenda during the 110th Congress. In 2006, the Democrats supported six state ballot initiatives to increase the minimum wage; all six initiatives passed. In May 2017, senate Democrats introduced the Raise the Wage Act, which would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024, and marks a leftward turn in Democratic economic policies.|$|E

[...] He introduced a health care platform that emphasized prevention and called for reforms in the current system to ensure <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>Americans</b> be covered in the future. In the financial sphere of the campaign, Thompson acknowledged that he could not compete with funds being raised by the upper-tiered candidates, but he stated that he did not intend to do so because his campaign was [...] "different" [...] than the others; according to Thompson, his was more centered around a strong ground organization in Iowa.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1990s, the New Age {{was found}} {{primarily}} in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as [...] "New Agers" [...] renders it difficult {{to determine how many}} practitioners there are. Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>Americans</b> who believed in reincarnation were part of the movement. He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas. In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown {{to such an extent that}} they were [...] "increasingly rivalling the sway of Christianity in western settings".|$|E

[...] Schlesinger, however, {{notes that he}} is also {{an example of the}} {{limitations}} of formal oratory: Congress heard Webster or Clay with admiration, but they rarely prevailed at the vote.

It came through the good offices of my old acquaintance Professor Messadaglia, then a deputy in the Italian Parliament, whom, for some reason I cannot remember, I had put in correspondence with Longfellow. The honor was wholly unexpected, and it brought Longfellow a distress which was chiefly for the gentleman who had procured him the impossible distinction. He showed me the pretty collar and cross, not, I think, without a natural pleasure in it. No man was ever less a bigot in things civil or religious than he, but he said, firmly, [...] "Of course, as a republican and a Protestant, I can't accept a decoration from a Catholic prince."
