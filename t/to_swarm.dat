5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Indiana {{to begin the}} game, Indiana kicked off to Virginia Tech to begin the second half. In {{response}} to the celebration following the 80-yard touchdown prior to halftime, Virginia Tech was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Indiana kicked off from the Tech 40-yard line, and the ball was downed at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line. A false-start penalty against the Hokies didn't prevent them from gaining a first down on a pass from DeShazo <b>to</b> <b>Swarm.</b> Swarm picked up another first down on his own, advancing {{the ball to the}} Tech 38-yard line with a rush up the middle. Tech continued to advance the ball with Thomas, Swarm and DeShazo rushing the ball and picking up first downs. Now on the Indiana side of the field, DeShazo attempted a deep pass, but the ball was intercepted by Indiana cornerback Jason Orton.|$|E
5|$|That even a dead ala is bad {{is seen in}} {{the legend}} {{explaining}} the origin of the Golubatz fly (Simulium colombaschense), a species of bloodsucking black fly (of the genus Simulium) that can be lethal to livestock. The legend, recorded in the Požarevac District in the 19th century by Vuk Karadžić, tells how a Serbian man, after a chase, caught and wounded an ala, but she broke away and fled into a cave near Golubac (a town in the district), where she died of the wounds. Ever since, her body has bred the Golubatz flies, and in late spring, they fly out of the cave in a big swarm, spreading as far as Šumadija. People walled up the cave’s opening once, but when the time came for the flies <b>to</b> <b>swarm,</b> the wall shattered.|$|E
25|$|Ant colony {{optimization}} is {{a widely}} used algorithm which {{was inspired by the}} behaviours of ants, and has been effective solving discrete optimization problems related <b>to</b> <b>swarming.</b> The algorithm was initially proposed by Marco Dorigo in 1992, and has since been diversified to solve a wider class of numerical problems. Species that have multiple queens may have a queen leaving the nest along with some workers to found a colony at a new site, a process akin <b>to</b> <b>swarming</b> in honeybees.|$|R
40|$|Swarm {{intelligent}} systems are simple but robust, capable of solving complex problems {{that no single}} agent could attempt. While technological advancements have driven development of multi-agent systems across disciplines, emergent behavior inherent <b>to</b> <b>swarms</b> is a desirable yet difficult property to ex-ploit. Solutions utilizing swarm behavior have been proposed for the Cooperative Cleaning Problem, which is applicable to UAVs cooperatively searching for evasive targets. This work proposes a new agent behavior capable of partitioning a search area, and when combined with previous swarm so-lutions, forms an optimization problem of how <b>to</b> best assign <b>swarms</b> <b>to</b> a complex topology. Agent-based simulations are developed <b>to</b> test <b>swarm</b> solutions. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{actions taken}} in earlier {{parts of a}} map can affect later parts of that mission, {{triggering}} scripted changes in objectives and enemy behavior: for instance, when a castle is raided, the neighboring castle will have troops ready <b>to</b> <b>swarm</b> attackers. After each action, a player character gains experience points, along with raising their health and magic meters, and giving random boosts to their statistics such as strength and agility. They may also learn new skills, including skills which are unique to specific characters. If they are defeated in battle, all characters are subject to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of}} the game. If the army's leader is killed, the map must be restarted. Victory is achieved when the map's objective has been completed, which can vary from defeating an enemy force to capturing specific points on a map.|$|E
5|$|The game's single-player {{campaign}} {{consists of}} around 30 linear levels, divided up into eight distinct missions. Missions have different objectives, from retrieving a particular item and accessing computer systems, escorting a friendly character through hostile territory, or destroying vital ship and station components. Enemies come in multiple {{forms in the}} game, often as Star Trek species such as the Borg and the Klingons. Each group of enemies uses a different means of attacking: most humanoid enemies are armed with weapons similar to the player, and will use cover and squad tactics to attempt to kill the player character. The Borg differ from this in that, instead of using squad tactics, they eventually adapt their personal energy shields {{to most of the}} player's weapons, slowly rendering the player's attacks useless as they advance. Other enemies may attempt <b>to</b> <b>swarm</b> the player and eliminate them with melee attacks.|$|E
5|$|Although most banded sugar ant colonies are monogynous (a nest that {{contains}} a single queen), some {{have been found to}} be polygynous, where a colony will have multiple queens; this is the fourth Camponotus species that is recognized as exhibiting polygyny. In polygynous colonies, queens are not territorial and free-mixing of offspring is observed. Despite the homogeneous environmental factors, however, different family lineages are strongly correlated with ant caste, suggesting caste is largely genetically determined. Nests containing a single queen are monandrous, where a queen will only mate once with a male. Not much is known about their nuptial flight, although virgin queens and males (alates) were observed mating in South Australia in January. This hints that banded sugar ants will mate during mid-summer, and colony foundation occurs at this time. Ideal conditions for nuptial flight is on warm days during the afternoon at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), which is when the alates begin <b>to</b> <b>swarm.</b> A colony can be long-lived, with queens living for seven years or more. The black carpenter ant (Camponotus pennsylvanicus) is known to adopt larvae and pupae from banded sugar ant colonies.|$|E

This {{is due to the}} advancement in many fields of technology and focusing on specific applications allowing the sensor systems optimization. One unique feature of small satellite missions is the construction of affordable distributed space systems from constellations <b>to</b> <b>swarms.</b> The paper brings to mind the visions formulated in the year 2006 in the IAA Study “Cost-effective Earth Observation missions” related to the main space mission components: ground segments, launch services and space segments.

25|$|Swarm behaviour, or swarming, is a {{collective}} behaviour exhibited by entities, particularly animals, of similar size which aggregate together, perhaps milling {{about the same}} spot or perhaps moving en masse or migrating in some direction. It is a highly interdisciplinary topic. As a term, swarming is applied particularly to insects, but can also be applied to any other entity or animal that exhibits swarm behaviour. The term flocking or 'murmuration' are usually used to refer specifically <b>to</b> <b>swarm</b> behaviour in birds, herding to refer <b>to</b> <b>swarm</b> behaviour in quadrupeds, shoaling or schooling to refer <b>to</b> <b>swarm</b> behaviour in fish. Phytoplankton also gather in huge swarms called blooms, although these organisms are algae and are not self-propelled the way animals are. By extension, the term swarm is applied also to inanimate entities which exhibit parallel behaviours, as in a robot swarm, an earthquake swarm, or a swarm of stars.|$|E

25|$|Despite this, the Seljuq Turks {{continued}} their incursions into Asia Minor, capturing Manzikert. The Byzantine Emperor Romanus Diogenes led an army {{in an attempt}} to score a decisive blow against the Seljuqs and add some military justification to his rule (which had seen the loss of southern Italy to Norman conquests). During the march, Alp Arslan, the leader of the Seljuq Turks withdrew from Manzikert. His tactical withdrawal allowed his army to ambush the Byzantines, reclaiming Manzikert shortly after. The victory itself led to few gains at the time for the Seljuq Turks, but the civil chaos that resulted in the Byzantine Empire allowed the Seljuqs and various other Turkic allies <b>to</b> <b>swarm</b> into Asia Minor.|$|E
25|$|Synoeca surinama is a Neotropical swarm-founding wasp of {{the tribe}} Epiponini. It {{is known for its}} {{metallic}} blue and black appearance and painful sting. S. surinama builds nests on tree trunks and can be found in tropical climates of South America. When preparing <b>to</b> <b>swarm,</b> {{there are a number of}} pre-swarming behaviors that members of S. surinama colonies partake in, such as buzzing runs and occasional brood cannibalism. In S. surinama, social environmental conditions determine the caste ranks of individuals in the developing brood. Unlike less primitive Hymenoptera species, S. surinama display little morphological variation between egglaying queens and workers. S. surinama wasps visit flowering plants and are considered pollinators. When these wasps sting, the stinger is left in the victim and the wasp ultimately dies. Additionally, S. surinama wasps produce extremely painful stings.|$|E
25|$|Motility {{is a key}} {{virulence}} determinant in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{has three}} distinct methods of moving across or through a medium. Rhamnolipids are particularly important in swarming motility where they are postulated to lower the surface tension of the surface through their surfactant properties, allowing the bacterial cell <b>to</b> <b>swarm.</b> New evidence suggests that rhamnolipids are necessary to allow Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells to overcome attachment mediated by type IV pili. There is some discrepancy between the role of HAAs and RHLs in swarming motility. Some studies use a rhlA mutation to assess the effect on motility, which prevents the formation of HAAs and rhamnolipids. Studies that use a rhlB mutant show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can swarm {{in the absence of}} rhamnolipids, but HAAs are absolutely necessary for swarming. Rhamnolipids have been proposed to be important in regulating swarm tendril formation.|$|E

50|$|The quorum {{sensing process}} in honey bees {{is similar to}} the method used by Temnothorax ants in several ways. A small portion of the workers leave the <b>swarm</b> <b>to</b> search out new nest sites, and each worker assesses the quality of the cavity it finds. The worker then returns <b>to</b> the <b>swarm</b> and {{recruits}} other workers to her cavity using the honey bee waggle dance. However, instead of using a time delay, the number of dance repetitions the worker performs is dependent {{on the quality of the}} site. Workers that found poor nests stop dancing sooner, and can therefore be recruited to the better sites. Once the visitors to a new site sense that a quorum number (usually 10-20 bees) has been reached, they return <b>to</b> the <b>swarm</b> and begin using a new recruitment method called piping. This vibration signal causes the <b>swarm</b> <b>to</b> take off and fly to the new nest location. In an experimental test, this decision-making process enabled honey bee <b>swarms</b> <b>to</b> choose the best nest site in four out of five trials.|$|R

25|$|Intermediates are {{workers with}} fully {{developed}} ovaries. These wasps are non-inseminated laying females, {{and they are}} present throughout the entire colony cycle. Intermediates lay eggs, but the eggs are eaten either by themselves or by other colony members. It is possible that non-inseminated laying females are always present {{in order to provide}} extra energy in the colony. Their eggs may be used for trophic purposes, since male production is controlled entirely by queens. This oophagy (egg eating behavior) can provide additional sustenance for the colony. Inseminated workers are typically older and are likely to have been potential queens at colony initiation. Therefore, non-inseminated egg layers are young and seem to be about <b>to</b> <b>swarm.</b> In a study on P. exigua foraging activity, a higher proportion of workers than intermediates were observed in all the colonies. Their study observed 12 colonies in Bom Jesus da Lapa, Bahia, Brazil.|$|E

As he loses consciousness, she admits that she is actually part of the scam and that he made a fatal mistake by giving up his verification code.|$|E
25|$|Ants are the {{greatest}} threat of predation for P. exigua. Many of the wasps’ traits, such as polygyny and protective nest structures, are suggested to be survival tactics against ant predation pressures. P. exigua are also observed <b>to</b> <b>swarm</b> and use scent-trail diversions as defense strategies. During Megaselia infestation, workers attempt to destroy all infested cells in order to terminate the parasitoids. However, wasps are often unable to eradicate the phorid pupae due to their strong attachment to the cell bottom. If the workers fail, then the wasps close the nest entrances and the colony flees to another location in the neighborhood {{to build a new}} nest. Once they have established a new nest, wasps will entirely close the old nest’s entrance, which prevents the encroaching parasitoid flies from coming inside. The wasps also fan their wings and use their mandibles to peck attack the phorid flies. Since P. exigua seem to be specialized against the common predation of ants, Megaselia easily defeat the wasps’ defense strategies and frequently invade the species nests.|$|E
