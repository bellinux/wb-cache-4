5|$|There {{were several}} avenues of appeal {{available}} to the Bali Nine. Lawyers had seven days post-sentencing to lodge appeals. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit for those convicted to request clemency from the President of Indonesia, but this requires an admission of guilt and had never been granted for a drug crime until 2009. All appealed to overturn their sentence. The sentences of Chen, Czugaj, Nguyen, Norman and Stephens stand at life imprisonment and Lawrence's sentence remains at 20 years after appeal. In May 2011, Rush's death sentence was reduced to life after he launched a final appeal in August 2010.|$|E
25|$|General {{anesthesia}} may {{be necessary}} because of specific risks to mother or child. Patients with heavy, uncontrolled bleeding may not tolerate the hemodynamic effects of regional anesthesia. General anesthesia is also preferred in very urgent cases, such as severe fetal distress, when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to perform a regional anesthesia.|$|E

25|$|The {{first four}} {{phases of the}} game, if the player uses the editors only minimally, will take up to 15 hours to complete, but can take as little as one or two hours. Note that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit for any stage: the player may stay in a single stage {{as long as they}} wish, and {{progress}} to the next stage when ready. At the end of each phase, the player's actions cause their creature to be assigned a characteristic. Each phase has three characteristics, usually based on how aggressively or peacefully the phase was played. Characteristics determine how the creature will start the next phase and give it abilities that can be used later in the game.|$|E
25|$|The rules {{may create}} social {{problems}} in some situations, {{especially for the}} widow. For example, among observant Jews, if the brother on whom the yibbum obligation falls is too young to marry, the widow would need {{to wait until the}} brother reaches marriage age or the age at which he may opt out of the marriage. The widow would not know if the brother would even opt out of the marriage. Furthermore, in either event, by that stage the widow may be past her child-bearing age, and still be subject to the possible obligation to marry the brother. Also, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit on the indication of the brother's intention as to whether he will proceed with the marriage or opt out, and the brother may already be married.|$|E
25|$|The dojo has {{a league}} also. Each of the {{students}} competes. The stronger a player is, the fewer games they have to play. Two different time limit rules {{are used in the}} league games. There is a longer time limit where each player has a minute to move, and hayago where the players are given just 10 seconds to make a move. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit, so any given player can play 1 or 10 games in one day. The league also has a rating system. The ratings are based on the players' winning percentages. There is a handicap, but one that was very different than the orthodox system of allowing the opponent to place the number of stones to the difference in rank. The stronger player gets 10 seconds less in their time for every number difference in rank. There is also a reverse komi rule. 0 komi, —3 komi, —5 komi, and —8 komi.|$|E

Kowalewicz also stated [...] "the songs this far are unlike anything we've ever done before yet it {{still seems to}} capture the urgency of our first record". Kowalewicz stated, in an interview, that the first three albums would form a trilogy and that the new album would not be named Billy Talent IV.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from its}} {{predominantly}} nonverbal storytelling, Mysts gameplay is unusual among adventuring computer games in several ways. The player {{is provided with}} very little backstory {{at the beginning of}} the game, and no obvious goals or objectives are laid out. This means that players must simply begin to explore. There are no obvious enemies, no physical violence, and no threat of [...] "dying" [...] at any point, although it is possible to reach a few [...] "losing" [...] endings. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit to complete the game. The game unfolds at its own pace and is solved through a combination of patience, observation, and logical thinking.|$|E
500|$|The book's {{endpapers}} {{had been}} overlooked. Potter {{wrote to the}} firm: [...] "I conclude <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> to get an end-paper design done—unless Mr. Stokoe has already designed one—I do not mind one way or another; I had begun to scribble something but it looks a bit stiff." [...] Mr. Stokoe apparently did not design one because the endpapers were either plain white or mottled lavender. Several years later, they were replaced with a design featuring a pie and a patty-pan and the cover illustration changed to Ribby sitting by the fire. In the 1930s, the book's size was reduced to bring it into line {{with the rest of}} the Peter Rabbit books. The title was changed at that time to The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan.|$|E

500|$|There {{are plans}} {{to connect the}} two segments, but there were {{insufficient}} funds available to complete the nearly [...] project and right-of-way needs to be acquired. [...] TxDOT only has $7.7 million of the $30 million required for construction costs. [...] Bexar County {{will pay for the}} balance of the project costs with TxDOT reimbursing the County when funds become available. [...] Relocation assistance is being provided to landowners to persuade them to sell their property for the highway. [...] With a shortage of funds and the right-of-way not purchased, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> table for construction. [...] Local opposition to the extension cite greater highway needs elsewhere, environmental concerns in the corridor, and a reluctance to sell land needed for the highway as chief concerns of the highway. [...] Once completed, the highway is believed to provide relief to nearby Loop 1604.|$|E
500|$|Juliet {{explains}} that Ethan kept {{a stash of}} the serum at a nearby drop point. She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time,</b> and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E

2500|$|IPL games utilise {{television}} timeouts {{and hence}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> limit in which teams must complete their innings. However, a penalty may be imposed if the umpires find teams misusing this privilege. Each team {{is given a}} two-and-a-half-minute [...] "strategic timeout" [...] during each innings; one must {{be taken by the}} bowling team between the ends of the 6th and 9th overs, and one by the batting team between the ends of the 13th and 16th overs.|$|E

A formal process (the [...] "JOP" [...] program) does exist for using multiple SOHO instruments collaboratively on a single observation.

2500|$|The {{most ancient}} {{testimony}} {{refers to this}} custom of Terce, Sext, and Nones, for instance Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, the Canons of Hippolytus, and even the Didache ("Teaching of the Apostles"). The Didache prescribed prayer thrice each day, without, however, fixing the hours. Clement of Alexandria and likewise Tertullian, {{as early as the}} end of the 2nd century, expressly mention the Canonical Hours of Terce, Sext, and Nones, as specially set apart for prayer. Tertullian says explicitly that we must always pray, and that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> prescribed for prayer; he adds, nevertheless: [...] "As regards the time, there should be no lax observation of certain hoursI mean of those common hours which have long marked the divisions of the day, the third, the sixth, and the ninth, and which we may observe in Scripture to be more solemn than the rest." ...|$|E
2500|$|In SN2 reactions, {{there are}} a few {{conditions}} that affect the rate of the reaction. [...] First of all, the 2 in SN2 implies that there are two concentrations of substances that affect the rate of reaction: substrate and nucleophile. [...] The rate equation for this reaction would be Rate=k. [...] For a SN2 reaction, an aprotic solvent is best, such as acetone, DMF, or DMSO. [...] Aprotic solvents do not add protons (H+) ions into solution; if protons were present in SN2 reactions, they would react with the nucleophile and severely limit the reaction rate. [...] Since this reaction occurs in one step, steric effects drive the reaction speed. In the intermediate step, the nucleophile is 180 degrees from the leaving group and the stereochemistry is inverted as the nucleophile bonds to make the product. [...] Also, because the intermediate is partially bonded to the nucleophile and leaving group, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> for the substrate to rearrange itself: the nucleophile will bond to the same carbon that the leaving group was attached to. [...] A final factor that affects reaction rate is nucleophilicity; the nucleophile must attack an atom other than a hydrogen.|$|E
