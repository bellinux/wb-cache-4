This standard describes the electromechanical requirements {{for a common}} mobile device battery charger equipped with a USB type-A socket providing power at 5 V DC. All new mobile phones requesting network access approval in China from June 2007 are required to support charging from the new common chargers. The original 2006 regulation is flexible regarding the interface on the mobile phone itself, allowing {{for the use of}} adapter cables if the mobile device is not equipped with a standard USB connector. Among other things, the 2009 update adds references to USB On-The-Go (OTG) support and the use of USB micro-B, micro-AB, mini-B; and Mini-10-pin and cylindrical ("barrel") type connectors on the terminal (phone) for charging.|$|E

40|$|The 10 X {{increase}} in complexity {{for the future}} 4 G <b>telecommunication</b> <b>terminals</b> is a major challenge for system designers. SoC solutions seem the only answer {{to cope with the}} performance requirements, but the usual design practices lead to huge difficulties, especially for the implementation of the control schemes. We describe our SoC implementation of a baseband subsystem for a high performance 4 G terminal. Our architecture, called FAUST, is based on distributed synchronization and asynchronous communication. We highlight how we have actually implemented these two key principles in our design. We detail their impact in terms of complexity and the new constraints it introduces to the synchronization schemes. Finally, we illustrate the new control scheme with the timing diagram of an actual reception sequence. T I...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{architecture}} suitable for implementing the processing parts of high throughput <b>telecommunication</b> <b>terminal</b> equipment, in standard CMOS. A first testchip {{has been designed}} in 0. 8 m CMOS and successfully tested. It contains some critical processing parts of an SDH-regenerator. The chip process a throughput of 10 Gbit/s and is fully clocked at 622 MHz. 2 ARCHITECTURE The architecture is mainly aimed for chips that process data with a throughput of 10 Gbit/s, but can easily be reshaped for other data-rates and applications. STM signals are byte-oriented. Thus the signal processing must operate at some fraction of the serial byte-rate. For future scaleability into higher data rates we select a clock frequency as high as possible. With a lower internal frequency the number of cells will increase, and thereby occupy a larger area. With the selected frequency of 622 MHz, we must process two bytes of data in every clock-cycle. In order to reach this high clock frequency we mu [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT 4 D) {{technology}} interventions {{that have been}} developed over the last decade. The purpose is to provide a snapshot of the trends that have characterized ICT 4 D technology interventions from the period starting 1995 to 2010. This paper presents three general dimensions i. e. ICTs, development and research which are further broken down into seven variables used to categorize projects over this period. The seven variables include: <b>telecommunication,</b> <b>terminal</b> device, target group, domain area, region, research methods and discipline. Results suggest that applied research stood out as the methodology of choice; health and education as the most researched areas; hand-held interventions as the most popular choice of solutions; and Computer Science, Informatics and Information Systems as the disciplines that offer ICT 4 D technology interventions. Consequently, we argue that these trends will facilitate understanding the past performance of ICT 4 D, both as an academic field and as an area of development practice, and identify defining ideas on the potential directions for the future...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a database designed {{to evaluate the}} performance of speech recognition algorithms in noisy conditions. The database may either {{be used for the}} evaluation of front-end feature extraction algorithms using a defined HMM recognition back-end or complete recognition systems. The source speech for this database is the TIdigits, consisting of connected digits task spoken by American English talkers (downsampled to 8 kHz). A selection of 8 different real-world noises {{have been added to the}} speech over a range of signal to noise ratios and special care has been taken to control the filtering of both the speech and noise. The framework was prepared as a contribution to the ETSI STQ-AURORA DSR Working Group [1]. Aurora is developing standards for Distributed Speech Recognition (DSR) where the speech analysis is done in the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>terminal</b> and the recognition at a central location in the telecom network. The framework is currently being used to evaluate alternative proposals for front-end feature extraction. The database has been made publicly available through ELRA so that other speech researchers can evaluate and compare the performance of noise robust algorithms. Recognition results are presented for the first standard DSR feature extraction scheme that is based on a cepstral analysis. 1...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to study and examine the various {{reliability}} characteristics of a global mobile satellite communication System (GMSCS) {{with the help of}} mathematical modelling. GMSCS basically comprises of four subsystems; Space segment, Land earth stations, <b>Telecommunication</b> <b>terminals</b> and Mobile earth stations. The system under consideration can have three different modes of working: normal, partial and complete failure. The system is characterized by determination of probabilities being in ‘up’ and ‘down’ states at any instant. Integro-differential equations are derived for these probabilities by identifying the system at suitable regeneration epochs. Based {{on the assumption that the}} failure rates of units are distributed exponentially while the repair rates are distributed arbitrarily, different reliability measures like operational availability, reliability, mean time to failure and cost effectiveness have been computed with the principle of Laplace transforms and supplementary variable technique. Considerable attention is devoted to illustrate the results with numerical examples to highlight the important features of reliability measures of the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{types of}} service using {{location}} Information are being various and extending it's domain as wireless internet technology is developing and it's application part is widespread, {{so it is}} prospected that LBS (Location-Based Services) will be killer application in wireless internet services. This location information is basic and high value-added information, and this information services make prior GIS (Geography Information System) to be useful to anybody. The acquisition of this location information from moving object is very important part for these LBS. After this, when LBS is familiar to everybody, we can predict that LBS system load is so heavy for the acquisition of so many subscribers and vehicles. Moving object database (MODB) system manages objects like subscribers and vehicles that are moving and have <b>telecommunication</b> <b>terminal</b> checked one's location. MODB is consists of 4 part, moving object location acquisition part, moving object location storage part, moving object query processing part, and moving object application part. In this MODB system, acquisition of moving object location part must provide guarantee location information as well as reduce telecommunication overhead. In this paper, we study of problems in acquisition {{a huge number of}} moving objects location and design some acquisition strategies to reduce telecommunication overhead.

40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of receive filtering in the Universal Mobile <b>Telecommunication</b> System (UMTS) <b>terminal</b> receiver is to provide channel selection selectivity. This enables the terminal to receive a desired signal in the presence of interfering signals. The worst case interference conditions in which an UMTS terminal still has to operate are defined by a number of conformance tests in the UMTS standard. The interference conditions in which the terminal has to operate in practice are however not always worst case. Based on the required number of operations it is determined when an adaptive digital receive filter is more computationally ecient than a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) receive filter in a terminal where {{a large part of the}} receive filtering is performed in the digital back-end.

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This thesis {{presents}} the results of an investigation to establish methods to improve the performance of area radio based communication systems for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. The considerable scale on which an area radio network is used as a telecommunication network is quite unique to South Africa {{due to a lack of}} high bandwidth telecommunication systems in rural areas. Research was done to establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the performance of the area radio telecommunication systems. Two KPIs were chosen, namely Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) availability and Control Success Rate (CSR). These KPIs were trended over a three-year period to measure the effectiveness of measures taken to improve the systems. Two measures were implemented, namely to change the RTU radios, antennas and coaxial feeder cables and to redesign the communication systems in such a way to restrict multiple RTU protocols on the same area radio telecommunication network. The installation of new digital radios together with low loss coaxial cable and specific antennas improved the RTU availability from 96. 87 % for the year 2002 to 99. 17 % for the year 2004, which realised in an increase of 2. 83 % for 432 installed RTUs. This measure, however, did not influence the CSR. The implementation of the newly designed communication networks had a significant influence on the control success rate of the SCADA systems and the KPI increased from 77. 65 % for the year 2002 to 78. 76 % for the year 2003 and 80. 88 % for the year 2004. A drastic increase in performance was observed after the restriction of multiple RTU protocols on the same network during May 2004, where the value for twelve months prior to September 2005 was measured at 84. 38 %. The utilisation of area radio telecommunication networks was measured for two operational networks and it was found to be well within the specifications of international accepted standards. One of these networks comprised of three repeaters and 84 installed RTUs and an average utilisation of 17 % and a peak utilisation of 25 % was measured. The other network had an installed base of 4 repeaters and 15 installed RTUs’s and an average utilisation of 3 % and a peak utilisation of 8 % was measured. This compares favourable with the IEEE standard 999 - 1992 [20], which recommends a channel utilisation of between 40 % and 60 %.
