5|$|Several {{other matters}} were also raised, {{relating}} to particular {{parts of the}} evidence (specifically, relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> testimony of Yahya Goba, one of the Buffalo Six), but these matters had little bearing on the final outcome of the case, and were dealt with only briefly by the court. The central argument raised was that, with regard to all the circumstances, Thomas did not actually have a practical choice whether to speak or not.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecution}} called Brown's sister, Denise, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> stand. She tearfully {{testified to}} many episodes {{of domestic violence}} in the 1980s, when she saw Simpson pick up his wife and hurl her against a wall, then physically throw her out of their house during an argument. Her testimony was punctuated by a barrage of defense objections and sidebar conferences with the judge.|$|E
25|$|With {{the jury}} absent, Fuhrman was called back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> {{stand by the}} defense to answer more {{questions}} about {{the discovery of the}} blood marks and leather glove that he found on Simpson's property. When questioned by attorney Gerald Uelmen, Fuhrman, with his lawyer standing by his side, pleaded the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination and further questioning after his integrity was challenged.|$|E

25|$|Oaths—sworn for the {{purposes}} of business, clientage and service, patronage and protection, state office, treaty and loyalty—appealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> and sanction of deities. Refusal to swear a lawful oath (sacramentum) and breaking a sworn oath carried much the same penalty: both repudiated the fundamental bonds between the human and divine. A votum or vow was a promise made to a deity, usually an offer of sacrifices or a votive offering in exchange for benefits received.|$|E
25|$|In {{a police}} photo lineup, an officer shows {{a group of}} photos to a witness or crime victim and asks {{him or her to}} pick out the suspect. This is {{basically}} a single-blind test of the witness's memory, and may be subject to subtle or overt influence by the officer. There is a growing movement in law enforcement to move to a double-blind procedure in which the officer who shows the photos <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> does not know which photo is of the suspect.|$|E
500|$|James Orsborne, giving evidence, {{said that}} he had learned from his brother about Moore's {{proposal}} {{to get rid of the}} boat, and had told George that he would be [...] "a darned fool" [...] even to consider the suggestion. He had stayed with his brother because [...] "I thought that if he was going to do anything crazy I might manage to prevent him". Recalled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> box, Moore {{said that he}} had refused to employ James Orsborne because he considered him dishonest.|$|E

500|$|The broader idea {{embedded}} in the opinion {{was the idea that}} willful misconduct of an attorney lowers the truthfulness of proffered testimony. In the instant case, the Court held that a trial judge could hold the [...] "presumption" [...] that a new witnesses' testimony is perjured due to [...] "a pattern of discovery violations". The pattern in Taylor's case was a series of two amendments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> list done in bad faith. [...] "It would demean the high purpose of the [...] to construe it as encompassing an absolute right to an automatic continuance or mistrial", Stevens wrote.|$|E
500|$|Florence Seymour was {{the first}} person called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> box. She said that her {{statement}} was false, and that she had only made it because Edgar Power had told her that she would be charged with murder if she did not. This immediately disrupted the case for the prosecution; Frederick Low had made it clear in his opening statement that their case rested primarily on Seymour's testimony. Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to say anything that would incriminate Williams. [...] Hastings did not cross-examine her, only asking if what she had said in court was true; she said that it was and then burst into tears.|$|E
500|$|Booth {{was then}} called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> stand, and {{initially}} claimed that Gruban had claimed to be [...] "a very powerful man" [...] {{and that it had}} been a case of Gruban using his power to help Booth, not the other way around. He was still in the witness box when the court day ended, and the next morning it was announced that Christopher Addison had come to the court. The judge allowed Addison to give his testimony before they continued with Booth, and during a cross-examination by Hastings Addison stated that he had not been advising Booth in any way, and that [...] "to say that Gruban's only chance of escape from internment was to hand over his shares to Mr Booth was a lie".|$|E
50|$|In {{a fictional}} court, various {{historical}} characters are brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness's</b> box {{and asked to}} narrate their version of history. These historical personalities range from mughal emperors Babur and Aurangzeb, Spanish adventurer Hernando Cortez, Lord Mountbatten, Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein, along with political leaders, religious zealots and even scheming Gods of mythology, many are accused of creating innumerable divided nations and people, and a legacy of hatred and distrust. The only arbiter standing for the humanity, is an unnamed abeed, littérateur. He listens <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses,</b> and mulls over the casualties of Kurukshetra, Kargil, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Nazi Germany, East Timor, the Aztec civilization and mythological Greece to Bosnia.|$|R

25|$|In April 2000, the Sunday World defamed a man {{who gave}} {{evidence}} in the murder trial of Catherine Nevin, falsely stating <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> offered <b>to</b> sell photographs <b>to</b> Williams. <b>The</b> <b>witness</b> said <b>the</b> article also defamed him by claiming he “bragged about his sexual prowess” <b>to</b> Williams. <b>The</b> article also unsuccessfully tried <b>to</b> falsely link <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> <b>to</b> Martin Cahill and the Dublin/Monaghan bombings. Sunday Newspapers Ltd, trading as the Sunday World, asked <b>the</b> High Court <b>to</b> dismiss <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> lawsuit, citing <b>the</b> length of time that had passed since the incident; the judge granted the tabloid's application.|$|R
500|$|As {{counsel for}} the prosecution, Hastings was the first {{barrister}} to speak. In his opening speech to the jury he criticised Booth for loving money rather than his country, saying {{that one of the}} things which the English prided themselves on was fair play, and [...] "no matter how loudly the defendant raises the cry of patriotism, I feel sure that your sense of fair play, gentlemen, will ensure a verdict that the defendant is unfit to sit in the House of Commons, as he has been guilty of fraud". Hastings then called Gruban <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> stand, and asked him to tell the jury what had happened. Gruban described how Booth had claimed to have influence over David Lloyd George. Gruban was then cross-examined by Rigby Swift.|$|E
500|$|On the trial's second day, {{soon after}} Barnes had taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> stand, Raith's counsel withdrew his client's defence. It {{had been his}} task, he said, [...] to prove a plea that the {{allegation}} in Raith's letter was true, and that Barnes had not been excluded capriciously. Counsel remarked that [...] "seldom {{in the history of}} libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly." [...] The case [...] ended at that point; Barnes was vindicated, and Raith's counsel issued him with a public apology. According to fellow administrator Alan Barnes, Johnson was a [...] "wide-open type of bloke" [...] who was vulnerable to manoeuvring. Colleagues advised Johnson to hire a lawyer before the case started, but he refused, saying that the libel case was merely a sporting matter, not a legal one.|$|E
500|$|On 17 July Smith {{complained of}} feeling unwell with chest and eye pain while under cross-examination, and {{proceedings}} were briefly halted {{while he was}} treated for the symptoms of a panic attack. When Smith returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> stand, he said he wished to speak to his barrister. Presiding judge Rafferty {{told him that he}} must answer questions, to which Smith replied: [...] "I want to change my plea. I'm fed up with this. I want to change my plea." [...] The charges were read to him again the following day, and he pleaded guilty. On 18 July 2001 Smith was sentenced to life imprisonment. In January 2005 Birmingham's Sunday Mercury newspaper reported that Smith had decided to change his plea after police agreed to return £400 confiscated from him during a raid on his flat after his arrest, and that he wanted the money to buy Mars bars in prison.|$|E

50|$|The {{sentence}} {{was carried out}} by Oklahoma's state electrician, Richard Earnest Owen. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witnesses</b> Gooch's hanging was botched and his death lasted 15 minutes. Many blamed Owen for this failure, because this was the only hanging he ever performed.|$|R
5000|$|Roncarelli {{was told}} that he was barred from holding a liquor licence and that the action was a warning that others would {{similarly}} be stripped of provincial [...] "privileges" [...] if they persisted in their activities related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Witnesses.</b>|$|R
500|$|Williams {{appeared}} at the Magistrates Court in Eastbourne for an initial hearing. He was not represented by either a solicitor or a barrister, and pleaded not guilty. On his way {{to and from the}} court Williams's head was again covered with an apron to prevent him from being photographed; the press accordingly dubbed him [...] "the hooded man." [...] The police decided that Seymour should take the witness stand as soon as possible to avoid her going back on what she had told the police. As such she was called <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> box by Cecil Whiteley (who was Treasury Counsel at the time) to go through her statement line by line. She was physically exhausted and fainted four times in the witness box; this and other interruptions meant that the initial hearing took four days. Eventually the case was referred to the Assizes for trial.|$|E
500|$|After an {{adjournment}} {{for lunch}} Gordon-Cumming returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> box, {{where he was}} cross-examined by Russell. During the session Russell provided {{a model of the}} table used and a photograph of the room, and questioned Gordon-Cumming about the bets where cheating had been suspected. Russell also asked him about why he had signed the document agreeing not to play cards: Gordon-Cumming stated that he had [...] "lost my head... on that occasion. If I had not lost my head I would not have signed that document". Gordon-Cumming's cross-examination ran into the second day, after which he was then re-examined by Clarke; his time in the witness box lasted until 1pm. The Illustrated London News considered that [...] "Gordon-Cumming made an admirable witness... leaning easily on the rail, his grey-gloved left hand resting easily on the bare right, perfectly dressed, his tones equable, firm, neither over-hurried nor over-deliberate, cool, but not too cool".|$|E
500|$|Starting on September 23 and {{continuing}} {{for over three}} weeks, each of the accused men was brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> stand to testify in his defense. The general trend of the men's responses was {{that all of them}} were willing to obey any order except to load ammunition, all were afraid of another explosion, and none had been approached by [...] "ringleaders" [...] persuading them not to workeach had made his own decision. Each man said that he himself had not coerced others to refuse to work. Some of the men related how, following the official interrogation at Camp Shoemaker, they had been under great pressure to sign statements containing things they had not said. Some men said that, at the meeting on the barge, Joe Small had not urged a mutiny and had not uttered any phrase to the effect of having the officers [...] "by the balls". On the witness stand, Small himself denied saying any such thing, though he would admit to it decades later in interviews.|$|E
5000|$|A {{party may}} impeach a witness for {{character}} by cross-examining <b>the</b> <b>witness</b> {{but not by}} introducing extrinsic evidence, about specific instances of prior misconduct, often called [...] "prior bad acts," [...] as long as <b>the</b> questions relate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>witness's</b> own character for truthfulness (or untruthfulness) or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> character for untruthfulness of a previous <b>witness</b> that <b>the</b> current <b>witness</b> has testified about before.|$|R

Four German sailors were found in Nicosians engine room and propeller shaft tunnel, and were killed.
