5|$|By early July 1724 Bach {{was more}} than a month into his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. BWV10 is the fifth of 40 chorale cantatas he started that year. The outer {{movements}} of the cantata are set for mixed choir and an orchestra consisting of trumpet, two oboes, strings and continuo. Luther's translation of Luke1:46–48 is <b>the</b> <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first movement. The canticle's doxology is <b>the</b> <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last movement. The five middle movements are a succession of arias and recitatives, with, between the fourth and sixth movement, a duet for alto and tenor. Soprano and bass each have one aria, and the two recitatives are sung by the tenor. <b>The</b> <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arias and recitatives is paraphrased and expanded from Luke1:49–53 and 55. <b>The</b> <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duet is Luther's translation of Luke1:54. The melody associated with Luther's German Magnificat appears in movements 1, 5 and 7.|$|E
