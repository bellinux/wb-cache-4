5|$|Intensification {{was more}} gradual {{following}} April9. At 0000UTC on April11, the JMA upgraded {{the system to}} tropical storm intensity, thus identifying it with the name Kujira. At roughly the same time, Kujira began to curve towards a westward track due to a high pressure area to the north. Concurrently the ambient wind shear abated and the storm further consolidated, allowing for more quicker strengthening. Throughout the following day, Kujira developed a banding eye feature that would later consolidate into a distinct circular eye; this was reflected with an upgrade to typhoon status by both the JTWC and JMA at 1800UTC on April12 and 0000UTC on April14, respectively. On April14, a shortwave trough caused Kujira to track slightly more northwestward. Marked intensification continued, and late on April15, the JTWC upgraded the typhoon to super typhoon intensity, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> while Kujira was located 400km (250mi) north-northwest of Yap State. At roughly the same time Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph). Estimated 1-minute sustained winds at that time were 250km/h (155mph), equivalent {{to that of a}} Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale. Following peak intensity, Kujira continued to track westward as it entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) at 1200UTC on April16, and as such the name Amang was assigned to the typhoon by the agency.|$|E

500|$|Ralambo was {{the ruler}} of the Kingdom of Imerina in the central Highlands region of Madagascar from 1575 to 1612. [...] Ruling from Ambohidrabiby, Ralambo {{expanded}} the realm of his father, Andriamanelo, {{and was the first}} to assign the name of Imerina to the region. [...] Oral history has preserved numerous legends about this king, including several dramatic military victories, contributing to his heroic and near-mythical status among the kings of ancient Imerina. The circumstances surrounding his birth, which occurred on the highly auspicious date of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> are said to be supernatural in nature and further add to the mystique of this sovereign.|$|E
500|$|According to {{one version}} of the story, while {{traversing}} the countryside, Radama and his men came across a wild zebu so exceptionally fat that the king {{decided to make a}} burnt offering of it. As the zebu flesh cooked, the enticing smell led Ralambo to taste the meat. He declared zebu meat to be fit for human consumption. In honor of the discovery, he decided to establish a holiday called fandroana that would be distinguished by the consumption of well-fattened zebu meat. [...] The holiday was to be celebrated on the day of his birth, which coincided with {{the first day of the}} year. To this end, the holiday symbolically represented a community-wide renewal that would take place over a period of several days before and after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

Michigan led 24–0 at halftime on touchdown runs by Fritz Seyferth and Ed Shuttlesworth, a 31-yard field goal by Dana Coin, and a 32-yard touchdown pass from Kevin Casey to Bo Rather.

In the fourth quarter, Michigan added two more touchdowns on a 92-yard interception return by Thom Darden and a short run by Harry Banks. With 91 rushing yards, Billy Taylor passed 2,000 career rushing yards to move into third place among Michigan's career rushing leaders. On defense, Michigan held UCLA to 39 rushing yards and sacked UCLA quarterback nine times. After the game, UCLA coach Pepper Rodgers said, [...] "I've never had a team dominated {{the way we were}} today." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before 1912 the {{delivery}} of parcels was controlled and handled by private companies, most of whom operated in cities and urban areas where there was more business to be had. Consequently, delivery of parcels to rural areas was inadequate and frequently hindered farmers who needed various supplies, parts and equipment delivered to their remote locations. To meet this demand Congress approved a law on August 24, 1912 creating postal rates for fourth class mail and providing for parcel post service. The Congressional law authorized the U.S. Post Office to produce the various special purpose postage stamps to pay the parcel fees, which became effective on January 1, 1913, the first day the U.S. Parcel Post began service. The 12 stamps were printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on the flat plate printing press on soft yellowish wove paper made with a single-line watermark bearing the letters 'U S P S' and were perforated with 12 gauge [...] The stamps were designed by Clair Aubrey Houston {{who at the time}} had worked at the Bureau for ten years, while the dies for the individual stamps were produced by several different engravers, with up to four engravers working on each die. The Post Office initially planned to place all dozen stamps on sale before parcel post service began, but Frank Hitchcock, the Postmaster General, deemed the original designs for the 3-cent, 50-cent and 75-cent denominations unsatisfactory, delaying the issue of those values until after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> The twelve stamps each bore their own distinctive subject in the vignette and were issued in a single color, [...] "carmine-rose". It was Hitchcock {{who came up with the}} idea of printing all the denominations of these stamps in one uniform color. However, because of the common color and similarity in border design Parcel Post stamps during the first six months of use were met with mixed reaction from postal personnel who had difficulty distinguishing the stamps at a glance and often confused the denominations, especially during busy hours. [...] "In an effort to help the stamp clerks an inscription of value in large plain capital letters was added to the [...] margin, next to each plate number. These were first added to plates on January 27, 1913." [...] An example of these large red spelled-out numbers, which appeared on two margins of each pane, can be seen on the illustration of the ten-cent plate block in the section [...] "Other configurations" [...] further down this page. [...] To compound the situation the stamps were larger than ordinary definitive stamps of the period, making it difficult to situate them on smaller parcels with limited space around the address and return address. They were also issued in sheets of 180, with four panes of 45 stamps per sheet, which was an inconvenient number for accounting purposes. By March the Postmaster General was considering using different colors for the individual stamps and a smaller, definitive-sized design [...] (for which plates of the 1 cent, 2 cent and 5 cent denominations were even engraved). Production of the Parcel Post sheets cut into 45 stamps each resulted in a somewhat higher percentage of stamps with straight edges (see image below) than other stamp productions, much to the disappointment of collectors at the time. Some philatelic publishers like Stanley Gibbons were rather unforgiving in their estimation of these new issues, referring to them as [...] "very useless stamps" [...] having an [...] "ugliness" [...] about them.|$|E
