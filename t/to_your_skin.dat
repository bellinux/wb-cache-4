50|$|Moisture-wicking fabrics are a {{class of}} hi-tech fabrics that provide {{moisture}} control for an athlete's skin. They move perspiration {{away from the body}} to the fabric's outer surface where it can evaporate. These fabrics typically are soft, lightweight, and stretchy—in other words, they are perfectly suited for making activewear. Moisture-wicking means that the fabric is absorbent and this can leave a barrier of wet fabric on <b>your</b> <b>skin.</b> Drywicking is the newest variation of moisture wicking. It is a smart two tier fabric that breaks the surface tension of sweat and propels it through the hydrophobic layer into a natural wicking outer layer like cotton where it is assisted by evaporative cooling leaving <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> absolutely dry. Besides the fact that your body can perform better, it will chemically free prevent odors because a bacteria microclimate cannot grow on dry skin. This broad category of fabrics is used to make garments like T-shirts, sports bras, running and cycling jerseys, socks, tracksuits, and polo-style shirts for any physical activity where the goal is <b>to</b> keep <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> as cool and dry as possible. Moisture-wicking fabrics are used to make apparel for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, mountain biking, snow skiing, and mountain climbing. Due to the popularity of garments made from these fabrics, more variations are being introduced to the market.|$|R

5000|$|In Western European culture, {{pale skin}} has {{indicated}} high status. A tan signified {{that you had}} to work outdoors as a manual laborer, while pale skin announced that you could afford {{to stay out of the}} sun and spend time and money cultivating your appearance. In the 1920s, pioneering fashion designer Coco Chanel popularized the idea of tanning. She made it so the sun represented pleasure and relaxation as well as wealth. [...] Post Industrial Revolution, tanning gained popularity because at this time it was easier to be employed, and therefore there was less outdoor manual labor, and more indoor labor. Due to more indoor jobs, a tan began to mean that you had time the leisure time <b>to</b> bronze <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> and the money to travel to places where it could be acquired.

40|$|Introduction to Skin Function The skin is a {{vital part}} of the body with many {{necessary}} functions: • The skin protects you from the environment. When <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> is intact, there is a barrier against bacteria and injury to the organs inside of the body. It prevents too much sunlight or harmful chemicals from entering the body. • The skin helps you stay warm or cool. Your sweat glands produce sweat and cool you off as the sweat evaporates from the skin. • Nerve endings in the skin send messages to the brain to give you information about pain, temperature and touch. Changes in Skin Function After Spinal Cord Injury After spinal cord impairment, the skin loses its ability to protect itself against harmful things. The nerves in parts of <b>your</b> <b>skin,</b> at and below the level of your spinal impairment, may not be able to send accurate information to the brain because of damage to the spinal cord. You may not be able to notice the difference between hot and cold. You may not feel a pin prick or know if someone has moved your leg. Unless you look, you cannot always tell where your legs, arms or fingers are. A pressure ulcer is a complication that may occur as a result of your spinal cord impairment. A pressure ulcer is an area of tissue damage caused by not relieving pressure. The area is usually over a bony prominence. In this section, you will find information on how to take care of <b>your</b> <b>skin,</b> how <b>to</b> prevent pressure ulcers and how to care for a pressure ulcer if one occurs. You will learn safety measures to protect yourself from harmful things in the environment, and how <b>to</b> check <b>your</b> <b>skin</b> regularly for potential problems.
