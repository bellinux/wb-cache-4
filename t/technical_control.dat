At some point, after delivery, the Army Air Forces named the repair vessels with FS-217 being named Colonel Armond Peterson.

The ship was based at Balboa, Canal Zone before being placed in reserve status on 17 February 1956.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} Vickers Type 630 {{design was}} completed at Brooklands by chief designer Rex Pierson {{and his staff}} in 1945, a 32-seat airliner powered by four Dart engines for a cruising speed of 275mph (443km/h). An order for two prototypes was placed in March 1946, and construction started in the company's Foxwarren Experimental Department. Originally Viceroy after the viceroy of India, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the aircraft was renamed Viscount following India's independence in 1947. There was work on replacing the Darts with the Mamba, but this was dropped {{by the time the}} prototypes were reaching completion. After Pierson's death in 1948, George Edwards (later Sir George Edwards) took over as chief designer and assumed all <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> over the Viscount project.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Toftoy was {{assigned}} to Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, as Director of the Ordnance Missile Laboratories, which was responsible for planning, <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> and supervision of what had become the nationwide Army guided missile and rocket development program.

In 1958, Toftoy became Deputy Commanding General of the Army Ordnance Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal.

25|$|The {{controller}} was a joint {{design by}} Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget and Hägglund, designated CMBK4. It {{was equipped with}} four cylinders. Those controlling the speed and braking were connected {{to each other and}} the controlled by the motorman by a wheel. The cylinders controlling the direction and disconnection of the motors were controlled by a lever. They were connected such that the main cylinder and the speed/braking cylinders had to be set to zero to disconnect the motors or change direction. The speed/braking controller had 24 levels. The reason for introducing a wheel was to allow the driver to man it with either hand and give it a more ergonomic location, as the motormen's job was to a greater degree to manoeuver the tram in traffic rather than a more <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> of the vehicle. The trams were unidirectional, but to allow them to back there were controls {{at the back of the}} vehicles, hidden within a hatch. It had three buttions, controlling speed, braking and emergency braking.|$|E

Reports and studies reflect that illicit acts such as cybercrime are predominantly the result of not only disregard for basic information security and but also lack of awareness about the importance of social issues associated with information technology. Consequently, focusing on the <b>technical</b> <b>controls</b> provides only a partial solution while managing cybercrime particularly in electronic government context. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the dynamic development of <b>technical</b> <b>controls</b> in different companies and to interpret the observations using Van de Ven and Poole's typology of change process theories. Design/methodology/approach – Case study data were obtained through semi-structured interviews, observation and document analysis in three organisations (Company A, Company B and Company C). Findings – The paper highlights the life-cycle development of <b>technical</b> <b>controls,</b> where controls are implemented, improved and eventually removed. It highlights the fact that the progression through the life-cycle can follow either a dialectical motor of change based on conflict or a teleological motor of change based on consensus. Research limitations/implications – The findings of the paper enhance the theory of rules developed by March et al., by providing insight into how change actually occurs, i. e. how inertia is broken. Practical implications – The paper offers practitioners some guidelines for the management of their control systems to help them maintain more effective and efficient control systems. Originality/value – The paper explains that under a teleological motor of change, inertia is broken more easily than under a dialectical one, because there is less tolerance for control obsolescence, hence improvement and removal of obsolete controls are more likely to occur. This is important for listed organisations having to implement more and more <b>technical</b> <b>controls</b> to comply with laws such as SOX. The paper also suggests that the life-cycle is not a “motor” of change as suggested by Van de Ven and Poole, because it cannot explain how inertia is broken...|$|R
