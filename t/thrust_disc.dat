40|$|EP 253181 A UPAB: 19930923 A fixture for a {{grinding}} wheel to an electric angle grinder {{is based on}} a clamping flange by which the wheel is clamped to the abutment of the hollow spindle. This flange is screwed to the threaded pin of a clamping pin. The cavity between the surfaces is filled with a plastic matrial, e. g. PVC of a low degree of polymerisation which is poured in as a liq. when hot and becomes a jelly when cold. By applying the lever on the <b>thrust</b> <b>disc,</b> the plunger is moved to displace the jelly in one of the cavities for a firm connection between for the wheel clamped between. ADVANTAGE - This relieves the clamping flange only when the grinding disc is to be changed and is ideal for one-hand grinders...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} five-degree-of-freedom (5 -DOF) hybrid {{magnetic}} bearing (HMB) for direct-drive wind turbines, which can realize suspension in the 4 -DOF radial and 1 -DOF axial directions. Only {{two sets of}} radial control windings are employed in the proposed HMB because only one set of radial control windings can achieve the 2 -DOF suspension in the radial direction. Unlike the traditional active thrust magnetic bearings, this paper uses a cylindrical rotor core without a large <b>thrust</b> <b>disc</b> in the novel HMB. The numbers of the controller, power amplifier and system volume can be reduced in the magnetic suspension system. This paper also presents the structure and basic characteristics of the proposed magnetic bearing. A precision equivalent magnetic circuit analysis of the permanent magnet ring and control magnetic field is conducted in this study, in consideration of the non-uniform distribution of magnetic density. Accordingly, the mathematical models, including the suspension force expression, are derived based on the accurate equivalent magnetic circuit. The basic principle of the structure parameter design is presented, based on the given key parameters. The accuracy of the analytical method is further validated by 3 D finite element analysis...|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the small}} {{diameter}} fans used in turbofan jet engines, the propeller {{has a large}} diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air. This permits a lower airstream velocity for a given amount of thrust. As it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate {{a large amount of}} air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large degree, a low <b>disc</b> loading (<b>thrust</b> per <b>disc</b> area) increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use.|$|R
50|$|At that moment, {{the crew}} applied maximum thrust on the engines {{to climb to}} 18000 ft. Supposedly, had they not applied <b>thrust,</b> the turbine <b>disc</b> in the inner left (No. 2) engine would have survived the entire flight. However, nine minutes after the thrust was applied, the faulty {{bearings}} inside the engine overheated enough (to about 1000 C) to cause an explosion.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the small}} {{diameter}} fans used in turbofan jet engines, the main rotor on a helicopter {{has a large}} diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air. This permits a lower downwash velocity for a given amount of thrust. As it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate {{a large amount of}} air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large degree, a low <b>disc</b> loading (<b>thrust</b> per <b>disc</b> area) greatly increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use and permits reasonable range. The hover efficiency ("figure of merit") of a typical helicopter is around 60%. The inner third length of a rotor blade contributes very little to lift due to its low airspeed.|$|R
500|$|Two {{distinct}} {{types of}} prey capture behavior {{have been observed}} in the marbled electric ray. The first is [...] "jumping", used by the ray to attack prey fish that swim close to its head, typically no farther than [...] In the [...] "jump", the ray pulls back its head and then <b>thrusts</b> its <b>disc</b> upwards, reaching {{about two or three}} times as high as the prey fish is from the bottom. Simultaneously, it makes a single tail stroke and produces a high-frequency (230–430 Hz, increasing with temperature) burst of electricity. The initial electric burst is very short, containing only 10–64 pulses, but is still strong enough to cause tetanic contraction {{in the body of the}} prey fish, often breaking its vertebral column. As the ray glides forward, the motion of the jump sweeps the now-paralyzed prey beneath it, whereupon it is enveloped by the disc and maneuvered to the mouth. Electric bursts continues to be produced during this process; the total number of electric pulses over a single jump increases with size, ranging from 66 in a newborn [...] long to 340 in an adult [...] long. The jump lasts no more than two seconds.|$|R
50|$|Only the {{limitations}} of weight and materials (e.g., the strengths and melting points of materials in the turbine) reduce the efficiency at which a turbofan gas turbine converts this thermal energy into mechanical energy, for while the exhaust gases may still have available energy to be extracted, each additional stator and turbine disk retrieves progressively less mechanical energy per unit of weight, and increasing the compression ratio of the system by adding to the compressor stage to increase overall system efficiency increases temperatures at the turbine face. Nevertheless, high-bypass engines have a high propulsive efficiency because even slightly increasing the velocity {{of a very large}} volume and consequently mass of air produces a very large change in momentum and thrust: thrust is the engine's mass flow (the amount of air flowing through the engine) multiplied by the difference between the inlet and exhaust velocities in—a linear relationship—but the kinetic energy of the exhaust is the mass flow multiplied by one-half the square of the difference in velocities. A low <b>disc</b> loading (<b>thrust</b> per <b>disc</b> area) increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use.|$|R

40|$|The authors {{provide a}} welcome amount of {{experimental}} {{data on the}} novel use of a floating disc element in a thrust bearing configuration. The concept of a floating ring in a journal bearing {{has been used in}} real hardware for some time now, particularly for low load high speed situations. It has always suffered from concerns that the ring will not truly float. This paper describes a <b>thrust</b> bearing floating <b>disc</b> designed so that pressurized fluid is assured to the pockets {{on both sides of the}} disc. In this way, true flotation is assured and their ex-perimental data prove this very well. The turbulent results warrant some further discussion, since the authors have chosen to double the total film thickness as compared to a single film hydrostatic thrust bearing. The pumping power and flow have then been doubled also, an offset to the reduce...|$|R
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearings (AMBs) {{are used}} in many high speed machinery applications because of their advantages of no contact, no wear, no need for lubrications and ability to operate in high rotational speeds. AMBs represent an alternative solution to traditional mechanical bearing due to their contactless working principle. Touchdown bearings are needed in AMBs to prevent system damage under certain conditions such as sudden impact or sudden change of unbalance. In these conditions, rotor may make contact with touchdown bearings. AMBs may {{have the capability to}} accommodate sudden impact without contact though this will require novel design of control strategy for thrust and touchdown bearing. The purpose of this work is to provide platform for the robust control design research of flexible rotor-AMB touchdown systems. To this end research work concentrates on the design, construction and simulation of magnetic thrust and touchdown system. The report begins with the identifications of flexible rotor AMB system configuration. In this content accurate rotor system model considering AMB, <b>thrust</b> and touchdown <b>discs</b> was obtained using FEM technique according to Timoshenko beam theory. Design of flexible rotor AMB system requires careful attention towards rotordynamic design aspect such as observability and controllability and it is important that actuator and sensor location are away from the nodal point. Identification of flexible rotor-AMB system model is achieved in a series of steps. Free-free undamped mode shapes were obtained in this work which predicts the dynamic behaviour of the flexible rotor. The plot of the free-free mode shapes and natural frequencies results have shown that the system is controllable and observable. Second, Campbell diagram was generated to see the effect of gyroscopic behaviour on the splitting of natural frequencies into forward and backword modes. Campbell diagram results showed satisfactory behaviour of flexible rotor. The second goal of this work is to acquire technical design, modelling of electromechanical components and control unit. Magnetic actuator design specifications were obtained based on magnetic circuit analysis. Unigraphics software was used to carry out detail design and 3 D modeling/assembly of electromechanical components. In this context purchase cost estimation was identified based on quotations. Purchase of rotor model components were made outside. The third goal of a thesis work is to verify the flexible rotor system model using experimental test. Hammer used as a force transducer was used in the test as excitation of the system and accelerometer used to measure response of the system. The experimental result validates the FEM technique because it is in reasonably good agreement with simulation results. The experimental mode shape results showed rotor will perform well within design speed range...|$|R
