500|$|Others {{have noted}} {{that the lack of}} {{coverage}} is not simply a media issue. Peter Fahy, the spokesman on race issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: [...] "A lot of police officers and other professionals feel almost the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> try and avoid [...] for fear of being criticised. This is not healthy". Montague suggests the lack of police appeals in cases involving white victims may be a cause of the lack of media coverage. Evidence of this was seen in the Parker case, with the police initially appearing keen to dismiss the possible racist aspect of the murder, stating [...] "there was {{no reason to believe that}} the attack was racially motivated".|$|E
2500|$|The obvious <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{check all}} triangles [...] against all triangles [...] for collisions, but this {{involves}} [...] comparisons, which is highly inefficient.

2500|$|... 28 As a {{consequence}} of the discovery of the several independent introductions of the sampling theorem, people started to refer to the theorem by including the names of the aforementioned authors, resulting in such catchphrases as “the Whittaker–Kotel’nikov–Shannon (WKS) sampling theorem" [...] or even [...] "the Whittaker–Kotel'nikov–Raabe–Shannon–Someya sampling theorem" [...] To avoid confusion, perhaps the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> refer to it as the sampling theorem, [...] "rather than trying to find a title that does justice to all claimants" [...]|$|E
2500|$|Both [...] "deaf" [...] and [...] "heaven" [...] (here scanned as one syllable) have tonic stress, {{but that}} of [...] "deaf" [...] is {{normally}} subordinated to that of [...] "heaven", allowing them comfortably to fill odd/even positions, but not even/odd. A reversal of the third ictus (as shown above) is normally preceded by at least a slight intonational break, which [...] "deaf heaven" [...] does not allow. Peter Groves calls this a [...] "harsh mapping", and recommends that in performance [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> prolong the subordinated S-syllable ... {{the effect of this}} is to throw a degree of emphasis on it".|$|E
2500|$|On January 3, 2007, Brodhead invited Seligmann and Finnerty back to Duke as {{students}} {{in good standing}} even though they still faced charges. They were also welcomed to participate on the lacrosse team. [...] Brodhead explained, [...] "We have decided that the right and fair <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> welcome back Reade Seligmann and Collin Finnerty to resume their studies at Duke for the spring semester. Although the students still face serious charges and larger issues require Duke’s collective attention, the circumstances in this case have changed substantially, and it is appropriate that the students {{have an opportunity to}} continue their education." [...] Both declined. Instead, Seligmann decided to enroll at Brown University, while Finnerty chose to attend Loyola College in Maryland.|$|E

Sharpton began the {{interview}} by commending the [...] "blacks and whites who stood vigil and to come together in that community {{to stand up for}} this girl." [...] In response to Bill O'Reilly's questions concerning the possibility that the woman might have fabricated the allegations, Sharpton said, [...] "First of all, the authorities have charged there was a crime. ... When the prosecutors went forward, they clearly have said this girl is the victim, so why would we be trying the victim?" [...] When O'Reilly mentioned recent news reports that DNA testing had failed to match any of the defendants, Sharpton said, [...] "I think that all of the facts that you have laid out the DA had — and I know this DA is probably not one that is crazy. He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict." [...] Sharpton continued that the case parallels [...] "Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom." [...] At the conclusion of the interview, when O'Reilly said that Sharpton didn't know what happened, Sharpton agreed. [...] "I don't know yet and I think that the proper <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> support those that want justice." ...|$|E
