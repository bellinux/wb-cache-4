5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of {{precision}} air attack throughout his life, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>War</b> College. He authored three books on air strategy: <b>The</b> <b>Air</b> <b>War</b> Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic Air War Against Japan (1980), and Strategic Air War Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy.|$|E

5|$|Some historians {{dispute the}} degree to which the Akutan Zero {{influenced}} the outcome of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>war</b> in the Pacific. For example, the Thach Weave, a tactic created by John Thach and used with great success by American airmen against the Zero, was devised by Thach prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, based on intelligence reports on the Zero's performance in China.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{victory at}} Kaiapit enabled the Australian 7th Division to be flown {{in to the}} upper Markham Valley. It {{accomplished}} the 7th Division's primary mission, for the Japanese could no longer threaten Lae or Nadzab, where a major airbase was being developed. The victory also led to the capture of the entire Ramu Valley, which provided new forward fighter airstrips for <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>war</b> against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper–Church Amendment was resurrected {{during the}} winter and {{incorporated}} into the Supplementary Foreign Assistance Act of 1970.

5|$|After Hitler's death, Speer {{offered his}} {{services}} to the so-called Flensburg Government, headed by Hitler's successor, Karl Dönitz, and took {{a significant role in}} that short-lived regime. On May15, an allied delegation arrived and asked Speer if {{he would be willing to}} provide information on the effects of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>war.</b> Speer agreed, and over the next several days, provided information on a broad range of subjects. On May23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.|$|E
5|$|In August 1947 {{he entered}} <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>War</b> College at Maxwell Field and {{graduated}} the following June. He then became {{deputy secretary of}} the Air Staff at Air Force Headquarters, Washington, D.C. and became a {{special assistant to the}} vice chief of staff there in January 1951. In September 1954 he became Air Deputy to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Defense College, which was then located in Paris, France. On September 1, 1956, he became deputy director, Military Assistance Division, United States European Command, also in Paris. In May 1958 he returned to Air Force headquarters and became assistant for coordination to deputy chief of staff for Plans and Programs.|$|E
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>war</b> {{turned out to}} be the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E

5|$|Posted to England in June 1943, Balmer took {{command of}} No.467 Squadron RAAF, flying Avro Lancasters in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>war</b> over Europe. He led his unit through the Battle of Berlin from November 1943 to March 1944. In April {{he was awarded}} the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the {{following}} month promoted to temporary group captain. Days later, on the night of 11/12 May, the last scheduled operation of his tour as No.467 Squadron's commanding officer, Balmer failed to return from a mission over Belgium. Initially posted as missing, his plane was later confirmed to have been shot down, and all of the crew killed. Balmer was buried outside Brussels.|$|E
5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company had {{defeated}} {{the vanguard of}} Nakai's force and stopped his advance down the Markham Valley dead in its tracks. The Battle of Kaiapit accomplished Vasey's primary mission, for the Japanese could no longer threaten Nadzab. It opened {{the gate to the}} Ramu Valley for the 21st Infantry Brigade, provided new forward fighter airstrips for <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>war</b> against the Japanese, and validated the Australian Army's new training methods and the organisational emphasis on firepower.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter {{was to play}} a {{major role}} during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965; along with the Gnat the Hunter was India's primary air defence fighter, and {{regularly}} engaged in dogfights with the Pakistani F-86 Sabres and F-104 Starfighters. The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month. Both sides claimed victory in <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>war,</b> Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own. Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate.|$|E

5|$|The YB-17s {{quickly became}} {{obsolete}} and were transferred in October 1940 to the 19th Bomb Group at March Field, California, when the 2d BG acquired newer models. During World War II they operated again at Langley Field until mid-1942. The Air Corps belatedly put the B-17 into mass production beginning in July 1940, {{but at the}} time of the attack on Pearl Harbor still had only 198 in service. However, 12,000 were produced during the war, became the backbone of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>war</b> against Germany, and were an iconic symbol of the AAF.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamics}} of <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>war</b> changed in June 1941. The German {{invasion of the}} Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, opened up the Eastern Front. The German bomber force was heavily committed to the theatre. The escalation of the fighting in the Mediterranean and North African theatres also diverted German air strength. The operations of the Luftwaffe over Britain changed dramatically. Small numbers of bombers would make hit-and-run attacks on selected targets near the coast {{for the remainder of}} 1941, replacing the mass raids of the preceding autumn and winter. Cunningham used the decline in the pace of operations to train new crews.|$|E
5|$|Tibbets {{returned}} to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended <b>the</b> <b>Air</b> <b>War</b> College. After {{he graduated in}} June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France. He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He {{returned to}} the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956. They had a son, James Tibbets.|$|E
