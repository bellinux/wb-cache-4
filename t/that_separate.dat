Board of Education, {{in which the}} {{unanimous}} court held <b>that</b> <b>separate</b> public schools for {{black and white students}} was unconstitutional. Although agitation for an end to racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E
5|$|Most methods <b>that</b> <b>separate</b> {{neptunium}} ions {{exploit the}} differing chemical behaviour of the differing oxidation states of neptunium (from +3 to +6 or sometimes even +7) in solution. Among the methods that are {{or have been}} used are: solvent extraction (using various extractants, usually multidentate β-diketone derivatives, organophosphorus compounds, and amine compounds), chromatography using various ion-exchange or chelating resins, coprecipitation (possible matrices include LaF3, BiPO4, BaSO4, Fe(OH)3, and MnO2), electrodeposition, and biotechnological methods. Currently, commercial reprocessing plants use the Purex process, involving the solvent extraction of uranium and plutonium with tributyl phosphate.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus bataar was {{originally}} {{described as a}} species of Tyrannosaurus, an arrangement that has been supported by some more recent studies. Others prefer to keep the genera separate, while still recognizing them as sister taxa. A 2003 cladistic analysis based on skull features instead identified Alioramus as the closest known relative of Tarbosaurus, as the two genera share skull characteristics {{that are related to}} stress distribution and that are not found in other tyrannosaurines. If proven, this relationship would argue against Tarbosaurus becoming a synonym for Tyrannosaurus and would suggest <b>that</b> <b>separate</b> tyrannosaurine lineages evolved in Asia and North America. The two known specimens of Alioramus, which show juvenile characteristics, are not likely juvenile individuals of Tarbosaurus because of their much higher tooth count (76 to 78 teeth) and their unique row of bony bumps along the top of their snouts.|$|E

5|$|The {{brains of}} {{vertebrates}} {{are made of}} very soft tissue. Living brain tissue is pinkish {{on the outside and}} mostly white on the inside, with subtle variations in color. Vertebrate brains are surrounded by a system of connective tissue membranes called meninges <b>that</b> <b>separate</b> the skull from the brain. Blood vessels enter the central nervous system through holes in the meningeal layers. The cells in the blood vessel walls are joined tightly to one another, forming the blood–brain barrier, which blocks the passage of many toxins and pathogens (though at the same time blocking antibodies and some drugs, thereby presenting special challenges in treatment of diseases of the brain).|$|E
5|$|The Mackinac Bridge carries I-75 {{across the}} Straits of Mackinac <b>that</b> <b>separate</b> Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form the {{connection}} between Lakes Michigan and Huron. The structure, {{unlike the rest of}} the state highways in Michigan like I-75, is under the maintenance and control of the Mackinac Bridge Authority (MBA). The authority collects a toll from traffic that crosses the bridge, which , is $4 for passenger cars and $5 per axle for commercial vehicles and motorhomes. In addition to cash, the MBA offers a pre-paid debit card option for the payment of tolls. The authority also provides a driver assistance program that will drive vehicles across the bridge at no additional charge; motorists who use the service have a fear of bridges. Because the bridge normally only allows motor vehicles, bicyclists and snowmobiles shuttled across are subject to fees. The authority maintains a small police department to patrol the bridge and escort vehicles across, and a pair of radio station transmitters that broadcast bridge conditions and travel information on AM530 and AM1610.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution <b>that</b> <b>separate</b> mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past to see that there is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E

5|$|The cusp at {{the front}} of M1, the anterocone, is {{separated}} into two smaller cusps by an indentation. In A.donovani, a ridge generally connects the two cusps {{at the front}} margin of the tooth, so that the indentation separating them is closed at the front (an anteromedian fossette), but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is open toward the front (an anteromedian flexus). An additional crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the anterocone. Further to the back, there is a pair of cusps—the protocone at the lingual, or inner, side and the paracone at the labial, or outer, side. A crest issues from the paracone and is attached to the front or middle part of the protocone. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph crest is present; an additional crest usually connects the two. At the back of the tooth, there are two additional large cusps—the hypocone (lingual) and metacone (labial)—and a prominent crest, the posteroloph, issues from the hypocone and is located behind the metacone. In A.donovani, the metacone is generally connected to the posteroloph, but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is directly connected to the hypocone. The valleys <b>that</b> <b>separate</b> the cusps extend from the lingual and labial margins to about the midline of the molar. In addition to a large root at the front and two large roots at the back (one labial, one lingual) there is a small additional labial root.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} the workers and queens are as long as broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with {{thirteen}} known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax is longer than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum is longer than it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is {{as long as it}} is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological differences <b>that</b> <b>separate</b> the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and thorax, M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown.|$|E
5|$|Xu Xing, another Chinese paleontologist, named a {{new species}} of Psittacosaurus in 1997, based on a {{complete}} skull with associated vertebrae and a forelimb. This material was recovered in Gansu Province, near the border with Inner Mongolia. This species is named P. mazongshanensis after the nearby mountain called Mazongshan (Horse Mane Mountain) and has been described in a preliminary manner. Unfortunately, the skull was damaged while {{in the care of}} the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP), and several fragments have been lost, including all of the teeth. The remains were found in the Lower Xinminbao Formation, which have not been precisely dated, although {{there is some evidence that}} they were deposited in the late Barremian through Aptian stages. Sereno suggested in 2000 that P. mazongshanensis was a nomen dubium, with no unique features <b>that</b> <b>separate</b> it from any other species of Psittacosaurus. However, more recent authors have noted that it can be distinguished by its proportionally long snout compared to other species of Psittacosaurus, as well as a prominent bony protuberance, pointing outwards and downwards, on the maxilla of the upper jaw. The maxillary protuberance is also now missing. Other features originally used to distinguish the species have been recognised as the results of the deformation of the skull after fossilisation. Sereno (2010) remained unconvinced of its validity.|$|E
