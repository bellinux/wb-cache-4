It is a <b>thin,</b> <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> characterized by a unique crinkled surface that provides surface stand-off between layers and minimizes heat transfer in multilayer applications. NRC- 2 /Two is a two-sided metallized film. The material, originally developed as a skin for balloon-like satellites, was later used by NASA as a thermal barrier.

This machine laminates various patterns of polyester yarn to a <b>thin</b> <b>polyester</b> <b>film.</b> The {{results show that the}} shear strength of materials changes with the angle selected for the transverse yarns, and substantial increases in biaxial load carrying capabilities, compared to materials formerly used, are possible.

40|$|To {{explore the}} limits of layer wound (RE) Ba 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x (REBCO, RE = Rare Earth) coils in a high {{magnetic}} field environment > 30 T, {{a series of small}} insert coils have been built and characterized in background fields. One of the coils repeatedly reached 35. 4 T using a single ~ 100 m length of REBCO tape wet wound with epoxy and nested in a 31 T background magnet. The coil was quenched safely several times without degradation. Contributing to the success of this coil was the introduction of a <b>thin</b> <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> that surrounded the conductor. This approach introduces a weak circumferential plane in the coil pack that prevents conductor delamination that has caused degradation of several epoxy impregnated coils previously made by this and other groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{permeation}} {{resistance of}} <b>thin</b> <b>polyester</b> <b>films</b> and metallized, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films was evaluated to assess then feasibility {{for use in}} chemical protective clothing applications. For a 0 002 cm <b>polyester</b> <b>film,</b> permeation tests were conducted with acetone, carbon disulfide, dichloromethane, and tetrahy-drofuran In all cases no permeation was detected for a five hour duration at the sen-sitivity of the permeation method. Concentrated sulfuric acid, however, severely degraded the <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> Permeation tests were also conducted {{with a series of}} 0. 0033 and 0. 0071 cm LDPE, metallized-LDPE films, and then laminates to study the contribution of the metal layer to the barrier properties Tests with dichloro-methane were performed on the films and laminates as is and also after flexing In all cases, the dichloromethane permeation rates were lower through the metallized-LDPE films than through the LDPE substrate alone when tested without flexing. The permeation rates through the metallized-LDPE films following flexing, however, were similar to those measured for the LDPE substrate Note Although the ~e 5 ea~ch de 11, o) iii patt t 1) B the Uiiited States Em Ironment. 11 Piotectioii AgeencB tliiotigii Gonttact No 6 h- 03 - 3293 to Adh 1 B 1 1 ~ Little, 1 m, it has not been iul>jecte Ageiic % cewew. lI 1 d thel dOl (loes not necew<mlv cefleet the wews of the Agenev and) U) omoa) endotsement should he nueoe...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a laser-based, non-contact sealing technique for thin, polyester-based lidding films, used in PET containers for food packaging. The method uses a beam-steered laser {{to seal the}} container, thereby enabling virtually instant change over from one product line to another. Unlike conventional sealing PET film processes, no bespoke tooling is required to hold the package components in close proximity and under pressure whilst the seal is formed. This greatly reduces sealing machine tooling costs and potential downtime at product changeovers. Results are presented that show that the process is able to produce seals of higher strength using <b>thin</b> (26 µm) <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> than those from the conventional thermal/mechanical process. This provides a potential for increased production flexibility, reduction in product wastage, and for reducing the cost and embodied energy in construction of a less massive sealing machine...|$|R
25|$|The {{double-sided}} metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} electrodes {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene film capacitor with double-sided metallization on a <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the <b>thinner</b> <b>polyester</b> foil improves the volumetric efficiency of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|R

A belt blank, for example, of a <b>thin</b> <b>polyester</b> <b>film,</b> is rotated on the rollers as heat is applied. Four rollers, each {{mounted on a}} separate roller assembly, are movable along appropriate tracks while a fifth centrally located roller is stationary. A pair of dc motors are operatively connected to a speed reduction gear assembly to provide a pair of rotating drive shafts that extend into the oven. One rotating shaft drives all of the rollers through a rotational gear assembly while the other drive shaft is capable of positioning the movable rollers through respective rotating threaded shafts. Control devices are provided for controlling the motors while measuring devices are operatively connected to the positional drive shaft to indicate {{the position of the}} rollers...|$|E

30|$|For {{fabricating}} {{a magnetic}} fluid film, two JGS 3 {{glasses and a}} <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> are needed. The glass has 50 -mm width, 50 -mm length and 1 -mm thickness. The <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> has a 30 -mm-diameter circular hole in the central section. The <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> is sandwiched in between the two glasses, and the magnetic fluid is injected into the circular hole. Then, the three-layer film is clamped by an attachment.

40|$|The X-ray {{fluorescence}} technique using {{peak intensity}} ratios of trace elements {{is one of}} the faster, less expensive and less invasive methods for obsidian sourcing. Moreover, XRF peak intensity ratios are particularly useful when the artifact is slightly altered, particularly affecting the alkali cations, or when its surfaces are covered with a fine film of carbonate deposits formed while the sample was buried. The limitation of this technique results from the dimensions of the obsidian samples: very small obsidian samples, nowadays about 1 cm in size, are difficult to measure given the very few X-rays emitted by their surface. An aluminium holder closed with a very <b>thin</b> Mylar© <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> was prepared and the specimen, positioned at the centre of the surface of the Mylar film, was placed in the XRF spectrometer. The use of recent technology XRF apparatus equipped with a 4 kW Rh anode X-ray tube coupled with an accurate measurement of refined X-ray characteristic lines, that exclude the X-ray background contribution, of five trace elements (Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb), made it possible to determine the source geological outcrop of archaeological obsidian samples as little as 7 mm and as light as 40 mg. A database of peak intensity ratios, background and interference free, of five trace elements was produced for obsidian samples from Monte Arci, Palmarola, Lipari, Pantelleria, Gyali and Melos. This database may be used by other laboratories provided the X-ray intensity of the trace elements Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb are measured as net intensities, that is purified from the contribution of the background and from interelemental interferences. A comparison between data obtained with two spectrometers, of different generation and differently calibrated, confirmed the possibility of obtaining a database that can be shared with other laboratories. The proposed XRF method was tested on Neolithic obsidians from four Apulian sites (Ripa Tetta at Lucera, Palestra ex G. I. L. at Foggia, Pulo di Molfetta and Grotta di Santa Barbara at Polignano a Mare), whose source outcrops had been also determined by SEM-EDS...|$|R

25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of PET film capacitors {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency.

The capacitance frequency dependence of <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors compared with the other film capacitors is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> capacitors compared with the other film capacitor types.|$|R
