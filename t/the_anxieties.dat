In the years that followed, as her children were abroad at boarding schools and universities, and her husband was active once more in Ghanaian politics and as an ambassador for the nation, she stayed mostly in Kumasi, providing the base from which he could travel out into the world, secure in the knowledge that Peggy was taking care of things on the home front. She kept an eye on the properties he had inherited from his grand-uncle. Despite her family's extensive political involvements, Peggy herself was not particularly interested in party politics. She supported her husband, of course. But her own contributions were through the wide range of social work she engaged in. Having learned Twi, the language of the Asante, she became interested in and knowledgeable about Akan art and folklore, as she acquired a major goldweight collection, began collecting and translating proverbs, and learned Ananse stories, many of them from her husband. For three decades, a visit to her house and her goldweight collection was {{one of the highlights of}} a visit to Ashanti for visitors interested in its art.|$|E

Under <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> condition, an egostressor was used to provoke <b>anxiety</b> on <b>the</b> part of <b>the</b> observers. State <b>anxiety,</b> {{as measured by the}} state scale of <b>the</b> State-Trait <b>Anxiety</b> Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970) and <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> thermometer, was found to increase significantly for <b>the</b> high trait <b>anxiety</b> group only. Heart rate elevation above resting level however was found to remain high under <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> condition and to decrease as the experiment progressed under the control condition for all three groups, suggesting that they were all affected by <b>the</b> <b>anxiety</b> manipulation. In line with the predictions of the theory of affordances, anxiety did not influence the location of the judged critical point. The steepness of the slope of the discrimination curve at the critical point was negatively affected by anxiety.

Patton repeatedly boasted of his sexual success with this young woman but his biographers are skeptical. Hirshson says the relationship was casual.

500|$|With {{the rise}} of feminist {{literary}} criticism in the 1970s, Mary Shelley's works, particularly Frankenstein, began to attract much more attention from scholars. Feminist and psychoanalytic critics were {{largely responsible for the}} recovery from neglect of Shelley as a writer. Ellen Moers {{was one of the first}} to claim that Shelley's loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of Frankenstein. She argues that the novel is a [...] "birth myth" [...] in which Shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mother's death as well as for failing as a parent. Shelley scholar Anne K. Mellor suggests that, from a feminist viewpoint, it is a story [...] "about what happens when a man tries to have a baby without a woman... is profoundly concerned with natural as opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction". Victor Frankenstein's failure as a [...] "parent" [...] in the novel has been read as an expression of <b>the</b> <b>anxieties</b> which accompany pregnancy, giving birth, and particularly maternity.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} that Haggard began writing She, society had more anxiety {{about the role of}} women. Debates {{regarding}} [...] "The Woman Question" [...] dominated Britain during the fin de siècle, as well as anxieties over the increasing position and independence of the [...] "New Woman". Alarm over social degeneration and societal decadence further fanned concerns over the woman's movement and female liberalisation, which challenged the traditional conception of Victorian womanhood. The role and rights of women had changed dramatically since {{the early part of the}} century, as they entered the workforce, received better education, and gained more political and legal independence. Writing in 1894, Haggard believed that marriage was the natural state for women: [...] "Notwithstanding the energetic repudiations of the fact that confront us at every turn, it may be taken for granted that in most cases it is the natural mission of women to marry; that – always in most cases – if they do not marry they become narrowed, live a half life only, and suffer in health of body and of mind." [...] He created the character of She-who-must-be-obeyed [...] "who provided a touchstone for many of <b>the</b> <b>anxieties</b> surrounding the New Woman in late-Victorian England".|$|E

[...] James changed his focus from <b>the</b> <b>anxieties</b> of English Catholics {{to the establishment of}} an Anglo-Scottish union. [...] He also appointed Scottish nobles such as George Home to his court, which proved unpopular with the Parliament of England. [...] Some Members of Parliament made it clear that in their view, the [...] "effluxion of people from the Northern parts" [...] was unwelcome, and compared them to [...] "plants which are transported from barren ground into a more fertile one". [...] Even more discontent resulted when the King allowed his Scottish nobles to collect the recusancy fines. [...] There were 5,560convicted of recusancy in 1605, of whom 112were landowners. [...] The very few Catholics of great wealth who refused to attend services at their parish church were fined £20 per month. [...] Those of more moderate means had to pay two-thirds of their annual rental income; middle class recusants were fined one shilling a week, although the collection of all these fines was [...] "haphazard and negligent". [...] When James came to power, almost £5,000 a year (equivalent to over £10million in 2008) was being raised by these fines.|$|E

Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{declared}} it as [...] "one of 30 Rock's best episodes ever" [...] He praised Carrie Fisher's guest appearance, but felt that Baldwin's role-playing during Morgan's therapy session stole the show. Bob Sassone of TV Squad felt that even though the plot was [...] "insane", the episode still managed [...] "to have a heart at its core". Sassone called the therapy scene [...] "one of the funniest scenes ... on TV this season". Robert Canning of IGN felt that the episode has [...] "great storylines to great guest stars", making it [...] "one of the best the series has produced so far". Canning called the therapy scene [...] "the best moment of the episode". [...] Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] " [...] Between Carrie Fisher's delightfully bonkers guest role and Jack Donaghy's hijacking of Tracy Jordan's therapy session, this 2007 episode was so wrong.

500|$|While {{many fans}} were upset with this sudden change of direction, {{the album was}} {{generally}} well received by mainstream publications. Entertainment Weekly was highly positive, writing that [...] "This is the group at their best." [...] In his review of the album, Rolling Stone writer Barry Walters wrote [...] "On a Wire quivers with <b>the</b> <b>anxieties</b> that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards [...] [...] [...] The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender." [...] The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band's popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, {{only to find that}} they had far less support from both their fans and their record label. Using the financial and critical success of Something to Write Home About, Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as Alkaline Trio, Dashboard Confessional, and Saves the Day. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label's top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of On a Wire. In an interview with Alternative Press, lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on On a Wire seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since Something to Write Home About, allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up Kids had previously earned. In an interview, Pryor confessed that he did not think that [...] "anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance". Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term [...] "emo", a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop-oriented acts. Pryor commented on the album, saying [...] "We really didn't give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really confident {{that we were going to}} kill this 'emo' stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust." ...|$|E
