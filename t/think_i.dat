5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can't {{be happy}} if I'm the only one that's getting {{published}} by Random House when I know there are such magnificent writers – both Latinos and Latinas, both Chicanos and Chicanas – in the U.S. whose books are not published by mainstream presses or whom the mainstream isn't even aware of. And, you know, if my success means that other presses will {{take a second look}} at these writers... and publish them in larger numbers, then our ship will come in.|$|E
5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was {{the first}} woman to play a marshal in a movie western. Roger would often cast against type in those days. I could never resist a plum role like a lady marshal in a genre that would never have {{considered}} such a gender reversal like that before. However, working with Roger was always an adventure and this film was no exception.|$|E

25|$|To make it, I prayed by the hour. It was automatic, almost subconscious. I {{did not ask}} God to take me out of it. I prayed {{he would}} give me {{strength}} to endure it. When it would get so bad that I did not <b>think</b> <b>I</b> could stand it, I would ask God to ease it and somehow I would make it. He kept me.|$|E

But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.|$|E

25|$|Regarding {{comments}} he made {{suggesting that}} contracts for the mega-fight {{were close to}} being finalized, De La Hoya told BoxingScene.com on July 26, 2010: I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> said it because I get the question asked so many times that, obviously, I was fed up and tired of it and I just said like, yeah, yeah, it's gonna get made. So it was a quick answer that I should have obviously thought about. But, obviously, negotiations weren't going on. Nothing was going on.|$|E

25|$|After {{this she}} was {{thrashing}} {{around on the}} ground. She was trying to scream but nothing was coming out. I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> kicked her because she wouldn't keep still. And then I put my foot on to her to keep her still. This didn't work so I stabbed her in the throat. I aimed and stabbed at the hard thing in her neck. I pushed the knife {{all the way in}} but she still wouldn't keep still so I worked out where her heart would be and I stabbed her {{on the left side of}} the chest.|$|E
25|$|I {{just had}} to lay it down, more or less: first track... second track – you know, really fast working on that. And all the guitar overdubs on Presence were done in one night. But I didn't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{would be able to}} do it in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. I was very happy with the guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E
25|$|Madonna {{approached}} me. We {{sat for a}} cup of tea {{and again}} {{for a cup of}} tea. Hopefully, it will all come together. I'm actually not familiar with her work, and I told her this flat-out. She sent a couple of films and I still haven't seen them... But no matter. I don't really go by that. I go by other things. I go by scripts. I go with what I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> can do with a character and if I feel a kinetic energy with someone and I feel we can uplift and challenge each other.|$|E

Evancho said in 2012: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> want to act full-time.
