5|$|Most of Hong Kong's {{buildings}} {{are concentrated in}} the northern shore of Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Towns (satellite towns) of the New Territories, such as Tsuen Wan or Sha Tin. Additional high-rises are located along Hong Kong Island's southern shoreline and areas near the stations of the Mass <b>Transit</b> <b>Railway</b> (MTR).|$|E
5|$|To resolve traffic {{congestion}} {{and to provide}} a more reliable means of crossing the Victoria Harbour, a rapid <b>transit</b> <b>railway</b> system (metro), the MTR, was planned from the 1970s onwards. The Island Line (Hong Kong Island), Kwun Tong Line (Kowloon Peninsula and East Kowloon) and Tsuen Wan Line (Kowloon and urban New Territories) opened in the early 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Previously, Hong Kong's Mass <b>Transit</b> <b>Railway</b> (MTR) {{adopted a}} system to {{recirculate}} magnetic plastic cards as fare tickets when it started operations in 1979. Another of the territory's railway networks, the Kowloon-Canton Railway (KCR), adopted the same magnetic cards in 1984, and the stored value version was renamed Common Stored Value Ticket. In 1989, the Common Stored Value Ticket system was extended to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) buses providing a feeder service to MTR and KCR stations and to Citybus, and was also extended to {{a limited number of}} non-transport applications, such as payments at photobooths and for fast food vouchers.|$|E
5|$|The {{special-purpose}} card, Airport Express Tourist Octopus, {{was introduced}} by Octopus Cards Limited to target tourists in Hong Kong. Two versions of this card are offered, a HK$220 card with a free single ride on the Airport Express, the Mass <b>Transit</b> <b>Railway</b> (MTR) train line that runs between the Hong Kong International Airport and the urban areas of Hong Kong, and a HK$300 card with two free single rides included. The airport journeys are valid for 180 days from the date of purchase. Both versions allow three days of unlimited rides on the MTR and include a HK$50 refundable deposit. Usable value on these cards may be added if necessary. These tourist Octopus cards may be used only by tourists staying in Hong Kong for 14 or fewer days; users {{may be required to}} produce a passport showing their arrival date in Hong Kong. Airport Express Tourist Octopus is available for purchase at all MTR stations.|$|E
25|$|Mass <b>Transit</b> <b>Railway</b> (MTR) is {{the rapid}} <b>transit</b> <b>railway</b> system in Hong Kong. Originally opened in 1979, the system now {{includes}} 221km of rail with 155 stations, including 89 railway stations and 68 light rail stops. There are also several future projects of the MTR.|$|E
50|$|Leaky {{feeder system}} {{is also used}} for {{underground}} mobile communication in mass <b>transit</b> <b>railways.</b> In Hong Kong the leaky feeder aerial was incorporated in the specification of the capital project and installed during construction.

50|$|Today, in Germany, all rapid <b>transit</b> <b>railways,</b> most {{commuter}} trains, {{and many}} light rail vehicles operate as high-floor networks.

50|$|A {{rack railway}} (also {{rack-and-pinion}} railway, cog railway, or cogwheel railway) is a steep grade railway with a toothed rack rail, usually between the running rails. The trains are fitted {{with one or}} more cog wheels or pinions that mesh with this rack rail. This allows the trains to operate on steep grades above around 7 to 10%, which is the maximum for friction-based rail. Most rack railways are mountain railways, although a few are <b>transit</b> <b>railways</b> or tramways built to overcome a steep gradient in an urban environment.|$|R

5000|$|The term is {{most often}} applied to rail transport, where low headways are often needed to move {{large numbers of people}} in mass <b>transit</b> <b>railways</b> [...] A lower headway {{requires}} more infrastructure, making lower headways expensive to achieve.

Newer signalling systems and moving block controls have significantly reduced headways in modern systems compared to the same lines only a few years ago. In principle, automated personal rapid transit systems and automobile platoons could reduce headways to as little as fractions of a second.|$|R
