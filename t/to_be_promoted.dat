5|$|A report {{commissioned}} by the Ministry of Defence in 1995 {{made a number of}} recommendations for financial savings in the armed forces' budget, one of which was the abolition of the five-star ranks. Part of the rationale was that these ranks were disproportionate {{to the size of the}} forces commanded by these officers and that none of the United Kingdom's close allies, such as the United States (which reserves the rank of general of the army for officers who have commanded large armies in major wars), used such ranks. The recommendation was not taken up in full, but the practice of promoting service chiefs to five-star ranks was stopped and the ranks are now reserved for special circumstances. Sir Peter Inge was, in 1994, the last active officer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to the rank. Inge relinquished the post of Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) in 1997 and his successor, Sir Charles Guthrie, was the first officer not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> upon appointment as CDS.|$|E
5|$|Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw, MC (3 April 1914– 27 June 2008), {{popularly known}} as Sam Bahadur ("Sam the Brave"), was the Chief of the Army Staff of the Indian Army during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, and was {{subsequently}} the first Indian Army officer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> {{to the rank of}} field marshal. His distinguished military career spanned four decades and five wars, beginning with service in the British Indian Army in World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Chauvel was {{appointed}} Inspector General, the Army's most senior post. He {{was forced to}} maintain an increasingly hollow structure by politicians intent on cutting expenditure. He was concurrently Chief of the General Staff from 1923 {{until his retirement in}} 1930. In November 1929, he became the first Australian <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to the rank of general. During the Second World War, he was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the Volunteer Defence Corps.|$|E

Aviles, who served in the United States Navy as Chief Gunner's Mate in World War I, spent most of the war at St. Augustine, Florida training recruits.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. It was felt that, as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period of six months. On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was the first Indian army officer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to the rank.|$|E
5|$|In Blamey's {{subsequent}} shake-up {{of higher}} command arrangements, Rowell {{was appointed to}} command I Corps. This was his first command since his three-day stint in command of a light horse squadron at Gallipoli. He became the first Duntroon graduate to command a corps, and the first <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> {{to the rank of}} lieutenant general. The old I Corps headquarters was largely absorbed into Lavarack's new First Army headquarters, so a new one was formed from Headquarters, Southern Command. Initially located in Melbourne, it soon moved to Esk, Queensland.|$|E

5|$|Regenbald first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1050, when he witnesses a charter of King Edward. King Edward gave him large estates {{as a reward for}} his service to the king as a royal chaplain. The Domesday Book records him owning at least seven churches, but only two of them have any indication that he performed any ecclesiastical services personally. Another royal reward was the grant to Regenbald of the status, without the actual office, of a bishop. He probably was unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to a bishopric, either because he was married or because his style of life was known to be unchaste.|$|E
5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} to the eighth rank, {{as a part}} of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen; this is called underpromotion. In the animated diagram, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece. There is no restriction placed on the piece that is chosen on promotion, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game (for example, two queens).|$|E
5|$|After {{one season}} in the Third Division South and {{eighteen}} in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, Palace's stay in the division was to {{last as long as}} the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> from, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Division Three South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth. Palace finished runners-up no less than three times, and when the 1939–40 season ended, Palace were sitting fourth. Unfortunately the season was only four matches old, cancelled with the onset of the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|After the Coast Guard Act 1978 {{came into}} force on 19 August 1978, the first Director General was {{appointed}} {{on the same}} day. Vice Admiral V. A. Kamath, deputed from the Indian Navy, served as the first DG ICG. Appointed on 19 August 1978, {{he served in the}} capacity until 31 March 1980. Traditionally, appointees to the DG position have come from the Indian Navy, although the current office holder, Rajendra Singh, is a direct entry Coast Guard officer. While several previous Directors General have come from the Coast Guard stream – such as Rameshwar Singh and P. Paleri – they have all initially been commissioned into the Indian Navy before later being permanently deputed to the Coast Guard service. As such, Singh has the distinction of being the first regular direct entry officer of the Indian Coast Guard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> to the position of ADG and to achieve three-star rank, doing so on 11 January 2013. He was later appointed as the DG, taking over this position in early 2016. Singh succeeded Vice Admiral H. C. S. Bisht on 1 March 2016. Besides the distinction of being the first three-star rank officer of the Indian Coast Guard, Rajendra Singh is the first Coast Guard officer to become the Director General.|$|E
5|$|From 1979, keg Stones began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> heavily nationwide, and {{the beer}} was {{introduced}} to the South of England for the first time. The beer was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the beer would be produced at the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for the Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s, it was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this was quickly halted after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the beer.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, he {{returned}} to Ramsbottom as their professional for a second season, with more effect. He took 83 wickets at 9.19 and scored 519 runs at 37.07 in 20 matches. He scored five fifties including a best of 66, and took eight five-wicket innings hauls including a best of 9/47 against Church as well as 7/27 against Lowerhouse. These performances earned him notice, and in late 2005, he appeared as a late-season overseas player substitute for Lancashire, {{and became the first}} overseas Lancashire player to take ten wickets on their debut, with 10/168 against Essex. This 5/93 and 5/75 helped Lancashire to an eight-wicket win, and in his only other first-class match, he took 4/43 and 2/49 was not enough as the Roses went down to Leicestershire by four runs. His sixteen wickets at 16.25 placed him second on the season's bowling averages, and helped the team <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>promoted</b> from Second Division. In two one-day games, Kartik took five wickets at 13.40.|$|E
