5|$|With both Stephen and Robert held prisoner, {{negotiations}} {{were held to}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to agreement on a long-term peace settlement, but Queen Matilda was unwilling to offer any compromise to the Empress, and Robert refused to accept any offer to encourage him to change sides to Stephen. Instead, in November the two sides simply exchanged the two leaders, Stephen returning to his queen, and Robert to the Empress in Oxford. Henry held another church council, which reversed its previous decision and reaffirmed Stephen's legitimacy to rule, and a fresh coronation of Stephen and Matilda occurred at Christmas 1141. Stephen travelled north to raise new forces and to successfully persuade Ranulf of Chester to change sides once again. Stephen then spent the summer attacking {{some of the new}} Angevin castles built the previous year, including Cirencester, Bampton and Wareham.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E

25|$|Significant changes {{occurred}} {{in the construction of}} the violin in the 18th century, particularly in the length and angle of the neck, as well as a heavier bass bar. The majority of old instruments have undergone these modifications, and hence are in a significantly different state than when they left the hands of their makers, doubtless with differences in sound and response. But these instruments in their present condition set the standard for perfection in violin craftsmanship and sound, and violin makers all over the world <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> as close to this ideal as possible.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, Noelle Fair and Lisa LaGrande {{adapted the}} play into Interpreting her Martyr'd Signs, {{the title of}} which is taken from Titus' claim {{to be able to}} {{understand}} the mute Lavinia. Focusing on the backstories of Tamora and Lavinia, the play is set in Purgatory shortly after their deaths, where they find themselves in a waiting area with Aaron as their salvation or damnation is decided upon. As they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to terms with their unresolved conflict, Aaron serves as a master of ceremonies, initiating a dialogue between them, leading to a series of flashbacks to their lives prior {{to the beginning of the}} play.|$|E
25|$|During {{early summer}} 2002, Rosa {{suddenly}} laid down work. As an artist {{he could not}} live under the conditions Egmont was offering him, {{but he did not}} want to give up making Scrooge McDuck comics either. So, his only choice was to go on hiatus and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to an agreement with Egmont. His main issues were that he had no control over his works. Rosa had discovered too often that his stories were printed with incorrect pages of art, improper colors, poor lettering, or pixelated computer conversions of the illustrations. Another matter was that his name was used in promotion of books and collections of stories without his agreement and without sending royalties to him. Rosa has never, as with any other Disney artist, received royalties for a single use of any of his stories worldwide.|$|E

25|$|That night, {{the family}} stays {{at a hotel}} where they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> {{up with a plan}} and Jules shows Sandspur to his girlfriend, Cindy. Based on the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, Nick thinks about the {{possibility}} of asking the merfolk to lure the giants to the sea, since they seem to be hypnotized by a nixie's singing. The kids sneak out to the beach, where they find that the mermaids hate land-dwellers and kidnap Jules, promising to let him go and sing the giants to the sea if the kids bring them a fish that has never been in their sea. They steal a tropical fish from Cindy's father's aquarium and race back to the beach. The mermaids are amazed that they completed the task and return Jules. Keeping their promise but intending to trick the humans, the mermaids sing for only a little while and to no effect before disappearing. However, Nick manages to tape their song in a tape recorder, which they intend to use to lure the giants themselves.|$|E

500|$|BioShock 2 was {{announced}} in 2008, with its development being led by 2K Marin.

BioShock 3 was also announced, with its release assumed to likely coincide with the BioShock film. BioShock 2 takes place about ten years following the events of the first game. The player assumes the role of Subject Delta, a precursor of the Big Daddies who must search the fallen city of Rapture for his former Little Sister, Eleanor. BioShock 2 was released for Windows PC, Mac, Xbox 360, and the PlayStation 3 worldwide on February 9, 2010.|$|E

The name had popped into his head after listening to Harry Nilsson's album Aerial Ballet, which featured jacket art of a circus performer jumping out of a biplane. Initially, Kramer's bandmates were unimpressed; they all thought {{he was referring to the}} Sinclair Lewis novel they were required to read in high school English class. [...] "No, not Arrowsmith," [...] Kramer explained. [...] "A-E-R-O...Aerosmith."

500|$|Arthur's costume was {{the easiest}} to create, as the color scheme {{mirrored}} his comic book counterpart, and was constructed to give a [...] "wetsuit look". The costume was also designed to be more form-fitting, to complement Ritchson's physique. Victor and Arthur's tops were also hoodie variations. When designing Dinah Lance's Black Canary costume, {{certain aspects of the}} comic book character were kept, while others changed entirely. For instance, the character retains her classic fishnet stockings, but the external, black mask the character wears is swapped for a painted mask. Cranstoun researched the various versions of Black Canary's costume, looking through the 1940s and 50s, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with the right version for the show. Cranstoun explained that she primarily came across two versions. One version reminded the designer of a Playboy Bunny, with a [...] "curvy, corseted, strapless thing that was not at all action-friendly". The other was more reminiscent of Lara Croft and Tank Girl, which is the route Cranstoun took. What Cranstoun created was a [...] "zipped, sleeveless body suit with a boot that was really flat and practical". The designer also kept the yellow accents the comic version had, as well as the long gloves. The filming crew did test shots with various masks for the character, including a leather mask reminiscent of the comic book character's look, before going with the painted variation.|$|E

500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with a way to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "b-boys" [...] and [...] "b-girls" [...] {{were the}} dancers to Herc's breaks, who were {{described}} as [...] "breaking".

Herc coined the terms [...] "b-boy", [...] "b-girl," [...] and [...] "breaking" [...] which {{became part of the}} lexicon of what would be eventually called hip hop culture. Early Kool Herc b-boy and later DJ innovator Grandmixer DXT describes the early evolution as follows: [...] " ... verybody would form a circle and the B-boys would go into the center. At first the dance was simple: touch your toes, hop, kick out your leg. Then some guy went down, spun around on all fours. Everybody said wow and went home to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with something better."In the early 1980s, the media began to call this style [...] "breakdance," [...] which in 1991 the New York Times wrote was [...] "an art as demanding and inventive as mainstream dance forms like ballet and jazz." [...] Since this emerging culture was still without a name, participants often identified as [...] "b-boys," [...] a usage that included and went beyond the specific connection to dance, a usage that would persist in hip hop culture.|$|E
