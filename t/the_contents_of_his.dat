5|$|He {{continued}} {{writing and}} eventually put together his first play, Removing All Doubt, which {{he sent to}} his old Syracuse theatre teacher, Arthur Storch, who was impressed. In 1984, Removing All Doubt was staged for drama students at his alma mater, Syracuse University. After that, he wrote Hidden in This Picture which debuted off-off-Broadway at Steve Olsen's West Bank Cafe Downstairs Theatre Bar in New York City in 1988. <b>The</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first two plays got him a theatrical agent. Producer John A. McQuiggan saw the production of Hidden in This Picture and commissioned Sorkin to turn the one-act into a full-length play called Making Movies.|$|E
5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita {{to allow him to}} marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E
5|$|Bilbo Baggins, the titular protagonist, is a respectable, {{reserved}} hobbit. During his adventure, Bilbo often {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> larder {{at home and}} wishes he had more food. Until he finds a magic ring, he is more baggage than help. Gandalf, an itinerant wizard, introduces Bilbo to a company of thirteen dwarves. During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key moments in the story. Thorin Oakenshield, the proud, pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo {{to get him out}} of trouble, but he proves himself a mighty warrior. Smaug is a dragon who long ago pillaged the dwarvish kingdom of Thorin's grandfather and sleeps upon the vast treasure.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} Archer discovers Robinson packing up <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> locker. He concedes {{that it is}} {{primarily}} an intermix problem, but that the engine could still work. Archer and Robinson then steal the NX Beta, with Tucker in flight control, but it starts to suffer the same issues as the Alpha. As Starfleet security detains Tucker, Archer and Robinson manage to coax the engines towards their goal of warp 2.5. Afterwards, Archer and Robinson are reprimanded by Starfleet, and the Vulcans ground the program for a year, but they eventually confirm that his father's design was sound. Back in the future, Archer launches the charges into the cloud, and T'Pol suggests that it be named after Archer's close friend, Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{gave his}} {{mistress}} vast {{sums of money}} by investing large sums in her name or confiding in trustees for her benefit. He also arranged for his two sons to be well provided for after his death. Under Belgian law, his three remaining legitimate children were entitled to a considerable portion of his estate, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> will. However, this applied only in Belgium and not abroad; consequently, much of the wealth he distributed for safekeeping was in foreign investments or {{in the shape of}} paintings, bric-a-brac, and art treasures that could be easily converted into cash. Leopold transferred Caroline a fortune in Congo securities, which were added to the already vast sum of six million francs he had previously presented her. Princess Louise soon went after these securities, but with the help of men loyal to the king, Caroline was able to safely spirit away the majority of her wealth to Paris; two of her estates (in Brussels and in France) were boarded up however, disallowing her from entering them.|$|E

25|$|Ingres died of {{pneumonia}} on 14 January 1867, {{at the age}} of eighty-six, in his apartment on the Quai Voltaire in Paris.

Lamarck was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse cemetery for just five years, according to the grant obtained from relatives. Later the body was dug up along with other remains and was lost. Lamarck's books and <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home were sold at auction, and his body was buried in a temporary lime-pit.|$|E

25|$|A further investigation, in 2014, {{revealed}} {{that it was}} unlikely he {{had been killed in}} a chariot accident. Scans found that all but one of his bone fractures, including those to his skull, had been inflicted after his death. The scans also showed that he had a partially clubbed foot and would have been unable to stand unaided, thus making it unlikely he ever rode in a chariot; this was supported by the presence of many walking sticks among <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tomb. Instead, it is believed that genetic defects arising from his parents being siblings, complications from a broken leg and his suffering from malaria, together caused his death.|$|E

Marić returned to Switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. Einstein probably never saw his daughter. <b>The</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> letter to Marić in September 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.|$|E
500|$|Bonvisio {{disclosed}} <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{discussions with}} the king to a French agent and confessed his being employed by Aldiosi under threat of torture; by this point Adiosi was no longer protector. According to an 6 April 1510 letter from the Venetian ambassador, the king dismissed Adiosi as protector and gave the post to Sisto della Rovere. There is no direct evidence that Sisto ever received the official title before he died in March 1517. Until the death of Julius II, Bainbridge [...] "filled the vacuum, real or in effect, in the protectorship of England".|$|E

In May, the commission issued a notification that it had decided to grant approval to the Mgr.

White tells Russell that Case will pay him a substantial sum if he destroys the contents of the box.|$|E
500|$|Chapter one, [...] "The Tollund Man", {{is devoted}} to the bog body of the same name that was {{discovered}} in 1950 in Tollund Fell, Bjaeldskov Dal in Jutland, Denmark. Glob discusses the excavation of the corpse, and his own personal involvement with the operation. Outlining the find's removal to the National Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen, he then outlines {{the manner in which the}} head was conserved for public display at the Silkeborg Museum. Alongside this he also discusses the archaeological context of Tollund Man, examining the manner in which he was executed, his clothing, and <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> last meal. The second chapter, entitled [...] "The Grauballe Man", deals with the eponymous bog body found in 1952 at Nebelgård Fen, located [...] east of Tolland. Like with the previous chapter, Glob discusses his own personal investigation into the body, outlining its discovery and conservation, as well as the context of his death and burial.|$|E
500|$|Etty {{had planned}} for a burial in York Minster, but {{neglected}} {{to cover the}} necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos {{in the wake of}} the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6May 1850 <b>the</b> <b>contents</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 [...] "It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds".|$|E
