40|$|Prdm 9 (Meisetz) is {{the first}} {{speciation}} gene discovered in vertebrates conferring reproductive isolation. This locus encodes a meiosis-specific histone H 3 methyltransferase that specifies meiotic recombination hotspots during gametogenesis. Allelic differences in Prdm 9, characterized for a variable number of zinc finger (ZF) domains, {{have been associated with}} hybrid sterility in male house mice via spermatogenic failure at the pachytene stage. The mule, a classic example of hybrid sterility in mammals also exhibits a similar spermatogenesis breakdown, making Prdm 9 an interesting candidate to evaluate in equine hybrids. In this study, we characterized the Prdm 9 gene in all species of equids by analyzing sequence variation of the ZF domains and estimating positive selection. We also evaluated the role of Prdm 9 in hybrid sterility by assessing allelic differences of ZF domains in equine hybrids. We found remarkable variation in the sequence and number of ZF domains among equid species, ranging from five domains in the <b>Tibetan</b> <b>kiang</b> and Asiatic wild ass, to 14 in the Grevy’s zebra. Positive selection was detected in all species at amino acid sites known to be associated with DNA-binding specificity of ZF domains in mice and humans. Equine hybrids, in particular a quartet pedigree composed of a fertile mule showed a mosaic of sequences and number of ZF domains suggesting that Prdm 9 variation does not seem by itself to contribute to equine hybrid sterility...|$|E

40|$|In 1993 the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China {{established}} the 300 000 km 2 Chang Tang Nature Preserve on the northwestern Tibetan plateau, an action precipitated by rapidly diminishing populations of chiru (Tibetan antelope) and wild yak. Some 30 000 nomadic pastoralists use areas within this reserve for livestock grazing, with many having traditionally depended {{in part on}} hunting for supplementary subsistence and trade. Following a 1997 request from TAR leaders for international assistance in addressing the conservation issues associated {{with the creation of}} this reserve, the TAR Forestry Bureau and the Network for University Co-operation Tibet – Norway began a 3 -year research collaboration program in 2000 to outline human-wildlife interactions and conservation priorities {{in the western part of}} the reserve. To date, four excursions (2 - 6 weeks each) have been made to the western Chang Tang region, and investigations of interactions between pastoralists and wildlife conservation objectives have been initiated in an area of about 5000 km 2, including the 2300 km 2 Aru basin located at 5000 m elevation at the northern edge of pastoralist inhabitation. The Aru site is unique in that nomads have only recently returned to this previously off-limits basin. But, as in surrounding areas, the people’s lives are undergoing changes recently influenced by the introduction of permanent winter houses, changing international trade in shahtoosh and cashmere wool, and a move towards stricter hunting regulations. The northwestern Chang Tang, with the Aru basin as a prime site, represents one of the last strongholds of the endangered chiru and wild yak, as well as home to <b>Tibetan</b> gazelle, <b>kiang,</b> <b>Tibetan</b> argali, blue sheep, wolf, snow leopard and brown bear. In autumn 2000, for example, with approximately 12 000 of the wild ungulates (mostly the migratory chiru) within the Aru basin along with some 8000 domestic livestock, issues of land use overlap and possible grazing competition are clear to both local nomads and reserve managers. Whereas livestock development actions elsewhere on the Tibetan plateau are promoting increased livestock production, they are doing so at the expense of wildlife, and such an approach will not be appropriate in areas where wildlife conservation is a major priority. Although some of the ongoing livestock development programs may be adapted to the western TAR, new approaches to pastoral development will have to be developed in the reserve. The ultimate goal of enhancing the nomads’ standard of living, while conserving this truly unique array of biodiversity, presents a daunting challenge...|$|R
5000|$|Mammals {{are also}} known to reside at high {{altitude}} and exhibit a striking number of adaptations {{in terms of}} morphology, physiology and behaviour. The Tibetan Plateau has very few mammalian species, ranging from wolf, <b>kiang</b> (<b>Tibetan</b> wild ass), goas, chiru (Tibetan antelope), wild yak, snow leopard, Tibetan sand fox, ibex, gazelle, Himalayan brown bear and water buffalo. [...] These mammals can be broadly categorised based on their adaptability in high altitude into two broad groups, namely eurybarc and stenobarc. Those that can survive {{a wide range of}} high-altitude regions are eurybarc and include yak, ibex, Tibetan gazelle of the Himalayas and vicuñas llamas of the Andes. Stenobarc includes those with lesser ability to endure a range of differences in altitude, such as rabbits, mountain goats, sheep, and cats. Among domesticated animals, yaks are perhaps the highest dwelling animals. The wild herbivores of the Himalayas such as the Himalayan tahr, morkhor and chamois are of particularly interesting because of their ecological versatility and tolerance.|$|R

40|$|Top {{carnivores}} play {{an important}} role in maintaining energy flow and functioning of the ecosystem, and a clear understanding of their diets and foraging strategies is essential for developing effective conservation strategies. In this paper, we compared diets and prey selection of snow leopards and wolves based on analyses of genotyped scats (snow leopards n = 182, wolves n = 57), collected within 26 sampling grid cells (5 × 5 km) that were distributed across a vast landscape of ca 5000 km 2 in the Central Himalayas, Nepal. Within the grid cells, we sampled prey abundances using the double observer method. We found that interspecific differences in diet composition and prey selection reflected their respective habitat preferences, i. e. snow leopards significantly preferred cliff-dwelling wild ungulates (mainly bharal, 57 % of identified material in scat samples), whereas wolves preferred typically plain-dwellers (<b>Tibetan</b> gazelle, <b>kiang</b> and argali, 31 %). Livestock was consumed less frequently than their proportional availability by both predators (snow leopard = 27 %; wolf = 24 %), but significant avoidance was only detected among snow leopards. Among livestock species, snow leopards significantly preferred horses and goats, avoided yaks, and used sheep as available. We identified factors influencing diet composition using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Wolves showed seasonal differences in the occurrence of small mammals/birds, probably due to the winter hibernation of an important prey, marmots. For snow leopard, occurrence of both wild ungulates and livestock in scats depended on sex and latitude. Wild ungulates occurrence increased while livestock decreased from south to north, probably due to a latitudinal gradient in prey availability. Livestock occurred more frequently in scats from male snow leopards (males: 47 %, females: 21 %), and wild ungulates more frequently in scats from females (males: 48 %, females: 70 %). The sexual difference agrees with previous telemetry studies on snow leopards and other large carnivores, and may reflect a high-risk high-gain strategy among males...|$|R
