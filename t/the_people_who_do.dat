Tilcox is able to return to the ice roads after being treated for his injuries. The expense of his treatment is highlighted on the show as a cause of concern for Tilcox. Despite his ordeals, Tilcox gains respect for the job and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> it, as well as self-satisfaction for having completed the entire season — a rare feat for a rookie (as mentioned in the finale). He leaves with the respect and admiration of his fellow ice road veterans.|$|E

He persuaded German military administration chief Harald Turner that the captured men were not Freemasons {{and told him that}} they were not to be shot as hostages. According to his personal secretary, Ljotić also asked Turner to not order the killing of Jews, stating [...] " [...] against Jews ruling my country's economy, but I am against their murder." [...] He added that [...] "their innocently-spilled blood cannot bring any good to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> this." [...] Turner was reportedly surprised by Ljotić's statements, given his history of antisemitism.|$|E

As The Guardian noted when discussing her awards for The Ghost Road, the series gave her the reputation as [...] "The woman who understood war". Barker stated in an interview with Wera Reusch that [...] "The trilogy is trying to tell something about the parts of war that don't get into the official accounts". She goes on to state that [...] "One of the things that impresses me is that two things happen to soldiers in war: a) they get killed or b) they come back more or less alright.

2500|$|After {{passing the}} bar exam, Wilson began his {{practice}} as a criminal defense attorney in San Diego, but he found such work to be low-paying and personally repugnant. He later commented to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I realized I couldn't be a criminal defense lawyer – because most of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> come to you are guilty." [...] Wilson switched to a more conventional law practice and continued his activity in local politics, working for Barry Goldwater's unsuccessful Presidential campaign in 1964. Wilson's liking for politics and managing the day-to-day details {{of the political process}} was growing. He put in long hours for the Goldwater campaign, earning the friendship of local Republican boosters so necessary for a political career, and in 1966, at the age of thirty-three, he ran for, and won a seat in the California State Assembly, succeeding Clair Burgener.|$|E
2500|$|Penn and Teller {{often have}} skits and stunts {{performed}} {{with them on}} set or use stock footage to combine reasonable arguments with straightforward, entertaining ridicule. For example, the [...] "Sex, Sex, Sex" [...] episode may be satirizing the media's obsession with sex appeal by having the hosts constantly surrounded by naked actors and actresses. Penn and Teller often close episodes with an impassioned ethical plea against whatever they are debunking, summarizing how this particular belief is harmful and should be resisted. The presenters distinguish between believers (often explaining that Penn and Teller themselves {{would like to believe}} these things are true, and showing compassion to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> think the things are true) and those they see as charlatans out for money or to advance a political agenda, at whom their anger is directed. For example, in their premiere episode, they debunk the idea that psychics can talk to the dead. While expressing the utmost sympathy towards people who are desperate for a chance to speak to a loved one who has died, they explain that charlatans take advantage of this love to get money from people, and deliver false messages {{that have nothing to do}} with the genuine character of the departed.|$|E
2500|$|Fame blows her [...] "posterior trumpet," [...] {{and all the}} dunces of {{the land}} come to Dulness's throne. There are three classes of dunce. First, there are the {{naturally}} dull. These are drawn to her as bees are to a queen bee, and they [...] "adhere" [...] to her person. The second are <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> {{not wish to be}} dunces but are, [...] "Whate'er of mungril no one class admits,/ A wit with dunces, and a dunce with wits" [...] (B IV 89–90). These dunces orbit Dulness. They struggle to break free, and they get some distance from her, but they are too weak to flee. The third class are [...] "false to Phoebus, bow to Baal;/ Or impious, preach his Word without a call" [...] (B IV 93–4). They are men and women who do dull things by supporting dunces, either by giving money to hacks or by suppressing the cause of worthy writers. These people come to Dulness as a comet does: [...] although they are only occasionally near her, they habitually do her bidding. [...] Of this last group, Pope classes Sir Thomas Hanmer, a [...] "decent knight," [...] who absurdly thinks himself a great Shakespeare editor and uses his own money to publish an exceptionally lavish and ornate edition (with a text that was based on Pope's own edition). He is outshone in darkness by one Benson, who is even more absurd, in that he begins putting up monuments of John Milton, striking coins and medals of Milton, and translating Milton's Latin poetry and who had then passed from excessive Milton fanaticism to fanaticism for Arthur Johnston, a Scottish physician and Latin poet. Unable to be the most fantastically vain man, Hamner prepares to withdraw his edition, but [...] "Apollo's May'r and Aldermen" [...] (B IV 116) take the page from him. (This was a reference to Oxford University Press, with which Pope had a quarrel based on their denying Bishop Warburton a doctorate in 1741). Dulness tells her followers to imitate Benson and tack their own names to statues and editions of famous authors, to treat standard authors as trophies (the busts made of them like hunting trophies), and thus [...] "So by each Bard an Alderman shall sit" [...] (B IV 131).|$|E
40|$|It is {{believed}} that so-called 'health boom' began around {{the middle of the}} 70 's in Japan. It is also believed that this boom has lasted until now. Medical sociology has asserted that this boom was reflected in people's increased concern about their own health and prosperity of so-called 'health industry', It is also argued that the primary factor contributing to the boom was increase in healthism. The above discussion supposes increase in healthmaintaining and -promoting behavior among <b>the</b> Japanese <b>people</b> in <b>the</b> period. The {{purpose of this article is}} to test this hypothesis through secondary analysis of 'Hoken'eiseikisochosa' and 'Kokuminseikatsu-kisochosa' by the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. These surveys have continually or periodically asked if the respondents were doing anything for their own health. and if so, what kind of items they were doing. It is discovered that the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> sports or exercise for health increased in the late 70 's, and that the rates of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> what public health and state persuaded them to do for prevention of chronic illness also increased during this period. However, the rates of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> other items that were believed to be good for maintenance and promotion of health have decreased. The ratio of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> something for health decreased, too. These rates were stable in the late 80 's and thereafter. These findings require not simply modification of the above-mentioned hypothesis, but also reformulation of the whole discussion on the 'health boom' and healthism in medical sociology...|$|R

We observed that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the subject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr. Jarndyce and prevented his going any farther, when he had remarked that there were two classes of charitable people; one, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> a little and made a great deal of noise; <b>the</b> other, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> a great deal and made no noise at all.
