Starting in {{the pole}} position, {{he led the}} first 29 laps of the race before being passed by {{eventual}} winner Erik Darnell and finishing second. After the race, he called the transition to stock cars a [...] "challenge": [...] "I'm a student at this, still trying {{to learn as much}} as I can. A lot of people have asked me what the toughest transition is, coming over here from the IndyCars and doing these stock car races, and really it's <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> don't get much practice time." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2009, {{the track}} was {{released}} as the album's buzz single, {{not intended to}} be the first release of Raymond v. Raymond, but to generate reception and feedback. In March 2010, Usher continued to support Garrett's original claims, stating the song was recorded before his marriage ended. Usher said in an interview for MTV News for promoting Raymond v. Raymond: [...] "I think people would have immediately alluded to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> was talking about my wife when I made that record — and now my ex-wife," [...] he said. [...] "When the song was recorded, I wasn't divorced. It was some reality in the contrast of trying to make it all work, having to balance a career and having a normal life. Coming in at 6 in the morning and arguing was a reality when you have those type of relationships. I felt that in a way, the story did touch on certain things at the time. I didn't know how realistic it would become. I didn't know I would become divorced. I did know it spoke on the contrast between trying to balance this world of being married and having this responsibility that's like a marriage at the same time. The song spoke to that place. Unfortunately, it did become a reality." ...|$|E
500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself and that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The {{best thing to do is}} just to ignore <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> <b>I</b> think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E

I admit that I did not grasp {{the reason for this}} choice. During an interview a musicologist asked me about it, and I answered that the book had just come out and the composer had probably used it because it was at hand. Now, a few months ago Berio, whom I don't know, sent me a very disgruntled letter. He had read the interview, several years after the fact, and assured me that the movement of this symphony offered the musical counterpart of the mythical transformation I was revealing. He included a book by a musicologist [...] who had demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b> <b>I</b> apologized for the misunderstanding, which was, I said, the result of my lack of musical training, but I'm still baffled.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2014, August was videotaped {{beating a}} man, and he posted the video on his {{personal}} Instagram account. Although he deleted the video from his profile, the video was later posted to YouTube, and shared by thousands. In the video, a shirtless August walks over {{to a man who}} is kneeling over a bicycle and ruthlessly punches him multiple times ending with a kick to the face. Sources close to him, such as friends, say that the man had money that was to be owed to August, and there was no specific amount of debt mentioned. After the incident had spread, he went to his Twitter account to shed light on the situation, explaining: [...] "I'm just a lil one out here on my own, no mom because she stay taking from me & no father because he wasn't around until all this happened. You guys would only know half of my story, only what's on screen & definitely not behind scenes.

2500|$|Trueman's Test career {{ended in}} 1965 {{after he had}} played {{in the first two}} of a three-match series against New Zealand. He bowed out with a then world record of 307 Test wickets at an average of 21.54. Although he was the first bowler to take 300 Test wickets, he had {{undergone}} numerous clashes and problems with the England cricketing hierarchy. He was not involved in the tours of Australia (1954–55); South Africa (1956–57) and (1964–65); India and Pakistan (1961–62); or India (1963–64). From the beginning {{to the end of his}} international career, England played 118 Tests and he missed 51 of them. He recalled in his memoirs: [...] "Irrespective of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>I</b> was at the top of my game for Yorkshire and frequently topped the county bowling averages, I was often overlooked for England. To my mind the reason for this was personal. Quite simply, some of the selection committee did not like my forthright attitude, which they misinterpreted as being [...] "bolshy". Rather than pick the best eleven players for the job, the selection committee would often choose someone because he was, in their eyes, a gentleman and a decent chap. Such attributes often took precedence over someone's ability to play international cricket". He also wrote: [...] "For this reason I was selected for far fewer Tests than I believe I should have been. To my mind, if I'd had the opportunity to play in those Tests, I'm sure I would have topped 400 wickets. But that was not to be, even though I was regularly taking 100-plus wickets a season for Yorkshire".|$|E
