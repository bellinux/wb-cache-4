25|$|The Islamic {{practice}} of Dhikr had involved {{the repetition of}} the 99 Names of God since the 8th or 9th century. By the 12th century, the {{practice of}} Sufism included specific meditative techniques, and its followers practiced breathing controls and the repetition of holy words. Interactions with Indians, Nepalese or the Sufis may have influenced the Eastern Christian meditation approach to hesychasm, but <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> proved. Between the 10th and 14th centuries, hesychasm was developed, particularly on Mount Athos in Greece, and involves the repetition of the Jesus prayer.|$|E
25|$|Mycorrhizas {{from the}} Miocene exhibit a {{vesicular}} morphology closely resembling that of present Glomerales.

However, {{it can be argued}} that the efficacy of signaling processes is likely to have evolved since the Miocene, and <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> detected in the fossil record. A finetuning of the signaling processes would improve coordination and nutrient exchange between symbionts while increasing the fitness of both the fungi and the plant symbionts.|$|E

25|$|Pliny (Naturalis Historia II.X) {{tells us}} that Hipparchus {{demonstrated}} that lunar eclipses can occur five months apart, and solar eclipses seven months (instead of the usual six months); and the Sun can be hidden twice in thirty days, but as seen by different nations. Ptolemy discussed this a century later at length in Almagest VI.6. The geometry, {{and the limits of}} the positions of Sun and Moon when a solar or lunar eclipse is possible, are explained in Almagest VI.5. Hipparchus apparently made similar calculations. The result that two solar eclipses can occur one month apart is important, because <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> based on observations: one is visible on the northern and the other on the southern hemisphere – as Pliny indicates – and the latter was inaccessible to the Greek.|$|E
