40|$|One’s {{choice between}} public and {{personal}} transport for the daily commute depends on various factors including convenience, comfort, monetary cost and <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> Abstracting convenience, comfort and monetary cost in a single fixed cost, {{we focus on the}} tradeoff between <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> and this cost, assuming fixed <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> for public transport. Such a tradeoff obviously depends on the decisions of other commuters, as <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> for personal transport depend on traffic density. This dependency is very well captured by the so-called fundamental diagram of traffic flow. The diagram relates traffic flux (and therefore also the <b>travel</b> <b>times)</b> to traffic density, an increased density leading to increased <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> We propose a simple Markovian queueing model to study congestion at a macroscopic scale. Noting that <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> are hardly influenced by the presence of traffic when there is limited traffic, and that <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> are dominated by the limited capacity of the road when there is congestion, we adopt a Markovian level-dependent queueing system, service rates being sub-linear in terms of the queue content. For this queueing system we first study the stationary waiting times assuming fixed arrival rates. As the arrival rate is typically not stationary during rush hour, we then study the transient waiting times in the fluid limit. Our fluid approximation is motivated by the large amounts of road users during rush hour. Based on the fluid approximation, we determine the fraction of road users choosing for public transport at any time by game theoretic arguments. Finally, we discuss several extensions of the macroscopic model. First, the implicit assumption of exponential <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> is relaxed to phase-type distributed <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> Secondly, we introduce a notion of local traffic density, say at the level of a neighbourhood. We then obtain a traffic model at a mesoscopic scale: the <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> no longer depend on the global density (or queue content) but on the local density...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{validate}} {{the performance of}} three P-velocity models built with differ-ent approaches on regional travel-time prediction for the Tethyan margin {{in order to test}} how well they predict independently observed <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> The three models are constructed with travel-time tomography, a compilation of a priori geologic and geo-physical information, and empirical scaling with adjustment from P-arrival inversion, respectively. We compared the synthetics with reference <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> (ground truth data) obtained by using events or explosions located within 25 km with 95 % confi-dence. We found variance of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> is not an adequate tool to assess the per-formance of velocity models, because predicted <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> that have small variance can have very different mean value from that of observed ones. Therefore, we propose an alternative way, variance estimation with mean of observed <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> (zero mean). This technique is more efficient to assess the mismatch between synthetics and observed <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> Among the three models we investigated, the EAPV 11 model built mainly with the empirical scaling shows better performance on the travel-time prediction. This result is intriguing, because this model inherits crustal velocity struc-ture, Moho depth, Pn velocities, and upper-mantle structure that affects <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> at regional distance, mostly from a scaled 3 D S-velocity model for the same region. This fact may imply that although errors may be included in this scaling, this way would work better than conventional P-arrival inversion. This difference likely exists be-cause surface waves have a better lateral resolution for the crust and uppermost mantle than <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> Online Material: Histograms of travel-time residuals and correction surfaces of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> with respect to iasp 91 for 33 stations...|$|R

40|$|In time-distance helioseismology, {{information}} about the solar interior is encoded in measurements of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> between pairs of points on the solar surface. <b>Travel</b> <b>times</b> are deduced from the cross-covariance of the random wave field. Here we consider <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> and also products of <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> as observables. They contain {{information about}} e. g. the statistical properties of convection in the Sun. The basic assumption of the model is that noise {{is the result of}} the stochastic excitation of solar waves, a random process which is stationary and Gaussian. We generalize the existing noise model (Gizon and Birch 2004) by dropping the assumption of horizontal spatial homogeneity. Using a recurrence relation, we calculate the noise covariance matrices for the moments of order 4, 6, and 8 of the observed wave field, for the moments of order 2, 3 and 4 of the cross-covariance, and for the moments of order 2, 3 and 4 of the <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> All noise covariance matrices depend only on the expectation value of the cross-covariance of the observed wave field. For products of <b>travel</b> <b>times,</b> the noise covariance matrix consists of three terms proportional to 1 /T, 1 /T^ 2, and 1 /T^ 3, where T is the duration of the observations. For typical observation times of a few hours, the term proportional to 1 /T^ 2 dominates and Cov[τ_ 1 τ_ 2, τ_ 3 τ_ 4] ≈ Cov[τ_ 1, τ_ 3] Cov[τ_ 2, τ_ 4] + Cov[τ_ 1, τ_ 4] Cov[τ_ 2, τ_ 3], where the τ_i are arbitrary <b>travel</b> <b>times.</b> This result is confirmed for p_ 1 <b>travel</b> <b>times</b> by Monte Carlo simulations and comparisons with SDO/HMI observations.
