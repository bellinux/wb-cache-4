25|$|Square dancers {{dance to}} a variety of music, mostly Chinese popular songs, both {{contemporary}} and historic. The hobby began in the mid-1990s, as middle-aged women who had been forced into retirement began doing it to keep themselves occupied. Its popularity notwithstanding, square dancing {{has been the subject of}} considerable controversy in the 2010s China due to complaints of noise pollution in the evening or morning hours. Dancers in China's increasingly populous cities congregate in public areas because there are few dedicated facilities where they could go. Residents of nearby apartment complexes who have been disturbed by the high volume of multiple dance groups' musical accompaniment, especially late in the evening and early in the morning when they are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep,</b> have sometimes reacted violently.|$|E

25|$|Ant {{was brought}} to court at the Old Bailey. The charges against him, which {{included}} criminal damage and threatening members of the public, were reduced to a single count of causing affray, to which he pleaded guilty. He was fined £500 and ordered to psychiatric care with a suspended sentence. In June 2003, he was arrested again by police after a conflict with a neighbour resulted in him attempting to smash in the neighbour's patio door with a shovel, and then lying down on the concrete floor of a café basement with his trousers pulled down, curling up, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Once again {{he was charged with}} affray and criminal damage and spent time in psychiatric wards. In September of that year he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983, and spent a further six months receiving in-patient psychiatric care. He was eventually granted a conditional discharge by the judge at Highbury Magistrates Court.|$|E
25|$|As she {{approaches}} the castle, the Beast is watching her movements through {{the reflection of}} his drink. As she comes into the castle the Beast hurriedly removes himself. The woman sits {{in his chair and}} rests by the fire. The beast watches her from his hall of mirrors and contemplates approaching her but is ashamed of his appearance. She later is seen having a bath interspersed with the police officers finding the dead officer's body and preparing to raid the castle. She is later seen <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> while being seduced by 3 vampy women while the Beast sits in a chair (a reference to Dracula and the Brides). The Beast leaves the room and, seeing his reflection, begins to smash up the mirrors. The woman, hearing the noise, comes out and follows him into a presumable living room. The Beast observes her from above and levitates the chaise she is sitting on.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{makes her}} debut and only appearance in 2010's Heavy Rain, developed by French studio Quantic Dream. She is introduced in her apartment, {{being unable to}} sleep. After taking a shower and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> once more, she notices the apartment has been broken into. The two invaders then attack, though ultimately are revealed to be a nightmare caused by Madison's poor sleeping. Madison then goes to a motel {{to try to help}} her sleep, where she meets other protagonist Ethan Mars, who has been injured after attempting the Origami Killer's first trial in order to find his son (who has been abducted by the killer). Though she doesn't know the cause, she helps him to his room and treats his wounds. Later in the game, she tends to Ethan's wounds again after he tries to complete another trial. After this, Madison helps Ethan to avoid the police who now believe him to be the Origami Killer, though whether she is successful depends on the player's actions. After they return to the motel, or after Ethan arrives having escaped the police station after being freed by another of the protagonists, FBI agent Norman Jayden, she learns why Ethan is now on the run, and that he is completing trials to find letters of the address where his son is being held.|$|E

500|$|The tone of {{the songs}} shifts after the first verse, growing more defiant, and the second verse of the song criticizes the {{violence}} under apartheid, with Gabriel singing about <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> but being able to [...] "only dream in red" [...] because of his anger at the death of black people. The lyrics of the third verse seek to motivate the listener: [...] "You can blow out a candle/But you can't blow out a fire/Once the flames begin to catch/The wind will blow it higher", suggesting that though Biko is dead, the movement against apartheid would continue. The lyrics express a sense of outrage, {{not only at the}} suffering of people under apartheid, but at the fact that that suffering was often forgotten or denied.|$|E
500|$|... "La Couchette" [...] follows six {{characters}} on a sleeper carriage travelling from Paris to Bourg St. Maurice. Shearsmith {{said that the}} writers aimed to exploit the intimacy of the setting; the unusual situation which is created by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in what is potentially {{a room full of}} strangers. This was, for Shearsmith, an [...] "odd frisson" [...] to play with. Discussing the filming, Whitehall said that the set was [...] "definitely the most intimate location I have ever been on ... It's all on springs so it moves around like a train carriage – and I suffer from very bad motion sickness so on the first day I threw up. I had to literally run off the set half way through a scene and throw up in the loo. So it was quite an auspicious start." [...] Hesmondhalgh also commented on the intimacy of the filming, saying that it was the tightest location used for Inside No. 9 since [...] "Sardines", the first episode of the first series. Nonetheless, she had [...] "such a fun week" [...] filming the episode, noting that, despite the limited space on-set, it is [...] "amazing how quickly you become institutionalised". Similarly, Pemberton noted that the filming resulted in [...] "a tough week", but that it was [...] "really fun, because it's a very fun episode".|$|E
2500|$|RLS sensations {{range from}} pain or an aching in the muscles, to [...] "an itch you can't scratch", a [...] "buzzing sensation", an {{unpleasant}} [...] "tickle that won't stop", a [...] "crawling" [...] feeling, or limbs jerking while awake. The sensations typically begin or intensify during quiet wakefulness, {{such as when}} relaxing, reading, studying, or <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{keeping with}} the title, the song is about the {{subconscious}} fears from deep within the soul which manifest themselves when the singer is alone at night. Written mainly by Philip Adrian Wright, {{it is based on}} his experience in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> after reading a horror novel. [...] The low synthesiser tones are designed to be haunting, are slow at the beginning, deliberately dark and melancholy. The instrumental increases tempo to a frenzy of pitch blending as the song reaches its culmination. It is a track that still contains the obvious influences of the original Human League of Oakey, Ware, Marsh and Wright.|$|E
2500|$|Juror 9, seeing Juror 4 rub {{his nose}} (which is being irritated by his glasses), {{realizes that the}} woman who {{allegedly}} saw the murder had impressions in {{the sides of her}} nose, indicating that she wore glasses, but did not wear them in court out of vanity. Other jurors, including Juror 4, confirm that they saw the same thing. Juror 8 adds that she would not have been wearing them while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> and points out that on her own evidence, the attack happened so swiftly that she wouldn't have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10, and 4 change their vote to [...] "not guilty", leaving only Juror 3. Juror 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks that his relationship with his own son is deeply strained, which is ultimately why he wants the boy to be guilty. He finally loses his temper and tears up a photo of him and his son, but then breaks down crying and changes his vote to [...] "not guilty", making the vote unanimous. The jurors then leave the room to reveal their verdict to the court.|$|E
2500|$|On May 25, 1848, Kane left Fort Edmonton, {{travelling}} {{with a large}} {{party of}} 23 boats and 130 people bound for York Factory, led by John Edward Harriott. [...] On June 1 they met with a large war party of some 1,500 warriors of Blackfoot and other tribes who were planning a raid against the Cree and Assiniboine. On that occasion Kane met the Blackfoot chief Big Snake (Omoxesisixany). The canoe brigade stayed as briefly as possible and then continued hastily down the river. On June 18 they arrived at Norway House, where Kane stayed for a month, waiting for {{the annual meeting of}} the chief factors of the Hudson's Bay Company and the arrival of the party with which he was bound to travel further. On July 24 he departed with the party of one Major McKenzie; they travelled along the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg to Fort Alexander. From there on Kane followed the same route he had taken two years earlier going west: by the Lake of the Woods, Fort Frances, and Rainy Lake, he travelled by canoe to Fort William and then along the northern shore of Lake Superior until he reached Sault Ste. Marie on October 1, 1848. From there he returned by steamboat to Toronto, where he landed on October 13. He noted in his book on this last leg of his journey: [...] "the greatest hardship that I had to endure [...] was the difficulty in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in a civilized bed".|$|E

After being kicked out of the park, Daffy complains that it is [...] "the coldest night in 64 years" [...] and wonders where he is going <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Daffy spots a department store window with a comfortable living room-type display and goes inside. Porky sees him and comes in the store using a skeleton key.|$|R
