5|$|The {{victims are}} {{informed}} by microcassette recorder that antidotes are hidden throughout the house; {{one is in}} the room's safe, and a cryptic clue is provided. Xavier ignores a warning note and uses a key on the door, which fires a bullet through <b>the</b> <b>peephole</b> and Gus' eye, killing him. They search the house for more antidotes after the room lets them out, with no success: Obi, who is revealed to have helped with the abductions, is forced into a crematory oven to obtain two antidotes inside, but inadvertently activates the trap and is burned to death before the others can save him, destroying the antidotes; In the next room, Xavier throws Amanda into a syringe-filled pit intended for himself, and though {{she is able to}} retrieve the key, he is unable to unlock the steel door behind which the antidote sits before the timer expires and he leaves out of frustration. Throughout the game, they discuss connections between them and determine that each has been jailed before; the sole exception is Daniel, who has nonetheless been arrested before.|$|E

During the tour they meet the maid Charlotte and through the {{exchange}} between herself and Royer-Collard {{it is apparent that}} there is a connection. The asylum has been converted into a print shop, with the inmates as its staff. The books being printed are the works of the Marquis de Sade. At the end of the tour, the new Abbé meets his predecessor, who resides in the Marquis' old cell. Yearning to write, he begs paper and a quill from the new Abbé, and tries to strangle Royer-Collard when he ventures to close <b>the</b> <b>peephole.</b> The Abbé is herded off by Royer-Collard before he can hear anymore from his predecessor.

2500|$|... "Permitted" [...] is an {{installation}} piece created by Renee Samwise Green inspired by Sarah Baartman. Green created a specific viewing arrangement {{to investigate the}} European perception of the black female body as [...] "exotic", [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "monstrous". Viewers were prompted to step onto the installed platform which was meant to evoke a stage, where Baartman may have been exhibited. Green recreates the basic setting of Baartman's exhibition. At {{the centre of the}} platform, which there is a large image of Baartman, and wooden rulers or slats with an engraved caption by Francis Galton encouraging viewers to measure Baartman's buttocks. In the installation there is also a peephole that allows viewers to see an image of Baartman standing on a crate. According to Willis, the implication of <b>the</b> <b>peephole,</b> [...] demonstrates how ethnographic imagery of the black female form in the nineteenth century functioned as a form of pornography for Europeans present at Baartmans exhibit.|$|E

Also, Qwilleran finds the ledger Dan was copying out of, and discovers it was a recipe of glazes used by Joy.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{advocate}} {{a new model}} for inductive learning. Called sequential induction, this model bridges classical fixed-sample learning techniques (which are efficient but ad hoc), and worst-case approaches (which provide strong statistical guarantees but are too inefficient for practical use). According to the sequential inductive model, learning is a sequence of decisions which are informed by training data. By analyzing induction {{at the level of}} these decisions, and by utilizing the minimum data necessary to make each decision, sequential inductive techniques can provide the strong statistical guarantees of worst-case methods, but with substantially less data than those methods require. The sequential inductive model is also useful as a method for determining a sufficient sample size for inductive learning and as such, is relevant to megainduction,where the preponderance of data introduces problems of scale. <b>The</b> <b>peepholing</b> and decision-theoretic subsampling approaches of Catlet [...] ...|$|R
40|$|A {{user study}} was {{conducted}} to compare the performance of three methods for map navigation with mobile devices. These methods are joystick navigation, <b>the</b> dynamic <b>peephole</b> method without visual context, and the magic lens paradigm using external visual context. The joystick method is the familiar scrolling and panning of a virtual map keeping the device itself static. In <b>the</b> dynamic <b>peephole</b> method <b>the</b> device is moved and the map is fixed with respect to an external frame of reference, but no visual information is present outside the device’s display. The magic lens method augments an external content with graphical overlays, hence providing visual context outside the device display. Here too motion of the device serves to steer navigation. We compare these methods in a study measuring user performance, motion patterns, and subjective preference via questionnaires. The study demonstrates the advantage of dynamic peephole and magic lens interaction over joystick interaction in terms of search time and degree of exploration of the search space...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{an adaptation of}} <b>the</b> <b>peepholing</b> method to regression trees. Peepholing {{was described as a}} means to overcome the major computational bottleneck of growing classification trees by Catlett [3]. This method involves two major steps: shortlisting and blinkering. The former has the goal of eliminating some continuous variables from consideration when growing the tree, while the second tries to restrict the range of values of the remaining continuous variables that should be considered when searching for the best cut point split. Both are effective means of overcoming the most costly step of growing tree-based models: sorting the values of the continuous variables before selecting their best split. In this work we describe the adaptations that are necessary to use this method within regression trees. The major adaptations involve developing means to obtain biased estimates of the criterion used to select the best split of these models. We present some preliminary experiments that show the effectiveness of our proposal. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present and}} discuss <b>the</b> concept of <b>peepholes</b> {{as a means}} for {{creating}} engaging interactions. By peepholes, we refer to aspects of interactive artifacts and environments that utilize the tension between what is hidden and what is revealed to foster engagement.

500|$|The work is {{an example}} of Lichtenstein's {{presentation}} of the uncertainty of the one-eyed perspective. It {{is considered to be a}} work on the subject of [...] "focal vision and blindness", and it is a prominent example of the theme running through Lichtenstein's art relating to vision. He uses the narrative to emphasize this theme, while playing on both <b>the</b> circular <b>peephole</b> and <b>the</b> circular eyes. The depicted mechanical device, a peephole in this case, forces the vision into a monocular format. Monocularity is funnelled through <b>the</b> primitive <b>peephole</b> apparatus that almost mimics a camera lens. In some senses, monocularity of this work is a strong theme that is directly embodied although only by allusion. In addition, the work is considered to be closely related to his later work, Image Duplicator (1963), which is regarded as a correction of I Can See the Whole Room! with its glaring and aggressive binocularity. The monocularity of I Can See the Whole Room! should be viewed as a concentrated form of monocularity, such as [...] "the common experience of closing one eye in order to fix an object in the gaze", but a subordinated form of monocularity that is enhanced by technology.|$|R
