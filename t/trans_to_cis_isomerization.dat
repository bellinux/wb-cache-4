50|$|Reductive {{elimination}} of square planar complexes can progress {{through a variety}} of mechanisms: dissociative, nondissociative, and associative. Similar to octahedral complexes, a dissociative mechanism for square planar complexes initiates with loss of a ligand, generating a three-coordinate intermediate that undergoes reductive elimination to produce a one-coordinate metal complex. For a nondissociative pathway, reductive elimination occurs from the four-coordinate system to afford a two-coordinate complex. If the eliminating ligands are trans to each other, the complex must first undergo a <b>trans</b> <b>to</b> <b>cis</b> <b>isomerization</b> before eliminating. In an associative mechanism, a ligand must initially associate with the four-coordinate metal complex to generate a five-coordinate complex that undergoes reductive elimination synonymous to the dissociation mechanism for octahedral complexes.|$|E

We find that the <b>trans</b> <b>to</b> <b>cis</b> <b>isomerization</b> reaction of the molecules in the monolayer shows deviation from the first-order kinetics unlike those reported on Langmuir monolayers of azobenzene molecules. We attribute the deviation from first-order kinetics to the simultaneous photoisomerization of trans isomers to form cis isomers and the reverse thermal isomerization of cis isomers to form trans isomers. Our analysis of {{the rate of change}} of mole fraction of trans isomers to form cis isomers indicates a first-order kinetics for trans to cis photoisomerization reaction and a second-order kinetics for cis to trans thermal isomerization reaction. This second-order kinetics mechanism is similar to the Lindemann-Hinshelwood mechanism for the unimolecular reactions at low concentration of reactants. The formation of the activated cis isomer by collisions is a slow process as compared to the decay of the activated cis isomer to trans isomer in the liquid expanded phase. This results in the second-order kinetics for the thermal isomerization of cis isomers...|$|E
40|$|The Cys 2 -Cys 10 {{disulfide}} bond in ribonuclease T 1 {{was broken}} by substituting Cys 2 and Cys 10 by Ser and Asn, respectively, as present in ribonuclease F 1. This C 2 S/C 10 N variant resembles the wild-type protein in structure and in catalytic activity. Minor structural changes were observed by 2 -dimensional NMR in the local environment of the substituted amino acids only. The thermodynamic stability of ribonuclease T 1 is strongly reduced by breaking the Cys 2 -Cys 10 bond, and the free energy of denaturation is decreased by about 10 kJ/mol. The folding mechanism is not affected, and the <b>trans</b> <b>to</b> <b>cis</b> <b>isomerizations</b> of Pro 39 and Pro 55 are still the rate-limiting steps of the folding process. The differences in the time courses of unfolding and refolding are correlated with the decrease in stability: the folding kinetics of the wild-type protein and the C 2 S/C 10 N variant become indistinguishable when they are compared under conditions of identical stability. Apparently, the Cys 2 -Cys 10 disulfide bond {{is important for the}} stability but not for the folding mechanism of ribonuclease T 1.

40|$|We have {{obtained}} the resonance Raman spectrum of bacteriorhodopsin's primary photoproduct K {{with a novel}} low-temperature spinning sample technique. Purple membrane at 77 K is illuminated with spatially separated actinic (pump) and probe laser beams. The 514 -nm pump beam produces a photostationary steady-state mixture of bacteriorhodopsin and K. This mixture is then rotated through the red (676 nm) probe beam, which selectively enhances the Raman scattering from K. The essential advantage of our successive pump-and-probe technique is that it prevents the fluorescence excited by the pump beam from masking the red probe Raman scattering. K exhibits strong Raman lines at 1516, 1294, 1194, 1012, 957, and 811 cm- 1. The effects of C 15 deuteration on K's fingerprint lines correlate well with those seen in 13 -cis model compounds, indicating that K has a 13 -cis chromophore. However, the presence of unusually strong "low-wavenumber" lines at 811 and 957 cm- 1, attributable to hydrogen out-of-plane wags, indicates that the protein holds the chromophore in a distorted conformation after <b>trans</b> leads <b>to</b> <b>cis</b> <b>isomerization...</b>|$|R

Direct coupling of the acid with aminoalcohols using DCC or EDC were only modestly successful. Thionyl chloride (SOCl 2) conversion of the precursor acid to the corresponding acid chloride and subsequent reaction with the aminoalcohol were more successful.

Given that the subsequent step would be SNAr displacement of halide, we chose to examine direct synthesis of the bicycle from the methyl ester in one pot.

40|$|The trans-polyproline (PII) {{oligomers}} (Figure 1) are unusually rigid peptide structures {{which have}} been extensively studied by our group for peptide mediated intramolecular electron transfer (ET) at long distances. We have previously studied ET across a series of metal ion donor (D) acceptor (A) oligoproline peptides with different distances, driving forces and reorganizational energies. The majority of these experiments involve generating the ET intermediate using pulse radiolysis methods, although more recently photochemical methods are also used. Results of these studies showed that ET across peptides can vary by more than twelve orders of magnitude. Using ruthenium bipyridine donors, ET reaction rate constants across several proline residues (n = 4 - 9) occurred in the millisecond (ms) to {micro}s timescale, thus limiting the proline peptide conformational motions to only minor changes (far smaller than the large changes that occur on the ms to sec timescale, such as <b>trans</b> <b>to</b> <b>cis</b> proline <b>isomerization).</b> The present report describes our large data base of experimental results for D-peptide-A complexes {{in terms of a}} model where the involvement of both superexchange and hopping (hole and electron) mechanisms account for the long range ET rate constants observed.

The N 1 s to π* transition of the central azo-bridge shifts by 0. 45 ± 0. 05 eV to higher photon energy and the transition dipole moment (TDM) is tilted by 59 ± 5 ° with respect to the surface normal. The π -system of one phenyl ring is tilted by about 30 ° with respect to the surface normal, while the second ring plane is oriented nearly perpendicular to the surface.

The mesophase behaviour was investigated by polarising optical microscopy, {{differential scanning calorimetry}} and X-ray diffraction measurements and {{it was found that}} all three compounds display SmAintercal mesophases. These bent-shaped molecules exhibit strong photoisomerisation behaviour in solutions in which <b>trans</b> <b>to</b> <b>cis</b> isomerisation takes about 50 seconds whereas the reverse process takes almost 31 hours...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} banana-shaped {{monomers}} containing naphthalene as central units, azobenzene in side arms with terminal alkenes were synthesized and characterized. Polarizing optical microscopy, DSC and X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that one compound processes a nematic phase while other four compounds exhibit B 6 phase. The absorption spectrum of trans-azobenzene displays high-intensity -* transition at 365 and low-intensity n-* transition at 450 nm. These molecules exhibit strong photoisomerisation behaviour in solutions in which <b>trans</b> <b>to</b> <b>cis</b> isomerisation takes 55 seconds whereas reverse process takes about 32 hours. Such a long thermal back relaxation {{is useful for}} creation of optical image storage devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of liquid crystals to light {{is very important}} for applications of liquid crystals in display and memory devices. Recently experiments have been carried out on liquid crystals doped with photoactive azo compounds. It is seen that UV rays incident on such systems can lower the nematic isotropic transition temperature T NI. Also, in some mixtures, a photo-induced smectic phase is observed. This is attributed to the change in the <b>trans</b> (longer) isomer <b>to</b> <b>cis</b> (shorter) isomer of the photoactive dopant. We have earlier developed a molecular mean-field model assuming the medium to consist of inter-converting anti-parallel and parallel pairs to explain the molecular origin of "two lengths". The model was used to explain double re-entrance, the effect of electric field on T NI, etc. This model is modified to include the change of <b>trans</b> <b>to</b> <b>cis</b> isomer which is equivalent to an increase of fraction of parallel (shorter) pairs. The calculated phase diagram with respect to incident UV radiation energy shows an induced smectic phase. This is in qualitative agreement with experimental trends.
