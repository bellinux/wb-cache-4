It moved westward and nearly strengthened <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hurricane, peaking in intensity on August 28. At that point, the cyclone encountered cooler waters, which {{caused it to}} weaken slowly, weakening <b>to</b> <b>a</b> depression on August 30.

Finally, it is demonstrated that the method can be used <b>to</b> transform <b>an</b> LR(1) grammar <b>to</b> <b>an</b> equivalent SLR(1) grammar, which in turn can be easdy transformed <b>to</b> <b>an</b> equivalent (1, 1) bounded right-context grammar.
