500|$|The Boys from Baghdad High was well-received {{from its}} initial screening. It was {{nominated}} for a Youth Jury Award at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, shortlisted for an Amnesty International 2008 UK Media Award in the category for Television Documentary and Docudramas, and the European Independent Film Festival named it <b>the</b> <b>Best</b> <b>News</b> and Current Affairs film. It {{was nominated for}} the Readers' Award in the Radio Times, and in May 2008 it won the Premiere Prize at the Sandford St. Martin Trust Awards, which acknowledges excellence in religious broadcasting. The Trust's chairman and former BBC Head of Religious Broadcasting Colin Morris said of the documentary, [...] "We saw the way faith breaks into secular life in the chaos of present-day Iraq. Coming from different ethnic and religious backgrounds the boys showed that despite the war their daily preoccupations were much the same as those of teenage boys the world over – girlfriends, parents, sport, fashion, exams, music. Would their friendship survive? Ultimately the programme confronted British viewers with the question: 'What in God's name are we doing there? The film received a standing ovation from the audience at the Traverse City Film Festival, and at the Tribeca Film Festival it was short-listed for the 2008 World Documentary Feature Competition, competing against eleven other non-fiction films for Best Documentary Film and Best New Documentary Filmmaker.|$|E

2500|$|... “News of My Morning Work” {{was likely}} written around 1609, {{but did not}} rise to {{prominence}} until it was published amongst other short pieces {{as a supplement to}} Sir Thomas Overbury’s A Wife in 1615, which became “an instant bestseller.” Overbury’s poem was published along with News articles such as Boulstred’s after it was discovered that Overbury had been murdered by the woman he wrote the poem about, making the publication a huge hit. A line in Jonson’s “Epigram on the Court Pucell” reads, “And in an Epicoene fury can write News / Equal with that which for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>News</b> goes,” which seems to imply that the News articles published with Overbury’s poem were written by Boulstred’s friends and that “News of My Morning Work” was written by Boulstred. The publication itself only identifies the author as a ‘Mris B.’ ...|$|E

2500|$|The new {{clock was}} {{potentially}} suitable for navigational uses (longitude by chronometer). Exploiting the invention at sea proved troublesome, however. In 1660 Lodewijk Huygens made a trial on a voyage to Spain, {{and reported that}} heavy weather made the clock useless. Alexander Bruce elbowed into the field in 1662, and Huygens called in Sir Robert Moray and the Royal Society to mediate and preserve some of his rights. Trials continued into the 1660s, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>news</b> coming from a Royal Navy captain Robert Holmes operating against the Dutch possessions in 1664. Lisa Jardine [...] doubts that Holmes reported {{the results of the}} trial accurately, and Samuel Pepys expressed his doubts at the time: The said master [...] affirmed, that the vulgar reckoning proved as near as that of the watches, which , added he, had varied from one another unequally, sometimes backward, sometimes forward, to 4, 6, 7, 3, 5 minutes; as also that they had been corrected by the usual account. One for the French Academy on an expedition to Cayenne ended badly. Jean Richer suggested correction for the figure of the Earth. By the time of the Dutch East India Company expedition of 1686 to the Cape of Good Hope, Huygens was able to supply the correction retrospectively.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on April 8, 2009 Khan would {{move up to}} the light welterweight division to fight Andreas Kotelnik (31-2-1, 13 KOs) at the MEN Arena in Manchester for the WBA light welterweight title on 18 July. Khan Said, [...] "This is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>news</b> that I could have received. To fight for the world title in only my 22nd fight and at the age of just 22 is fantastic. Frank has done a great job getting the world title fight for me in Britain and now I have to go out win it." [...] This would be Kotelnik's fourth title defense. Khan won by a unanimous decision, 120–108, 118–111, 118–111, in front of 10,000, and became the third-youngest Brit to win a world title, at the age of 22. Khan's lightning hand speed and fitness gave him the advantages to go well ahead on points in the first ten rounds. Kotelnik rallied in the closing rounds but could not land a decisive punch on Khan, Kotelnik throwing everything he had in the final two stanzas. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It's the best feeling ever. I want to thank Freddie Roach and my team for making this happen. I'm a world champion and I'm going to enjoy it. I'm still young and I've got big things to come." ...|$|E
