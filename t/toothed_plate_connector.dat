The characteristic shear strength and slip moduli were evaluated for three types of connectors: � 1 � a 300 -mm-long rectangular notch cut in the LVL joist and reinforced with a 16 -mm-diameter lag screw; � 2 � a triangular notch reinforced with the same lag screw; and � 3 � two 333 -mm-long <b>toothed</b> metal <b>plates</b> pressed in the lateral surface of two adjacent LVL joists. The shear force versus relative slip relationships are presented together with analytical prepeak and postpeak approximations {{which can be used}} to carry out nonlinear finite-element analyses of LVL-concrete composite beams. The failure mechanisms of the notched connections are also discussed. Analytical design formulas for shear-strength evaluation of notched connections derived in accordance with New Zealand Standards and Eurocodes are proposed based on four possible failure mechanisms.

The new systems will enhance and accelerate the replacement process of concrete bridge decks, and provide sufficient composite action to resist the horizontal shear at the girder-to-deck interface. The new systems include a debonded interface with formed shear key protruding from the precast girders and steel connectors for concrete girders; 11 4 in. diameter steel shear studs and a new 2 ̆ 2 dovetail 2 ̆ 2 shaped <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> for steel girder construction. ^ Test program consisting of horizontal shear push-off specimens, lab size beams, and full scale girders was conducted on all proposed connection schemes. Test results show that the debonded shear key system with steel connectors spaced at 24 in. {{along the length of the}} girder provides sufficient horizontal shear resistance utilizing the shear friction theory. The 11 4 in. diameter steel shear studs appears to have high fatigue resistance and higher α values as compared to both AASHTO Standard and AASHTO LRFD Specifications. The ultimate strength capacity of the 11 4 in. studs was found to be twice the capacity of the conventional 7 / 8 in. diameter studs.

40|$|Finger {{jointing}} {{of short}} off-cuts for structural purposes particularly for lightweight roof truss and prefabricated timber house is likely an economical method of minimizing wastage and generating benefits. The {{primary goal of}} this research is on the possibility of using finger-jointed timber with metal <b>plate</b> <b>connectors</b> for structural purposes, i. e. in trusses: internal members, top and bottom chord. This research assessed the strength properties of finger-jointed Strength Group B timber and the influence of number of joints and its positioning on strength. The glue applied for finger jointing is polymer isocyanate adhesive or commercially known as Koyo glue. Bending, compression and tension tests were carried out and the results show that the efficiency of the joints in relation to the strength of the unjointed specimens were greatly influenced by the positioning and number of joints. The results obtained from tests indicated that modulus of rupture decreases with the presence of finger joint while modulus of elasticity is not affected. Tests on the performance of connection with metal plate using finger-jointed timber showed small difference in the basic working load as compared to the unjointed specimens. The study suggests that the combination use of finger-jointed timber with metal <b>plate</b> <b>connector</b> for structural purposes is acceptable depending on the joint efficiency, the position and number of the finger joint in the member, and the type of stresses (i. e. compression, tension or bending) in the member...|$|R

40|$|The fire {{performance}} of heavy timber frame structures is often {{limited by the}} poor {{fire performance}} of its connections. Conventional timber connections, dowelled or <b>toothed</b> <b>plate</b> connections typically use steel as a connector material. In a fire, the steel parts rapidly conduct heat into the timber, leading to reduced fire performance. Replacing metallic connectors with alternative non-metallic, low thermal conductivity connector materials can, therefore, lead to improved connection performance in fire. This paper presents an experimental study into the fire performance of metal-free timber connections comprising a hot-pressed plywood flitch plate and glassfibre- reinforced polymer dowels. The thermal behaviour of the connections at elevated temperatures is studied using a standard cone calorimeter apparatus and a novel heat transfer rate inducing system. The latter is a fire testing system developed at the University of Edinburgh. The mechanical behaviour of the connection during severe heating was also studied using an environmental chamber at temperatures up to 610 °C. The results demonstrate that heat transfer in the non-metallic connections is governed by the thermal properties of the timber, resulting in significant enhancements in connection fire performance...|$|R

Different variables such as span length (8 and 10 m), connection and concrete types, and design level (well- and under-designed, in terms of connector numbers) were investigated.

Connection types investigated include triangular and rectangular (150 mm and 300 mm long) notches cut in the timber and reinforced with a coach screw, and modified <b>toothed</b> metal <b>plates</b> pressed {{on the edge of}} the LVL joists. All of the beam specimens were designed using the effective bending stiffness or gamma -method, in accordance with Annex B of Eurocode 5. The same method was used for an analytical-experimental comparison of the beam's performance at ultimate (ULS) and serviceability (SLS) limit state. All well-designed beams provided more than 95 % composite action even though there were relatively few connectors (e. g. six 300 mm long notches on the 8 m span beam). The ULS and SLS live load capacity of the beams was found to be approximately 90 % of that of a fully composite beam. Correction factors providing a 15 % increase for deflection and a 13 % reduction of the effective bending stiffness are proposed for calculations using the transformed section method for all well-designed beams, i. e. beams designed using the gamma -method according to Annex B of Eurocode 5. Although the gamma -method was found to be significantly underestimate the ULS strength, it provided an accurate prediction of the short-term deflection. In terms of the connection type, the 300 mm rectangular notches provided the best performance, with high stiffness and strength beyond the ULS load level, and requiring fewer connectors along the beam.

40|$|The New Zealand Building Code (NZBC) {{deemed to}} satisfy {{solution}} for houses and small multi-unit dwellings requires external walls within 1 m of and at angles less than 90 ° to a property boundary to be fire-rated {{to a minimum}} 30 -min fire resistance rating (FRR). The NZBC also requires structural building systems to remain stable during and after fire when subjected to a uniformly distributed horizontal face load of 0. 5 kPa ‘in any direction’. This research investigated the fire performance of laterally loaded light timber-framed compartments, to assess their suitability under the NZBC requirements for residential buildings. The research involved a full-scale standard furnace experiment and a full-scale compartment fire experiment. The building design was based on common New Zealand residential building construction for a light timber-frame building with compartment dimensions of 4. 33 m × 3. 35 m and stud height of 2. 4 m. One of the 4. 33 m walls was 30 -min fire-rated and the other building elements were of typical non-fire-rated construction. Internal wall and ceiling linings were 10 mm thick standard grade plasterboard, except for the fire-rated wall which had 10 mm fibre-reinforced plasterboard {{on both sides of}} the timber framing. The external cladding and roof consisted of light-weight sheet materials except for the fire-rated wall which had no additional covering. The fire-rated wall was subjected to a lateral load applied at the top plate equivalent to a 0. 5 kPa face load. The roof truss system was an integral component in providing lateral support to the fire-rated wall and each roof truss spanned between the fire-rated wall and the parallel 4. 33 m wall. Each roof truss was designed with a splice in the centre of the bottom chord, connected by <b>toothed</b> metal <b>connector</b> <b>plates.</b> In the furnace experiment the compartment was heated to the ISO 834 standard time-temperature curve, failure of the roof truss system at the truss <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> was observed after 30. 5 min, causing failure of the roof resulting in lateral deflection of the loaded fire-rated wall. It was found there was non-uniform temperature distribution in the compartment. An analysis of the failure taking into consideration temperature distribution in the compartment suggests that the roof truss system with splice supporting the fire-rated wall would fail in lateral stability after 26 min if the furnace had been driven to achieve the ISO 834 time-temperature relationship at ceiling level. An analysis of expected performance of an unlined compartment predicts a lateral stability failure time of 19. 5 min if exposed to the ISO 834 standard time-temperature curve. The compartment experiment was a natural fire with a fixed initial ventilation and fuel load consisting of wood cribs. The roof truss design incorporated specific protection of the splice using blocks of timber. The wall system failed in lateral stability after 28 min and before all the fuel in the compartment was consumed. Applying a time equivalence method suggests that the fire-rated wall restraint system performance would be the equivalent of 33. 5 min in a standard fire resistance test for the compartment. Comparing the results for Experiments # 1 and # 2, the protection added to the splice improved the performance of the lateral load restraint system from 26 min to 33. 5 min. An analysis of expected performance of an unlined compartment predicts a lateral stability failure time of 26 min if exposed to the ISO 834 standard time-temperature curve...|$|R

In steel construction, {{there are}} various seismic {{structural}} systems that have been successfully utilized in the past including eccentric and concentric braced frames and moment frame systems. When these systems are used, the building envelope between structural members is filled with architectural components such as masonry infill walls, which are only expected to carry out of plane loads, such as wind, on each individual wall panel. Hybrid masonry {{is a relatively new}} type of structural system which incorporates the masonry infill walls within steel frames into the structural system to resist lateral loads imposed on the structure. This research represents the third phase of testing at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) and is part of an ongoing project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation Research (NEESR) to investigate the applicability of hybrid masonry as an adequate structural system. In phases I and II of hybrid masonry <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> development research at UHM, a wide variety of connector designs were explored to determine the positive and negative aspects to different fuse and link <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> designs and connection methods. Fuse connector tests demonstrated the viability of tapered fuses to dissipate large amounts of energy during cyclic loading. These tests also showed that various practical connector orientations and methods can be applied for hybrid masonry connectors, particularly the straight bolted side plate connection. In addition, during phase I of testing, a series of bolt push out tests were performed to determine the shear strength of post-installed through-bolts in masonry. Observations from the first two phases of testing were used as a guide for selecting 4 -inch and 6 -inch tapered fuse designs for testing on partially grouted and fully grouted masonry wall specimens. Multiple pairs of both tapered fuse connectors were slip-critically bolted to side plates, which were welded to a steel beam above the masonry wall specimens. These tests were performed to verify that the behavior of multiple pairs of <b>connector</b> <b>plates</b> in series is similar to the behavior of the individual pairs of <b>connector</b> <b>plates.</b> In addition, the tests were performed to observe the interaction between the steel <b>connector</b> <b>plates</b> and masonry wall specimens. Based on numerous observations and results in this phase of testing, the design of Type I hybrid masonry connections was improved.

In regions of higher seismicity (Seismic Design Categories D and greater), there exists a much greater need for a clearer understanding of the mechanics of the interaction between the steel frame of a building and the masonry shear wall as well as the development of specific detailing requirements to provide for a ductile and somewhat predictable response in a seismic event of significant magnitude. The scope of this thesis is the investigation of the connection between the steel beam and the top of the masonry wall for a Type I hybrid masonry system, using a proposed steel <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> through-bolted to the masonry wall bond beam, in order to provide preliminary guidelines and recommendations for the development of energy dissipating hybrid masonry <b>connector</b> <b>plates.</b> The first portion of this study focused on the development of <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> designs to determine which provided the most stable, ductile cyclic response. The second portion of this study investigated the strength and limit states of the through-bolted connection to the masonry wall bond beam under shear loading. Based on these experiments, recommendations are provided for the most suitable <b>connector</b> <b>plate</b> designs as well as a general evaluation of the connection to the masonry wall and potential limit states to consider in future design applications. For a "rigid" connection between the steel frame and CMU wall, link connectors with a thickness greater than 0. 5 inches is recommended, whereas fuse Type T was proven to be superior for a ductile, energy dissipating <b>connector</b> <b>plate.</b> ACI 530 - 08 design values for bolt shear yielding and masonry shear failure were determined to be the most appropriate limit states for determining an approximate design values for the thru-bolted CMU wall connections...|$|R
