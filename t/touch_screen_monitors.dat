5000|$|The {{medical problem}} {{associated}} with computer-related work is {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS). CTS is a stress-related injury caused by repetitive movement of joints, especially the wrist, {{and can lead to}} numerous musculoskeletal problems. It has become very common among Computer professionals due to poorly placed computer components and extensive typing {{over a long period of}} time. Studies conducted show that one in eight computer professionals suffer from CTS. This study was conducted over 21 companies and the majority of sufferers said that they experienced acute and in some cases severe pain due to CTS. The main cause of CTS seems to be debatable, however, with many sources saying that the syndrome is predominantly caused by the acute positioning of the wrist while typing and this problem is exacerbated by the need for the user to be crouching towards the screen while typing. Different research conducted cites the mouse as being the main cause of CTS as it was found that among the fingers the right thumb was revealed to be more susceptible to CTS due to the acute position of the thumb while using the mouse. CTS, although prevalent, seems to be very difficult to ameliorate or cure due to the consistency in the design of computer components such as the mouse and the keyboard, but some companies are leading the way with technologies such as <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>monitors</b> which will reduce stress on the hand and wrist. Employers in major companies are also taking measures to ameliorate CTS by implementing frequent work breaks and work rotation procedures to ensure that employees aren’t working on a single computer for hours on end [...] "a higher level of intensity of computer work results in higher risk for CTS."

40|$|Abstract—Information leakage {{of general}} input {{operations}} using button images in {{graphical user interface}} on <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>monitors</b> was experimentally investigated from images reconstructed by receiving the electromagnetic noise. In the experimental investigations for input operations of a personal identification number, {{it was confirmed that}} when a button image was touched, the touched button image can be identified from the reconstructed button images. This kind of information leakage has originated the fact that the touched button image has changed the color for informing the operator which button image was touched. From the elucidation of the image reconstruction mechanism, {{it was found that the}} information leakage has been caused by the magnitude of the emitted signal that results from the analog voltage differences of the RGB signals between neighboring pixels on the monitor. Therefore, a countermeasure method was proposed from the viewpoint of the combination of the colors of the button images and of the background or of the numerals in the button images. The countermeasure method was then applied to the previous input operations of a personal identification number. From the experimental results for the countermeasure method, it was confirmed that the touched button image cannot be identified from the reconstructed button image. As a result, the proposal countermeasure method can prevent effectively the information leakage of input operations on <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>monitors</b> due to the electromagnetic noise...|$|E

During that time, I was given three {{projects}} to work on: Large Altitude Simulation System (LASS) basket strainer, log books, {{and the design}} of a case for <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>monitors</b> used for simulations. I spent most of my time on the LASS basket strainer. The LASS system has a water feed line with a basket strainer that filters out rust. In 2009, there were three misfires which cost approximately $ 27, 000 and about 8 % of the allotted time. The strainer was getting a large change in pressure that would result in a shutdown of the system. I have designed a new basket that will eliminate the large pressure change and it can be used with the old basket strainer housing. The LASS system has three steam generators (modules). Documents pertaining to these modules are stored electronically, and the majority of the documents are not able to be searched with keywords, so they have to be gone through one by one. I have come up with an idea on how to organize these files so that the Propulsion Department may efficiently search through the documents needed. Propulsion also has a LASS simulator that incorporates two <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>monitors.</b> Currently these monitors are in six foot by two foot metal cabinet on wheels.

40|$|Spatial neglect is a {{heterogeneous}} disorder with {{a multitude of}} manifestations and subtypes. Common clinical neglect tests fail to differentiate these subtypes. In line bisection tasks, for example, a marked rightward deviation {{can be caused by}} an underestimation of the left half of the line (input-related deficit), by the failure to direct actions towards the left side of space (output-related deficit), or by a mixture of both these impairments. To disentangle these components, we used a test consisting of a line bisection task on a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>monitor</b> (manual motor task) and the subsequent judgment of one's own bisection performance (visual perceptual task). It is hypothesized that patients with mainly output-related neglect should be better in recognizing their misbisected lines than patients with purely input-related neglect. In a group of 16 patients suffering from spatial neglect, we found that patients are {{three times more likely to}} suffer from a predominantly input-related than from an output-related subtype. The results thus suggest that neglect is typically an input-related impairment. Additional analysis of the line bisection task revealed that temporal (slowness in initiation and execution of contralateral movements) and spatial (insufficient movement amplitude towards the contralesional side) aspects of output-related neglect were not related. This independence raises the possibility that a fine-grained differentiation of output-related neglect is required. That is, impairments in lateralized temporal and spatial aspects of movements may underlie different neglect subtypes...|$|R

It is known that pigeons with navigational experience show a larger hippocampus and also a more lateralised brain than pigeons without navigational experience. So we hypothesized that experience may have an influence also on orientation ability. We examined two groups of pigeons (11 with navigational experience and 17 without) in a standard operant chamber with a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>monitor</b> showing a 2 -D schematic of a rectangular environment (as "geometric" information) and one uniquely shaped and colored feature in each corner (as "landmark" information). Pigeons were trained first for pecking on one of these features and then we examined their ability to encode geometric and landmark information in four tests by modifying the rectangular environment. All tests were done under binocular and monocular viewing to test hemispheric dominance. The number of pecks was counted for analysis. Results show that generally both groups orientate on the basis of landmarks and the geometry of environment, but landmark information was preferred. Pigeons with navigational experience did not perform better on the tests but showed a better conjunction of the different kinds of information. Significant differences between monocular and binocular viewing were detected particularly in pigeons without navigational experience on two tests with reduced information. Our data suggest that the conjunction of geometric and landmark information might be integrated after processing separately in each hemisphere and that this process is influenced by experience...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} areas of {{interest}} in the field of ergonomics is the design of hand tools. Though considerable research has produced more user-friendly tools, there has been some reluctance to use them for some tasks. It is hypothesized that this reluctance {{on the part of the}} user may be partly due to the reduction of accuracy while using those handles. A pilot study employing twenty subjects (10 males, 10 females) was undertaken to evaluate three different grip angles, between the tool and handle axis, combined with four visual availability of the target conditions. Each subject was asked to aim at the center of the target under all the twelve test scenarios, with each subject performing ten trials in each scenario. The target was a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>monitor.</b> The interface was a black screen background with the center indicated by a red cross-hair. The results of this study showed that the dependent variable, accuracy, was primarily effected by the angle of the of the handle grip with respect to the tool axis and by the visual availability of the target in a manual-aiming task. The tool with the least ergonomically correct wrist position yielded the best accuracy. As expected, the blind condition was the worst, but seeing the points that had been previously hit as additional visual feedback did not improve performance. The overall implication being that the most ergonomically correct tool might not lead to the best performance unless proprioception or feedback is taken into consideration. This has direct implications for tasks such as laparoscopic surgery where a long shafted tool is used with little visual feedback...|$|R
