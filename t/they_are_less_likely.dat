5|$|Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species {{are the primary}} causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of socioeconomic-cultural homogamy on the marital and sexual satisfaction of Hong Kong Chinese couples. Using a representative, territory-wide sample of 1, 083 first-time married heterosexual couples, this study found that wives <b>were</b> generally <b>less</b> satisfied than their husbands with their marital and sexual relationships. Husbands {{were more likely to}} be satisfied with their marriages when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> two to four years older than their wives than when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> of similar age to their wives (i. e., within one year of each other), but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> satisfied with their marriages when only their wives were employed than when both partners were employed. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> satisfied with both their marital and sexual relationships when their wives were five or more years older. Wives with an older husband {{were more likely to be}} sexually satisfied than wives of the same age as their husband, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> satisfied with their marriages when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> better educated than their husbands. The implications of the findings are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The College Kidnappers was a {{group of}} alumni from the University of Illinois who {{specialized}} in kidnapping wealthy mobsters for ransom. These mobsters <b>were</b> targets because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to approach the police and could pay the ransom.|$|R

25|$|These animals {{also have}} the {{advantage}} of being far lower mass than the typical human. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to set off small mines intended to injure or kill people, if the bomb-sniffing animal crosses directly over the top of a buried mine.|$|E
25|$|Because {{agreeable}} {{children are}} {{more sensitive to the}} needs and perspectives of others, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to suffer from social rejection. Specifically, research indicates that children who are less disruptive, less aggressive, and more skilled at entering play groups are more likely to gain acceptance by their peers.|$|E
25|$|Costco {{introduced}} Kirkland Signature as its {{private label}} in 1992. The {{idea was to}} provide brand name quality products at discounted prices. To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding. According to Costco, while consumers may be wary of same-store-branding, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> {{to be wary of}} brands that they are familiar with and trust.|$|E
50|$|Undocumented {{immigrants}} in New Haven were often targets of robbery, and sometimes murder because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> {{to go to}} police due to their immigration status. It is also harder for undocumented immigrants to get bank accounts, causing some to carry around larger sums of cash.|$|R
5000|$|Thin {{transparent}} {{sheets of}} mica {{were used for}} peepholes in boilers, lanterns, stoves, and kerosene heaters because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to shatter than glass when exposed to extreme temperature gradients.

25|$|For Puerto Rican women, {{circular}} migration is often affected by familial and marital status. Single women and mothers, or {{women who have}} recently experienced a change in marital status, such as divorce, {{are more likely to}} migrate to the United States than those women in stable and/or large families. Additionally, once women migrate to the United States <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to return to Puerto Rico than men.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} is, how can {{the differences}} between social wasp mimics and bumblebee mimics be explained? Evidently if model species are common, and have overlapping distributions, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be polymorphic. Their mimics are widespread and develop a kind of rough and ready jack-of-all-trades mimicry. But if model species are less common and have patchy distribution they develop polymorphism; and their mimics match them more exactly and are polymorphic also. The issues are currently being investigated.|$|E
25|$|Pregnant {{teenagers}} face many of {{the same}} pregnancy related issues as other women. There are, however, additional concerns for those under 15 of age as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be physically developed enough to sustain a healthy pregnancy or to give birth. For girls aged 15â€“19 risks are associated more with socioeconomic factors than with the biological effects of age. Risks of low birth weight, premature labor, anemia, and pre-eclampsia are connected to the biological age, being observed in teen births even after controlling for other risk factors (such as accessing prenatal care etc.).|$|E
50|$|Sixty-four {{percent of}} {{caregivers}} {{of the elderly}} receiving 4 hours of respite per week, after one year, reported improved physical health.

25|$|The cello is {{typically}} made from carved wood, although other {{materials such as}} carbon fiber or aluminum may be used. A traditional cello has a spruce top, with maple for the back, sides, and neck. Other woods, such as poplar or willow, are sometimes used for the back and sides. Less expensive cellos frequently have tops and backs made of laminated wood. Laminated cellos are widely used in {{elementary and secondary school}} orchestras and youth orchestras, because they are much more durable than carved wood cellos (i.e., <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to crack if bumped or dropped) and they are much less expensive.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the immigration-reduction {{advocacy}} {{think tank}} the Center for Immigration Studies released a poll {{that found that}} 68% of Americans think U.S. immigration levels are too high, and just 2% said they are too low. They also found that 70% said <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to vote for candidates that favor increasing legal immigration. In 2004, 55% of Americans believed legal immigration should remain at the current level or increased and 41% said it should be decreased. The less contact a native-born American has with immigrants, the more likely one would {{have a negative view}} of immigrants.|$|E
25|$|Several moths in {{the family}} Tineidae are {{commonly}} regarded as pests because their larvae eat fabric such as clothes and blankets made from natural proteinaceous fibers such as wool or silk. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to eat mixed materials containing some artificial fibers. There are some reports {{that they may be}} repelled by the scent of wood from juniper and cedar, by lavender, or by other natural oils; however, many consider this unlikely to prevent infestation. Naphthalene (the chemical used in mothballs) is considered more effective, but there are concerns over its effects on human health.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study found}} that {{pregnant}} women who consumed 340grams of low-mercury containing fish with fatty acids per week have benefits that outweigh the risks for mercury poisoning. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to have children with low verbal IQ, motor coordination and behavioral problems.

25|$|Four factors {{exist that}} cause {{a person to}} be optimistically biased: their desired end state, their {{cognitive}} mechanisms, the information they have about themselves versus others, and overall mood. The optimistic bias is seen {{in a number of}} situations. For example: people believing that they are less at risk of being a crime victim, smokers believing that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to contract lung cancer or disease than other smokers, first-time bungee jumpers believing that they are less at risk of an injury than other jumpers, or traders who think they are less exposed to losses in the markets.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in a party's {{decision}} to participate in or engage with a corporation is their confidence that the corporation will deliver the party's expected outcomes. When categories of parties (stakeholders) do not have sufficient confidence that a corporation is being controlled and directed {{in a manner consistent}} with their desired outcomes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to engage with the corporation. When this becomes an endemic system feature, the loss of confidence and participation in markets may affect many other stakeholders, and increases the likelihood of political action. There is substantial interest in how external systems and institutions, including markets, influence corporate governance.|$|E
25|$|Dog treats given {{excessively}} {{can be a}} {{cause of}} obesity. The type of food fed has a direct bearing on the tendency of a dog to become overweight. Table scraps, treats, even premium high-energy dog foods can contribute to obesity. Therefore, it is highly important to closely monitor the quantity of treats that a dog gets especially when the dog's activity is diminished. Dog treats {{are more likely to}} be linked to obesity in old dogs, since in their old age <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to be active and exercising. On the other hand, active dogs require and use more calories, so dog treats are not a cause of concern in younger and highly active dogs.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} whether women with {{acute myocardial infarction}} in the Nottingham health district receive the same therapeutic interventions as their male counterparts. DESIGN [...] Retrospective study. SETTING [...] University and City Hospitals, Nottingham. PATIENTS [...] All patients admitted with a suspected myocardial infarction during 1989 and 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Route and timing of admission to hospital, ward of admission, treatment, interventions in hospital, and mortality. RESULTS [...] Women with myocardial infarction took longer to arrive in hospital than men. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> admitted to the coronary care unit and <b>were</b> therefore also <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to receive thrombolytic treatment. They seemed to have more severe infarcts, with higher Killip classes, and had a slightly higher mortality during admission. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> than men to receive secondary prophylaxis by being discharged taking beta blockers or aspirin. CONCLUSIONS [...] Survival chances both in hospital and after discharge in women with acute myocardial infarction <b>are</b> reduced because <b>they</b> {{do not have the}} same opportunity for therapeutic intervention as men...|$|R
25|$|This is {{the reason}} why {{injuries}} effect an athlete so much, as if any normal person got an injury they could just work around it, but for an athlete, this causes them to be separated from their sport and could mean a loss of identity is established. Normal, everyday people have skills in all aspects of their life, and have support all around them in everything they do; and as athletes are so focused on their sports, when they break out into everyday life <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to achieve their further meaning in life relating to their career and future life options due to their inability to develop themselves as people in their early lives.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the work}} of the Jesuits today embraces a wide variety of apostolates, ministries, and civil occupations, they are {{probably}} most well known for their educational work. Since the inception of the order, Jesuits have been teachers. Besides serving on the faculty of Catholic and secular schools, the Jesuits are the Catholic religious order with the second highest number of schools which they run: 168 tertiary institutions in 40 countries and 324 secondary schools in 55 countries. (The Brothers of the Christian Schools have over 560 Lasallian educational institutions.) They also run elementary schools at which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to teach. Many of the schools are named after St. Francis Xavier and other prominent Jesuits.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these problems, Bedouin women have additional obstacles to accessing care. Bedouin women are often not permitted to travel alone. In circumstances where the clinic is further away from the settlement, a male relative must accompany the woman (often forfeiting a dayâ€™s wage {{in order to do}} so). Moreover, higher school dropout rates and lower employment levels among Bedouin women mean that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to speak Hebrew. If the medical practitioner does not speak Arabic, the women must often rely on their male relatives for translation, thus forfeiting any right to medical privacy. When surveyed, Bedouin women cited lack of childcare (in {{addition to}} prohibitive distances and poor infrastructure) as a top barrier to accessing health care.|$|E
25|$|Over {{a period}} of thirty years, Lewis amassed a huge {{personal}} fortune almost solely through targeting wealthy bankers, merchants and other prominent figures. This was most often because more of a profit could <b>be</b> made while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to report the crime to police. Among his more well-known victims included General John A. Logan, Judge Noah Davis, Charles Francis Adams and, most notably, Irish author Oscar Wilde.|$|R
50|$|When newly formed, the Nebraska statewide {{lifespan}} respite program {{conducted a}} statewide survey {{of a broad}} array of caregivers who had been receiving respite services, and found that one in four families with children under 21 reported that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>less</b> <b>likely</b> to place their child in out-of-home care once respite services were available. In addition, 79% of the respondents reported decreased stress and 58% reported decreased isolation.|$|R
