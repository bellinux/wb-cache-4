5|$|Although {{they were}} not penalized, Nuggets coach George Karl and Knicks coach Isiah Thomas were both {{scrutinized}} for their part in the brawl. Carmelo Anthony was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players excessively because it wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> image free from violence.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Koppelman {{was part of}} the Stanley William Hayter Atelier 17 in New York. Later he worked at the Printmaking Workshop founded by Robert Blackburn and Will Barnet. Blackburn {{credited}} Koppelman with saving the workshop when it faced financial difficulties in 1956, by transforming it into a seven-member artists cooperative with annual dues <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> doors open.|$|E
5|$|Some experts {{also see}} the union {{as a way to}} curtail the loss of Russian {{influence}} in Central Asia. Russian politicians have voiced their concerns over Russia’s long southern borders and the challenges it may pose. By creating a regional trading bloc <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> neighbours in Central Asia stable, Russia hopes to find securing its own borders easier.|$|E

5|$|The FARDC {{deployed}} 850 {{soldiers and}} 150 PNC police officers {{as part of}} an international force in the Central African Republic, which the DRC borders to the north. The country had been in a state of civil war since 2012, when the president was ousted by rebel groups. The DRC was urged by French president François Hollande <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> troops in CAR.|$|E
5|$|A few {{deductions}} {{can also}} be made from the satellite communications. The first deduction {{that can be made}} from the satellite communications is that the aircraft remained operational until at least 08:19—seven hours after final contact was made with air traffic control over the South China Sea. The varying BFO values indicate the aircraft was moving at speed. The aircraft's SDU needs location and track information <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> antenna pointed towards the satellite, so it {{can also be}} deduced that the aircraft's navigation system was operational.|$|E

5|$|Early {{drafts of}} Barret's {{background}} featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, {{and his wife}} executed {{in front of him}} by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's desire <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Aspmyra Næringseiendom {{converted}} its debt, then NOK20.5 million, to Swiss francs. Because of the transaction, {{within a}} year the company's debt had increased by 10 percent. In 2004, the stadium ownership company {{changed its name to}} Aspmyra Stadion AS. The municipality eliminated the stadium company's debt of NOK5.5 million to the municipality in November 2005. This allowed the club's operating company to have a positive share capital and the club was thus allowed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> license. In May 2006, the grass pitch was replaced with artificial pitch, costing NOK3.1 million. The training pitch received new turf in 2007.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February, several {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that JAL would decide <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta. Inamori and ETIC officials, {{according to the}} reports, decided that switching alliances from Oneworld to Skyteam would be too risky and could hinder JAL's ability to turn around quickly. Two days later, JAL officially announced that they would strengthen their partnership with American, including a joint application for antitrust immunity on transpacific routes. The airline would also fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.|$|E

5|$|The Tsugaru clan {{sided with}} Tokugawa Ieyasu's Eastern Army during the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. Its {{immediate}} neighbors also all supported the Eastern Army. After the Tokugawa victory at Sekigahara, the Tsugaru clan was granted {{an increase in}} territory, along with permission <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> existing domain of Hirosaki (named for the family's castle town). The domain started out small at 45,000 koku, before being increased in size to 100,000 koku. Tamenobu remained politically active {{in the early years}} of the Edo era, mainly in the Kansai area; he died in Kyoto in 1608.|$|E
5|$|Upon its establishment, {{the studio}} needed more capital in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> {{operation}} running, and thus needed to gain support from publishers. They approached Electronic Arts, {{but it did}} not result in a project. The studio also contacted Ubisoft looking to make a Might & Magic game, but Ubisoft instead ended up contracting with Arkane Studios on that project, which became Dark Messiah of Might & Magic. Obsidian pitched a game to Take-Two Interactive called Futureblight, which was described as a Fallout-style game powered by the Neverwinter Nights engine. Similar to the EA and Ubisoft projects, Futureblight was never made.|$|E
5|$|When Nintendo {{published}} {{the game in}} North America, the packaging design featured {{a small portion of}} the box cut away to reveal the unique gold-colored cartridge. In 1988, The Legend of Zelda sold two million copies. Nintendo of America sought <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a warranty card became a member of the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, but the number grew as the data bank of names got larger.|$|E

5|$|Although the Xbox {{version of}} Halo lacks {{official}} support for online multiplayer play, third-party packet tunneling software provide unofficial ways around this limitation. The Windows and Macintosh ports of Halo support online matches involving up to 16 players and include multiplayer maps {{not in the}} original Xbox release. However, co-operative play {{was removed from the}} ports because it would have required large amounts of recoding to implement. In April 2014, it was announced that GameSpy's servers and matchmaking, on which Halo PC relied, would be shut down by May 31 of the same year. A team of fans and Bungie employees announced they would produce a patch for the game <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> multiplayer servers online. The patch was released on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2017, Emirates has 48 orders {{outstanding}} {{but due to}} lack {{of space}} in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and will not take any in 2019-20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021: there are open production slots in 2019 and Airbus reduced its production rate at 12 per year for 2017-18. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not want them anymore and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins lead solitary existences when {{out at sea}} {{and this}} part of their life has been little studied as the task of finding even one bird on the vast ocean is formidable. When at sea, the Atlantic puffin bobs about like a cork, {{propelling}} itself through the water with powerful thrusts of its feet and keeping itself turned into the wind, even when resting and apparently asleep. It spends much time each day preening <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> plumage in order and spread oil from the preen gland. Its downy under-plumage remains dry and provides thermal insulation. In common with other seabirds, its upper surface is black and underside white. This provides camouflage, with aerial predators unable to observe the bird against the dark watery background and underwater attackers failing to notice it as it blends in with the bright sky above the waves.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Malcolm {{summed up}} with: [...] "This car {{is really a}} most {{attractive}} proposition. Its acceleration is so good {{that it would take}} a really powerful and well-tuned car <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on <b>its</b> heels, and its upkeep is low." ...|$|R
5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the tree}} of heaven's weedy habit, landowners and other organisations often resort to various methods of control in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> populations in check. For example, the city of Basel in Switzerland has an {{eradication}} program for the tree. It can {{be very difficult to}} eradicate, however. Means of eradication can be physical, thermal, managerial, biological or chemical. A combination of several of these can be most effective, though they must of course be compatible. All have some positive and negative aspects, but the most effective regimen is generally a mixture of chemical and physical control. It involves the application of foliar or basal herbicides in order to kill existing trees, while either hand pulling or mowing seedlings in order to prevent new growth.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality, who {{administrated}} the DA-funds, {{stating that}} both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal. Therefore, both were converted to an interest-bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club. The club is required to have positive equity <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>its</b> license {{to play in the}} top two tiers. Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company, it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS. Thus, the consequence of Innovation Norway's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier. To secure it retained a positive equity, Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality.|$|E
