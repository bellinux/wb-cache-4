25|$|As with {{previous}} production-based Mustang race cars, Multimatic Engineering was engaged by Ford Performance {{to develop a}} complete <b>turn-key</b> race-only version of the S550 Shelby GT350R. The resulting competition derivative, the GT350R-C, features safety equipment and roll-over protection homologated to FIA and IMSA specifications; Bosch MS5.0 ECU and ABS controller; MoTeC instrumentation and datalogging; adjustable anti-roll bars; Multimatic DSSV spool-valve dampers and other competition upgrades.|$|E
25|$|Unique versions, {{such as the}} California 500 Specials and the 52 Hurst-modified SS/AMX drag {{race cars}} {{are perhaps the most}} highly sought after by {{collector}}s. In 2006, a California 500 AMX sold for $54,000 at the Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, Arizona, while a regular AMX went for over $55,000 at the Mecum collector auction in Belvidere, Illinois. In 2007, Hemmings wrote that only about 39 of the original SS/AMX <b>turn-key</b> race cars may have survived.|$|E
25|$|Norsk Data took a {{strategic}} decision {{to abandon their}} role as system suppler for a few, large customers and {{decided to become a}} European-wide minicomputer supplied which could compete directly with American manufacturers. Sintran III was launched as a further development of Sintran II which included Nord-TSS and introduced virtual memory, which was launched with a new generation of hardware, the Nord-10, in 1973. CERN later followed up with purchasing a Nord-10 in 1975 for their largest department. Additional orders were made {{and by the end of}} 1976 CERN were operating fifty ND computers. The delivery to CERN combined with a more efficient software portfolio with the Nord-10 were key factors in the continued growth. For instance, ND delivered a <b>turn-key</b> system for meteorology in Algeria in 1974, complete with software developed in-house. Half the company's revenue came from international sales that year.|$|E

5000|$|Waterhouse {{recorded}} his debut single in late 2010 at the Distillery Studio in Southern California. [...] "Some Place", backed with [...] "That Place" [...] was recorded with a pickup group {{billed as the}} <b>Turn-Keys,</b> featuring Ira Raibon of the Fabulous Souls playing saxophone. The initial release of [...] "Some Place" [...] in November 2010 was on Waterhouse's own PRES imprint. The single was recorded, mixed, and mastered completely analog to lacquer, plated and hand-pressed. The labels were handset letterpress printed.

50|$|In {{the lesser}} {{court of the}} Conciergerie, Debrun, Brault and others, jailers, <b>turn-keys,</b> National Guards, gendarmes and executioners, {{including}} the Chief Headsman, Sanson, are waiting to send the tumbrels containing the condemned prisoners forth to the guillotine. Brault's daughter is watering her flowers at a window. All {{are talking about the}} late events and wondering what has been done with Robespierre, some being in his favour, others against him. Labussière and Martial enter, searching for Fabienne. Labussière is known to all as a government official, and has specially recommended himself to Madame and Mademoiselle Brault (the wife and daughter of the head jailer) by giving them free tickets to the theatre. Through them a note is conveyed to Fabienne, a letter and a flower, bidding Martial an eternal farewell and telling him that the sight of her companion nuns going to prison has recalled her to her religious duty, and that they must wait to meet in heaven.|$|R
25|$|From {{the mid-1970s}} ND started serving a more {{differentiated}} customer base and was increasingly {{dependent on the}} sales force coming with feedback as to which functionality needed to be developed. Norsk Tipping {{was in the first}} years of the 1970s the first customer to apply an ND system to accounting. The software was developed and owned by ND, but Skår rejected proposals that the company should develop a portfolio of administrative software. At the time this was based on the strategy that the high profit margins were in the central parts of the hardware while independent software firms were not making money. Towards the end of the 1970s this strategy started to backfire, as hardware-oriented customers, such as universities, were pressing down prices while companies which wanted <b>turn-key</b> solutions were increasingly willing to pay full price.|$|E
25|$|The road {{across the}} span was {{originally}} two-way, plus {{there was a}} sidewalk along the south side. On January 25, 1914, the span unexpectedly opened during a windstorm, and trapped a young man on the open swing span section until the bridge operators could row out to the center span and use the <b>turn-key</b> to put the span back into proper position. The state took over ownership of the span in 1938. In June 1952, the span was opened {{for the first time}} in 25 years to allow an Army Corp of Engineers vessel to pass, and the span opened for the final time in October 1960. In the 1980s the swivel became inoperable. The bridge was nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic Places about 2006. In March 2007, planned maintenance and re-painting began on the bridge, closing the bridge to traffic at times. The $2.5 million project was completed in October 2007.|$|E
