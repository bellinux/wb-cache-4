25|$|In living {{specimens}} of N. sp. {{the base of}} the leaf is petiolate in the lower 4-5 cm with the leaf edges curled upwards. When pressed they are flattened and the leaf is narrowly lanceolate as in Danser's drawing of N. mollis. The leaf-sheathing on pressed plants of N. sp. is also flattened and looks decurrent instead. Without reference to a living plant you would be none the wiser. Could <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same with Danser's N. mollis specimen? The degree of supposed leaf decurrence and the bracts on the pedicels can be explained by natural variation within the range of this species. There are enough high mountains between those that contain N. sp. (G. Lumarku, G. Murud, Meligan Range) in the northwest and N. mollis (G. Kemul) in the southeast to provide a link between the two.|$|E

And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and theirs {{is the only}} real relationship on screen." [...] The review continues, [...] "Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the Martin Scorsese of the BAFTAs: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the GDP {{of one of the}} small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that Alexander Korda award. The best Casino Royale could achieve was a gong for sound. Will <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> year that changes its fortunes?" [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who praised the previous film, disliked Quantum of Solace. He wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that [...] "James Bond is not an action hero." [...] Kate Muir wrote in The Times that [...] "The Bond franchise is 50 years old this year, and the scriptless mess of Quantum of Solace may be considered its mid-life crisis", before she went on to praise the film's successor Skyfall as a [...] "resurrection". Some writers criticised the choice of Quantum of Solace as a title.

The Library of the Fine Arts felt [...] "in classical design, anatomical drawing, elegance of attitude, fineness of form, and gracefulness of grouping, no doubt Mr. Etty has no superior", and while [...] "the representation of the ideas in the lines quoted [...] are beautifully and accurately expressed upon the canvas" [...] they considered [...] "the ulterior reference of the poet [...] was entirely lost sight of, and that, if <b>this</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> nearest that Art can approach in conveying to the eye the happy exemplification of the subject which Gray intended, we fear we must give up the contest upon the merits of poetry and painting." [...] Similar concerns were raised in The Times, which observed that it was [...] "Full of beauty, rich in colouring, boldly and accurately drawn, and composed with a most graceful fancy; but the meaning of it, if it has any meaning, no man can tell", pointing out that although it was intended to illustrate Gray it [...] "would represent almost as well any other poet's fancies." [...] The Examiner, meanwhile, took issue with the cramped and overladen boat, pointing out that the characters [...] "if not exactly jammed together like figs in a basket, are sadly constrained for want of room", and also complained that the boat would not in reality [...] "float half the weight which is made to press upon it." ...|$|E
