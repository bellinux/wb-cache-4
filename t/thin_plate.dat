25|$|When the {{internal}} carotid artery enters the canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, it first ascends a short distance, then curves anteriorly and medially. The artery lies at first {{in front of the}} cochlea and tympanic cavity; from the latter cavity it is separated by a thin, bony lamella, which is cribriform in the young subject, and often partly absorbed in old age. Farther forward it is separated from the trigeminal ganglion by a <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> of bone, which forms the floor of the fossa for the ganglion and the roof of the horizontal portion of the canal. Frequently this bony plate is more or less deficient, and then the ganglion is separated from the artery by fibrous membrane. The artery is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a prolongation of dura mater, and is surrounded by a number of small veins and by filaments of the carotid plexus, derived from the ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk.|$|E

25|$|One of Wheatstone's most ingenious devices was the 'Polar clock,' {{exhibited}} at {{the meeting of the}} British Association in 1848. It is based on the fact discovered by Sir David Brewster, that the light of the sky is polarised in a plane at an angle of ninety degrees from the position of the sun. It follows that by discovering that plane of polarisation, and measuring its azimuth with respect to the north, the position of the sun, although beneath the horizon, could be determined, and the apparent solar time obtained. The clock consisted of a spyglass, having a Nicol (double-image) prism for an eyepiece, and a <b>thin</b> <b>plate</b> of selenite for an object-glass. When the tube was directed to the North Pole—that is, parallel to the Earth's axis—and the prism of the eyepiece turned until no colour was seen, the angle of turning, as shown by an index moving with the prism over a graduated limb, gave the hour of day. The device is of little service in a country where watches are reliable; but it formed part of the equipment of the 1875–1876 North Polar expedition commanded by Captain Nares.|$|E

Yet, it provides an appealing opportunity of yielding pattern formations within a non-local variational framework- elasticity- free of significant noise disturbances.

60|$|But farther; by the 24th Observation it appears, {{that there}} is a {{constant}} relation between Colours and Refrangibility; the most refrangible Rays being violet, the least refrangible red, and those of intermediate Colours having proportionably intermediate degrees of Refrangibility. And by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Observations, compared with the 4th or 18th there appears to be the same constant relation between Colour and Reflexibility; the violet being in like circumstances reflected at least thicknesses of any <b>thin</b> <b>Plate</b> or Bubble, the red at greatest thicknesses, and the intermediate Colours at intermediate thicknesses. Whence it follows, that the colorifick Dispositions of Rays are also connate with them, and immutable; and by consequence, that all the Productions and Appearances of Colours in the World are derived, not from any physical Change caused in Light by Refraction or Reflexion, but only from the various Mixtures or Separations of Rays, by virtue of their different Refrangibility or Reflexibility. And in this respect the Science of Colours becomes a Speculation as truly mathematical as any other part of Opticks.

60|$|Obs. 7. By the Analogy of {{all these}} Phænomena {{with those of the}} like Rings of Colours {{described}} {{in the first part of}} this Book, it seemed to me that these Colours were produced by this thick Plate of Glass, much after the manner that those were produced by very thin Plates. For, upon trial, I found that if the Quick-silver were rubb'd off from the backside of the Speculum, the Glass alone would cause the same Rings of Colours, but much more faint than before; and therefore the Phænomenon depends not upon the Quick-silver, unless so far as the Quick-silver by increasing the Reflexion of the backside of the Glass increases the Light of the Rings of Colours. I found also that a Speculum of Metal without Glass made some Years since for optical uses, and very well wrought, produced none of those Rings; and thence I understood that these Rings arise not from one specular Surface alone, but depend upon the two Surfaces of the Plate of Glass whereof the Speculum was made, and upon the thickness of the Glass between them. For as in the 7th and 19th Observations of the first part of this Book a <b>thin</b> <b>Plate</b> of Air, Water, or Glass of an even thickness appeared of one Colour when the Rays were perpendicular to it, of another when they were a little oblique, of another when more oblique, of another when still more oblique, and so on; so here, in the sixth Observation, the Light which emerged out of the Glass in several Obliquities, made the Glass appear of several Colours, and being propagated in those Obliquities to the Chart, there painted Rings of those Colours. And as the reason why a <b>thin</b> <b>Plate</b> appeared of several Colours in several Obliquities of the Rays, was, that the Rays of one and the same sort are reflected by the <b>thin</b> <b>Plate</b> at one obliquity and transmitted at another, and those of other sorts transmitted where these are reflected, and reflected where these are transmitted: So the reason why the thick Plate of Glass whereof the Speculum was made did appear of various Colours in various Obliquities, and in those Obliquities propagated those Colours to the Chart, was, that the Rays of one and the same sort did at one Obliquity emerge out of the Glass, at another did not emerge, but were reflected back towards the Quick-silver by the hither Surface of the Glass, and accordingly as the Obliquity became greater and greater, emerged and were reflected alternately for many Successions; and that in one and the same Obliquity the Rays of one sort were reflected, and those of another transmitted. This is manifest by the fifth Observation of this part of this Book. For in that Observation, when the Speculum was illuminated by any one of the prismatick Colours, that Light made many Rings of the same Colour upon the Chart with dark Intervals, and therefore at its emergence out of the Speculum was alternately transmitted and not transmitted from the Speculum to the Chart for many Successions, according to the various Obliquities of its Emergence. And when the Colour cast on the Speculum by the Prism was varied, the Rings became of the Colour cast on it, and varied their bigness with their Colour, and therefore the Light was now alternately transmitted and not transmitted from the Speculum to the Chart at other Obliquities than before. It seemed to me therefore that these Rings were of one and the same original with those of thin Plates, but yet with this difference, that those of thin Plates are made by the alternate Reflexions and Transmissions of the Rays at the second Surface of the Plate, after one passage through it; but here the Rays go twice through the Plate before they are alternately reflected and transmitted. First, they go through it from the first Surface to the Quick-silver, and then return through it from the Quick-silver to the first Surface, and there are either transmitted to the Chart or reflected back to the Quick-silver, accordingly as they are in their Fits of easy Reflexion or Transmission when they arrive at that Surface. For the Intervals of the Fits of the Rays which fall perpendicularly on the Speculum, and are reflected back in the same perpendicular Lines, by reason of the equality of these Angles and Lines, are of the same length and number within the Glass after Reflexion as before, by the 19th Proposition of the third part of this Book. And therefore since all the Rays that enter through the first Surface are in their Fits of easy Transmission at their entrance, and as many of these as are reflected by the second are in their Fits of easy Reflexion there, all these must be again in their Fits of easy Transmission at their return to the first, and by consequence there go out of the Glass to the Chart, and form upon it the white Spot of Light in the center of the Rings. For the reason holds good in all sorts of Rays, and therefore all sorts must go out promiscuously to that Spot, and by their mixture cause it to be white. But the Intervals of the Fits of those Rays which are reflected more obliquely than they enter, must be greater after Reflexion than before, by the 15th and 20th Propositions. And thence it may happen that the Rays at their return to the first Surface, may in certain Obliquities be in Fits of easy Reflexion, and return back to the Quick-silver, and in other intermediate Obliquities be again in Fits of easy Transmission, and so go out to the Chart, and paint on it the Rings of Colours about the white Spot. And because the Intervals of the Fits at equal obliquities are greater and fewer in the less refrangible Rays, and less and more numerous in the more refrangible, therefore the less refrangible at equal obliquities shall make fewer Rings than the more refrangible, and the Rings made by those shall be larger than the like number of Rings made by these; that is, the red Rings shall be larger than the yellow, the yellow than the green, the green than the blue, and the blue than the violet, as they were really found to be in the fifth Observation. And therefore the first Ring of all Colours encompassing the white Spot of Light shall be red without any violet within, and yellow, and green, and blue in the middle, as it was found in the second Observation; and these Colours in the second Ring, and those that follow, shall be more expanded, till they spread into one another, and blend one another by interfering.|$|E
60|$|Obs. 8. I {{measured}} {{therefore the}} thickness of this concavo-convex Plate of Glass, and found it every where 1/4 of an Inch precisely. Now, by the sixth Observation of the first Part of this Book, a <b>thin</b> <b>Plate</b> of Air transmits the brightest Light of the first Ring, that is, the bright yellow, when its thickness is the 1/89000th part of an Inch; and by the tenth Observation of the same Part, a <b>thin</b> <b>Plate</b> of Glass transmits the same Light of the same Ring, when its thickness is less in proportion of the Sine of Refraction to the Sine of Incidence, that is, when its thickness is the 11/1513000th or 1/137545th part of an Inch, supposing the Sines are as 11 to 17. And if this thickness be doubled, it transmits the same bright Light of the second Ring; if tripled, it transmits that of the third, and so on; the bright yellow Light in all these cases being in its Fits of Transmission. And therefore if its thickness be multiplied 34386 times, so as to become 1/4 of an Inch, it transmits the same bright Light of the 34386th Ring. Suppose this be the bright yellow Light transmitted perpendicularly from the reflecting convex side of the Glass through the concave side to the white Spot {{in the center of}} the Rings of Colours on the Chart: And by a Rule in the 7th and 19th Observations in the first Part of this Book, and by the 15th and 20th Propositions of the third Part of this Book, if the Rays be made oblique to the Glass, {{the thickness of}} the Glass requisite to transmit the same bright Light of the same Ring in any obliquity, is to this thickness of 1/4 of an Inch, as the Secant of a certain Angle to the Radius, the Sine of which Angle is the first of an hundred and six arithmetical Means between the Sines of Incidence and Refraction, counted from the Sine of Incidence when the Refraction is made out of any plated Body into any Medium encompassing it; that is, in this case, out of Glass into Air. Now if the thickness of the Glass be increased by degrees, so as to bear to its first thickness, (viz. that of a quarter of an Inch,) the Proportions which 34386 (the number of Fits of the perpendicular Rays in going through the Glass towards the white Spot {{in the center of the}} Rings,) hath to 34385, 34384, 34383, and 34382, (the numbers of the Fits of the oblique Rays in going through the Glass towards the first, second, third, and fourth Rings of Colours,) and if the first thickness be divided into 100000000 equal parts, the increased thicknesses will be 100002908, 100005816, 100008725, and 100011633, and the Angles of which these thicknesses are Secants will be 26´ 13´´, 37´ 5´´, 45´ 6´´, and 52´ 26´´, the Radius being 100000000; and the Sines of these Angles are 762, 1079, 1321, and 1525, and the proportional Sines of Refraction 1172, 1659, 2031, and 2345, the Radius being 100000. For since the Sines of Incidence out of Glass into Air are to the Sines of Refraction as 11 to 17, and to the above-mentioned Secants as 11 to the first of 106 arithmetical Means between 11 and 17, that is, as 11 to 11-6/106, those Secants will be to the Sines of Refraction as 11-6/106, to 17, and by this Analogy will give these Sines. So then, if the obliquities of the Rays to the concave Surface of the Glass be such that the Sines of their Refraction in passing out of the Glass through that Surface into the Air be 1172, 1659, 2031, 2345, the bright Light of the 34386th Ring shall emerge at the thicknesses of the Glass, which are to 1/4 of an Inch as 34386 to 34385, 34384, 34383, 34382, respectively. And therefore, if the thickness in all these Cases be 1/4 of an Inch (as it is in the Glass of which the Speculum was made) the bright Light of the 34385th Ring shall emerge where the Sine of Refraction is 1172, and that of the 34384th, 34383th, and 34382th Ring where the Sine is 1659, 2031, and 2345 respectively. And in these Angles of Refraction the Light of these Rings shall be propagated from the Speculum to the Chart, and there paint Rings about the white central round Spot of Light which we said was the Light of the 34386th Ring. And the Semidiameters of these Rings shall subtend the Angles of Refraction made at the Concave-Surface of the Speculum, and by consequence their Diameters shall be to the distance of the Chart from the Speculum as those Sines of Refraction doubled are to the Radius, that is, as 1172, 1659, 2031, and 2345, doubled are to 100000. And therefore, if the distance of the Chart from the Concave-Surface of the Speculum be six Feet (as it was in the third of these Observations) the Diameters of the Rings of this bright yellow Light upon the Chart shall be 1'688, 2'389, 2'925, 3'375 Inches: For these Diameters are to six Feet, as the above-mention'd Sines doubled are to the Radius. Now, these Diameters of the bright yellow Rings, thus found by Computation are the very same with those found in the third of these Observations by measuring them, viz. with 1-11/16, 2-3/8, 2-11/12, and 3-3/8 Inches, and therefore the Theory of deriving these Rings from the thickness of the Plate of Glass of which the Speculum was made, and from the Obliquity of the emerging Rays agrees with the Observation. In this Computation I have equalled the Diameters of the bright Rings made by Light of all Colours, to the Diameters of the Rings made by the bright yellow. For this yellow makes the brightest Part of the Rings of all Colours. If you desire the Diameters of the Rings made by the Light of any other unmix'd Colour, you may find them readily by putting them to the Diameters of the bright yellow ones in a subduplicate Proportion of the Intervals of the Fits of the Rays of those Colours when equally inclined to the refracting or reflecting Surface which caused those Fits, that is, by putting the Diameters of the Rings made by the Rays in the Extremities and Limits of the seven Colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, proportional to the Cube-roots of the Numbers, 1, 8/9, 5/6, 3/4, 2/3, 3/5, 9/16, 1/2, which express the Lengths of a Monochord sounding the Notes in an Eighth: For by this means the Diameters of the Rings of these Colours will be found pretty nearly in the same Proportion to one another, which they ought to have by the fifth of these Observations.|$|E
6000|$|The Microscope, {{which for}} the most part I made use of, was shap'd [...] much like that in the sixth Figure of the first Scheme, the Tube [...] being {{for the most part}} not above six or seven inches long, though, by [...] reason it had four Drawers, it could very much be lengthened, as [...] {{occasion}} required; this was contriv'd with three Glasses; a small [...] Object Glass at A, a thinner Eye Glass about B, and a very deep one [...] about C: this I made use of only when I had occasion to see much of an [...] Object at once; the middle Glass conveying a very great company of [...] radiating Pencils, which would go another way, and throwing them upon [...] the deep Eye Glass. But when ever I had occasion to examine the small [...] parts of a Body more accurately, I took out the middle Glass, and only [...] made use of one Eye Glass with the Object Glass, for always the fewer [...] the Refractions are, the more bright and clear the Object appears. And [...] therefore 'tis not to be doubted, but could we make a Microscope to [...] have one only refraction, it would, cæteris paribus, far excel any [...] other that had a greater number. And hence it is, that if you take a [...] very clear piece of a broken Venice Glass, and in a Lamp draw it out [...] into very small hairs or threads, then holding the ends of these [...] threads in the flame, till they melt and run into a small round Globul, [...] or drop, which will hang {{at the end of the}} thread; and if further you [...] stick several of these upon the end of a stick with a little sealing [...] Wax, so as that the threads stand upwards, and then on a Whetstone [...] first grind off a good part of them, and afterward on a smooth Metal [...] plate, with a little Tripoly, rub them till they come to be very [...] smooth; if one of these be fixt with a little soft Wax against a small [...] needle hole, prick'd through a <b>thin</b> <b>Plate</b> of Brass, Lead, Pewter, or [...] any other Metal, and an Object, plac'd very near, be look'd at through [...] it, it will both magnifie and make some Objects more distinct then any [...] of the great Microscopes. But because these, though exceeding easily [...] made, are yet very troublesome to be us'd, because of their smallness, [...] and the nearness of the Object; therefore to prevent both these, and [...] yet have only two Refractions, I provided me a Tube of Brass, shap'd [...] much like that in the fourth Figure of the first Scheme; into the [...] smaller end of this I fixt with Wax a good plano convex Object Glass, [...] with the convex side towards the Object, and into the bigger end I fixt [...] also with wax a pretty large plano Convex Glass, with the convex [...] side towards my eye, then by means of the small hole by the side, I [...] fill'd the intermediate space between these two Glasses with very clear [...] Water, and with a Screw stopp'd it in; then putting on a Cell for the [...] Eye, I could perceive an Object more bright then I could when the [...] intermediate space was only fill'd with Air, but this, for other [...] inconveniences, I made but little use of.|$|E
50|$|The strip {{model is}} limited mostly to SPSWs with <b>thin</b> <b>plates</b> (low {{critical}} buckling capacity) and certain ratios. In {{the development of}} this model, no solution has been provided for a perforated SPSW, shear walls with thick steel plates and shear walls with stiffeners. The strip model concept, although appropriate for practical analysis of <b>thin</b> <b>plates,</b> is not directly applicable to other types of plates. Moreover, its implementations have yet to be incorporated in commonly used commercial computer analysis software.|$|R

The crack tip displacement and rotation fields based on the Reissner theory are calculated. These results are used to calculate the J-integral (energy release rate) for both Kirchhoff and Reissner plate theories. Invoking Simmonds and Duva's (1981) result that the value of the J-integral based on either theory is the same for <b>thin</b> <b>plates,</b> a universal relationship between the Kirchhoff theory stress intensity factors and the Reissner theory stress intensity factors is obtained for <b>thin</b> <b>plates.</b> Calculation of Kirchhoff theory stress intensity factors from finite elements based on energy release rate is illustrated. It is proposed that, for <b>thin</b> <b>plates,</b> fracture toughness and crack growth rates be correlated with the Kirchhoff theory stress intensity factors...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{a study of}} two types of piezoelectric materials, namely linearly <b>thin</b> <b>plates</b> and slender rods. For mathematical modeling of <b>thin</b> piezoelectric <b>plates</b> a key-point in developing a rigorous model is to consider {{the thickness of the}} piezoelectric plate as a parameter. The rigorous model is then derived by using functional analysis to study the limit behavior when the thickness parameter goes to zero, so that the <b>thinner</b> the <b>plate</b> the sharper the model. This thesis consists in, first, studying an already published mathematical modeling of <b>thin</b> piezoelectric <b>plates</b> and next, in extending it to the case of thin piezoelectric rods. The study is confined to general linearly piezoelectric structures submitted to static electromechanical loadings...|$|R
