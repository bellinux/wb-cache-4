40|$|The {{municipality}} of Saint-Gilles in central Brussels is {{known locally as}} a ‘village within the city’ and a ‘refuge’ welcoming artists of all sorts. This reputation is linked with long-lasting historic {{factors such as the}} location of art schools, art galleries, recycled spaces, and low rents, which have been responsible for attracting generations of artists and various cultural enterprises. Moreover, during the last 30 years, local authorities have been nurturing an artistic image to brand the municipality and to attract new middle-class inhabitants. Henceforth, the presence of artists has been part of a broad regeneration plan that has gradually turned poor and multiethnic neighbourhoods into trendy spaces to go out or to live in. Looking at this small municipality reveals some of the practical and symbolic factors influencing the location of artists within the city. Since 1988, the organisation of a well-known artistic biennial event (‘Parcours d’artistes’) questions the role that artists play in the redevelopment of these neighbourhoods, as well as their probable instrumentalisation in gentrification policies.
