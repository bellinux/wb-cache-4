500|$|The season {{aired on}} Nickelodeon, {{which is owned}} by Viacom, and was {{produced}} by United Plankton Pictures and Nickelodeon. The season's executive producer was series creator Stephen Hillenburg, who also functioned as the series' showrunner. During production of the previous season, Nickelodeon picked up a second season for SpongeBob SquarePants on August 31, 1999. The season premiered more than a year later, on October 26, 2000. Season production assistant and then-staff writer Derek Iversen commented, [...] "We hoped it would go one season. We hoped it would go two seasons. I figured you do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and you hope." ...|$|E
500|$|Crew {{members have}} also reacted {{positively}} towards the episode. Carter {{said of the}} episode: The Erlenmeyer Flask' brings back nothing but good memories. It just has terrific images in it; it really brought the series {{in its first year}} full circle. It was successful in doing what we wanted to do, which was to close down the X-Files. It shocked a lot of people". Goodwin commented: [...] "Everything about that episode is absolutely first class. The acting, the art direction, the camera work. There's nothing in it that isn't <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get, and that's really a credit to a lot of very talented people". The episode introduced many concepts and themes that would appear in the mythology episodes for the show throughout the years including genetic experiments, alien-human hybrids, toxic alien blood, government conspiracies, alien fetuses and deadly assassins.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{described}} the album as a [...] "fine balancing act" [...] of [...] "emo-edged" [...] tracks and [...] "wallop-packed rockers." [...] Steve Hochman of The Los Angeles Times commented that [...] "Those graduating from teen tastes could well turn to this album {{as a first}} step to adulthood." [...] Aaron Scott of Slant Magazine praised the maturity the band showed through the album, noting that it had the capability to attract a wide-ranging audience. Rolling Stone reviewer Barry Walters stated that [...] "Bleed American sports the tender turbulence that insular emo kids have been enjoying in private for years," [...] with the album appealing to fans of Creed and Blink-182 as well as new wave music. Blender gave the album a mixed review, saying that the album's mainstream potential was [...] "undercut by guitars, which are neither as gleefully blaring as Weezer’s nor as cleanly melodic as the Knack’s." [...] Writing for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau stated [...] "if this band can't be maturity's answer to 'N Sync, it can be patriotism's answer to Travis." [...] Pitchfork, however, gave a much more negative and sarcastic review of the album. Reviewer Ryan Schreiber ended his review with [...] "So do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> <b>can,</b> listen to your favorite band, bury your head in the sand, before it all begins again. Hey, I just wrote a Jimmy Eat World song!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Yorke wrote many of Kid As lyrics {{by cutting}} up {{words and phrases}} and {{assembling}} them at random. Many were everyday cliches and banal observations, such as [...] "Where'd you park the car?"; others are violent ("cut the kids in half"). The chorus lyric of [...] "How to Disappear Completely" [...] was inspired by Yorke's friend Michael Stipe of R.E.M., who advised Yorke to relieve tour stress by repeating to himself: [...] "I'm not here, this isn't happening". Another line came from a dream Yorke had {{in which he was}} running down the River Liffey. The chorus lyric of [...] "Optimistic" [...] ("try <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> / <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> is good enough") was an assurance by Yorke's partner, Rachel Owen, when he felt that [...] "nothing we'd done was releasable". Radiohead used Yorke's lyrics [...] "like pieces in a collage, pierced something together and [...] an artwork out of a lot of different little things". They did not publish Kid As lyrics in the liner notes, as they felt they could not be considered independently of the music.|$|E

[...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} for a moment that I am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game.
