40|$|Oryctes agamemnon arabicus was an {{exogenous}} species accidentally {{introduced in}} the oases of Mrah Lahouar from Tozeur on 1980 ’s and officially reported in southwest Tunisia on 1995. This pest closely associated to date palm was spread in some oases of southwest Tunisia, covering actually 3310 ha. The preferred development sites are standing living palm trees. Different parts of the plant are subject of the attack of this pest such as respiratory roots, external components of the stem and the oldest basal green palms of the crown. The attacked site contains often different stages of the cycle of the insect like mating, oviposition, larval feeding, pupation and adult emergence. In some cases, beetles are attracted <b>to</b> <b>heap</b> <b>manure,</b> when it exists inside oases, buried on the soil as compost. The life cycle of immature stages, from egg to adult emergence, under natural conditions still on average 319 days and is dominated by larval development which represent 89. 6 % of the total cycle. Consequently, larvae constituted the harmful stages of the species. Females prefer to deposit their eggs in friable material inside hidden sites of the palm tree. The mean registered fecundity of 43 females is 26. 62 eggs/female. The female lies eggs separately leaving a space between each other and prefers to change the oviposition site often before finishing egg stock. The threat of O. agamemnon arabicus consists on the attack of respiratory roots. In fact, {{after many years of}} successive attacks of these roots by several generations, the larval tunnels interpenetrate and evolve on a large hole which weaken the basal support of the plant and lead to its sudden collapse by winds...|$|E
5000|$|... 3. Tackling the farmers. Surprising to us now, {{in those}} days the farmers were {{something}} of an obstacle to progress. They had not yet caught on to the advances made by Justus von Liebig in Germany, who began to apply chemistry {{to the needs of}} agriculture. Despite this, Henslow pressed on with ideas about field experiments which would try out various fertilisers and measure the resulting product. Questions such as [...] "Should gypsum be added <b>to</b> <b>manure</b> <b>heaps</b> <b>to</b> fix the ammonia?" [...] were proposed, no doubt to much muttering sotto voce, and head-shaking from the farmers. It is only fair to add that Henslow did eventually get a good deal of help and acceptance for his ideas.|$|R
40|$|Six agro-organic wastes were {{evaluated}} {{for their ability}} to reduce N losses from cattle manure during storage. The materials were selected based on their low pH, high C: N ratios or high cation exchange capacity. They included; filter mud (FM), sawdust (SD), a common by-product of the timber industry, maize stover (MS), wood ash (WA), Ondiri peat (OP), and coffee pulp (CP), a waste product from coffee factories. Manure samples equivalent to 40 g (dry weight basis) were combined with 20 % of each of the amendments and placed in 500 ml elernmeyer flasks. Volatilization of ammonia was determined using a laboratory gas train simulator and volatilized NH 3 was collected in 100 ml of 2 % boric acid and determined by titration with 0. 01 M H 2 SO 4. Mixing organic amendments with manure significantly reduced NH 3 losses relative <b>to</b> non-amended <b>manure</b> <b>heaps</b> with the exception where wood ash was added. The total N content of the untreated manure prior to incubation was 17. 11 g N kg- 1 and after 51 days declined to 9. 36 g N kg- 1 which translated to a 43 % loss from the initial levels. The cumulative NH 3 losses ranged between 7. 6 % to 78. 7 % of the initial N, {{depending on the type of}} amendment. The N losses were positively correlated (r 2 = 0. 855) to the initial pH of the amended manures. Addition of sawdust, resulted in least mass and carbon loss and the original mixture was unchanged showing that minimal decomposition had occurred...|$|R

40|$|Several manure use {{options were}} {{analysed}} for profitability using results from research and farmer participatory trials that {{were conducted in}} the small-scale farming sector in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The options analysed for profitability were a) not using any manure b) using aerobically composted (<b>heap</b> stored) <b>manure,</b> c) using manure improved through anaerobic storage (pit-stored), d) different manure application methods i. e. banding, broadcasting and station placement {{and the use of}} manure in combination with inorganic fertiliser. The use of manure provided a marginal rate of return (MRR) of at least 600 % compared to not using manure. The marginal rate of return on manure use was increased significantly by composting manure in pits. Financial benefits obtained from pit- stored manure were much higher {{in the first year of}} manure application compared to those of heap- stored manure. Higher returns from heap- stored manure were obtained in the second and third season after manure application. Overall undiscounted financial benefits for the three years were marginally higher for heap- stored manure. Using a discount rate of 100 % financial benefits from using pit-stored manure were much higher than those of <b>heap</b> stored <b>manure</b> as pit-stored manure provided much higher returns in the first year of application. Higher financial benefits were obtained from supplementing manure with inorganic fertiliser compared to using manure alone. Banding and placing manure on-station (applying the manure to the hill of maize) increased returns from using both pit and <b>heap</b> stored <b>manure.</b> The conventional practice of broadcasting manure was found not to be profitable.

40|$|Separation of slurry {{produces}} a solid fraction that {{is stored in}} <b>manure</b> <b>heaps</b> before {{being used as a}} fertiliser in crop production. Considerable amounts of ammonia (NH 3) and greenhouse gases may be emitted during storage, which has deleterious environmental effects. The emission levels can be expected to depend on oxygenation level inside the bulk of the stored manure and therefore on storage conditions. An experiment was thus set up to study gaseous emissions during storage of the solid fraction, and the effects of the oxygenation of <b>manure</b> <b>heaps</b> on emissions of NH 3 and various greenhouse gases. Emissions of NH 3 and the greenhouse gases methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from an uncovered and covered heap of solids separated from pig slurry were compared, and related to the oxygenation level inside the <b>manure</b> <b>heap.</b> Approximately 15 % of the initial nitrogen content was lost when separated solids were stored uncovered. Of the initial nitrogen content, 4. 8 % was lost as N 2 O, 0. 3 % was lost as NH 3, while the 9. 6 % unaccounted for was assumed lost as dinitrogen (N 2). Of the initial carbon content, 28 % was lost during uncovered storage; the majority of this was emitted as CO 2 (25 %), while 1. 3 % was emitted as CH 4. Oxygenation level inside the <b>heap</b> was found <b>to</b> influence the production and emission of greenhouse gases. Covering the heap with an airtight material delayed aeration of the bulk of the stored manure, which reduced the internal heat production, degradation of organic matter, and emission of NH 3 and greenhouse gases. Emissions of NH 3, N 2 O, and CH 4 were reduced by 12, 99, and 88 %, respectively, when the <b>manure</b> <b>heap</b> was covered with an airtight material...|$|R
