50|$|Wraps are a {{class of}} trick in which the poi are wrapped around something, most {{typically}} part of the body, to change the path or direction of spin. There {{are two types of}} wrap - basic or recoil wraps wrap around the target and then bounce off so that the poi ends up spinning in the opposite direction to which it started from, and thru-wraps which wrap around a moving body part so that the direction stays the same but the poi changes the path it is travelling along. Basic and recoil wrap sequences can be generated in infinite variety by <b>tracing</b> <b>line</b> paths with the hand between multiple points on the body and matching poi head direction as the hand travels back and forth along the line. Typical targets for a wrap are the arms and legs, although any body part is suitable - one of the more dangerous places to perform wraps is around the neck. These are among the most dangerous fire poi tricks as the poi can come into contact with the body or become entangled round the body; double neck thru-wraps are perhaps the most dangerous move that can be done with fire poi due to the risk of the poi tangling.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for generating the nofit polygon (NFP) that is simple, intuitive and computationally efficient. The NFP has in recent years become an important tool for handling the geometric calculations for two-dimensional irregular shape nesting problems. Its value lies in reducing the computational complexity of detecting whether two polygons overlap. The proposed NFP generator {{is based on the}} novel concept of <b>trace</b> <b>line</b> segments that are derived from the interaction of the two-component polygons. The complete set of the <b>trace</b> <b>line</b> segments contain all the boundary edges of the NFP and some internal points that need to be discarded. Algorithms for deriving the <b>trace</b> <b>line</b> segments, efficiently determining those segments that form the boundary of the NFP and the identification of holes and degenerate cases are describe...|$|R
50|$|<b>Trace</b> <b>lines</b> {{are stored}} in the trace cache based on the program counter of the first {{instruction}} in the trace {{and a set of}} branch predictions. This allows for storing different trace paths that start on the same address, each representing different branch outcomes. This method of tagging helps to provide path associativity to the trace cache. Other method can include having only starting PC as tag in trace cache. In the instruction fetch stage of a pipeline, the current program counter along with a set of branch predictions is checked in the trace cache for a hit. If there is a hit, a <b>trace</b> <b>line</b> is supplied to fetch unit which does not {{have to go to a}} regular cache or to memory for these instructions. The trace cache continues to feed the fetch unit until the <b>trace</b> <b>line</b> ends or until there is a misprediction in the pipeline. If there is a miss, a new trace starts to be built.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an automated and effective method for detecting 3 D edges and <b>tracing</b> feature <b>lines</b> from 3 D-point clouds. This method is named Analysis of Geometric Properties of Neighborhoods (AGPN), {{and it includes}} two main steps: edge detection and feature <b>line</b> <b>tracing.</b> In the edge detection step, AGPN analyzes geometric properties of each query point’s neighborhood, and then combines RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) and angular gap metric to detect edges. In the feature <b>line</b> <b>tracing</b> step, feature <b>lines</b> are <b>traced</b> by a hybrid method based on region growing and model fitting in the detected edges. Our approach is experimentally validated on complex man-made objects and large-scale urban scenes with millions of points. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that our method obtains a promising, reliable, and high performance in detecting edges and <b>tracing</b> feature <b>lines</b> in 3 D-point clouds. Moreover, AGPN is insensitive to the point density of the input data...|$|R

50|$|Direct tracings of the {{vibrations}} of sound-producing {{objects such as}} tuning forks {{had been made by}} English physician Thomas Young in 1807, but the first known device for recording airborne speech, music and other sounds is the phonautograph, patented in 1857 by French typesetter and inventor Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. In this device, sound waves travelling through the air vibrated a parchment diaphragm which was linked to a bristle, and the bristle <b>traced</b> a <b>line</b> through a thin coating of soot on a sheet of paper wrapped around a rotating cylinder. The sound vibrations were recorded as undulations or other irregularities in the <b>traced</b> <b>line.</b> Scott's phonautograph was intended purely for the visual study and analysis of the tracings. Reproduction of the recorded sound was not possible with the original phonautograph.|$|R
