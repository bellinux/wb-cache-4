Southern Rhodesian Prime Ministers thereafter became a regular fixture at such meetings and, from 1944, at Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences.|$|E

5|$|Hobbs {{returned}} to cricket in 1922 and batted effectively throughout {{the first months}} of the season, scoring 10 first-class centuries in total. One of the centuries came in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, in which he captained the Players team for the first time. Towards the end of the season, his form faded owing to the lingering effects of his illness and operation the previous year. Wisden observed that he frequently tired during longer innings and often tried to get out soon after reaching three figures; this habit of giving up his innings continued throughout the remainder of his career. The season also marked a turning point in his batting approach where he preferred to score more slowly and take fewer risks, in contrast to his adventurous pre-war tactics. Second in the national batting averages for 1922, he scored 2,552 runs at an average of 62.24, but declined an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC. Less successful during the wet 1923 season, Hobbs failed on many occasions and was unsuccessful in both Gentlemen v Players games. He was still struggling with the after-effects of his operation and Wisden noticed he once more tried to score too quickly early in an innings. However, against Somerset, he scored the 100th century of his first-class career, <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>man</b> to reach the landmark after W. G. Grace and Hayward. Overall in the season, he scored 2,087 runs at 37.95.|$|E

5|$|Scholar Andrew Spicer {{argues that}} British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism {{than to the}} expressionistic American mode of noir. Examples of British noir from the classic period include Brighton Rock (1947), {{directed}} by John Boulting; They Made Me a Fugitive (1947), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti; The Small Back Room (1948), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; The October Man (1950), directed by Roy Ward Baker; and Cast a Dark Shadow (1955), directed by Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including The Last Page (a.k.a. Man Bait; 1952), Stolen Face (1952), and Murder by Proxy (a.k.a. Blackout; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: Night and the City (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors—Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney—it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox's British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed's <b>The</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Man</b> (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in Citizen Kane.|$|E

5|$|The 2013 season {{continued}} in similar fashion, with Djokovic, Federer and Murray occupying {{three of the}} four semifinal slots at the Australian Open, with Nadal still suffering from injury. Murray beat Federer in a five-set epic in the semifinal meaning all four members of the Big Four had beaten each other at least once in a Grand Slam event, subsequently losing to Djokovic in the final in four sets. As a result, Djokovic became <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>man</b> to win four Australian Open titles and the first to win three consecutively in the Modern Era; and Murray himself became the first man to reach the final of the next Grand Slam event after winning his maiden title. Nadal returned for the clay-court season, winning events in Sao Paulo, Mexico, Barcelona, Madrid and Rome before becoming the only male player to win a Grand Slam tournament eight times by winning Roland Garros, defeating Djokovic in the semifinals. However, Djokovic did end Nadal's eight-year winning streak at the Monte-Carlo Masters. Murray's clay-court season ended prematurely because of a back injury and did not compete at the French Open, whereas Federer lost in the quarterfinals after making the final in Rome. Nadal and Federer lost early at Wimbledon in the first and second round respectively, thus ending Federer's 36 consecutive Grand Slam tournament quarter final appearance record. Murray defeated Djokovic in the final to become the first British man to win the tournament in 77 years, extending his winning streak on grass to 18 matches. Leading up to the U.S. Open, Nadal won ATP Masters 1000 events in Montreal and Cincinnati, his third hardcourt ATP Masters 1000 event of the year after winning at Indian Wells earlier in the year, extending his winning streak to 15–0 in hardcourts for the year. He went onto win the U.S. Open, defeating Djokovic in the final in four sets. While Murray and Federer lost in the quarterfinals and fourth round respectively.|$|E
