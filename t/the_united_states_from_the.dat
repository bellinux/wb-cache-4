5|$|NWA/WCW United States Tag Team Championship reigns were {{determined}} by professional wrestling matches, in which competitors are involved in scripted rivalries.

5|$|With {{the economy}} {{so focused on}} one crop, Mobile's {{fortunes}} were always tied to those of cotton, and the city weathered many financial crises.

The last slaves to enter <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> African trade were brought to Mobile on the slave ship Clotilde. Among them was Cudjoe Lewis, who in the 1920s was the last survivor of the slave trade.|$|E

5|$|Players {{choose an}} 18th-century faction {{and set out}} to achieve {{domination}} over the known world through military force, diplomacy, espionage and economics. The interface and play are similar to earlier Total War titles: although the campaign element of the game is turn-based, players can direct battles in real-time. Empire: Total War is the first game in the series to allow naval battles to be conducted in real-time. In addition to the standard campaign mode, a special campaign follows the development of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> settlement of Jamestown to the American War of Independence. Players may also recreate several historical battles from the early modern era, such as the Battle of Fontenoy, Battle of Rossbach, Battle of Brandywine Creek and Battle of Lagos.|$|E
