Annie was sentenced to one year in the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Framingham. Because of health issues, she was soon paroled.

40|$|International audienceIreland ran a {{conventional}} test and slaughter Bovine Tuberculosis eradication programme from 1954 until 1988. This programme fulfilled our trading requirements {{but failed to}} eradicate TB. At this point a major initiative, ERAD, was launched targeted with reducing the disease levels by half within a four-year period and devising the strategy and supports necessary to achieve final eradication. The lessons learned at that <b>time</b> <b>have</b> <b>informed</b> Ireland's eradication programme ever since. Eradication was not possible without developing solutions to address the wildlife disease reservoir and other identified constraints. Since 1992 the programme objectives have been restated. It is now effectively an interim control programme where significant resources have been invested {{in research and development}} aimed at overcoming the identified constraints to eradication.
