40|$|To {{examine the}} {{development}} of <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> callosity thickness and roughness in early lactation and to quantify cow factors of interest, a system to classify <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> condition was developed. A distinction was made between rough and smooth rings around the teat orifice. In addition, a classification {{of the degree of}} callosity was developed. Kappa coefficients for the repeatability of scoring by this classification system by different workers were 0. 71 for <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> callosity thickness and 0. 86 for <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> callosity roughness. The <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> callosity classification system was used for a longitudinal study with 40 cows during the first 14 wk of lactation. Models were built to predict <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> callosity thickness and roughness, machine-on time, and milk yield. For the response variables, <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> callosity thickness, machine-on time, and milk yield, the consecutive measurements appeared to follow a lactation curve model with a subject-specific general slope and intercept. <b>Teat</b> <b>end</b> callosity increased rapidly the first 8 wk. Cow factors such as days in milk, parity, machine-on time, and <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> shape were associated with the degree of <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> callosity, and the probability of the callosity ring to become rough. <b>Teat</b> <b>end</b> callosity thickness did not decrease within the 14 -wk trial period for most teats. Pointed or round teat ends showed more callus than inverted teat ends. Longer machine-on time resulted in a higher probability of the callosity ring to become rough. Rear teats showed less callosity than front teats in this study. LR: 20031114; PUBM: Print; JID: 2985126 R; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|E

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study in 15 herds, {{with a total}} of 2157 cows, was conducted {{to examine the relationship between}} teat-end callosity (TEC) and the incidence of clinical mastitis. During the 1. 5 -yr study period, clinical mastitis was diagnosed by the farmers based on clinical signs. Teat-end callosity was scored every month according to a teat-end callosity classification system, which discriminates between teat-end callosity thickness (TECT) and roughness (TECR). Differences in TECT between healthy and clinical mastitis quarters within infected cows were small but significant 3 mo before (0. 13 higher), in the month during which the clinical mastitis occurred (0. 08 higher), and in the following 2 mo (0. 06 and 0. 05 higher). To compare TECT and TECR between cows with and without clinical mastitis, 199 cows with clinical mastitis were paired with control cows based on herd, days in milk, and parity. Clinical mastitis cows had more TEC than their healthy herd mates, particularly when clinical mastitis occurred between the second and fifth months of lactation. Clinical Escherichia coli mastitis in the second or third month of lactation occurred in cows with less TEC than in cows with clinical mastitis caused by other pathogens. Clinical culture-negative, yeast, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter aerogenes mastitis cows had more TECT and TECR than other cows with clinical mastitis in the same month of lactation.

The objectives of this study were: (1) to investigate the correlated responses in milk flow, udder and teat measurements to selecting sires for high and average milk production, (2) to find estimates of heritability and repeatability of these measurements, (3) to examine their relationship with udder health and milk production, and (4) to investigate the relationship of teat-end classification with udder health, lactation milk yield, and milk flow. The realized differences in milk production due to selection adjusted for the year of calving were 1275 lb. for foundation cows, and 2525, 2637, and 2843 lb. for progeny of high minus average sires in generations one, two, and three, respectively;Progeny of high sires had a significantly higher average rate of milk flow, and maximum rate than progeny of average sires in generation one; higher initial rate, 2 -min milk, average rate, and maximum rate in generation two; and higher 2 -min milk, average rate, and maximum rate in generation three. Cows, lactations, and year-seasons had significant effects on measurements of milk flow. Estimates of repeatability for measurements of milk flow ranged from. 22 -. 47 and estimates of heritability ranged from. 13 -. 26. Phenotypic correlations indicated that high yielders had faster rates of milk flow and higher incidences of mastitis;Selection for higher milk yield caused udders {{to be closer to}} the ground, closer to the hock, and to have greater distances between teats pre- and postmilking.

One tool that has helped find this extra time without sacrificing good parlor performance has been the information and reports obtained from in-line milk meters and management software. Determining Parlor Efficiency The goals for parlor efficiency could be described as follows: · Have cows enter the parlor and occupy stalls calmly yet quickly. · Have the milker begin an excellent udder prep routine within 60 seconds of cow entry.

Methods Four different stall surfaces (no bedding, cacao bean husk, sawdust, and chopped wheat straw) were each continuously tested for a period of 1 week to determine their effects on nine lactating Holstein cows housed in the free-stall barn with rubber matting. The lying time and the milk yield were measured between d 4 and d 7. Blood samples for plasma cortisol concentration and teat swabs for bacterial counts were obtained prior to morning milking on d 7. The time-averaged gas-phase ammonia concentrations in the barn were measured between d 2 and d 7. Results The cows spent approximately 2 h more per day lying in the stalls when bedding was available than without bedding. The milk yield increased in the experimental periods when cows had access to bedding materials as compared to the period without bedding. The lying time was positively correlated with the milk yield. Bacterial counts on the <b>teat</b> <b>ends</b> recorded for cows housed on cacao bean husk were significantly lower than those recorded for cows housed without bedding.

In a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design, Holstein-Friesian heifers (n = 100) of low or high genetic merit for milk production, milked 2 or 3 times a day, and fed a mixed ration with low or high energy content, were compared during the first 14 wk of lactation. Milk composition and cell counts were determined weekly; quarter milk samples for bacteriology were taken in wk 2, 8, and 14; and teat condition was scored in wk 2, 6, 10, and 14 during the experiment. The experimental factors resulted in substantial differences in milk production between treatment groups (24. 1 for low vs. 25. 6 kg/d for high genetic merit; 23. 3 for 2 times vs. 26. 5 kg/d for 3 times daily milking; and 20. 9 for low-energy ration vs. 29. 0 kg/d for high-energy ration). Ration composition was the most important determining factor for milk production, but did not affect cell counts or intramammary bacterial infections, although cows that received low-energy rations had rougher <b>teat</b> <b>ends</b> than cows receiving high-energy rations. This indicates that high production itself is not a major risk factor for udder health in the first lactation. A higher milking frequency impaired teat condition and improved cell counts in general, but did not clearly influence bacteriological status. High genetic merit was related to higher cell count, more Staphylococcus, and less Bacillus and other environmental pathogens in cultures and did not affect teat condition. The effects of milking frequency and feeding on udder health were similar for cows with high and low genetic merit. Genetic selection on milk production, without taking udder health into account, reduces udder health. As a result, maintaining udder health will require increasing the skills and time of dairy farmers who have to divide their attention to more cows when farm sizes increase, or selection should put more emphasis on udder health traits...|$|R
40|$|Mastitis {{research}} has shown that 40 - 50 % of intramammary infections (IMI) are contracted during the dry or non-lactating period with the greatest percentages of these occurring during the first and last two weeks of the dry period. The ability to develop and apply external persistent barrier teat dip products (like a liquid bandage) that can persist for these 1 week periods could decrease IMI, thus improving animal health and performance, and product quality and safety. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate 2 new prototype persistent barrier dry cow teat dips compared to a commercially available dry cow barrier teat dip, with particular interest and comparisons of dip persistency in providing <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> protection, and overall <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> and skin health. Cows dipped with commercial T-Hexx dip had significantly greater persistency and protection compared to experimental dips A (2323 - 124 - 01) and B (2323 - 125 - 01). Experimental dips were easy to apply (as was control dip). Problems with experimental dips are they crack, shed, and rip more easily and thus come off. It seems to rub and shred on the <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> also even though dip may remain on the side or barrel of the teat. Believe this has to do with the consistency or thickness of the film and its tensile strength...|$|E

40|$|Objective of {{this study}} was to compares a 0. 5 % iodine aqueous teat dip vs 0. 5 % {{chlorhexidine}} gluconate powdered teat dip under winter conditions on overall <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> and teat skin condition and health. Under the conditions of this trial there were slight non-significant decreases in <b>teat</b> <b>end</b> condition associated with colder temperatures and temperature changes in both groups, with no differences between groups in TE change. Both groups saw some decreases in teat skin condition with powder dipped teats showing a 2 fold increased hazard of dry teat skin. Results of this trial show teat changes (skin and end condition) associated with cold temperature changes even under ideal (minimal wind) housing and different teat dips. Producers need to realize changes will occur, assess their own farm condition (housing, weather, wind) and be judicious in determining conditions requiring switches to winter dip products and practices...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to identify risk factors for intramammary infections with Streptococcus uberis and Staphylococcus aureus under field conditions. An 18 -mo survey with sampling of all quarters of all lactating cows at 3 -wk intervals was carried out in three Dutch dairy herds with medium bulk milk somatic cell count (200, 000 to 300, 000 cells/ml). Quarter milk samples were used for bacteriology and somatic cell counting. Data on parity, lactation stage, and bovine herpesvirus 4 -serology were recorded for each animal. During the last year of the study, body condition score, and teat-end callosity scores were recorded at 3 -wk intervals. A total of 93 new infections with Strep. uberis were detected in 22, 665 observations on quarters at risk for Strep. uberis infection, and 100 new infections with Staph. aureus were detected in 22, 593 observations on quarters at risk for Staph. aureus infection. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis with clustering at herd and cow level was used to identify risk factors for infection. Rate of infection with Strep. uberis was lower in first- and second-parity cows than in older cows, and depended on stage of lactation in one herd. Quarters that were infected with Arcanobacterium pyogenes or enterococci, quarters that had recovered from Strep. uberis- or Staph. aureus-infection in the past, and quarters that were exposed to another Strep. uberis infected quarter in the same cow had a higher rate of Strep. uberis infection. Teat-end callosity and infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci or corynebacteria were not significant as risk factors. Rate of Staph. aureus infection was higher in bovine herpesvirus 4 -seropositive cows, in right quarters, in quarters that had recovered from Staph. aureus or Strep. uberis infection, in quarters exposed to other Staph. aureus infected quarters in the same cow, and in quarters with extremely callused <b>teat</b> <b>ends.</b> Infection with coagulase-negative staphylococci was not significant as a risk factor. The effect of infection with corynebacteria on rate of infection with Staph. aureus depended on herd, stage of lactation, and teat-end roughness. Herd level prevalence of Strep. uberis or Staph. aureus, and low quarter milk somatic cell count were not associated with an increased rate of infection for Strep. uberis or Staph. aureus...|$|R

40|$|Six farms using {{different}} types of dried manure solid (DMS) strategies, including a farm that had side-by- side pens using sand and DMS, participated in a study {{to assess the impact}} on herd health of using DMS as bedding on dairy farms in the Northeast. Samples of unused and used bedding were taken {{over the course of a}} year and analyzed for bacterial content and physical properties. Mastitis and somatic cell count (SCC) records were analyzed in relation to those properties. Sand bedding started out “cleaner” than DMS bedding, but once in the stalls, the bacterial load of several organisms was highest in sand. In addition, DMS with the least bacterial numbers in the unused tended to have the highest bacterial numbers in the used bedding. A comparison of bacterial concentrations in unused and used air-dried DMS versus composted DMS did not show composted to be consistently lower and calls into question the value of composting DMS prior to bedding. Bacteria in the unused bedding had little to no effect on bacteria in the used indicating that bacterial levels in used bedding are more dependent on bacterial levels in the manure of the cows using the stalls and how well the stalls are scraped, rather than the cleanliness of the bedding before it is place in the stalls. Levels of Streptococcus, Klebsiella and gram negative and positive bacteria were significantly higher on the <b>teat</b> <b>ends</b> of cows bedded on DMS versus those bedded on sand, but SCC and mastitis for those cows did not differ between bedding materials. Although mastitis differed among farm/bedding strategies, bacteria levels and properties of bedding had no effect on mastitis incidence. Lactation number, stage of lactation and SCC were the significant variables. Decreased levels of Klebsiella in the used bedding increased the odds of having an abnormal SCC for one FBS, and decreased moisture and fine particles in the used bedding increased the odds of having an abnormal SCC for a different FBS. For all others, abnormal cell counts were affected only by season, lactation number and milk production. Concern that continued use of DMS will increase SCC was not borne out using linear regression of 10 years worth of linear score data. Although 2 of 6 farms showed an increase in linear score while using DMS, it was not different from the change in linear score prior to using DMS. Lameness was higher in cows bedded on sand compared to DMS. Economic analysis a savings of between 1 and 26 cents per hundred weight of milk produced through the use of manure solids as bedding on five farms. This study suggests that properly managed DMS can provide an economic benefit without compromising herd health. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authorit...|$|R
