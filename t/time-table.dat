Thanks to a carefully planned <b>time-table,</b> the effects of wear and tear had been kept to a minimum. Captain Parker described the march discipline – [...] "As we marched through the country of our Allies, commissars were appointed to furnish us with all manner of necessaries for man and horse ... the soldiers {{had nothing to do}} but pitch their tents, boil kettles and lie down to rest." [...] In response to Marlborough's manoeuvres, the Elector and Marsin, conscious of their numerical disadvantage with only 40,000 men, moved their forces to the entrenched camp at Dillingen on the north bank of the Danube. Marlborough could not attack Dillingen {{because of a lack of}} siege guns – he was unable to bring any from the Low Countries, and Baden had failed to supply any despite assurances to the contrary.|$|E

In the afternoon a further advance down the ridge was to be made. The attack was to be conducted by three corps of the Second Army (General Sir Herbert Plumer): II Anzac Corps in the south-east was to advance , IX Corps in the centre was to attack on a [...] front, which would taper to [...] at the summit and X Corps in the north had an attack front of [...] The corps planned their attacks {{under the supervision of the}} army commander, using as guides, the analyses of the Somme operations of 1916 and successful features of the attack at Arras on 9 April. Great care was taken in the planning of counter-battery fire, the artillery barrage <b>time-table</b> and machine-gun barrages.|$|E
500|$|Large {{numbers of}} posts from which machine-guns were to fire an {{overhead}} barrage were built and protective pits were dug for mules, which were to carry loads of [...] {{rounds of ammunition}} to advanced troops. Three field companies of engineers with a pioneer battalion were kept in reserve, to follow up the attacking infantry and rebuild roads and work on defensive positions as ground was consolidated. The artillery {{in support of the}} division devised a creeping and standing barrage plan and <b>time-table,</b> tailored to the estimated rates of advance of the infantry units. The standing barrage lifts were to keep all trenches within [...] of the infantry under continuous fire and targets fired on by [...] howitzer, [...] howitzer and [...] howitzers were to change from them only when infantry got within [...] The 18-pounder field gun standing barrages would then jump over the creeping barrages, to the next series of objectives. The concealed guns of the Guards Division field artillery were to join the creeping barrage for the advance at [...] and at [...] the 112th Army Field Brigade was to advance to the old front line, to be ready for an anticipated German counter-attack by [...]|$|E

There is a wide variety of <b>time-tabling</b> problems one of which is known as university <b>time-tabling.</b> In this kind of problem, {{there are a lot of}} university courses requiring scheduling while avoiding overlap in any particular term.

2500|$|The {{infantry}} advance {{was to be}} {{assisted by}} a heavy artillery barrage which was to fall successively on German defensive lines and a field artillery barrage which was to creep forward. The short lifts of the creeping barrage, were to reach points registered beforehand, so that the advance of the barrage would fall on each length of trench obstructing the advance, each battery firing along a lane. Barrage lifts were determined by a <b>time-table,</b> {{based on the assumption}} that delays in the infantry advance, to wait for the barrage to move on were preferable to the risk of it moving too fast and allowing German troops time to emerge from shelters and engage the infantry with small-arms fire. The British infantry were to keep as close to the creeping barrage as possible and six artillery lifts were synchronised with the stages of the infantry advance. The 9th Division in corps reserve, was to move forward to sheltered localities about [...] behind the old front line.|$|E
