25|$|Despite these varying viewpoints, the Swedish-speaking {{population}} in Finland in general {{have their own}} identity distinct {{from that of the}} majority, and they wish to be recognized as such. In speaking Swedish, Swedish-speaking Finns predominantly use the Swedish word finländare (approximately <b>translatable</b> as Finlanders) when referring to all Finnish nationals. The purpose is to use a term that includes both themselves and Finnish-speaking Finns because the Swedish word finnar, in Finland-Swedish usage, implies a Finnish-speaking Finn. In Sweden, this distinction between finländare and finnar is not widely understood and often not made.|$|E

Other terms include: obake (お化け), yōkai (妖怪), bōrei (亡霊), and shiryō (死霊). There is a long {{tradition}} of belief in the supernatural in Japan stemming from a variety of influences. Imported sources include Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese folklore. The most notable influence, however, is Shintō, a native Japanese animistic religion which presupposes that our physical world is inhabited by eight million omnipresent spirits.|$|E
25|$|Sinn Féin won a huge {{majority}} in the 1918 general election, largely thanks to the British executions of the 1916 leaders, the threat of conscription with the Conscription Crisis of 1918 and the first-past-the-post ballot. They won 73 out of 105 Irish seats, with about 47% of votes cast. 25 seats were uncontested. On 21 January 1919, 27 Sinn Féin MPs (the rest were imprisoned or impaired), calling themselves Teachtaí Dála (TDs), assembled in the Mansion House in Dublin and formed an Irish parliament, known as Dáil Éireann (<b>translatable</b> into English as the Assembly of Ireland). A ministry or Aireacht was formed, {{under the leadership of}} the Príomh Aire (also called President of Dáil Éireann) Cathal Brugha. De Valera had been re-arrested in May 1918 and imprisoned and so could not attend the January session of the Dáil. He escaped from Lincoln Gaol, England in February 1919. As a result he replaced Brugha as Príomh Aire in the April session of Dáil Éireann.|$|E
25|$|The {{author of}} the De medicamentis is most likely the Marcellus who was {{appointed}} magister officiorum by Theodosius I. The heading of the prefatory epistle identifies him as a vir inlustris, <b>translatable</b> as “a distinguished man,” but a more formal designation of rank that indicates he had held imperial office. Marcellus’s 16th-century editor Janus Cornarius gives the unhelpful phrase ex magno officio (something like “from high office”); coupled with two references in the Theodosian Code to a Marcellus as magister officiorum, Cornarius’s phrase has been taken as a mistaken expansion of the standard abbreviation mag. off. The magister officiorum {{was a sort of}} Minister of the Interior and the identification is consistent with what is known of the author’s life and with the politics of the time. His stated connection to the Ausonii makes it likely that he was among the several aristocratic Gauls who benefitted politically when the emperor Gratian appointed his Bordelaise tutor Ausonius to high office and from Theodosius’s extended residence in the western empire during the latter years of his reign.|$|E

500|$|This work's title, <b>translatable</b> as [...] "tutor", {{refers to}} Christ {{as the teacher}} of all mankind, and it {{features}} an extended metaphor of Christians as children. It is not simply instructional : the author intends {{to show how the}} Christian should respond to the Love of God authentically. Clement, following Plato (Republic 4:441), divides life into three elements: character, actions and passions. The first having been dealt with in the Protrepticus, he devotes the Paedagogus to reflections on Christ's role in teaching us to act morally and to control our passions. Despite its explicitly Christian nature, Clement's work draws on Stoic philosophy and pagan literature; Homer alone is cited over sixty times in the work.|$|E

According to Reisner, the name [...] "Abuwtiyuw" [...] is not fully <b>translatable,</b> but he surmised that bw ("bu") is an onomatopoeic representation of a dog's bark, as this component often is found in Ancient Egyptian dog names. Edward C. Martin Jr. claims that the name, or its variant transliteration of Abutiu, means [...] "With Pointed Ears", which would fit the description of the Tesem.|$|E
500|$|In {{a famous}} paper of 1936 with Garrett Birkhoff, the first work ever to {{introduce}} quantum logics, von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a propositional calculus substantially {{different from all}} classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics. The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, {{the need for the}} new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (e.g., one horizontally and the other vertically), and therefore, a fortiori, it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added in between the other two, the photons will, indeed, pass through. This experimental fact is <b>translatable</b> into logic as the non-commutativity of conjunction [...] It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of classical logic, [...] and , are not valid for quantum theory.|$|E
500|$|After the {{commercial}} failure of Astral Weeks, Moondance {{was seen by}} music journalists as a record that redeemed Morrison. Billboard magazine predicted it would reach rock and folk audiences while rectifying music buyers' oversight of the singer's previous record [...] "with a more commercial entry, still rich with the soul-folk nuances of this sensitive Irish song surrealist". Moondance reached the top 30 of the American albums chart and the top 40 of the British chart in 1970, while establishing Morrison as a young, commercially successful, and artistically independent singer-songwriter with great promise. Its eclectic, lushly arranged style of music proved more accessible to listeners and <b>translatable</b> for live audiences, leading Morrison to form The Caledonia Soul Orchestra, a large ensemble of musicians with whom he would find his greatest concert success. According to Harrington, Moondance was very successful with hippie couples who were [...] "settling into complacent domesticity" [...] at the time. In Hage's opinion, its success lent Morrison a rising cultural iconicity and presence in the burgeoning singer-songwriter movement of the early 1970s, first indicated by his front cover feature on the July 1970 issue of Rolling Stone.|$|E
500|$|In the anime {{adaptation}} of Rurouni Kenshin, Watsuki's designs were {{combined with the}} voice talents of voice actress Mayo Suzukaze. She said that she started feeling like Kenshin after years of work as his voice, but says that providing the voice for his character {{was one of her}} best experiences. In producing the English dub version of the series, Media Blasters considered following suit, with Mona Marshall considered a finalist to voice Kenshin. Richard Hayworth was eventually selected for the role, giving Kenshin's character a more masculine voice in the English adaptation. Marshall was also selected to voice the younger Kenshin during flashback scenes. Clark Cheng, Media Blasters dub script writer, said that localizing Kenshin's unusual speech was a difficult process. His use of de gozaru and oro were not only character trademarks that indicated his state of mind, but important elements to the story. However, neither is directly <b>translatable</b> into English, and in the end the company chose to replace de gozaru with [...] "that I did," [...] "that I am," [...] or [...] "that I do." [...] Kenshin's signature oro was replaced with [...] "huah" [...] to simulate a [...] "funny sound" [...] that had no real meaning. Daryl Surat of Otaku USA said that the grammar in Kenshin's dialogue in the Media Blasters dub and subtitles resemble the grammar in the dialogue of Yoda, a character in Star Wars.|$|E
500|$|Like other Disney media {{products}} {{which are}} often localized through Disney Character Voices International, Frozen was translated and dubbed into 41 languages (compared with only 15 for The Lion King). A major challenge was to find sopranos capable of matching Menzel's warm vocal tone and three-octave vocal range in their native languages. Rick Dempsey, the unit's senior executive, regarded the process of translating the film as [...] "exceptionally challenging"; he explained, [...] "It's a difficult juggling act {{to get the right}} intent of the lyrics and also have it match rhythmically to the music. And then {{you have to go back}} and adjust for lip sync! ...requires a lot of patience and precision." [...] Lopez explained that they were told by Disney to remove complex wordplay and puns from their songs, to ensure the film was easily <b>translatable</b> and had globally appealing lyrics. For the casting of dubbed versions, Disney required native speakers in order to [...] "ensure that the film feels 'local'." [...] They used Bell and Menzel's voices as their [...] "blueprint" [...] in casting, and tried to match the voices [...] "as much as possible," [...] meaning that they auditioned approximately 200 singers to fill the 41 slots for Elsa alone. For nearly 15 dubbed versions, they cast Elsa's singing and speaking parts separately, since not all vocalists could act the part they were singing. After casting all the other roles for all 41 languages, the international cast ended up including more than 900 people, who voiced their roles through approximately 1,300 recording sessions.|$|E

2500|$|Jiajie (假借 jiǎjiè, [...] "borrowing; {{making use}} of") are {{characters}} that are [...] "borrowed" [...] to write another homophonous or near-homophonous morpheme.

As this was pronounced similarly to the Old Chinese word *lai [...] "to come", 來 {{was also used}} to write this verb. Eventually the more common usage, the verb [...] "to come", became established as the default reading of the character 來, and a new character [...] was devised for [...] "wheat".

The paradigm shift does not merely involve the revision or transformation of an individual theory, it changes the way terminology is defined, how the scientists in that field view their subject, and, perhaps most significantly, what questions are regarded as valid, and what rules are used to determine the truth of a particular theory. The new theories were not, as the scientists had previously thought, just extensions of old theories, but were instead completely new world views.|$|E

The four main ones overlap markedly, such that [...] "about eighty {{percent or more of}} the {{features}} of the Tibetan schools are the same". Differences include the use of apparently, but not actually, contradictory terminology, opening dedications of texts to different deities and whether phenomena are described from the viewpoint of an unenlightened practitioner or of a Buddha. On questions of philosophy the inclusion (Nyingma, Sakya, Jonang, Kagyu) or exclusion (Gelugpa) of Yogacara and Buddha-nature teachings has been a historical divide between schools, which still colours the approaches to sunyata and ultimate reality. The 19th century Rimé movement downplayed these differences, as still reflected in the stance of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who states that there are no fundamental differences between these schools.

The new publication's spirit was indebted to Junimist discourse. Its title, <b>translatable</b> as [...] "the Romanian trifle" [...] or [...] "the Romanian nonsense", alluded to the cynicism and self-importance of the emerging modern Romanian society. According to Vianu, this was a theme first debated by Junimeas Theodor Rosetti. Moft! thus mimicked the common answer to any important or merely exacerbated problem, and Caragiale also used it to illustrate {{what he saw as}} a common national feature. In one of his early editorials for the magazine, he claimed that moft was to Romanians what spleen (melancholy) was to the English people, nihilism to the Russians, chauvinism to the Hungarians, and vendetta to the Italians.|$|E
2500|$|Here [...] "-Ø" [...] {{represents}} a zero morpheme, as the absolutive case is unmarked in Basque. The forms for the ergative are [...] "-k" [...] after a vowel, and [...] "-ek" [...] after a consonant.

The default determiner (commonly called the article which is suffixed to common nouns and usually <b>translatable</b> by [...] "the" [...] in English) is [...] "-a" [...] in the singular and [...] "-ak" [...] in the plural, the plural being marked only on the determiner and never the noun.
