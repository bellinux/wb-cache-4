RESULTS: Twice-weekly ECT was associated with significantly lower total electricity dosage administered, a tendency toward shorter overall hospital stay and fewer ECT treatments compared to thrice-weekly ECT.

500|$|A multiplace chamber is the {{preferred}} facility for treatment of decompression sickness as it allows direct physical access to the patient by medical personnel, but monoplace chambers are more widely available and {{should be used for}} treatment if a multiplace chamber is not available or transportation would cause significant delay in treatment, as the interval between onset of symptoms and recompression is important to the quality of recovery.

The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and validate limited sampling strategies for the prediction of E 7070 exposure in two different <b>treatment</b> <b>schedules</b> for phase II studies using the Bayesian estimation approach. Data from two phase I dose finding studies were used in which E 7070 was administered either as a single 1 h infusion or as a daily 1 h infusion for 5 days. Plasma concentration-time data from 75 patients were randomly divided into an index data set, used for the development of the strategies, and a validation data set. Population pharmacokinetic parameters were derived on the basis of the index data set. The D-optimality algorithm was used for the selection of optimal time points for both <b>treatment</b> <b>schedules.</b> The developed strategies were compared by assessment of their predictive performance of exposure, expressed as AUC (area under the plasma concentration vs time curve), in the validation data set. The developed population pharmacokinetic model comprised three compartments, with saturable distribution to one peripheral compartment and both linear and saturable elimination from the central compartment. For the 1 h infusion, a four sample strategy was selected which resulted in unbiased and accurate predictions of AUC (bias 0. 74 %, precision 13 %). A five sample strategy was generated for the daily times five schedule yielding unbiased (bias 3. 2 %) and precise (12 % precision) predictions of AUC.
