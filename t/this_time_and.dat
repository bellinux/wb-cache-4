5|$|The Cambrian {{explosion}} {{took place}} around 540 to 520 {{million years ago}} (Mya).

5|$|The {{original}} proposed {{opening of}} the line was on 28 October 1850 by Thomas Farncombe, Lord Mayor of London, but the line was far from complete by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> so the ceremony was postponed.

5|$|A castle {{may have}} been {{constructed}} on Castle Island by 1257, when the 16-year-old King Alexander III of Scotland was forcibly brought there by his regents. During the First War of Scottish Independence (1296–1328), the invading English army held the castle, then named Loch Leven Castle, which lies at a strategically important position between the towns of Edinburgh, Stirling and Perth. Parts of the present fortification, the curtain wall, may date from <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> were perhaps built by the occupying English. The castle was captured by the Scots {{before the end of}} the 13th century, possibly by the forces of William Wallace.|$|E

5|$|About forty {{days after}} mating, the female giant Pacific octopus {{attaches}} strings of small fertilised eggs (10,000 to 70,000 in total) to rocks in a crevice or under an overhang. Here she guards and cares for them {{for about five}} months (160 days) until they hatch. In colder waters, such as those off of Alaska, it may take as much as 10 months for the eggs to completely develop. The female aerates the eggs and keeps them clean; if left untended, many eggs will not hatch. She does not feed during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> dies soon afterwards. Males become senescent and die {{a few weeks after}} mating.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E

First under Abel as GM and then Ned Harkness, Alex Delvecchio, Lindsay, and Jimmy Skinner in the position, the Red Wings suffered {{a long period of}} decline, from 1967 until 1983, during which they made the playoffs only twice.

5|$|American {{science fiction}} {{magazines}} {{first appeared in}} the 1920s with the appearance of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. The beginnings of science fiction as a separately marketed genre can be traced to <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> {{by the end of the}} 1930s the field was undergoing its first boom, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several titles. By the late 1940s the market began to recover again. From a low of eight active magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 in 1950, and a further 22 had commenced publication by 1954. Imagination was launched in the middle of this publishing boom.|$|E
5|$|An Itza {{account of}} this {{encounter}} reached the colonial authorities in Yucatán via Tipuj. The Itza reported that the Guatemalan party approached on horseback to within sight of Nojpetén, and about thirty curious Itzas gathered {{to talk to the}} intruders, whereupon they were attacked by the Spanish, resulting in the deaths of thirty Itzas, the capture of one and yet more wounded. A Christian Maya emissary from Bacalar-at-Chunjujub', Yucatán, was in Nojpetén around <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> reported that the Itza gathered 3,000–4,000 warriors ready to repulse Díaz de Velasco's party.|$|E
5|$|Ann Bannon {{was born}} Ann Weldy in Joliet, Illinois, in 1932. She {{grew up in}} nearby Hinsdale {{with her mother and}} stepfather, and had the {{responsibility}} of taking care of four siblings due to the family's financial problems. She took comfort in a vibrant imaginary life during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> found solace in writing. Growing up, she was surrounded by music, particularly jazz, as her family hosted small recitals for friends and neighbors. One became a character in her books: a perennial bachelor named Jack who slung jokes and witticisms at the audiences.|$|E

5|$|Around 1200UTC the {{following}} day, Linfa further intensified into a severe tropical storm. A microwave satellite {{image of the}} storm depicted an eye-feature surrounded by deep convection. Interacting with a nearby upper-level low, poleward outflow significantly improved late on June19, fueling further strengthening. Slowly tracking in a general northward direction, Linfa continued to organize and by June20, the JTWC upgraded Linfa to a typhoon. A small, ragged eye appeared on visible satellite images by <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> several hours later, the storm reached its peak intensity just below typhoon-status according to the JMA. Maximum sustained winds peaked at 110km/h (70mph 10-minute winds) and a barometric pressure of 975hPa (mbar).|$|E
5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> {{following}} the disastrous Battle of Acheloos in 917, the Byzantines were mostly occupied in the Balkans in a protracted conflict against Bulgaria. Hence, Kourkouas's first task as Domestic of the East was {{the suppression of}} the revolt of Bardas Boilas, the governor (strategos) of Chaldia, a strategically important area on the Empire's northeastern Anatolian frontier. This was quickly achieved and his brother, Theophilos Kourkouas, replaced Boilas as governor of Chaldia. As commander of this northernmost sector of the eastern frontier, Theophilos proved a competent soldier and gave valuable assistance to his brother's campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Born as Vasudeva in Pajaka {{village near}} Udupi in 1238, he learnt the Vedas and Upanishads under his guru Achyutapreksha. He was {{initiated}} into sanyasa (asceticism) {{after which he}} earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha). Later, he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel India. He successfully debated with many scholars and philosophers during <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first notable disciple. Unlike Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) who preached Advaita philosophy (monism) and Ramanujacharya who propounded Vishishtadvaita philosophy (qualified monism), Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (dualism).|$|E

5|$|By the 19th century, Leicester Square {{was known}} as an {{entertainment}} venue, with many amusements peculiar to the era, including Wyld's Great Globe, which was built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and housed a giant scale map of the Earth. The construction of New Coventry Street {{made it easier for}} traffic to access the square, resulting in private residences being replaced by shops, museums and exhibition centres. Savile House at No.5–6, built in 1683 for Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, had become a museum by <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> was ultimately destroyed by fire in 1865. It was rebuilt as the Empire Theatre.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> there is much to suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E
