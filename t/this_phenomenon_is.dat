5|$|The cloudy {{outer edge}} of the eye is called the “eyewall”. The eyewall {{typically}} expands outward with height, resembling an arena football stadium; <b>this</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> sometimes referred to as the stadium effect. The eyewall is where the greatest wind speeds are found, air rises most rapidly, clouds reach to their highest altitude, and precipitation is the heaviest. The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{observations}} of gravity-related phenomena during solar eclipses, especially during the period of totality. In 1954, and again in 1959, Maurice Allais reported observations of strange and unexplained movement during solar eclipses. The reality of this phenomenon, named the Allais effect, has remained controversial. Similarly, in 1970, Saxl and Allen observed the sudden change in motion of a torsion pendulum; <b>this</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> called the Saxl effect.|$|E

5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems. Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation {{will tend to}} become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable example of <b>this</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> Avatar, {{which was also}} released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much higher proportion of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.|$|E

5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining who does the bulk of unpaid work.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is not a}} human invention, and may be {{observed}} in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.|$|E
5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for <b>this</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and requires no treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have also}} {{adversely}} impacted {{the ecology of}} the Everglades by introducing numerous invasive species, which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging example of <b>this</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> the recent proliferation of the Burmese python in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.|$|E
5|$|If two {{disjoint}} smooth simple closed curves {{undergo the}} curve-shortening flow simultaneously, they remain disjoint as the flow progresses. The reason is that, if two smooth curves {{move in a}} way that creates a crossing, then at the time of first crossing the curves would necessarily be tangent to each other, without crossing. But, in such a situation, the two curves' curvatures at the point of tangency would necessarily pull them apart rather than pushing them together into a crossing. For the same reason, a single simple closed curve can never evolve to cross itself. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> known as the avoidance principle.|$|E
5|$|In {{interstellar}} astronomy, visible spectra {{can appear}} redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon {{referred to as}} interstellar reddening – similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes {{the rest of the}} sky to have a blue color. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> distinct from redshifting because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered {{in and out of the}} line-of-sight.|$|E

5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation bias, where the smaller bones of younger animals {{were less likely to be}} preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection bias, where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that <b>this</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> a consequence of life history, rather than bias, and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E
5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She {{is often described as}} looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. <b>This</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{evidence}} {{provided by the}} embryo suggests that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous, making it the first viviparous archosauromorph asides from possibly metriorhynchids. This {{is consistent with the}} separation of its sacral ribs from its sacrum, which indicates a mobile pelvis that could have functioned in giving birth. While the otherwise absence of viviparous archosaurs has been historically attributed to common attributes inherited from the archosaurian stem-lineage, the discovery that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous suggests that <b>this</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>is</b> due to lineage-specific lifestyle restrictions. Although the sex-determination systems among living archosauromorphs are diverse, with crocodilians and turtles using temperature-dependent sex determination, phylogenetic modelling suggests that Dinocephalosaurus retained the basal condition of genotypic sex determination from early diapsids, and that this system facilitated its transition to an obligately marine lifestyle alongside viviparity.|$|E
