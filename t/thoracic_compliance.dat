40|$|ABSTRACT: In thirty-nine {{children}} undergoing spine fusion with Harrington instrumentation, measurement ofthoracic {{compliance and}} elastance was normal {{in all of}} the twenty-nine children with idiopathic scoliosis. Compliance was low in three children with paralytic scoliosis but not in seven children with congenital scoliosis. In adults with scoliosis, both the thoracic cage ‘ and the lungs may be stiff and, therefore, hard to inflate. This makes artificial ventilation during operation difficult. When high pressure is required to inflate the thorax with a given volume of air or gas, <b>thoracic</b> <b>compliance</b> is low and the reciprocal of compliance, thoracic elastance, is high. Caro and DuBois, measuring the elastance of lung and thoracic cage in a small number of children with scoliosis who were to have operations under general anesthesia and myoneural blockade, found that it was either equal to or lower than values obtained in a group of normal children ofcomparable age. In these young patients, the chest wall was easily expanded. We wished to repeat the measurements of Caro and DuBois but on a larger number of patients who were having their scoliosis corrected by Harrington instrumentation, a technique which might well alter the <b>thoracic</b> <b>compliance</b> and increase the elastance...|$|E

Pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV), with its high and decelerating inspiratory flow, has faster tidal volume delivery and different gas distribution. The same tidal volume setting, delivered by PCV versus VCV, may result in a lower peak airway pressure and reduced risk of barotrauma, but variable tidal and minute volume may be generated (Campbell and Davis 2002; Wang et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2016).|$|R

The optimum ventilation mode for anesthetized patients on prone position was not described and studies comparing volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) and pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) during prone position are limited. We hypothesized that PCV instead of VCV during prone position could achieve lower airway pressures and reduce the systemic stress response. In this study, we aimed to compare the effects of PCV and VCV modes during prone position on respiratory mechanics, oxygenation, and hemodynamics, as well as blood cortisol and insulin levels, which has not been investigated before.|$|E

The peak airway pressures were minimal at a frequency of 45 b. p. m.

40|$|The {{possibility}} that the heightened cardiovascular risk associated with the menopause can be reduced by increasing dietary isoflavone intake was tested in 17 women by measuring arterial compliance, an index of the elasticity of large arteries such as the <b>thoracic</b> aorta. <b>Compliance</b> diminishes with age and menopause. An initial 3 - to 4 -week run-in period and a 5 -week placebo period were followed by two 5 -week periods of active treatment with 40 mg and then 80 mg isoflavones derived from red clover containing genistein, daidzein, biochanin, and formononetin in 14 and 13 women, respectively, with 3 others serving as placebo controls throughout. Arterial compliance, measured by ultrasound as a pressure (carotid artery) and volume (outflow into aorta) relationship, was determined after each period; plasma lipids were measured twice during each period. Urinary output of isoflavones was also determined. Arterial compliance rose by 23 % relative to that during the placebo period with the 80 -mg isoflavone dose and slightly less with the 40 -mg dose (mean 6 SEM: placebo, 19. 761. 5; 40 mg, 23. 760. 7; 80 mg, 24. 46 1. 4). In the three women receiving continuous placebo, compliance was 16 6 2. 2, similar to that during the run-in period for the remaining subjects (17 6 2. 1). ANOVA showed a significant (P 5, 0. 001) difference between treatments; by Bonferroni multiple comparisons and by paired t test, differences were significant between placebo and 40 - and 80 -mg isoflavone doses (by paired t test: P 50. 039 for placebo vs. 40 mg; P 5 0. 018 for placebo vs. 80 mg). Plasma lipids were not significantly affected. An important cardiovascular risk factor, arterial compliance, which diminishes with menopause, was significantly improved with red clover isoflavones. As diminished compliance leads to systolic hypertension and may increase left ventricular work, the findings indicate a potential new therapeutic approach for improved cardiovascular function after menopause. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{specific}} features of the mechanisms responsible {{for the development of}} acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by direct and indirect damaging factors and to reveal its differential diagnostic signs. Materials and methods. Lung morphological changes were studied creating experimental models of ARDS of various genesis in 75 outbred male albino rats weighing 300 — 400 g, which included the direct damaging factor acidine-pepsin aspiration (Group 1, n= 25) and the indirect damaging factor blood loss (Group 2, n= 50). Prospective examinations were made in 73 patients (43 men and 30 women, whose age was 21 to 69 years) with ARDS caused by direct damaging factors, such as aspiration pneumonitis, pneumonia, blunt chest injury, and pulmonary contusion (37 patients, including 21 men and 16 women) and in those with ARDS caused by indirect damaging factors, such as abdominal sepsis, severe concomitant injury, and hemorrhagic shock (36 patients, including 22 men and 14 women). Results. The study has shown that ARDS caused by direct and indirect damaging factors is characterized by different developmental mechanisms and lung morphological changes that underlie the specific features of functional impairments.

40|$|Flail {{chest is}} a rare {{complication}} in pediatric patients with blunt chest trauma. There is no general consensus on which treatment is most appropriate for flail chest in pediatric patients, {{although it has been}} reported that surgical fixation is associated with beneficial outcomes for flail chest in adults. The present report described two pediatric cases of flail chest, which was rare in pediatric blunt trauma. In small children, functional residual capacity is smaller, and the thorax is pliable due to high <b>thoracic</b> <b>compliance.</b> Therefore, it is only advisable to select intubation and mechanical ventilation treatment. Likewise, in pediatric flail chest, the available evidence does not suggest that ventilator management protocols should be adopted routinely, and the treatment for pediatric flail chest was not established completely. There were not huge different between the described patients, including injury severity and ventilation setting. However, one had a relapse of flail chest after extubation and chest taping was required, while the other patient’s condition was stable after decannulation. As described above, it is difficult to predict a recurrence of flail chest in pediatric patients even if treatment goes well. Therefore, T-piece trial should be considered prior to extubation...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the independent lung ventilation (ILV) in adults {{has been described by}} Carlon and co-workers in 1978 and subsequently by other investigators. In 1983 Hedenstierna and co-workers using a bilumen tube suitable for prolonged intubation, and two Servo Ventilator 900 B (Siemens) adapted for synchronization, treated a wide range of clinical conditions. Following this experience, the potential use of simultaneous independent lung ventilation (sILV) in patients of the pediatric age group has been investigated. Pathophysiology of monolateral lung injury In infants with lung injury, the affected lung presents reduced compliance and greater respiratory airway resistance than the less affected lung. When these infants are mechanically ventilated, the ventilated gases are preferentially deviated towards the less pathological lung, thereby over-expanding it and providing little benefit for the more affected lung. The result is that the affected lung receives insufficient ventilation while the less affected lung could be over ventilated, defeating the purpose of mechanical ventilation.

The patients were homogenized by ASA score (ASA I and ASA II) and on population basis. Hemodynamic parameters and 4 time-point pulmonary function tests were monitored in both groups. Peritoneal insufflation resulted in significant increase of systemic arterial pressure (23 %), mean arterial pressure (23. 8 %), systemic vascular resistance (65 %), pulmonary vascular resistance (90 %), and significant reduction of cardiac output (24 %) and cardiac index (51 %). Pneumoperitoneum caused transient restriction of pulmonary function by reducing the <b>thoracic</b> and lung <b>compliance.</b> Fall of pH concentration, increase of PaCO 2 and ET CO 2 without any changes of PaO 2, SO 2, base excess and bicarbonate ions concentrations were the sequelae of CO 2 absorption from peritoneal cavity. Postoperative 'hypothermi', i. e. lowering of body temperature for 0. 3 oC was the consequence of sudden gas expansion (Joule-Thompson phenomenon), which implies continuous flow of dry gas under pressure over peritoneal surface. Tissue damage factors (D-dimer, C-reactive protein, Protein C) were significantly lower in laparoscopic group, meaning that such mode of treatment resulted in minor postoperative pain and shorter period of recovery.

40|$|The {{effects of}} aging on {{arterial}} mechanical properties {{and the response}} to nitroprusside were examined in 25 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. High-fidelity pressures were recorded with a multisensor catheter. Pulse wave velocity was determined between two sensors in the <b>thoracic</b> aorta. Arterial <b>compliance</b> was determined by {{an analysis of the}} diastolic waveform and cardiac output. At baseline, despite a similar systemic vascular resistance, the pulsatile load (e. g., arterial compliance) and wave transmission characteristics (e. g., pulse wave velocity) were altered with aging. Arterial compliance was reduced in older (greater than 50 yr, n = 8) versus younger (less than 35 yr, n = 8) patients (0. 51 +/- 0. 17 vs. 1. 33 +/- 0. 63 ml/mmHg, P less than 0. 01) and intermediate in those 35 - 50 yr of age (n = 9, 0. 72 +/- 0. 40 ml/mmHg). There was a positive correlation between age and pulse wave velocity (r = + 0. 90). Nitroprusside infusion decreased resistance, increased arterial compliance, and lowered pulse wave velocity in all groups. Yet, advancing age was associated with a greater fall in wave velocity for a given fall in aortic pressure. The slope (K) of the relation between pulse wave velocity and aortic diastolic pressure progressively increased with age (0. 01 +/- 0. 03, 0. 06 +/- 0. 02, and 0. 09 +/- 0. 03 m/s-mmHg). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant relation between K and age. These data demonstrate that in older patients with dilated cardiomyopathy the left ventricle is coupled to an arterial circulation that has a greater pulsatile load, despite a similar steady load. Furthermore, these age-related changes in the arterial system affect the hemodynamic response to pharmacologically-induced vasodilatation...|$|R

At rest, abdominal'thoracic contribution was not different between elderly and young. During exercise, abdominal contribution to total ventilation was decreased in the young compared to that at rest (rest: 53. 6 ± 2. 9 % vs exercise: 50. 4 ± 1. 9 - 48. 9 ± 1. 8 %; p <. 01), but significantly increased in the elderly (rest: 53. 9 ± 1. 8 % vs exercise: 57. 3 ± 1. 7 - 59. 8 ± 2. 0 %; p <. 01). Only in the elderly, respiratory frequency was increased during exercise compared to that at rest (rest: 20. 1 ± 0. 8 [Imin] vs exercise; 25. 6 ± 1. 5 - 27. 8 ± 1. 6 [Imini; p <. 05).

When many dif-ferent procedures are described for the treatment of the same disease, {{it is clear that the}} ideal technique has not been identi-fied yet. In our opinion, the method devised by Actis Dato et al. [2] has a valid theoretical basis and has, in their hands, proved to be safe and effective. Furthermore, the authors have such a consid-erable experience in this field that their opinion has to be taken into the utmost consideration by the scientific community. In conceiving our technique, we aimed to avoid some draw-backs associated with the use of metallic retrosternal bars while trying to maintain similar long-term results. In fact, a transverse posterior bar limits the <b>thoracic</b> <b>compliance,</b> causes exposures to serious damage in the case of trauma, can be painful and requires a second operation for removal. We think that such dis-advantages may justify the research on novel methods. The use of new titanium plates specifically built for sternal stabilization avoids the need for a posterior support, while ensuring the same solidity of the reconstructed sternum. These results can be achieved thanks to the highest strength-to-weight ratio of titanium: the Synthes struts (Synthes®, Canada Ltd.) modelled on the anatomical sternal shape are so thin and light that their removal is not required. As correctly noted by Actis Dato et al., the procedure is relatively expensive [3]. This disadvantage is un-doubtedly more than offset by the avoidance of a second surgery for the bar removal. Finally, the economic impact of the procedure is limited, as it is indicated in a carefully selected group of patients, with a condition difficult to correct such as the severe asymmetric pectus excavatum...|$|E
40|$|Fluid {{administration}} {{in patients with}} acute circulatory failure might increase cardiac output and restore oxygen supply for the different organs. However, in patients in which extra fluid does not increase cardiac output (the non-responders), this extra fluid is harmful. Predicting whether a patient will benefit from fluid administration therefore is a daily clinical challenge {{in the intensive care}} unit. For this reason, predicting fluid responsiveness {{has become one of the}} major topics of intensive care research during the last decades. ‘Static’ markers of volume status like blood pressure or central venous pressure have been studied for many years and were found to be unreliable in predicting fluid responsiveness. This thesis therefore focused on the use of ‘dynamic’ indices for predicting fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patients, based on the swings in arterial blood pressure due to heart-lung interactions. First we found that the predictive value of dynamic indices is high in patients ventilated with high tidal volume and without cardiac arrhythmias. We also showed that the use of a lower tidal volume and the presence of cardiac arrhythmias reduced the area under the receiver operator curve to almost half. In order to improve our knowledge of the underlying physiology of heart-lung interaction, and to increase the usability of the dynamic indices in clinical practice with respect to different physiological conditions, we investigated the influence of tidal volume, lung compliance and chest wall compliance on the heart-lung interaction. We found that tidal volume linearly increases intrathoracic pressures and the value of the dynamic indices. We also found that a decrease in <b>thoracic</b> <b>compliance</b> increased intrathoracic pressures and dynamic indices. A change in lung compliance did not change these parameters. These findings were summarized in a physiologically based mathematical model of the interaction between the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, incorporating dynamic indices and fluid responsiveness. The model allows for the simulation of these complex relationships and may predict the effect of volume infusion in specific patients in the future. To further increase applicability in clinical practice, we also showed that the dynamic indices can be measured reliably non-invasively using an inflatable finger cuff...|$|E

If a patient survives the initial phase of DCS, complications may occur, one of these being intraabdominal hypertension (IAH) and it´s potential development into the abdominal compartment syndrome. The indications for DCS have been widened and DCS principles can be applied in situations where time and resources are essential factors. The DCS principles of rapidly controlling intestinal spillage have not been evaluated. The aim of the studies in Papers I and II was to evaluate the principles of spillage control of intestinal contents according to the DCS concept and more specifically the effects of early rapid control of multiple bowel perforations on cardiovascular and pulmonary function compared with conventional small bowel resections in an animal model with abdominal trauma. In Paper I the animal model using anaesthetised pigs included a gunshot wound to the abdomen which caused multiple small bowel injuries. Haemorrhagic shock was combined with the gunshot wound in Paper II. The results presented in Paper I showed a significant reduction in rise in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance, and a trend towards higher cardiac output and lower oxygen consumption in the bowel ligation group. In Paper II the results show a longer persistence of lactic acidaemia in the bowel ligation group. The aim of the study in Paper III was to assess visceral (intestinal, gastric and renal) microcirculation parallel with central haemodynamics and respiratory function during stepwise increases in intraabdominal pressure. In Paper IV we studied mucosal barrier function and morphology in the small bowel and colon of the pigs which were subjected to IAH. The IAP in anaesthetised pigs was increased stepwise using CO 2 inflation, by 10 mm Hg at 10 -minute intervals up to 50 mm Hg, and followed by exsufflation (Paper III). The microcirculation was selectively studied using a 4 -channel laser Doppler flowmeter (Periflex 5000, Perimed, Sweden). The mucosal tissues were mounted in modified Ussing chambers for assessment of barrier function (E. coli K 12 uptake and 51 Cr-EDTA permeability) (Paper IV). The results showed that the microcirculation of the small bowel mucosa and colon mucosa was significantly less affected compared to the seromuscular layers. The microcirculation of gastric mucosa, renal cortex and the seromuscular layer of small bowel and colon were significantly reduced with each increase. Cardiac output (CO) decreased significantly at IAP levels above 10 mm Hg and the respiratory function data showed an increasing airway pressure and a concomitant reduction in <b>thoracic</b> <b>compliance.</b> Transmucosal passage of E. coli was increased three-fold in the small bowel after ACS with a significant correlation to the degree of mucosal microcirculatory reperfusion after exsufflation. 51 Cr-EDTA permeability was unaffected. Bacterial passage in the colon was unchanged, whereas 51 Cr-EDTA permeability after ACS increased by up to 181 % of baseline and was correlated to significant histopathological changes in the mucosa. In Paper I we have demonstrated that early rapid control of multiple bowel perforations in a model with moderate shock resulted in less impairment of SVR and PVR than conventional resection and anastomosis. The use of DCS principles, however, had no beneficial effect on cardiovascular function when haemorrhagic shock was combined with abdominal missile trauma (Paper II), on the contrary bowel ligation was followed by more prolonged lactic acidosis than conventional repair. The studies in Paper III and IV indicate that the microcirculation of intestinal mucosa and especially small bowel mucosa seem better preserved in response to intraabdominal hypertension caused by CO 2 insufflation than other intraabdominal microvascular beds. The short term ACS in this model caused morphological changes in the intestinal mucosa, and mucosal barrier dysfunction. The response pattern concerning barrier function changes after CO 2 insufflation differs between small bowel and colonic mucosa. The small bowel mucosa showed increased bacterial passage, and the colonic mucosa an increase in paracellular permeability and secretory response...|$|E
