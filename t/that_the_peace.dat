5|$|Fearing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> with Sviatoslav {{would not}} endure, the Byzantine emperor induced the Pecheneg khan Kurya to kill Sviatoslav before he reached Kiev. This was {{in line with}} the policy {{outlined}} by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in De Administrando Imperio of fomenting strife between the Rus' and the Pechenegs. According to the Slavic chronicle, Sveneld attempted to warn Sviatoslav to avoid the Dnieper rapids, but the prince slighted his wise advice and was ambushed and slain by the Pechenegs when he tried to cross the cataracts near Khortitsa early in 972. The Primary Chronicle reports that his skull was made into a chalice by the Pecheneg khan.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{argued that}} he had conquered the city by force. Abu Ubaidah {{maintained}} the city had capitulated, through the peace agreement between him and Thomas. The corps commanders discussed the situation, and reportedly told Khalid <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> agreement must be honored. Their rationale had logic: if other Byzantines in Syria heard that the Muslims had given a guarantee of safety to a surrendered city and then had slaughtered those whose safety had been guaranteed, no other city would ever surrender to the Muslims. This would make the task of conquering Syria immeasurably more difficult. Khalid, though not happy, agreed to honor the peace agreement.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{travelled}} {{thousands of}} miles to arrive in India. They studied Indian geography and mastered local languages {{to deal with the}} Indians. At the time, they were technologically advanced, with superior equipment in several critical areas to that available locally. Chhabra hypothesizes that even if the British technical superiority were discounted, they would have won the war because of the discipline and organization in their ranks. After the First Anglo-Maratha war, Warren Hastings declared in 1783 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> established with the Marathas was on such a firm ground that it {{was not going to be}} shaken for years to come.|$|E

5|$|The {{terms of}} the peace {{agreement}} were {{that no one would}} be enslaved, no harm would be done to the temples, nothing would be taken as booty and that safe passage was given to Thomas, Harbees, and every citizen of Damascus who was not willing to live under Muslim rule. The peace agreement also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> would end after three days and that the Muslims could attack after these three days without violating the agreement.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, the city's Christmas decorations also {{included}} lighted snowflakes on the utility poles of Easton streets surrounding the Peace Candle. The 32 six-foot snowflake decorations cost just over $10,800, which were funded {{in part by}} a $6,000 Community Development Block Grant secured by the city. The Easton Holiday Committee said it was becoming increasing difficult to raise sufficient funds for the holiday display and sought $10,000 from the city council, but they were rejected. In response, six of the eleven Easton Holiday Committee members resigned in March 2001, prompting fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> Candle would not be erected during its 50th anniversary that following holiday season. However, the committee was filled with new volunteers who revamped efforts to raise funds through the sale of wax candles and greeting cards. The Peace Candle was lit during a ceremony on November 23, 2001, in dedication to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as rescue workers from New York City, The Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania who responded the day of the attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, a six-foot slab of {{fiberglass}} {{from the}} imitation wax {{at the top}} of the candle was knocked loose by 50 mile-per-hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year's assembly of the Peace Candle, as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers about the history of the structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Peace</b> Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were put to rest the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put the candle up.|$|E

5|$|After they test {{negative}} for the virus, Artyom again encounters Khan. They locate the young Dark One, {{and in a}} series of hallucinatory flashbacks, Artyom recalls that he was saved by a Dark One as a child; he was psychically linked to the Dark Ones, intended to form a bridge between their species and his. Artyom vows to make amends by protecting the little Dark One, and the two travel to Polis, the Metro's central area, where a peace conference regarding D6 between the Rangers, Red Line, the Reich, and neutral Hansa is taking place. Artyom defeats Lesnitsky and Pavel during the trip. Along the way, the little Dark One senses that there is a group of hibernating Dark Ones in D6. After arriving at Polis, the little Dark One uses his telepathic abilities to make the Red Line leader, Chairman Moskvin, publicly confess <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> conference is a diversion to enable General Korbut to seize D6. Artyom {{and the rest of the}} Rangers rush to the bunker to make a final stand against Korbut's army, but are incapacitated by an armored train ramming into their station. Red Line soldiers surround, and prepare to execute Artyom and Miller.|$|E
5|$|In April 634, Abu Bakr {{invaded the}} Byzantine Empire in the Levant and decisively {{defeated}} a Byzantine army at the Battle of Ajnadayn. The Muslim armies marched north and laid siege to Damascus. The city was taken after a monophysite bishop informed Khalid ibn al-Walid, the Muslim commander in chief, {{that it was}} possible to breach city walls by attacking a position only lightly defended at night. While Khalid entered the city by assault from the Eastern gate, Thomas, commander of the Byzantine garrison, negotiated a peaceful surrender at the Jabiyah gate with Abu Ubaidah, Khalid's second in command. After the surrender of the city, the commanders disputed the terms of the peace agreement. The commanders finally agreed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> terms given by Abu Ubaidah would be met. The peace terms included an assurance that no pursuit will be undertaken by Muslims against the departing Roman convoy for three days. Having acquiesced to the peace terms, it was three days after the surrender of the city that Khalid set out after the Damascan refugees towards Antioch and defeated them in battle six days later, near present day Al Jayyad.|$|E
5|$|Soon, {{they find}} the espers and Terra convinces them to accept a truce with Gestahl. However, during the negotiations, Kefka attacks the espers, killing each of those still alive and {{capturing}} the magicite that remains from their essence. Additionally, he kills General Leo, who is appalled by Kefka's dishonorable tactics and attempts to defend the espers. The Returners reunite, now aware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> was a ploy for Gestahl to obtain magicite and the stone statue remains of the Warring Triad within the espers' now-unsealed land. Kefka and Gestahl travel through the open gate to the esper world, find the Warring Triad, and prompt the island on which the esper world is located to detach and fly in the sky as an ominous Floating Continent. The Returners attempt {{to stop them from}} causing further damage, but despite their efforts, they are unable to prevent Kefka and Gestahl from gaining the power of the statues. Now empowered, Kefka promptly kills Gestahl and moves the statues out of their proper alignment, upsetting the balance of magical power and causing the destruction of most of the surface world. In the disaster, the Returners are separated from one another as Setzer's airship is torn apart.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{government}} began {{negotiations with the}} Allies about the terms of surrender on 10August. During this period B-29 attacks on Japan were limited to a raid by the 315thBombardment Wing against an oil target {{on the night of}} 9/10August and a daytime precision bombing attack on a factory in Tokyo on 10August. The next day, President Truman ordered a halt to the bombing due to the possibility that it would be interpreted as a sign <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>peace</b> negotiations had failed. On 11August, Spaatz issued a new targeting directive for any renewed attacks that reduced the emphasis on bombing cities in favor of intensified attacks on transport infrastructure. On 13August, B-29s dropped copies of the Japanese government's conditional offer to surrender over Japanese cities. Negotiations appeared to be stalled, and on 14August Spaatz received orders to resume the bombing campaign. Arnold requested the largest attack possible, and hoped that USASTAF could dispatch 1,000 aircraft against the Tokyo region and other locations in Japan. In fact, 828 B-29s escorted by 186 fighters (for a total of 1,014 aircraft) were dispatched; during the day precision raids were made against targets at Iwakuni, Osaka and Tokoyama and at night the cities of Kumagaya and Isesaki were firebombed. While the Eighth Air Force units at Okinawa had not yet conducted any missions against Japan, General Doolittle decided not to contribute aircraft to this operation as {{he did not want to}} risk the lives of the men under his command when the war was effectively over. These were the last attacks conducted against Japan by heavy bombers, as at noon on 15August Hirohito made a radio broadcast announcing his country's intention to surrender.|$|E
