5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by <b>the</b> <b>rustling</b> of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E
5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to <b>the</b> <b>rustling</b> of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.|$|E
25|$|Spill {{can also}} {{introduce}} sounds {{which are not}} desired {{as part of the}} recording or live sound mix, such as the sound of a squeaking piano pedal, the clacking of keys on a bassoon, or <b>the</b> <b>rustling</b> of papers on a public speaker's podium.|$|E

25|$|Territorial Governor John C. Frémont, who {{had been}} the first Republican presidential {{candidate}} in 1856, was largely an absentee appointee. But in February 1881 he suggested to the territorial Legislature that they fund a state militia to ride against the outlaws and stop <b>the</b> <b>rustling.</b> The legislators hooted down his plan.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the first}} {{operation}} of the oracle of Delphi Temple, {{it was believed that}} the god lived within a laurel (his holy plant) and gave oracles for the future with <b>the</b> <b>rustling</b> of the leaves. It was also said that the art of divination had been taught to the god by the three winged sisters of Parnassus, the Thriae, at the time when Apollo was grazing his cattle there. The Thriae used to have a Kliromanteion (oracle by lot) in that area in the past and it is possible that such was the first oracle of Delphi, i.e. using the lot (throwing lots in a container and pulling a lot, the color and shape of which were of particular importance).|$|E
2500|$|Foley {{sound effects}} are sounds that {{synchronize}} on screen, and require {{the expertise of}} a foley artist to record properly. [...] Footsteps, the movement of hand props (e.g., a tea cup and saucer), and <b>the</b> <b>rustling</b> of cloth are common foley units.|$|E

60|$|Now {{the silence}} grew intense, {{so much so}} that <b>the</b> <b>rustle</b> of a lady's dress sounded loud in the great hall.|$|R
2500|$|Lecture {{halls and}} conference rooms pose the {{challenge}} of reproducing speech clearly to a large hall, which may have reflective, echo-producing surfaces. One issue with reproducing speech is that the microphone used {{to pick up the}} sound of an individual's voice may also pick up unwanted sounds, such as <b>the</b> <b>rustling</b> of papers on a podium. A more tightly directional microphone may help to reduce unwanted background noises.|$|E
2500|$|A {{noise gate}} sets a {{threshold}} where {{if it is}} quieter it will not let the signal pass {{and if it is}} louder it opens the gate. [...] A noise gate's function is in a sense the opposite to that of a compressor. [...] Noise gates are useful for microphones which will pick up noise which is not relevant to the program, such as the hum of a miked electric guitar amplifier or <b>the</b> <b>rustling</b> of papers on a minister's lectern. Noise gates are also used to process the microphones placed near the drums of a drum kit in many hard rock and metal bands. [...] Without a noise gate, the microphone for a specific instrument such as the floor tom will also pick up signal from nearby drums or cymbals. [...] With a noise gate, the threshold of sensitivity for each microphone on the drum kit can be set so that only the direct strike and subsequent decay of the drum will be heard, not the nearby sounds.|$|E

60|$|Swithin still slept on, and {{presently}} <b>the</b> <b>rustle</b> {{began again}} in the far- down interior of the column. The door could be heard closing, and <b>the</b> <b>rustle</b> came nearer, showing that she had shut herself in,--no doubt to lessen the risk of an accidental surprise by any roaming villager. When Lady Constantine reappeared at the top, and saw the parcel still untouched and Swithin asleep as before, she exhibited some disappointment; {{but she did not}} retreat.|$|R
