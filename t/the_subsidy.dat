5|$|In 2012, Iran's {{head of the}} Expediency Council, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, {{criticized the}} {{government}} for failing to reinvest the money it saved by restructuring government subsidies. To compensate, the government says it has allowed producers to adjust their prices more liberally and it has given free loans and energy subsidies in some cases. In recent years, income inequality in Iran has declined by different measures, which may be an effect of <b>the</b> <b>subsidy</b> reforms. For example, the income Gini coefficient fell from 0.4023 in 2005 to 0.3813 in 2010. Between February 2011 and February 2012, the government earned 510 trillion rials (some $41.6 billion) by implementing <b>the</b> <b>Subsidy</b> Reform Plan.|$|E

The first part of my work focuses on the Common European Policy and its functions for the farmers, whether it is needed for functioning of the agriculture or <b>the</b> <b>subsidies</b> are more harmful for it.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the {{government}} started to question <b>the</b> <b>subsidies</b> given to <b>the</b> NS. Not only were there {{questions regarding the}} way the NS spent <b>the</b> <b>subsidies,</b> but, after <b>the</b> neo-liberal reforms of the 1980s, it was also considered not done to award generic <b>subsidies</b> to companies. <b>The</b> government decided on the verzelfstandiging of the NS. (Although technically, {{this is not the}} case, but instead refers here to withdrawal of <b>the</b> <b>subsidies.)</b> <b>The</b> idea was that not only rail transport was economically viable, but that there could be competition as well.|$|R
5|$|In October 2012, 179 of 240 {{members of}} {{parliament}} {{voted in favor of}} pausing <b>the</b> <b>subsidy</b> reform, because of high inflation (exacerbated by the sanctions against Iran). Consequently, the growth in consumption of subsidized products rebounded in 2012.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, <b>the</b> <b>subsidy</b> is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government to the firm hence it has no effect on national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that while <b>the</b> <b>subsidy</b> reform plan needs further adaptation and fine-tuning, citizens must separate the questions of public policy from the issues of government legitimacy. The IMF has hailed Iran's economic reform and asked Iran's expertise {{to be transferred to}} other countries. The Economist Intelligence Unit has also praised Iran's subsidies reform plan for its positive effect on the economy in 2011.|$|E
40|$|Mortgage revenue bond (MRB) {{programs}} are frequently justified {{on the basis}} that they enable low- or moderate-income families to purchase houses that they otherwise could not afford. This article argues that evaluations of MRB programs must include estimates of the responses of buyers and sellers to <b>the</b> <b>subsidies.</b> <b>The</b> empirical evidence indicates that the behavioral responses reduce the efficiency of MRB programs (the amount of <b>the</b> <b>subsidies</b> provided to targeted households) and cause <b>the</b> <b>subsidies</b> to be distributed more inequitably than previous research has shown. The capitalization of 10 % to 14 % of the value of MRB subsidies diverts some of the program benefits to sellers. Horizontal inequities are created because one group of moderate-income households use <b>the</b> <b>subsidies</b> to purchase more housing services than unsubsidized households with the same incomes. ...|$|R

5|$|As of October 2011, {{consumption}} of liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel has cut between 4 and 19%, {{despite the fact}} that more than 1 million cars have been added to Iran's fleet. Increased use of compressed natural gas (CNG) to fuel cars has also reportedly played a role in this. According to the government, if oil products consumption had not been managed, {{consumption of}} gasoline would have increased to 120 million liters per day, while by reforming consumption pattern the figure has fallen to 60 million liters per day. In November 2011, the Government reported that <b>the</b> <b>subsidy</b> reform plan has saved Iran $6 billion.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of {{the plan}} will reduce waste and consumerism. In fact, {{according}} to official data, the higher income strata {{of the population has}} enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until now. On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic in Tehran. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>subsidy</b> plan will increase social justice through targeted social assistance. According to official data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile. Overall, implementation {{of the plan}} will increase productivity, efficiency, competitiveness of Iran's economy, economic growth, oil exports and per capita income (all other things being equal).|$|E
5|$|In {{his book}} which {{presented}} {{the model to}} the general public, Paul Krugman used {{the example of the}} aircraft industry, with the two players being Airbus and Boeing. In fact, Krugman and Baldwin examined the industry for wide bodied aircraft {{in the context of the}} model in a 1988 paper. The authors calibrate an extended version of the model in order to examine the effect of a subsidy to Airbus by European governments, and its presence in a market which can only support two firms at most, worldwide. They find that <b>the</b> <b>subsidy</b> had an unambiguously negative effect on welfare of the United States and a positive effect on rest of the world, which benefits from lower prices. The result for Europe hinges on price elasticity of demand; for relatively inelastic demand the net effect of subsidy is positive with most of the benefits accruing to European consumers, but for elastic demand, social welfare in Europe goes down. Importantly, unlike in the baseline Brander and Spencer model, Krugman and Baldwin find that the changes to consumer surplus resulting from <b>the</b> <b>subsidy</b> and entry, dominate the effect of changes in firm profits in social welfare calculations.|$|E
