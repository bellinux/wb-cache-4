In order to reduce structural components deformation caused by such temperature change, material <b>of</b> <b>truss</b> <b>frame</b> mostly adopts laminated composite material tubes, whose linear thermal expansion coefficient (LTEC) is very small. Therefore, accurate measurement <b>of</b> LTEC <b>of</b> <b>truss</b> <b>frame</b> materials over a broad temperature range is essential for successful mission. To address this issue, this paper proposes a general experiment platform for measuring LTEC of laminated composite material specimen reaching length up to one meter in the temperature range from –  100  °C to + 100  °C. The platform uses light-density optical fiber probe to measure length variation and thermocouple to record temperature variation.

Finally, LTEC measurement of a tubular composite materials specimen is conducted.

The understanding of basic elements of structural mechanics - springs, bars, beams and foundations - is gradually built up in one, two and three dimensions. Using these elements it is demonstrated how complex load-bearing structures can be modelled and analysed. Methods for linear as well as geometric and material nonlinear analyses are presented. In order to highlight the generality of the described methodology, a short section that addresses other areas of applied mechanics such as thermal conduction, moisture diffusion and groundwater flow is included. Three key learning objectives are supported: (1) knowledge of the basic theory of structural mechanics; (2) skills in modelling and analysis of structures and (3) ability to evaluate and improve the efficiency of proposed structural configurations in a design process.

Motivated {{by recent}} {{interest}} in group-symmetry {{in the area}} of semidefinite programming, we propose a numerical method for finding a finest simultaneous block-diagonalization of a finite number of symmetric matrices, or equivalently the irreducible decomposition of the matrix ∗-algebra generated by symmetric matrices.

40|$|The statics and {{mechanics}} of structures form a core aspect of civil engineering. This book provides {{an introduction to}} the subject, starting from classic hand-calculation types of analysis and gradually advancing to a systematic form suitable for computer implementation. It starts with statically determinate structures in the form <b>of</b> <b>trusses,</b> beams and <b>frames.</b> Instability is discussed {{in the form of the}} column problem - both the ideal column and the imperfect column used in actual column design. The theory of statically indeterminate structures is then introduced, and the force and deformation methods are explained and illustrated. An important aspect of the book’s approach is the systematic development of the theory in a form suitable for computer implementation using finite elements. This development is supported by two small computer programs, MiniTruss and MiniFrame, which permit static analysis <b>of</b> <b>trusses</b> and <b>frames,</b> as well as linearized stability analysis. The book’s final section presents related strength of materials subjects in greater detail; these include stress and strain, failure criteria, and normal and shear stresses in general beam flexure and in beam torsion. The book is well-suited as a textbook for a two-semester introductory course on structures. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{simultaneous}} analysis and design (SAND) is revisited with two objectives in mind: (i) to propose and evaluate alternative formulations for various structural and mechanical system optimization problems, and (ii) to study implementation {{aspects of the}} formulations. SAND formulates the optimization problem in a mixed space of design variables and behavior variables, to imbed the state equations in one single optimization framework. Therefore explicit analysis and design sensitivity analysis of the system are not needed.

40|$|Although most {{structures}} {{are designed to}} function under small deformation, their large deformation behavior {{can be used to}} estimate reliability and safety for survivorship from an accident or a natural disaster. Structures such as buildings, bridges, ships, vehicles and machinery are designed with a safety factor to protect certain assets from the unexpected and unknown elements. The large deformation analysis provides the rational basis for a safety factor. In this paper, the method of sequential limit analysis is used to compute large deformation solutions <b>of</b> <b>truss</b> and <b>frame</b> problems. Differing from the incremental method of plasticity, the limit analysis method is numerically stable, more effecient and requires simpler input data. A duality theorem serves as the foundation of an algorithm for computing the complete static and kinematic solutions simultaneously and for establishing their accuracy in each step of a deformation sequence. The phenomena encountered in large deformation such as loading-unloading under monotone deformation, bifurcation (more generally, loss of uniqueness) of solutions, and internal contact of structural members are revealed by the sequential limit analysis presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} computing an info-gap robustness function of structures, which is regarded as one measure of structural robustness, under uncertainties associated with the limit load factor. We assume that the external load in the plastic limit analysis is uncertain around its nominal value. Various uncertainties are considered for the live, dead, and reference disturbance loads based on the nonstochastic info-gap uncertainty model. Although the robustness function is originally defined by using the optimization problem with infinitely many constraints, we show that the robustness function is obtained as an optimal value of a linear programming (LP) problem. Hence, we can easily compute the info-gap robustness function associated with the limit load factor by solving an LP problem. As the second contribution, we show that the robust structural optimization problems <b>of</b> <b>trusses</b> and <b>frames</b> can also be reduced to LP problems. In numerical examples, the robustness functions, {{as well as the}} robust optimal designs, are computed for trusses and framed structures by solving LP problems. 1...|$|R
