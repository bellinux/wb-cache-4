5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to equip an army that would not unequivocally <b>take</b> <b>its</b> side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E
5|$|During an {{excursion}} into Przemysl Land in the 48th {{year of his}} reign, Władysław cought a cold {{from which}} {{he was unable to}} recover. He finally died in Grodek in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, Władysław III, and Lithuania to his younger, Casimir, both still minors at the time. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken for granted. Władysław's death ended the personal union between the two realms, and it was not clear what would <b>take</b> <b>its</b> place.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Hannah {{continued}} MSU's expansion by co-founding Michigan State University–Oakland, now Oakland University, with Matilda Dodge Wilson.

5|$|Mr Stoffberg's {{school did}} not <b>take</b> <b>its</b> pupils {{to the final}} stage of {{secondary}} education. Before Jan could set his schooldays behind him and commence his higher education he would have to sit the Matriculation exam.

5|$|Superstar Saga, {{developed}} by AlphaDream, {{is said to}} <b>take</b> <b>its</b> inspiration from the Nintendo 64 game Paper Mario; the two games have similar graphics and gameplay. The producers of the game were Shigeru Miyamoto, {{the creator of the}} Mario franchise, Tetsuo Mizuno, and Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo. The voice acting for Mario and Luigi in the game is provided by Charles Martinet, well known for providing the characters' voice in Nintendo's Mario franchise. The game's music was composed by Yoko Shimomura, who also composed the score for Super Mario RPG.|$|E

5|$|Taborn prefers earlier {{models of}} Fender Rhodes, for their raunchier sound. He also {{attempts}} to retain {{control over the}} sound that is presented to an audience when playing electronic instruments: he links his instruments to his own amplifier, and then has the venue <b>take</b> <b>its</b> feed from that amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The Tempest may <b>take</b> <b>its</b> overall {{structure}} from traditional Italian commedia dell'arte, which sometimes featured a magus and his daughter, their supernatural attendants, {{and a number}} of rustics. The commedia often featured a clown known as Arlecchino (or his predecessor, Zanni) and his partner Brighella, who bear a striking resemblance to Stephano and Trinculo; a lecherous Neapolitan hunchback who corresponds to Caliban; and the clever and beautiful Isabella, whose wealthy and manipulative father, Pantalone, constantly seeks a suitor for her, thus mirroring the relationship between Miranda and Prospero.|$|E
5|$|The {{built-in}} gyroscope {{allows for}} some image stabilization {{for the camera}} while recording video, although it still has room for improvement, since state-of-the-art image stabilization algorithms {{do not need to}} use a gyroscope, but use image processing. Other features of the camera are macro (for close up pictures) and faster capture including being able to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> first picture in 1.1seconds and the next half a second later.|$|E

50|$|Mont-Royal <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> {{name from}} Town of Mount Royal (in French, Ville-Mont-Royal), where {{the station is}} located; the town in turn, <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> name from Mount Royal, the {{mountain}} that dominates the Island of Montreal.|$|R
5|$|The {{pressure}} of the separation and constant press attention began to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> toll of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rebel}} capture of Brussels on 18 December, work soon began {{on a new}} constitution. In January, the rebels re-called the States-General, a {{traditional}} assembly composed of the provincial elites which had not met since the Middle Ages, to discuss the form the new state would <b>take.</b> <b>Its</b> 53 members, representing the states and social classes, met in Brussels in January 1790 to begin negotiations. The constitution eventually devised by the States-General was inspired by both the Dutch Verlatinge of 1581 and American Declaration of Independence of 1776. The liberals were disgusted that members of society from beyond the guilds, clergy and nobility should not be consulted. They also saw the closed sessions of the States-General as ridiculing the idea of popular sovereignty. The declaration of the independence was not supported by Britain and the Dutch who believed that the new independent state {{would not be able}} to act as an effective buffer against possible French territorial expansion in the region.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. Air interdiction and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over the course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E
50|$|The {{locality}} <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> {{name from}} the Terrica parish name, which in turn <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> name from early pastoral run spelt variously in the New South Wales Government Gazette as Terica, Terrea, Terren or Terrin.|$|R
50|$|The Flying Monk Ground, on {{the bank}} of the Tetbury Avon in the {{northern}} outskirts of the town, <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> name from a demolished public house which in turn <b>took</b> <b>its</b> name from Eilmer of Malmesbury.|$|R
50|$|Édouard-Montpetit station <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> {{name from}} the street under which it lies: Édouard-Montpetit Boulevard. The {{boulevard}} in turn <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> name from Édouard Montpetit (1881-1954), a Quebec lawyer, economist and academic closely linked with the nearby Université de Montréal.|$|R
5|$|In May 1809, {{the rebels}} {{captured}} Sjenica. They repulsed an Ottoman {{attack on the}} village of Suvodol in early June, and seized Novi Pazar later that month, but failed to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> fortress. Lacking numbers and adequate military training, they failed to establish a corridor to Montenegro and never came close to the Adriatic Sea. Karađorđe had described acquiring access to the sea {{as one of his}} key aims. The rebels experienced further setbacks in Niš, where 3,000 were surrounded at Čegar Hill in May–June 1809. Knowing that he and his men would be impaled if captured, rebel commander Stevan Sinđelić fired at his entrenchment's gun powder magazine, setting off a massive explosion that killed him and everyone else in the vicinity. On the site of the battle, the Ottoman commander Hurshid Pasha built a stone tower with the skulls of Sinđelić and his fighters embedded in its walls as a warning to others who wished to rebel.|$|E
5|$|It {{was planned}} that the 2nd Infantry Brigade would move past 1st Infantry Brigade once Grévillers was {{captured}} {{but it was}} forced into action early, when its commander, Brigadier General Robert Young, seeing that the 37th Division was struggling to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> objective of Biefvillers, decided to use his brigade to assist. Accordingly, two battalions cleared the village by 10:00 am although casualties were incurred when they were fired upon by some Whippet tanks. The commander {{of one of the}} attacking battalions, along with its padre, intervened and directed the tanks onto Biefvillers. With the village captured, this secured the flank of 1st Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Julia {{consisted}} of mainly a low-level swirl of clouds by late on September16; however, minimal convection kept the storm at the minimum requirements for a tropical cyclone. Early on September17, Julia weakened to a tropical depression. Despite {{a slight increase}} in convection and organization, wind shear and dry air continued to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> toll on the increasingly ill-defined storm, and Julia degenerated into a remnant low by early on September 19 after being devoid of convection for nearly 12hours. While moving north, the remnants of Julia then transitioned into a weak extratropical cyclone and made a small westward turn before dissipating inland over North Carolina on September21.|$|E
5000|$|A United States Post Office {{operated}} {{here from}} February 9, 1916 to July 30, 1927. The railroad spur <b>took</b> <b>its</b> name from nearby Crum Creek, {{a branch of}} the Kiamichi River, which in turn <b>took</b> <b>its</b> name from a local resident.|$|R
5000|$|Any {{element of}} R at which f <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> {{globally}} minimal value is invertible in R. If an f satisfying (EF2) is chosen, then the converse also holds, and f <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> minimal value exactly at the invertible elements of R.|$|R
5000|$|Shawmut, Montana {{is a small}} {{community}} near Harlowton. It <b>takes</b> <b>its</b> name from a train station, which, in turn, may have <b>taken</b> <b>its</b> name from the surname of a local rancher or may {{be connected to the}} railroad interests mentioned above.|$|R
