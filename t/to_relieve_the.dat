Tensions between Louis and the English barons began to increase, prompting a wave of desertions, including William Marshal's son William and William Longespée, who both returned to John's faction.|$|E

At the same time, it began large-scale mobilization {{in preparation for}} its campaign in Croatia. It was met with widespread refusal of mobilised personnel to report to their designated units, desertions and an overall lack of enthusiasm for the campaign. This resulted in low troop availability, forcing the JNA to deploy fewer infantry units. Response to the mobilisation was particularly poor in Central Serbia, where only 26 percent of those called up reported for service.|$|E
