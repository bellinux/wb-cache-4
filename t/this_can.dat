5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected {{back in the}} opposite direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, or if {{the far end of the}} line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E

5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> cause a comedo, (commonly called a blackhead or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E

5|$|An {{intrathecal}} pump infuses an opioid such as morphine {{directly into}} the fluid-filled space (the subarachnoid cavity) between the spinal cord and its protective sheath, providing enhanced analgesia with reduced systemic side effects. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> reduce the level of pain in otherwise intractable cases. An anxiolytic or a nonopioid analgesic, and local anesthetics may also be infused along with the opioid.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from this}} active communication, a good bughouse player tries to {{coordinate}} silently by {{keeping an eye}} on the other board and adapting moves accordingly. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> mean as little as glancing at the other board before trading queens, or as much as playing an opening adapted to the other board.|$|E

5|$|Clumber Spaniels shed at {{a medium}} pace. Clumbers tend to drool {{because of their}} very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies are {{especially}} curious and playful.

5|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{can also}} be used more broadly to identify species present in a body of water, debris filtered from the air, or sample of dirt. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> establish the range of invasive species and endangered species, and track seasonal populations.|$|E
5|$|Divergent {{evolution}} of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints. Nevertheless, some protease superfamilies have evolved from one nucleophile to another. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> be inferred when a superfamily (with the same fold) contains families that use different nucleophiles. Such nucleophile switches have occurred {{several times during}} evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.|$|E
