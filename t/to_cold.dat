5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} plant, {{meaning that}} it is resilient <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and freezing climatic conditions, dies back {{at the end of}} its growing season, has creeping rootstalks, and lives for over two years. It grows vigorously from seed over a period of 2â€“5 years, and thrives particularly well in freshly disturbed, cut or eroded peat. E.angustifolium is protogynous.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful {{work to be done}} underwater.|$|E

5|$|In the far {{future of}} the universe, {{assuming}} that proton decay does not occur, cold fusion occurring via quantum tunnelling would cause the light nuclei in ordinary matter to fuse into 56Fe nuclei. Fission and alpha-particle emission would then make heavy nuclei decay into iron, converting all stellar-mass objects <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> spheres of pure iron.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, {{when taken}} during the third {{trimester}} of pregnancy, may cause risk to the neonate, including benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, with possible symptoms including hypotonia, apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> stress. Symptoms of hypotonia and the neonatal benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome {{have been reported to}} persist from hours to months after birth. Other neonatal withdrawal symptoms include hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting). Breastfeeding by mothers using midazolam is not recommended.|$|E

5|$|Reversible pulpitis is {{characterized}} by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, such as when dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin (tertiary dentin) have been produced inside the pulp chamber, insulating against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response <b>to</b> <b>cold.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} was reactivated on 11 April 1947 in Boston. It remained {{as the major}} command of the Massachusetts Army National Guard, but its command took control of units from other states following consolidation of the Army National Guard. The division remained as an active reserve component of the Army National Guard, {{but it was not}} selected for any deployments <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> war contingencies. In 1956 the division received its distinctive unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|The redback spider's {{affinity}} for human-modified habitat has enabled it to spread to several countries via international shipping and trade. Furthermore, its tolerance <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> {{means that it}} {{has the ability to}} colonise many temperate countries with a winter climate cooler than Australia. This is concerning due to the risks to people being bitten who are unaware of its venomous nature, and also to the conservation of local threatened insect species that the redback might prey upon.|$|E

5|$|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} hypothyroidism (lack of production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical symptoms are tiredness, intolerance <b>to</b> <b>cold,</b> constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, {{as well as}} a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately {{succumb to the}} cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort. This adaptiveness {{is thought to be}} the reason why American alligators are widespread further north than the American crocodile. In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. When the water begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> tundra desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E

5|$|By December 15, {{newspapers}} had attributed 286 deaths to the blizzard, including 54 in New York, 51 in New Jersey (later {{confirmed as}} 52), 26 in Pennsylvania, and 71 in the New England states. Fatalities {{related to the}} storm and associated cold snap were far-reaching, involving 23 states. A wide variety of factors contributed to the high death toll, including over-exertion, exposure <b>to</b> <b>cold,</b> transportation accidents, structural fires, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The storm caused some isolated power failures along its path. In north-central Virginia, telephone and electricity lines were damaged. The blizzard cut electricity to all of Newtown, Connecticut, though it was mostly restored within hours. In Rhode Island, Block Island and some inland towns were without power. Short-lived power outages affected southern New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure <b>to</b> <b>cold.</b> Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E
5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive <b>to</b> <b>cold.</b>|$|E

5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1769, Day and his {{barrister}} friend, John Bicknell, chose Sabrina {{and another}} girl, Lucretia, from orphanages, and falsely declared {{they would be}} indentured to Day's friend Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Day took the girls to France to begin Rousseau's methods of education in isolation. After a short time, he returned to Lichfield with only Sabrina, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment. He used unusual, eccentric, and sometimes cruel, techniques to try to increase her fortitude, such as firing blanks at her skirts, dripping hot wax on her arms, and having her wade into a lake fully dressed to test her resilience <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> water.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
