5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Killer</b> <b>was</b> {{director}} Woo's {{follow-up to}} A Better Tomorrow 2 which {{was released in}} 1987.

According to producer Terence Chang, Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined A Better Tomorrow 2 and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio. When Chang refused, Hark began rejecting Woo's new film ideas, including ideas for films that would later be made, such as Bullet in the Head and Once a Thief.|$|E

5|$|Several {{witnesses}} {{testified against}} him. The widow Eliza Sharp {{testified that the}} voice of <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> <b>was</b> distinct. A test was devised allowing Mrs. Sharp to hear Beauchamp's voice; she immediately identified it {{as that of the}} killer. (Beauchamp claimed he had disguised his voice {{on the night of the}} murder and thought Mrs. Sharp would not recognize it). Patrick Henry Darby, an Old Court partisan, claimed that in 1824, he had a chance encounter with the man he now knew as Beauchamp. Darby said the man – a stranger to him at the time – had asked for Darby's help in prosecuting an unspecified claim against Sharp. The man then identified himself as the husband of Anna Cooke and said he intended to kill Sharp. Based on the circumstantial evidence, Beauchamp was held for trial at the next term of the circuit court in March 1826.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Killer</b> <b>was</b> {{not able}} to be filmed until actor Chow Yun-fat stepped in and enlisted the company he was {{contracted}} with, Golden Princess Film, to fund part of the project. Chow had worked previously with Woo on the two A Better Tomorrow films. Woo wanted Danny Lee to play Li Ying, but Lee was under an exclusive contract with Cinema City and was only able to work on The Killer if his production company, Magnum, was involved. John Woo approached his friend, Sally Yeh, asking her {{to be in a}} film to play an important female character. Yeh was currently contracted with Tsui Hark and accepted the role but later felt she did not give her best performance. The supporting roles were filled out by friends of the actors and director. Chu Kong was a friend of Chow Yun-fat who had entered retirement and returned to acting in The Killer as a favor. Two of Woo's close friends joined the cast: actor Kenneth Tsang and screenwriter Barry Wong. Wong Wing-Hang was hired to be the director of photography for The Killer but had to leave the set {{for an extended period of}} time, so Peter Pau was added to shoot the rest of the film.|$|E

5|$|Working as the Deputy Surveyor, Jones {{began to}} build good {{relations}} with the Mississauga Ojibwa Indians and Mohawk Indians of the area. He became fluent in the languages of these groups and earned the trust of many members of the tribes, including influential members like Joseph Brant, of whom he became a good friend. In 1797 the head chief of the Mississaugas in the Credit River area Wabakinine, as well as his wife, were murdered {{by a member of the}} Queen's Rangers. Wabakinine had been a very beloved chief and seen as a firm ally of the British. His murder shocked the members of his band and other local Ojibwa bands. Charles McEwan, <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> <b>was</b> charged and tried, but the Indian witnesses did not attend the trial and he was subsequently acquitted for lack of evidence. Nimquasim, a local Indian chief, met with Augustus Jones on February 15, 1797 and confessed to Jones that he and the local Indian bands were inclined to wage open war against the British over the event. Jones relayed this information to British administrator Peter Russell. The town of York had about 675 white settlers and 135 soldiers, a number that Russell believed might not be sufficient to address an Indian rebellion. If a winter rebellion transpired York would be cut off from large garrisons at the Bay of Quinte and the Niagara Peninsula. Russell and John Graves Simcoe both anticipated rebellion for the next year or so, but it never came. Joseph Brant, a Mohawk chief who had travelled to England cautioned the tribes against rebellion as he knew the military strength of the British was likely to render any war a losing one. Russell, however, set out to undermine alliances and friendships between the Indian bands of southern Ontario, fearing such an uprising.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Anthony Lapalla, a {{psychologist}} at the Federal Correctional Institution in Texarkana, believed <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> <b>was</b> planning to continue to make unexpected attacks such as that of Virgil Starks on the outskirts of town. He also believed that the same person committed the murders of Virgil Starks, Betty Jo Booker, Paul Martin, Polly Ann Moore and Richard Griffin. He also believed <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> <b>was</b> between the ages of middle 30s to 50 years old. He said that <b>the</b> <b>killer</b> <b>was</b> apparently motivated by a strong sex drive and that he was a sadist. He said that a person who would commit such crimes is intelligent, clever, shrewd and often not apprehended. According to Lapalla's theories, the killer knew at all times what was being done in the investigation and knew that the lonesome roads were being patrolled, which is why he chose the house on the farmland. He pointed out that his statements were surmised theories that were based on {{a large number of people}} who have committed similar crimes. He said in many cases the killer is never apprehended and in some instances he will divert attention to other distant communities where it is believed the crimes are committed by a different individual or else he will overcome the desire to kill and assault women.|$|E

50|$|A notable {{distinction}} of The Kindaichi Case Files <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> <b>killers</b> <b>are</b> not depicted as psychopathic murderers and the murders are never committed for financial reasons alone. <b>The</b> identified <b>killers</b> all have deep rooted problems, often involving great emotional trauma through the greed or thoughtlessness of others, as {{their reasons for}} committing the murder(s). Thus <b>the</b> <b>killers</b> <b>are</b> often portrayed as sympathetic figures, as opposed to cold, calculating killers in some other mystery series.|$|R
