40|$|<b>Carve</b> <b>out</b> {{projects}} have recently become an emerging issue {{in practice and}} theory given the diversity of strategic foci of companies as well as recent merger and acquisition activities. This paper highlights the relevance of IT in such <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> projects. IT depicts their characteristics and specific features with regard to general IT projects as well as success factors {{for the management of}} IT <b>carve</b> <b>outs.</b> Based on a systematic literature review, we conducted 18 exploratory expert interviews with different stakeholders involved in the management of IT <b>carve</b> <b>outs.</b> We show that the perception and acknowledgement of the IT function within the overall <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> project is broadly underestimated. We elaborate on learnings for the successful management of the IT function within a <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> project: the involvement of IT executives in the early phases of contract negotiations; improved IT due diligence processes for a better anticipation of IT costs; early analysis of the target enterprise architecture. Additionally, we identified success factors of managing IT <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> projects. This paper is among the first to shed light into the research field of IT <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> projects including exploratory empirical data and gives recommendations for future research of IT <b>carve</b> <b>outs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Equity <b>carve</b> <b>outs,</b> {{the partial}} listing of a {{corporate}} subsidiary, appear to be transitory arrangements, usually dissolved {{within a few years}} by either a complete sale or a buy back. Why do firms perform expensive listings just to reverse them thereafter? We interpret <b>carve</b> <b>outs</b> as strategic options to attract information from the market over the relative value of a productive unit as an independent entity and thus to improve the decision process on whether to sell out or to retain control. The separate listing is costly, as it reduces coordination of production, but generates valuable information from the market over the optimal allocation of ownership. We compute the optimal timing for the final sale or buy back decisions, the value of the strategic options embedded in the <b>carve</b> <b>out</b> and the optimal shares retained. The model explains the temporary nature of <b>carve</b> <b>outs,</b> and suggests an explanation for many empirical findings. In particular, it explains why <b>carve</b> <b>outs</b> are more common in sectors with high uncertainty and in more informative markets.
