50|$|ESSA-1 had {{a similar}} design {{to that of the}} <b>TIROS</b> <b>satellite</b> series. It was an 18-sided right prism, {{measuring}} 107 cm across opposite corners and 56 cm. It had a reinforced baseplate, which carried most of the subsystems and a cover assembly (hat). ESSA-1 had approximately 10,000 1-cm by 2-cm solar cells, which charged 21 nickel-cadmium batteries. ESSA-1 was designed to take pictures of daytime cloud cover, record them, and transmit them when it was in range of a ground acquisition station.|$|E
50|$|The 270 lb (122 kg) {{satellite}} {{was launched}} into a nearly circular low earth orbit by a Thor Able rocket. Drum-shaped with a 42-inch (1.1 m) diameter, and height of 19 inches (48 cm), the <b>TIROS</b> <b>satellite</b> carried two six-inch (15 cm) long television cameras. One of the cameras had a wide-angle lens with an f /1.6 aperture that could view an 800-mile-wide area of the Earth. The other camera had a telephoto lens with an f /1.8 aperture and 10- to 12-power magnification compared to the wide angle camera.|$|E

40|$|Ground based {{pyranometer}} {{measurements were}} combined with meteorological {{data from the}} <b>Tiros</b> N <b>satellite</b> in order to estimate clear-sky insolations at five U. S. sites for five weeks {{during the spring of}} 1979. The estimates were used to develop a semi-empirical model of clear-sky insolation for the interpretation of input data from the Tiros Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Using only satellite data, the estimated standard errors in the model were about 2 percent. The introduction of ground based data reduced errors to around 1 percent. It is shown that although the errors in the model were reduced by only 1 percent, TOVS data products are still adequate for estimating clear-sky insolation...|$|R

5000|$|Late on August 19, Tropical Storm Doreen {{was first}} located with a <b>TIROS</b> <b>satellite</b> image. The next day, a ship, the San Juan Prospector {{reported}} winds of 40 knots (45 mph, 70 km/h) and a pressure of 975 mbar (hPa). At this time, Doreen {{was moving to}} the northwest as 10 knots. On August 21, Doreen altered its course to the west, but reversed back to its original heading the next day. On the August 22, the ship Kyoyu Maru, which was {{just north of the}} storm's center reported winds of 60 knots (70 mph, 115 km/h). Over the next few days, the storm gently recurved northward but then slowed down and headed to the southwest. On August 30, Tropical Storm Doreen crossed the Central Pacific where it dissipated the next morning. During the course of the system, 13 ships reported winds related to Doreen, [...] but no damage was reported.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Betsy {{can be traced}} back to an area of {{disturbed}} weather southwest of Cape Verde that first identified via <b>TIROS</b> <b>satellite</b> imagery on August 23. Tracking westward, the tropical wave was intercepted by a United States Navy reconnaissance airplane early on August 27, which concluded that the disturbance had become a tropical cyclone of moderate intensity. Based on information from the flight, it was estimated that the system had organized into a tropical depression by 0000 UTC on August 27, 350 mi east-southeast of Barbados. Although operationally the United States Weather Bureau office in San Juan, Puerto Rico upgraded the disturbance to tropical storm intensity three hours after their first tropical cyclone bulletin that same day, post-analysis indicated that the tropical depression had remained at the same intensity up until 1200 UTC on August 29. Nonetheless, the tropical cyclone was given the name Betsy for a period of time as a tropical depression, contrary to typical tropical cyclone naming procedure. As Betsy approached the Windward Islands, it began to move in a more northwesterly direction, and was briefly located in the Caribbean Sea during the overnight hours of August 28 before re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean the following day, after which Betsy was upgraded to tropical storm classification in post-analysis.Upon moving to the northwest of the Leeward Islands, Betsy entered conditions favorable for marked development. An upper-level trough centered a short distance north of the tropical storm enhanced outflow conditions and speed divergence. Under these conditions, Betsy proceeded to quickly intensify, and reconnaissance missions tasked by the United States Air Force and Weather Bureau indicated that the tropical storm had reached hurricane intensity by 0000 UTC on August 30, centered roughly 200 mi north-northeast of Puerto Rico. By coincidence, forecast responsibilities were transferred to the Weather Bureau Office in Miami, Florida at the same time; however, the hurricane was still under the purview of the Weather Bureau per se. Due to increasing atmospheric pressure heights to the north, Betsy drastically slowed in forward speed and intensification, and remained stationary for a period of time on August 31 before it began to drift westward. On September 2, Betsy began to quickly intensify, and after strengthening to a Category 3 hurricane-equivalent - a major hurricane on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale - the small hurricane attained Category 4 intensity and reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) at 0000 UTC on September 4, while situated well north of the Turks and Caicos.|$|E

One of these gratings will be employed in the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer, an instrument of the Remote Atmospheric and Ionospheric Detector System to be flown aboard a <b>TIROS</b> <b>satellite</b> in 1991.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the significant milestones {{in the use}} of satellites for snow and ice monitoring. The feasibility of such monitoring was demonstrated by the <b>Tiros</b> 2 <b>satellite</b> in 1961. Nimbus 1 showed that breaks in the sea ice can be easily monitored during continuous nighttime conditions; Nimbus 3 showed the practicality of delineating regions of active melting of ice and snow in temperate areas. Landsat data {{have been found to be}} particularly useful for monitoring and studying glaciers and their attendant surface features. Ice concentration can be determined with reasonable accuracy from a sequence of electronically scanned microwave radiomenter images made aboard Nimbus 5. In the future we can expect improved sensors and spacecraft systems with longer operating lives...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the application of a pressure modulated radiometer (PMR) to the remote sensing of trace amounts of gases in the atmospheres {{as well as to the}} direct measurement of upper atmospheric winds. The PMR operates as a gas correlation spectrometer. Compared to conventional gas correlation parameters, it has some advantages which are related to greater versatility and the employment of a simpler method for maintaining electrical/optical balance. The PMR has a high sensitivity in connection with its essentially very high effective resolution. It represents a passive system and emits no radiation. A PMR is flown on Nimbus 6 which was launched in 1975. The instrument has also been used on the Nimbus 7 <b>satellite</b> and the <b>Tiros</b> N <b>satellite...</b>|$|R

The weather forecast capabilities of the various weather <b>satellites</b> (<b>Tiros,</b> SEOS, Nimbus) are discussed, and the development of additional satellite systems is examined. A rational approach is development that leads to the establishment of the economic benefits which may result from the utilization of meteorological satellite data. The economic and social impacts of improved weather forecasting for industries and resources management are discussed, and significant weather sensitive industries are listed...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tiros</b> <b>satellite</b> {{microwave}} measurements {{together with}} radiosonde data {{are used to}} illustrate a method for deriving vertical temperature distributions in the atmosphere {{on the scale of}} 100 km. The method employs N equations in N unknowns. The unknowns are the N coefficients which are needed at each pressure level to multiply the measured N radiances in order to retrieve the vertical temperature distributions. As an example, the spatial variation of the tropopause characteristics is derived over a cyclone. Diurnal variations in the radiances and the consistency of radiosondes and satellite radiance data need further investigation...|$|E

It {{seems to us}} the code isn't optimization. A series of optimum group sync codes (n = 60) have been searched out with error tolerance E = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10, 12. Their error sync probabilities are less than the error sync probability of the TIROS code (from two times to two order of magnitudes about). These optimum or qansi-optimum codes will be presented for application in the second generation of the Meteorological Satellites of China...|$|E
40|$|Since 1960, when NASA {{launched}} the <b>Tiros</b> <b>satellite</b> {{to study the}} atmosphere of the earth, great advances {{have been made in the}} study of the earth system by means of remote sensing. It is felt that the time has come for assembling the separate pieces into a coherent whole. Work has, therefore, been conducted to develop a concept called 'global habitability'. The objective of the considered program is to investigate long-term physical, chemical, and biological trends and changes in the earth's environment, including its atmosphere, land masses, and oceans. The program is specifically concerned with a study of the effects of natural and human activities on the earth's environment, and with the future effects on biological productivity and habitability of the earth by man and by other species...|$|E
40|$|Satellite data {{analysis}} tools are developed and implemented for {{the diagnosis of}} atmospheric circulation systems over the tropical Pacific Ocean. The tools include statistical multi-variate procedures, a multi-spectral radiative transfer model, and the global spectral forecast model at NMC. Data include in-situ observations; satellite observations from VAS (moisture, infrared and visible) NOAA polar orbiters (including <b>Tiros</b> Operational <b>Satellite</b> System (TOVS) multi-channel sounding data and OLR grids) and scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR); and European Centre for Medium Weather Forecasts (ECHMWF) analyses. A primary goal is {{a better understanding of}} the relation between synoptic structures of the area, particularly tropical plumes, and the general circulation, especially the Hadley circulation. A second goal is the definition of the quantitative structure and behavior of all Pacific tropical synoptic systems. Finally, strategies are examined for extracting new and additional information from existing satellite observations. Although moisture structure is emphasized, thermal patterns are also analyzed. Both horizontal and vertical structures are studied and objective quantitative results are emphasized...|$|R
50|$|The Star {{was used}} to propel {{most of the other}} upper stages used on the Atlas E/F, however it was also used in its own right on several launches. A Star-17A was used in the launch of the RM-20 {{spacecraft}} on 12 April 1975, giving the rocket a LEO payload of 725 kg, while the Star-37S-ISS {{was used to}} launch nineteen DMSP, NOAA and <b>Tiros</b> weather <b>satellites</b> between 1978 and 1995. With the Star-37 upper stage, the rocket could place 1100 kg into a Sun-synchronous orbit. The RM-20 launch failed due to damage to the first stage, caused by the explosion of residual fuel in the flame trench during launch. Another launch failed due to stage separation occurring at the correct time despite the first stage burn being extended by fifty seconds to resolve an underperformance issue, the end result of which was the upper stage separating and igniting whilst the first stage was still firing.|$|R
40|$|NASA's {{contribution}} to tape recorder technology {{may appear to}} lie in such glamorous devices as the tape recorders of the <b>Tiros</b> and Nimbus <b>satellites</b> which receive signals carrying weather information during an orbit around the earth and then transmit those signals {{back to the ground}} when the satellite is in view of ground stations. These quite important recording devices are, however, only useful as members of a complex hierarchy of devices all of which participate in the ultimate process of obtaining information from NASA's efforts. Their existence and utility is based on the existence of many more prosaic recording devices which {{have been involved in the}} development of such spectacular units...|$|R
40|$|Moon {{measurements}} made at Tromso, and at Spitzbergen, 70 and 78 N, back in {{the fifties}} have been re-evaluated. One has {{to take into account}} that the wedge calibration will change when the focussed image of the moon on the inlet slit is used. A correction was later decided to be used after several experiments in Dobsons Laboratory in Oxford. The absorption coefficients have been changed since the observations were taken and evaluated the first time. The re-evaluated ozone values have been plotted, in one diagram for Spitzbergen, and in one for Tromso. The zonal mean value for ozone is given as a reference. Ozone measurements from the winter season 1985 / 86 and 1986 / 87 made at the same places are presented. Here the daylight measurements are incorporated and also <b>TIROS</b> <b>satellite</b> data from single point data retrieval are given. The two winter seasons were very different. In the first we had a late final stratospheric warming, and in the other we had an early final stratospheric warming. This {{can be seen from the}} 30 millibar temperatures, provided by Barbara Naujokat, and plotted in the diagrams. Again the zonal mean values of ozone are given as reference...|$|E
40|$|Using daily {{measurement}} {{of day and}} night infrared and incoming and absorbed solar radiation obtained from a <b>TIROS</b> <b>satellite</b> {{over a period of}} approximately 45 months, and integrated over 2. 5 degree latitude-longitude grids, the proportion of cloud cover over each grid each day was derived for the entire period. For each of four three-month periods, estimates a and b of the two parameters of the best-fit beta distribution were obtained for each grid location. The (a,b) plane was divided into a number of regions. All the geographical locations whose (a,b) estimates were in the same region in the (a,b) plane were said to have the same cloud cover type for that season. For each season, the world was thus divided into separate cloud cover types. Using estimates of mean cloud cover for each season, the world was again divided into separate cloud cover types. The process was repeated for standard deviations. Thus for each season, three separate cloud cover models were obtained using the criteria of shape of frequency distribution, mean cloud cover, and variability of cloud cover. The cloud cover statistics were derived from once-a-day, near-local-noon satellite radiation measurements...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{analysis is}} made of the extratropical stratospheric circulation {{in terms of the}} seasonal variation of large-scale motion fields, with the aid of height and temperature data obtained from the <b>TIROS</b> <b>satellite.</b> Special attention is paid to a comparison of climatological aspects between the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and the Southern Hemisphere (SH). In order to see the general picture of the annual mach of the upper stratosphere, the zonal mean values of geopotential height of the 1 mb level at 70 deg N and 70 deg S were plotted on the daily basis throughout a year. It is observed that, during the winter, the zonal mean 1 mb height in the NH is much more variable than that in the SH. It is also notable that the SH height is rather oscillatory throughout the longer period from midwinter to early summer. Since the zonal mean height in the polar latitude is a rough measure of the mean zonal flow in extratropical latitudes, the difference of the seasonal variation between the two hemispheres mentioned above is considered to be due mainly to the planetary wave-mean flow interaction in the middle atmosphere. The wave activity in the middle atmosphere is represented more rigorously by the Eliassen-Palm flux associated with vertically propagating planetary waves forced from below. The day-to-day variation of the EP flux in the upper stratosphere shows that the wave activity varies intermittently with a characteristic time scale of about two weeks...|$|E
40|$|Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) was {{incorporated}} by NASA in the <b>Tiros</b> 8 weather <b>satellite.</b> APT included an advanced satellite camera that immediately transmitted a picture {{as well as}} low cost receiving equipment. When an advanced scanning radiometer was later introduced, ground station display equipment would not readily adjust to the new format until GSFC developed an APT Digital Scan Converter that made them compatible. A NASA Technical Note by Goddard's Vermillion and Kamoski described {{how to build a}} converter. In 1979, Electro-Services, using this technology, built the first microcomputer weather imaging system in the U. S.

40|$|In {{a survey}} of {{examples}} of formative tropical cyclones viewed by the <b>TIROS</b> <b>satellite,</b> and a comparison {{of many of these}} views with surface, upper-air, and time and space-section analyses, it is found that the upper-level structure of the formative cyclone of moderate intensity is grossly {{similar to that of the}} storm at maturity. Common features in most examples studied include: (1) an upper-level trough or shear line which preceded the low-level trough and which moved with the storm system; and (2) an upper-level ridge or anticyclone which was generally superimposed over the convective area east of the lower-level trough or vortex. As has been found with the mature storm, strong subsidence occurred urder the upper trough and coincided with a cloudiness minimum area in advance of the major convective cloudiness and west of the trough axis. Upward vertical motion with heavy convective activity was suggested under the upper-level ridge or anticyclone to the rear of the lower-level trough. Several examples depict these features and demonstrate changes that occurred as the storms passed individual stations. The TIROS photos were invaluable in this study as a source of additional data for confirming the distribution and type of cloudiness, for implying flow patterns at upper and lower levels, and for providing the basis for reasonable estimates of the stage of development of the entire system. It is concluded that an easterly wave model incorporating an upper-level trough and ridge or anticyclone as integral features of the moving system is one which describes most adequately the majority of observations concerning formative tropical cyclones of moderate intensity and is one which is especially satisfying in terms of fulfilling the various theoretical and physical considerations.
