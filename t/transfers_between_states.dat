50|$|Making Tracks is the {{cooperative}} program between the NWTF and state, federal and provincial wildlife agencies to restore wild turkeys to all suitable habitat in North America. The NWTF works with wildlife agencies coordinating the trap and transfer of wild turkeys. Wild turkey populations {{have more than}} doubled since 1990. In areas where they are abundant, wild turkeys are trapped via nets propelled or dropped over a feeding flock. Trapped birds are individually placed in specialized transport boxes, and then released in areas of suitable habitat with few or no wild turkeys. The NWTF routinely provides trapping equipment, transfer boxes and helps coordinate wild turkey <b>transfers</b> <b>between</b> <b>states,</b> provinces and nations. Since the 1950s, state and provincial wildlife agencies have moved more than 192,000 wild turkeys into suitable habitat across North America. The NWTF, founded in 1973, helped accelerate those efforts by providing trapping equipment, transfer boxes, funding and volunteers. Currently, there are more than 7 million wild turkeys throughout North America.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explore a}} variety of {{experiments}} within linear, two-wire, magnetic atom guides. Experiments include guiding of Rydberg atoms; <b>transferring</b> <b>between</b> <b>states</b> while keeping the atoms contained within the guide; and designing, constructing, and testing a new experimental apparatus. The ultimate goal of the atom guiding experiments {{is to develop a}} continuous atom laser. The guiding of Rydberg atoms is demonstrated. The evolution of the atoms is driven by the combined effects of dipole forces acting on the center-of-mass degree of freedom as well as internal-state transitions. Time delayed microwave and state-selective field ionization are used to investigate the evolution of the internal-state distribution as well as the Rydberg atom motion while traversing the guide. The observed decay time of the guided-atom signal is about five times that of the initial <b>state.</b> A population <b>transfer</b> <b>between</b> Rydberg <b>states</b> contributes to this lengthened lifetime, and also broadens the observed field ionization spectrum. Transfer from one guided ground state to another is studied. In our setup, before the atoms enter the guide, they are pumped into the $|F= 1, m_F=- 1 rangle$ state. Using two repumpers, one tuned to the $F= 1 rightarrow F'= 0 $ transition and the other tuned to the $F= 1 rightarrow F'= 2 $ transition, the atoms are pumped <b>between</b> these guided <b>states.</b> Magnetic reflections within the guide are also studied. Design and construction of a new linear magnetic atom guide is detailed. This guide~$beta$ has many improvements over the original guide~$alpha$: a Zeeman slower, magnetic injection, a physical shutter, and surface adsorption evaporative cooling are some of the main changes. Testing of this new system is underway.
