5|$|During {{his year}} of consulship in 519 {{relations}} with the East Roman Empire flourished and the Acacian schism between the Eastern and Western Christian churches was ended. Whilst Eutharic was nominally a statesman, politician and soldier of the Roman Empire, {{he was also an}} Arian, whose views clashed with the Catholic majority; as consul enforcing Theoderic's tolerant policy towards <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people,</b> he incurred resentment from the local Catholics, whose traditions were less than tolerant. Following disturbances in Ravenna, where Catholics burnt down a number of synagogues, Eutharic's siding with <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people</b> of Ravenna was reported with resentment in a fragmentary contemporary chronicle.|$|E

After the British released him, he joined the Stern Gang, who were fighting to remove the British from Palestine. He and Hansi Brand lived {{for the rest of their}} lives in Israel, at first moving to the Givat Brenner kibbutz, then Tel Aviv, with their two sons.|$|E
5|$|In the Book of Esther it {{is related}} that Haman, a public servant, plots to get Esther's husband, the King of Persia, to slay all <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people</b> in his land. The King, {{who is going}} over his books during a sleepless night, realises {{something}} is amiss. Esther, discovering the plot, denounces Haman, and her husband orders his execution on a scaffold he has built. The King's eunuchs promptly carry this out. Michelangelo shows Haman crucified with Esther looking at him from a doorway, the King giving orders in the background.|$|E

5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of the power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people.</b> Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E

5|$|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is {{a notorious}} antisemitic {{literary}} forgery, probably written {{under the direction}} of the Russian secret police in Paris, that purported to reveal a conspiracy by <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people</b> to achieve global domination. It was exposed as a work of fiction in 1920 by Lucien Wolf and the following year by Philip Graves in The Times. Once exposed, it disappeared from mainstream discourse, Barkun writes, until interest in it was renewed by the American far right in the 1950s. Its use was spread further by conspiracy groups on the internet.|$|E

5|$|The {{contemporary}} Catholic {{chronicle of}} the Anonymus Valesianus portrays Eutharic {{in a negative}} light, connecting him with taking the Jews' side in anti-Jewish disturbances in Ravenna over the Jewish congregation's rights to their synagogue; the disagreement prompted a conflict between the Arians and Catholics as the Arian Eutharic chose to side with <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people.</b> It is thought that the outrage expressed by the Catholics at this action was in proportion to Eutharic's being {{a symbol of the}} recent reconciliation between the Eastern and Western Churches brought about under the direction of Theoderic.|$|E

5|$|During Levy's tenure, {{the synagogue}} had several congregants who were famous, or would become so. Ray Frank, the first Jewish woman to preach {{formally}} from a pulpit in the United States, settled in Oakland around 1885, and taught Hebrew Bible studies and Jewish history at First Hebrew Congregation's Sabbath school, {{where she was}} superintendent. Her students there in the 1880s included Gertrude Stein, later to become a famous writer, and Judah Leon Magnes, who would become a prominent Reform rabbi. Magnes's views of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people</b> were strongly influenced by First Hebrew's Rabbi Levy, {{and it was at}} the building on 13th and Clay that Magnes first began preaching—his bar mitzvah speech of 1890 was quoted at length in The Oakland Tribune.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann's trial {{before the}} Jerusalem District Court began on 11 April 1961. The legal {{basis of the}} charges against Eichmann was the 1950 Nazi and Nazi Collaborators (Punishment) Law, under which he was indicted on 15 {{criminal}} charges, including crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes against <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people,</b> and membership in a criminal organisation. The trial was presided over by three judges: Moshe Landau, Benjamin Halevy and Yitzhak Raveh. The chief prosecutor was Israeli Attorney General Gideon Hausner, assisted by Gabriel Bach of the Department of Justice and Tel Aviv District Attorney Yaakov Bar-Or. The defence team consisted of German lawyer Robert Servatius, legal assistant Dieter Wechtenbruch, and Eichmann himself.|$|E
5|$|In AD 26, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is {{a wealthy}} prince and {{merchant}} in Jerusalem, {{who lives with}} his mother, Miriam (Martha Scott); his sister, Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell); their loyal slave, Simonides (Sam Jaffe); and Simonides' daughter, Esther (Haya Harareet). Esther loves Judah, but is committed to another. Judah's childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala (Stephen Boyd), is now a tribune. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in the glory of Rome and its imperial power, while Judah is devoted to his faith and the freedom of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people.</b> This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum demanding that Judah delivers potential rebels amongst the populace to the Roman authorities.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Ben Shoshan and Yehuda Etzion, both {{members of}} the Gush Emunim Underground, plotted {{to blow up the}} al-Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Etzion {{believed}} that blowing up the two mosques would cause a spiritual awakening in Israel, and would solve all the problems of <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people.</b> They also hoped the Third Temple of Jerusalem would be built on the location of the mosque. On 15 January1988, during the First Intifada, Israeli troops fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters outside the mosque, wounding 40 worshipers. On 8October1990, 22 Palestinians were killed and over 100 others injured by Israeli Border Police during protests that were triggered by the announcement of the Temple Mount Faithful, a group of religious Jews, {{that they were going to}} lay the cornerstone of the Third Temple.|$|E

5|$|Most Jews, {{religious}} and secular, consider {{the wall to}} be important to <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people</b> since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple. They consider the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19-year gap. There are, however, some haredi Jews who hold different views. Most notable are the adherents of the Satmar hasidic dynasty who retain the views espoused by their Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who would not approach the Wall after the 1967 conquest because of his opposition to Zionism, although he did visit the site during his visits to the Holy Land in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|To aid in his {{ministry}} to <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people,</b> Jesus {{was given the}} ability to perform miracles, by permission of God rather than by his own power. Through {{his ministry}}, Jesus {{is seen as a}} precursor to Muhammad. According to the Quran, Jesus was not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by Allah, who physically raised Jesus into the heavens. To Muslims, it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus will return to earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (ad-Dajjal) by killing him in Lud.|$|E
5|$|The {{victories}} of Operation Barbarossa in {{the summer}} and fall of 1941 against Hitler's new enemy, the Soviet Union, led to dramatic changes in Nazi anti-Jewish ideology and the profile of prisoners brought to Auschwitz. Construction on Auschwitz II-Birkenau began in October 1941 to ease congestion at the main camp. Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, head of the Schutzstaffel (SS), intended the camp to house 50,000 prisoners of war, who would be interned as forced laborers. Plans called for the expansion of the camp first to house 150,000 and eventually as many as 200,000 inmates. An initial contingent of 10,000 Soviet prisoners of war arrived at Auschwitz I in October 1941, but by March 1942 only 945 were still alive, and these were transferred to Birkenau, where most of them died from disease or starvation by May. By this time Hitler had decided to annihilate <b>the</b> <b>Jewish</b> <b>people,</b> so Birkenau was repurposed as a combination labor camp/extermination camp. The Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum estimates that 1.3 million people, 1.1 million of them Jewish, were sent to the camp during its existence.|$|E
