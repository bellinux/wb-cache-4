40|$|Array and pointer {{references}} are often ambiguous in that compile time analysis cannot always determine if distinct {{references are}} to the same object. Ambiguously aliased objects are not allocated to registers by conventional compilers due {{to the cost of}} the loads and stores required <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>register</b> copies consistent with memory and each other. These instructions affect performance by generating memory traffic. There are several hardware and software strategies {{that can be used to}} solve the ambiguous alias problem; we have implemented one such scheme called CRegs in a compiler and instruction level simulator. We present a modification to Briggs' optimistic coloring algorithm that allows us to allocate local and parameter arrays to CRegs. The CRegs register file operation and instruction set modifications required to implement this scheme are discussed. Underlying hardware issues such as pipeline impact and chip area are briefly discussed. Several benchmarks are compared in [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The brain can use {{multiple}} reference frames to code line orientation, including head-, object-, and gravity-centered references. If these frames change orientation, their representations must {{be updated}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>register</b> with actual line orientation. We tested this internal updating during head rotation in roll, exploiting the rod-and-frame effect: The illusory tilt of a vertical line {{surrounded by a}} tilted visual frame. If line orientation is stored relative to gravity, these distortions should also affect the updating process. Alternatively, if coding is head- or frame-centered, updating errors should {{be related to the}} changes in their orientation. Ten subjects were instructed to memorize the orientation of a briefly flashed line, surrounded by a tilted visual frame, then rotate their head, and subsequently judge the orientation of a second line relative to the memorized first while the frame was upright. Results showed that updating errors were mostly related to the amount of subjective distortion of gravity at both the initial and final head orientation, rather than to the amount of intervening head rotation. In some subjects, a smaller part of the updating error was also related to the change of visual frame orientation. We conclude that the brain relies primarily on a gravity-based reference to remember line orientation during head roll...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} the development of register records in Bohemia by comparing the recent records in registry books with those issuing from the oldest registry books.

The importance of this thesis is to highlight the fact that the records in the registry books were originally determined to be registers of received sacraments arising from the clerical regulations issued by the Roman Catholic Church. The Trident Council instructed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>registers</b> of christening and marriages. But the implementation into practise of these registers took longer than it was expected. The register agenda in the Czech lands was not uniform until the 18 th century. The proper integration of the register agenda was stated after this period on the basis of state regulations.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Information Technology)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2007 The {{registration}} {{model is}} {{a very important part of}} any tertiary education institution's value chain, as this is the first contact that many students have with the institution. Therefore it is of extreme importance that this process runs efficiently and is well organised, as a poorly run registration model can damage the image of the institution. This study is part of a strategic planning initiative by the School of Modelling Sciences. Due to the fact that BSc students are high up on the subsidy scale, recruitment personnel are going to focus on recruiting BSc students, with a goal of having 100 first year BSc students. Currently the first year BSc students are registered in 5 hours. Given the expected increase, management wants to know how many resources should be added to the various sub-processes in the registration model <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>registering</b> the first year BSc students in 5 hours, with more than 85 % of students realizing a turnaround time of less than 120 minutes. This will be accomplished through building a representative simulation model on which the various number of students will be tested to see what their influence will be on the time needed to complete the first year BSc registration. If this time is above 5 hours, resources will be added until the registration is completed in 5 hours and more than 85 % of students realize a turnaround time of less than 120 minutes. With cost being a factor in deciding on a solution, estimated costs will be provided for each solution in order to aid decision making. Master...|$|R
