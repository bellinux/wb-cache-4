5000|$|The GT22HW-2 was a {{departure}} from the standard production of the GT22 Series as it was a custom model designed to meet the conditions of Yugoslavia. This multipurpose locomotive was introduced with a turbocharger (<b>T),</b> <b>Head</b> End Power (H) for passenger use and EMD Dash 2 Electronics (-2), with an A1A-A1A axle arrangement. Due to the locomotive's compact appearance, the length was shortened by 1.25 feet (381 mm) from a normal GT22CW-2. Thirty four of these locomotives were manufactured by Đuro Đaković between February 1981 and August 1984.

50|$|The gauges {{are locked}} by {{twisting}} the knurled {{end of the}} handles, this action is performed to exert {{a small amount of}} friction on the telescopic portions of the gauge (the smaller diameter rods found at the <b>T</b> <b>head</b> of the gauge). To use, the gauge is inserted at a slight angle to the bore and gently locked to a size slightly larger than the bore while at that angle. Then, rocking the handle side-to-side, slowly move the handle across the bore to the other side. The rocking will first align the gauge with the bore axis and the act of moving the handle {{to the other side of}} the bore will bring it to the exact bore diameter. This action compresses the two anvils where they remain locked at the bores dimension after being withdrawn.|$|E
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} the most common cancer {{diagnosed}} in American males. However, current methods of screening for prostate cancer have low sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing patients with prostate cancer. A new methodology of screening for prostate cancer was formulated by developing a method and device to quantify the traditional digital rectal exam. The Quantitative Digital Rectal Exam (QDRE) measures the relative compliance at discrete locations on the posterior surface of the prostate. The <b>Test</b> <b>Head</b> of the QDRE indents the prostate and measures the pressure distribution across a rigid disk using an matrix of pressure transducers. The position of the <b>Test</b> <b>Head</b> is tracked by the Location Tracking System. The Mapping Algorithm analyzes each <b>Test</b> <b>Head</b> measurement and the position information recorded by the Location Tracking System, and generates a map showing magnitudes and locations of relative compliance across the measured surface of the prostate. A proof of concept test used a mock-up of the <b>Test</b> <b>Head,</b> a mechanical Location Tracking System and a rudimentary Mapping Algorithm to examine a clinical model of the prostate which had one nodule. The results were presented as a map of the measured surface of the prostate model, and results showed the size of the nodule (6. 4 mm in diameter) and the relative compliance of the nodule (0. 08 relative to the healthy tissue of the model), as well as the location within the measured surface. by Stacy J.

5000|$|Having a zero copula {{is one way}} {{to solve}} the {{problems}} listed above without compromising the existing syntactic theory. The verb is present, just covertly as [...] "null."Using X-bar theory, it is possible to both account for the grammaticality of constructions such as [...] "I happy" [...] as well as explain how the subject DP is derived. In X-bar theory, there are no obligatory lexical categories that make up a sentence; instead, there are only general X-bar rules: the specifier rule, adjunct rule, and complement rule. Therefore, the theory accurately permits the AP [...] "happy" [...] as grammatical even without a verb since AP can be a complement to the <b>T</b> <b>head</b> (see Figure 2).Additionally, under the VP-internal subject hypothesis, the subject [...] "I" [...] will be generated in the specifier of VP and, using the DP movement, it will move to the specifier position of TP. Consequently, the resulting surface structure of the nominal sentence [...] "I happy" [...] is properly generated under this analysis.|$|E
