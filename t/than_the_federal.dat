5|$|Canada is a {{federation}} {{composed of}} ten provinces and three territories. In turn, {{these may be}} grouped into four main regions: Western Canada, Central Canada, Atlantic Canada, and Northern Canada (Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Together, the provinces collect more revenue <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, {{the federal government can}} initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the Canada Health Act; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. Equalization payments are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.|$|E
5|$|During a {{press conference}} on January 25, 1989, Metro Director Alan Gibbs {{confirmed}} that the granite had been quarried in South Africa and announced that an investigative report would be delivered to the Metro Council Transit Committee the following week. The announcement was met with calls from King County Councilman Ron Sims to fire the responsible Metro officials who knowingly allowed the purchase. Metro's ban on South African goods was stricter <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> sanctions, which only prohibited importation of specific materials such as steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products, and was used by UMTA to threaten to pull its funding for the bus tunnel project.|$|E

50|$|Forty-three states—all except Indiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont—give their {{governors}} {{some form}} of line-item veto power.

5000|$|One {{prominent}} role of Lombard credit is in use by <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve System of the United States of America. Traditionally, the discount rate, or the rate {{charged by the}} Fed to member banks in need of funds (ostensibly to maintain the required reserve ratio), was lower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> target <b>federal</b> funds rate, or the rate charged among banks for {{the same type of}} overnight credit. This meant that banks could borrow from the Central Bank at a lower rate than they could from each other, which somewhat conflicts with the Central Bank's role as a [...] "lender of last resort". A discount rate lower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rate typically charged by another bank opened the possibility of arbitrage and thus required extra scrutiny of potential borrowers. <b>The</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve Board of the United States switched to a so-called [...] "Lombard facility," [...] in which the discount rate is actually higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> targeted <b>federal</b> funds rate, thus creating an economic incentive for banks to look elsewhere before asking to borrow from the Fed.|$|R

25|$|In American {{political}} discourse, states' {{rights are}} political powers {{reserved for the}} state governments rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government according to the United States Constitution, reflecting especially the enumerated powers of Congress and the Tenth Amendment.

As a result, the federal government took over enforcement of much of North Carolina's worker safety laws.

25|$|McCain {{opposes the}} federal minimum wage; instead he {{believes}} that each state should decide its own minimum wage.

He also {{voted in favor of}} maintaining the filibuster against a bill to increase the federal minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to $7.25. This would effectively repeal the federal minimum wage.

25|$|In April 2014, the United States Senate {{debated the}} Minimum Wage Fairness Act (S. 1737; 113th Congress). The bill would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to {{increase}} the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour {{over the course of}} a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Portman opposed the bill, arguing that Ohio already had a higher minimum wage <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> minimum wage, indicating that the states should be able to make their own decisions.|$|E
25|$|Nor {{could the}} federal {{government}} take its component states to task. The initial federal budget was quite small, limiting {{the federal government}}'s ability to use its financial largesse as a carrot. It was dependent upon grants from the United Kingdom and from its member states. The provincial budgets of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago were both larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> budget. This led to repeated requests for those states to provide greater financing to the federal government. These requests were not well received, as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago together already contributed 85 {{percent of the federal}} revenue, in roughly equal portions.|$|E

25|$|Drug {{sentencing}} guidelines {{under state law}} in America are generally much less harsh <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> {{sentencing guidelines}}, although great irregularities exist. The vast majority of drug felonies and almost all drug misdemeanors in the United States are prosecuted at the state level. The federal government tends to prosecute only drug trafficking cases involving large amounts of drugs, or cases which have been referred to federal prosecutors by local district attorneys seeking the harsher sentences provided under the federal sentencing guidelines. In rare instances, some defendants are prosecuted both federally and by the state for the same drug trafficking conduct. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a defendant does not face double jeopardy if he is convicted and sentenced by {{both the state and}} federal government for the same underlying criminal conduct.|$|E

On 8 July, a federal judge ruled the state's same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional. The couple married in the state's capital of Tepic. Four lesbian couples requested injunctions after being denied marriage licenses by the Civil Registry in early July 2014. On 31 October 2014, it was announced by the Civil Association CODISE that nine couples were awaiting decisions on injunctions.
