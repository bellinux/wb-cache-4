5|$|Some of the city's necessities such as coal {{arrived by}} barge, but most came by road. Carts, carriages, horses and {{pedestrians}} were crowded {{together and the}} gateways in the wall formed bottlenecks through which {{it was difficult to}} progress. The nineteen-arch London Bridge was even more congested. The better-off used hackney carriages and sedan chairs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> destinations without getting filthy. The poor walked, and might be splashed by the wheeled vehicles and drenched by slops being thrown out and water falling from the overhanging roofs. Another hazard was the choking black smoke belching forth from factories which made soap, from breweries and iron smelters and from about 15,000 houses burning coal.|$|E

In addition, though the distance between trenches varied between 7 and 500 yards, workers tried to erect barbed wire defences as far away from their trench as possible, to prevent the enemy from getting too close to the trench, or possibly lobbing in grenades.|$|E

The classes are about one hour in length, with occasional double periods lasting two hours. Classes end around five o'clock. First-year students get Friday afternoons off, while sixth- and seventh-year students have several free periods during the week. In the evening, students eat their dinner in the Great Hall, after which they are expected to be in their common rooms. Astronomy classes take place late at night in the Astronomy Tower.|$|E
25|$|These census numbers show a 363,000 {{population}} {{increase in the}} western states and territories between 1860 and 1870. Some of this increase is because of a high birth rate in the western states and territories, but most is from emigrants moving from the east {{to the west and}} new immigration from Europe. Much of the increase in California and Oregon is from emigration by ship, as there was fast and reasonably low cost transportation via east and west coast steamships and the Panama Railroad after 1855. The census numbers imply at least 200,000 emigrants (or more) used some variation of the California/Oregon/Mormon/Bozeman trails <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> new homes between 1860 and 1870.|$|E

There is a possibility for some passengers (for example, those allergic to perfume) to ask security to use a narrow corridor which bypasses the shop. Nonetheless, the layout has been criticized by teetotalist organizations. The airport's response is that the layout was needed due to the terminal's small size. The shop has also been criticized for informing passengers who purchase less than their permitted tax-free quota of alcohol that {{they are allowed to}} purchase more. The Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs indicated that this may violate the ban on alcohol advertising.|$|E

25|$|As {{the years}} passed, the Oregon Trail became a heavily used {{corridor}} from the Missouri River to the Columbia River. Offshoots {{of the trail}} continued to grow as gold and silver discoveries, farming, lumbering, ranching, and business opportunities resulted in much more traffic to many areas. Traffic became two-directional as towns were established along the trail. By 1870 {{the population in the}} states served by the Oregon Trail and its offshoots increased by about 350,000 over their 1860 census levels. With the exception of most of the 180,000 population increase in California, most of these people living away from the coast traveled over parts of the Oregon Trail and its many extensions and cutoffs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> new residences.|$|E
25|$|Tackling is {{the only}} way to stop a player from running and is a major part of any team's defence. A good tackle stops the player from moving forward and {{prevents}} them from passing the ball. It can also put an opponent under pressure and force the ball loose. There are five styles of tackles commonly used by players: the side, rear, passive front, active front and smother. The aim of the active front tackle is to drive the opponent backwards, while the smother tackle prevents the opposing player passing the ball. Once the player has been brought to ground, the tackler typically tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> feet quickly and compete for the ball. Other players arriving at the tackle will also compete for the ball.|$|E
25|$|Svenskhuset (the Swedish House) is {{the oldest}} house on Spitsbergen. The house was erected by the Swedes on Cape Thordsen in Isfjorden, and was {{intended}} to withstand the harsh conditions of the Svalbard winters. A group of Norwegian seal hunters were stuck on the island {{in the autumn of}} 1872. They sought out the Finland-Swedish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, who at the time was conducting an expedition in the area, for assistance. Nordenskiöld did not have the resources to accommodate all the hunters, so it was agreed that a number of the men would make their way to Svenskhuset, where they knew there would be food, coal and equipment. Seventeen men without families were selected, and on 14 October 1872 they set out for Svenskhuset in row boats. The journey was 350 km (220 mi), and it took the crew seven days <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> destination.|$|E

25|$|The cunning folk of Britain {{were often}} from the {{societal}} class that included artisans, tradesmen, and farmers, {{and as such}} were commonly at least semi-literate and of a higher social position than common labourers. In many cases they continued in their ordinary line of work alongside earning money as a professional cunning man or woman {{in order to gain}} the maximum possible income. In almost all cases, cunning folk worked either alone, as a solitary magical practitioner, or with one other person, such as a spouse or sibling. The only known exception was in early nineteenth-century Manchester, where a group of cunning men used to meet in a group centred around the most prominent of their members, a cunning fellow called Rawlinson. This method of working alone was one factor that separated the cunning folk from the stereotype of witches then prevalent in Britain, which often held that these witches met together in groups, sometimes known as covens, and at times flew through the air in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> meeting points.|$|E
25|$|Freight and World War II traffic helped pay {{off some}} of the debt the SIRT had accumulated, briefly making the SIRT profitable. B freight trains {{operated}} to Staten Island, in addition to Jersey City. Around this time, B crews began running through without changing at different junctions. Regular B crews, and Staten Island crews were separated, meaning that the crews had to change before they could get into Staten Island. All traffic to and from Cranford Junction in New Jersey was handled by the SIRT crews. During the war, all east coast military hospital trains were handled by the SIRT–the trains came onto Staten Island via Cranford Junction, with some trains stopping at Arlington to transfer wounded soldiers to a large military hospital. The Baltimore & New York Railway line become extremely busy between Cranford Junction and the Arthur Kill, with troop movements, prisoner-of-war trains and war material operating over this stretch <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> appointed destinations. Two B subsidiaries, the B and the Staten Island Rapid Transit, were merged on December 31, 1944. Since the Baltimore & New York Railway opened in 1890, the SIRT operated this line with locomotives belonging to itself and to its parent company, the B Around the time of the second World War, the B operated special trains for important officials. One special was operated for former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill. The train took him to Stapleton, from where he boarded a boat to cross the Atlantic. The SIRT made special accommodations for the trip, including a shined-up locomotive with sporting polished rods, white tires, and an engine crew clad in white uniforms.|$|E
