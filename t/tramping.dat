25|$|Backpacking is {{the outdoor}} {{recreation}} of carrying gear on one's back, while hiking {{for more than}} a day. It is often but not always an extended journey, and may or may not involve camping outdoors. In North America tenting is common, where simple shelters and mountain huts found widely in Europe are rare. In New Zealand, <b>tramping</b> is an equivalent term though overnight huts are frequently used. Hill walking is the equivalent in Britain, though backpackers make use of all kinds of accommodation, in addition to camping. Backpackers use simple huts in South Africa. Similar terms used in other countries are trekking and bushwalking.|$|E

An account of {{the horror of the}} conditions on the Ypres Salient, written by the war correspondent Philip Gibbs, was used for the League's information leaflets. Planned publications included the Ypres Book of Valour. The League also had a marching song, called <b>Tramping</b> along to a little tin whistle and an old toy drum, a version of which was published in 1926.|$|E

Riiser-Larsen agreed and secured the use of two Dornier Do J Wal seaplanes. The expedition, however, was forced to land close to the Pole, badly damaging one of the planes. After twenty-six days on an ice shelf, first trying to shovel tons of snow to create an airstrip, until someone suggested the easier way of <b>tramping</b> the snow surface, the expedition's six members squeezed themselves into the remaining plane.

Surveyors quickly encountered problems, however, when they discovered the land selected for the new settlement was still inhabited by Māori, who expressed astonishment and bewilderment to find Pākehā <b>tramping</b> through their homes, gardens and cemeteries and driving wooden survey pegs into the ground.

Outdoor leisure activities dominate, with beaches, river, mountain biking, <b>tramping,</b> and golf, being popular. In summer, many large scale events attract domestic tourists including the Spring Racing Carnival, The Blossom Parade, Harvest Hawkes Bay Weekend, and various concerts and events. The Blossom Festival was once a large national event in the mid-20th century, with charter trains from Wellington and Auckland coming for the event. This however has slowly declined in popularity.|$|E

The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] was inspired by Diamond Head's [...] "Dead Reckoning" [...] and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. [...] "Metal Militia", {{one of the fastest}} songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity. Mustaine composed the main riff, which emulates a marching army.

These positions created a line about [...] long.

Orwell's aunt Nellie Limouzin also lived in Paris and gave him social and, when necessary, financial support. He led an active social life, worked on his novels and had several articles published in avant-garde journals.|$|E
