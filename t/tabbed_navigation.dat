40|$|Reference and {{instruction}} librarians at North Park University {{have long been}} avid users of LibGuides, but, like many librarians, we had some concerns about the usability of the default three-column layout and the <b>tabbed</b> <b>navigation</b> in LibGuides 1. We were happy to see that Springshare addressed these concerns in LibGuides 2, offering more flexibility in layout and navigation options. Before migrating to the new platform, we ran a usability study to compare the effectiveness {{of each of these}} options for research guides aimed at undergraduate students. This session will share the methods and results of that study, which took a close look at three different variables: number of columns, placement of navigation menu, and level of integration with the library website. After discussing the results, we will demonstrate how we applied those results to North Park 2 ̆ 7 s instance of LibGuides v 2...|$|E

50|$|In computing, the <b>tabbing</b> <b>navigation</b> is {{the ability}} to {{navigate}} between focusable elements (such as hyperlinks and form controls) within a structured document or user interface (such as HTML) with the tab key of a computer keyboard. Usually, pressing Tab will focus on the next element, while pressing Shift + Tab will focus on the previous element. The order of focusing can be determined implicitly (based on physical order) or explicitly (based on tab index). In general, tabbing is cyclical, not linear, meaning that the tabbing will cycle to the first/last element when it moves away from the last/first element.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the past}} Web browsers have used <b>tabbing</b> <b>navigation</b> {{to change the}} focus within an interface, by {{pressing}} the tab key of a computer keyboard {{to focus on the}} next element (or Shift + Tab to focus on the previous one). The order is based on that in the source document. For HTML without any style, this method usually works as the spatial location of the element is in the same order of the source document. However, with the introduction of style via presentational attributes or stylesheets such as CSS, this type of navigation is being used less often. Spatial navigation uses the arrow keys (with one or more modifier key held) to navigate on the [...] "2D plane" [...] of the interface. For example, pressing the [...] "up" [...] arrow key will focus on the closest focusable element on the top (relative to the current element). In many cases, this could save many key presses.|$|R
40|$|In mobile {{computing}} and other contexts, latency {{is a more}} critical resource than bandwidth. Interactive performance relies on low latency response to the user. The {{question of how much}} performance is necessary (and when) is still open. These sources of latency manifest themselves in different ways and with differing severities. When designing systems for a Web 2. 0 framework, {{it is important to have}} a good means for measuring existing latencies as well as simulating new latencies, throughout all parts of a system. This report discusses a web app latency analysis framework with respect to a set of representative tasks. These tasks include: web usage, <b>navigation</b> with <b>tabs,</b> <b>navigation</b> between many open windows, and significant copying and pasting.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of the position of navigation buttons on the intuitive operation of iPad applications for children in middle childhood. When using iPads for educational reasons it is important that applications are designed as intuitive as possible. Well-designed and intuitive applications make educational content more accessible and support children in their learning process. In a 2 by 2 factor between subject experiment with 84 children (Mage = 7. 7), I investigated how the vertical position (top vs. bottom) and the horizontal distance (close vs. distant) of navigation buttons influence the (1) time children need to <b>tab</b> different <b>navigation</b> buttons (next, back, home) and (2) the degree to which children perceive navigation buttons as intuitive. In addition to the experiment, children were also asked both open and closed interview questions. Results show that children perceive navigation buttons that are positioned at the bottom of the screen and distant from each other as most intuitive. Further research is required to investigate intuitive symbols for navigation buttons for children in middle childhood. Keywords...|$|R
