5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the juries were substantially different, but that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge {{that they were not}} deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> {{when the}} {{decision}} is meaningful to the person deciding value, the likely rating is based {{on his or her}} attitudes (positive, neutral, or negative) towards the name and towards the painting in question. The participants also were asked to rate some of the objects twice and believed that, at session's end, they would receive two of the paintings they had positively rated. The results indicated a great increase in the positive attitude of the participant towards the liked pair of things, whilst also increasing the negative attitude towards the disliked pair of things. The double-ratings of pairs of things, towards which the rating participant had a neutral attitude, showed no changes during the rating period. Therefore, the existing attitudes of the participant were reinforced during the rating period, and the participants suffered cognitive dissonance when confronted by a liked-name paired with a disliked-painting.|$|E

25|$|Another type of device {{people use}} {{to help their}} recall memory become {{efficient}} chunking. Chunking {{is the process of}} breaking down numbers into smaller units to remember the information or data, this helps recall numbers and math facts. An example of this chunking process is a telephone number; this is chunked with three digits, three digits, then four digits. People read them off as such when reciting a phone number to another person. There has been research done about these techniques and an institution tested two groups of people to see if these types of devices work well for real people, the results came back determining a significant performance difference between the group who did not use cognitive strategies and the group who did. The group using the techniques immediately performed better than the other group and when taking a pre-test and post-test <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> the group using the techniques improved while the other group did not.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia. In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that,</b> after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations. A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not {{have an effect on the}} development of taste disorders in cancer patients. An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to immunocompromised cancer patients. Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.|$|E

500|$|The {{volatile}} seaborgium(VI) compounds SgCl6 and SgOCl4 {{are expected}} to be unstable to decomposition to seaborgium(V) compounds at high temperatures, analogous to MoCl6 and MoOCl4; this should not happen for SgO2Cl2 due to the much higher energy gap between the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, despite the similar Sg–Cl bond strengths (similarly to molybdenum and tungsten). Thus, in the first experimental chemical studies of seaborgium in 1995 and 1996, seaborgium atoms were produced in the reaction 248Cm(22Ne,4n)266Sg, thermalised, and reacted with an O2/HCl mixture. The adsorption properties of the resulting oxychloride were measured and compared with those of molybdenum and tungsten compounds. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> seaborgium formed a volatile oxychloride akin to those of the other group 6 elements, and confirmed the decreasing trend of oxychloride volatility down group 6: ...|$|E
500|$|When Maunsell {{inherited}} the design as CME of the Southern Railway, he began trials using the weakest N15 (No.442) in 1924. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>indicated</b> <b>that</b> better performance {{could be obtained}} by altering the steam circuit, valve travel and draughting arrangements, although the first two recommendations were deemed too costly for immediate implementation by the Locomotive Committee. Eight extra King Arthur-type boilers were ordered from North British and fitted to N15s Nos.737742 by December 1925 {{in an effort to}} improve steaming. The remaining Urie boilers were fitted with standard Ross pop safety valves to ease maintenance. Maunsell also addressed draughting problems caused by the narrow Urie [...] "stovepipe" [...] chimney. The exhaust arrangements were modified on No.737 using the King Arthur chimney design and reduced-diameter blastpipes. This proved successful, and all [...] "Urie N15s" [...] were modified over the period 19251929. The oil-burning equipment was refitted to Nos.737 and 739 during the 1926 General Strike and removed in December of that year.|$|E

The young king's mother was found through the DNA testing of a mummy designated as 'The Younger Lady' (KV35YL), which was found lying beside Queen Tiye in the alcove of KV35. Her DNA proved that, like his father, she was a child of Amenhotep III and Tiye; thus, Tutankhamun's parents were brother and sister.
