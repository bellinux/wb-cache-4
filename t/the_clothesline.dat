25|$|Though JBL {{held the}} title for many months, most title matches were won controversially. At Survivor Series, JBL {{defeated}} Booker T to retain his WWE Championship by hitting Booker {{in the face}} with the title belt when the referee was knocked out. JBL defeated Eddie Guerrero, The Undertaker, and Booker T in a Fatal Four-Way at Armageddon after a run-in by Heidenreich, who incapacitated the Undertaker, allowing JBL to take advantage and hit Booker with <b>the</b> <b>Clothesline</b> From Hell to get the pinfall victory.|$|E
25|$|According to widely {{accepted}} local and family tradition, Anna Strong's {{role in the}} ring was to signal Brewster that a message was ready, as he ran regular trips with whaleboats across the Sound {{on a variety of}} smuggling and military missions. She did this by hanging a black petticoat on her clothesline at Strong Point in Setauket, which was easily visible by Brewster from a boat in the Sound and by Woodhull from his nearby farm after he began to operate almost exclusively from home. She would add a number of handkerchiefs for one of six coves where Brewster would bring his boat and Woodhull would meet him. Historian Richard Welch writes that the tradition of <b>the</b> <b>clothesline</b> signal is unverifiable, but it is known that the British suspected a woman of disloyal activities at Setauket who fit Anna's profile.|$|E
500|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} between John Cena and John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL). JBL dominated {{most of the}} match, {{as he began to}} work on Cena's surgically-repaired right pectoral muscle. Mid-way in the match, Cena attempted a powerbomb but Cena collapsed and could not execute the move. JBL controlled most of the match, as Cena tried to avoid JBL's assaults. JBL also applied numerous submission maneuvers on Cena. JBL performed <b>the</b> <b>Clothesline</b> from Hell on Cena and attempted another Clothesline from Hell but Cena avoided the move and executed an FU for the win.|$|E

60|$|So Ozma {{ordered the}} Gump taken apart. The antlered head was again {{hung over the}} mantle-piece in the hall, and the sofas were untied {{and placed in the}} {{reception}} parlors. The broom tail resumed its accustomed duties in the kitchen, and finally, the Scarecrow replaced all <b>the</b> <b>clotheslines</b> and ropes on the pegs from which he had taken them on the eventful day when the Thing was constructed.|$|R
500|$|Another group, under Volney C. Wilson, was {{responsible}} for instrumentation. They also fabricated the control rods, which were cadmium sheets nailed to flat wooden strips, cadmium being a potent neutron absorber, and the scram line, a Manila rope that when cut would drop a control rod into the pile and stop the reaction. Richard Fox, who made the control-rod mechanism for the pile, remarked that the manual speed control that the operator had over the rods was simply a variable resistor, controlling an electric motor that would [...] <b>the</b> <b>clothesline</b> wire over a pulley that also had two lead weights attached to ensure it would fail-safe and return to its zero position when released.|$|E
2500|$|After the on air {{character}} of Faarooq disappeared from WWE TV, Bradshaw proceeded {{to take on}} a J. R. Ewing esque gimmick, becoming a heel {{for the first time since}} 1999 complete with a suit, cowboy hat, and tie as he began his first main event push. He began referring to himself as John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield, or JBL. His finishing move's name was part of the overhaul, becoming <b>the</b> <b>Clothesline</b> From Wall Street until he later changed it back to its original name. His first promo was on the border between Texas and Mexico, where he hunted for incoming illegal immigrants in order to win a [...] "Great American Award", which granted the winner number one contendership to the WWE Championship. He won, thanks to the then-SmackDown! heel general manager Kurt Angle, and immediately challenged Eddie Guerrero for the title.|$|E
2500|$|JBL's luck {{continued}} in early 2005; at the Royal Rumble, he snuck past both Big Show and Kurt Angle in a Triple Threat match when he pinned Angle after <b>the</b> <b>Clothesline</b> From Hell. He once again emerged with his title intact from WWE's first-ever Barbed Wire Steel Cage match at No Way Out against Big Show. JBL won the match when Big Show chokeslammed JBL {{off the top}} rope through the ring. JBL managed to crawl {{out from under the}} ring apron before Show could make it to the floor, winning the match by escape. On the next episode of SmackDown!, JBL had a [...] "Celebration of Excellence" [...] in which he and his Cabinet celebrated {{the fact that he was}} the longest-reigning WWE Champion in ten years, a party which was broken up and ruined by Big Show and newly crowned number one contender John Cena. JBL was aggravated consistently by John Cena to make him retaliate as John Cena could then strike back. Cena failed to convince Layfield to do so.|$|E

2500|$|At The Great American Bash, Guerrero {{defended the}} title against JBL in a Texas bullrope match. JBL won after Angle (who was General Manager of SmackDown! at the time) {{reversed}} the decision after Guerrero {{appeared to have}} retained the title. On the July 8 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero pulled a switcharoo with Shannon Moore, who was wrestling as [...] "El Gran Luchadore" [...] and wore the costume. The next week on SmackDown!, Guerrero faced JBL in a steel cage match for the WWE title where El Gran Luchadore appeared again and cost Guerrero the match; he later revealed himself as Kurt Angle. Guerrero continued his feud with Angle again. At SummerSlam, Guerrero lost to Angle after submitting to his ankle lock. Guerrero then allied himself with Big Show. Each week Angle and his new allies Luther Reigns and Mark Jindrak began targeting Guerrero and Big Show. Guerrero defeated Reigns in a singles match at No Mercy. General Manager Theodore Long booked a Survivor Series Elimination match between {{a team led by}} Guerrero and a team led by Angle. Guerrero's team consisted of himself, Big Show, John Cena (replacing the originally chosen Rey Mysterio), and Rob Van Dam. At Survivor Series, Guerrero's team defeated Angle's team. Guerrero, along with Booker T and The Undertaker, then challenged JBL for a WWE Championship rematch. Along the way, Guerrero found a partner in Booker T. At Armageddon, Guerrero and Booker's initial teamwork broke away, and the match ended with JBL pinning Booker following <b>the</b> <b>Clothesline</b> From Hell. Afterwards, Guerrero and Booker briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to win the WWE Tag Team Championship.|$|E

50|$|In wrestling, a lariat is when an attacking wrestler runs {{towards an}} opponent, wraps {{his arm around}} their upper chest and neck and then forces them to the ground. This move {{is similar to a}} <b>clothesline,</b> <b>the</b> {{difference}} being that in a <b>clothesline</b> <b>the</b> wrestler's arm is kept straight {{to the side of the}} wrestler during the move, while in the lariat the wrestler strikes their opponent with his arm.|$|R

50|$|This is a move {{in which}} a wrestler will spin in place before hitting an attack, like <b>the</b> discus <b>clothesline,</b> discus punch, or the discus forearm.

60|$|So {{there seemed}} {{no way out}} of their dilemma and being {{helpless}} they simply sat still. Ojo, {{who was on the}} front of the raft, looked over into the water and thought he saw some large fishes swimming about. He found a loose end of <b>the</b> <b>clothesline</b> which fastened the logs together, and taking a gold nail from his pocket he bent it nearly double, to form a hook, and tied it to the end of the line. Having baited the hook with some bread which he broke from his loaf, he dropped the line into the water and almost instantly it was seized by a great fish.|$|E

Teams would be tasked with counting all of the yellow umbrella (297). When they wrote the correct answer on a chalkboard and presented it to a judge at a café in Rua da Regueira, they would get their next clue.
