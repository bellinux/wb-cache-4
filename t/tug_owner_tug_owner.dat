They are very popular with small port craft <b>owners</b> and <b>tug</b> <b>owners.</b> These fenders are compression moulded in high-pressure thermic-fluid-heated moulds and have excellent seawater resistance.|$|R
50|$|The {{railways}} {{sued the}} <b>tug</b> <b>owners</b> and operators for the additional cost incurred {{as a result}} of the closure of the bridge. The <b>tug</b> <b>owners</b> claimed that there was no right to recover, as CN was not the owner of the bridge and suffered no direct physical or property damage. Their losses were purely economic (based on lost profits and increased operational costs), which were not generally recoverable in tort law.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tug</b> <b>owners</b> were {{familiar}} with the area and were at all times aware that the bridge was mainly used by CN and was essential to their operations.|$|R

50|$|The {{owners of}} the Rhône sued the barge and the <b>tug</b> <b>owners</b> for {{damaging}} their ship, and North Central Maritime Corporation, {{the owner of the}} barge, sued Great Lakes for breach of its towage contract. Great Lakes denied liability in both actions and counterclaimed for limitation of liability pursuant to provisions of the Canada Shipping Act. At the Trial Division of the Federal Court of Canada, the judge apportioned 80 percent of the liability to Great Lakes and 20 percent to North Central in the first action (based on the negligence of the respective captains), and found Great Lakes to be totally at fault in the second action.|$|R
5000|$|Facing defeat, the New York City detectives rang up Sheriff Athorne of York County, who motored out to Leavitt on his dory. The {{fugitive}} Leavitt {{told the}} sheriff that some New Yorkers {{were trying to}} kidnap him, and that if they tried again he would shoot them. Hearing this, bail bondsman Beardsley chartered a tugboat from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, [...] "with which {{to take up the}} chase again," [...] reported The New York Times. [...] "The Portsmouth <b>tug</b> <b>owner,</b> however, did not enthuse over the proposition," [...] said The Times," [...] and, as there were no armored motor boats in the neighborhood and not a torpedo boat nearer than Newport, Mr. Beardsley and the detectives came back to New York." ...|$|R
50|$|Luna was {{designed}} by John G. Alden (1884-1962), one of America's greatest and most prolific yacht designers, but was heavily influenced by the preferences of the <b>tug's</b> <b>owner,</b> the Mystic Steamship Company, and its subsidiary Boston Tow Boat Company. As a result, Lunas aesthetics embody the classical sweeping profile of the American harbor tug. The tugboat also had a very innovative propulsion plant: two diesel engines, each turning a generator and exciter to create DC current, which was then shunted (via prototypical switchboards) to a single DC motor (weighing 20 tons) attached to a single propeller shaft. The project was a showpiece for Thomas Edison's General Electric Corporation, which seized the challenge to design, build and deliver the components, in conjunction with their control subcontractors. Six years after Lunas delivery, GE reported that there were 33 diesel-electric tugs in service, 21 of which were GE installations.|$|R
50|$|A {{public hearing}} {{was held on}} March 4, 1943, before the United States Steamboat Inspectors, at which the four {{survivors}} were examined. This testimony was recorded and made available to all interested parties. Shortly thereafter, Fortenbaugh privately interviewed the survivors and took statements from them {{with an eye toward}} the anticipated litigation; the survivors signed these statements on March 29. Fortenbaugh also interviewed other persons believed to have some information relating to the accident and in some cases he made memoranda of what they told him. At the time when Fortenbaugh secured the statements of the survivors, representatives of two of the deceased crew members had been in communication with him. Ultimately claims were presented by representatives of all five of the deceased; four of the claims, however, were settled without litigation. The fifth claimant, petitioner herein, brought suit in a federal court under the Jones Act on November 26, 1943, naming as defendants the two <b>tug</b> <b>owners,</b> individually and as partners, and the railroad. Petitioner sought to compel production of signed statements and memoranda. Respondent granted names of those who had provided statements, but refused to produce documents. The court ordered his imprisonment, but stayed the order pending appeal. Respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and the production order was reversed.|$|R

[...] Of F. Murray Abraham's performance, Gelder wrote: [...] "Far from the terrifying figure who made blind men's dogs <b>tug</b> their <b>owners</b> into doorways and up courts, Mr. Abraham can scarcely contain the good cheer waiting to burst out in little bits of business before his ghostly encounters." ...|$|R

[...] No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no {{children}} asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would <b>tug</b> their <b>owners</b> into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, [...] "No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!" ...|$|R
50|$|YMS-328 {{was sold}} privately in 1948 to Vancouver <b>Tug</b> & Barge <b>owner</b> Harold Jones. He named her La Beverie. Upon Joness death in 1956, millionaire Max Wyman {{purchased}} the yacht and renamed her the Wild Goose II. Wyman {{traveled the world}} on the yacht including Tahiti, Bora Bora, and Hawaii.

He keeps his eye on his men, and will push you forward if he sees you deserve it. He has the name of having the best of captains on the river, and of being one of the best and most liberal of employers. But you must not expect much in flat life, you will find the men rough as well as the work." ...|$|R
50|$|The vessel {{is powered}} by z-drives and was built as a {{multi-purpose}} anchor handling tug supply vessel. It was christened on 27 August 2003. Union Sovereign was owned by JP Knight which purchased the initial <b>owner,</b> Klyne <b>Tugs</b> of Lowestoft, in 2007.

50|$|A guide {{animal is}} an animal {{specifically}} trained to assist visually impaired persons navigate in public. These animals may {{be trained to}} open doors, recognize traffic signals, guide their owners safely across public streets, and navigate through crowds of people. A mobility animal may perform similar services for a person with physical disabilities, as well as assisting with balance or falling issues. Hearing animals are trained to assist hearing-impaired or deaf persons. These animals may be trained to respond to doorbells or a ringing phone, or to <b>tug</b> their <b>owners</b> toward {{a person who is}} speaking to them. Mental health animals can be trained to provide deep-pressure therapy by lying on top of a person who may be suffering from PSTD flashbacks, overstimulation, or acute anxiety. Similarly, autism dogs have been recently introduced to recognize and respond to the needs of people with autism spectrum disorder; some persons with ASD state that they are more comfortable interacting with animals than with human caregivers due to issues regarding eye contact, touch, and socialization. Medical emergency animals can assist in medical emergency and perform such services as clearing an area {{in the event of a}} grand mal seizure, fetching medication or other necessary items, alerting others in the event of a medical episode; some may even be trained to call emergency services through use of a telephone with specially designed oversized buttons.|$|R

60|$|When I {{returned}} {{in command of}} another ship, some five years afterwards, Mr. and Mrs. Falk had left the place. I should not wonder if Schomberg's tongue had succeeded at last in scaring Falk away for good; and, indubitably, there was a tale still going about the town of a certain Falk, <b>owner</b> of a <b>tug,</b> who had won his wife at cards from the captain of an English ship.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} Rollo and Jennie were both asleep--for the chambermaid, {{thinking}} {{that they must be}} tired from having been up so late the night before, concluded to let them sleep as long as possible. While they were sleeping, the waiters on board the ship were all employed in carrying up trunks, and boxes, and carpet bags, and bundles of canes and umbrellas, from all the state rooms, and spreading them about upon the decks, where the custom-house officers could examine them. The decks soon, of course, presented in every part very bustling and noisy scenes. Passengers were hurrying to and fro. Some were getting their baggage together for examination; some were unstrapping their trunks; and others, having unstrapped theirs, were now fumbling in their pockets, in great distress, to find the keys. It is always an awkward thing to lose a trunk key; but the most unfortunate of all possible times for meeting with this calamity is when a custom-house officer is standing by, waiting to examine what your trunk contains. Those who could not find their keys were obliged to stand aside and let others take their turn. As fast as the trunks were inspected, the lid of each was shut down, and it was marked with chalk; and then, {{as soon as it was}} locked and strapped again, a porter conveyed it to the <b>tug,</b> where the <b>owner</b> followed it, ready to go on shore.|$|R
40|$|Tug today {{represents}} irreplaceable part of port infrastructurein all {{the world}} harbours and it is almost unthinkable torun a business of some port in international relations withoutusing them.

Their purchase depends on the financial power of the investorin infrastructure, whether the state or a private company whichis the common <b>owner</b> of the <b>tugs</b> fleet in the port with which itmost often has a "Concession contract" for undertaking thementioned activities besides the rest of the known contractedways of cooperation...|$|R
50|$|Humans were {{affected}} by the disturbance in several ways such as temporary loss of the fishing industry and financial strain. Residents and tourists alike depend on the coastal environment for both recreational and economical pursuits. More than 200 square miles of commercial fishery were closed for several months following the spill and some seafood businesses were unable {{to make up the}} economic losses from that time out of work. Over a year after the spill, the <b>owners</b> of the <b>tug</b> and barge were given criminal charges because the Oil Pollution act of 1990 had made it illegal to negligently discharge harmful quantities of oil into the United States' navigable waters. The owners paid a total of $9.5 million in criminal and other costs.|$|R
5000|$|By April 18, 1963, {{preparations}} {{were being}} made by Steers to dynamite the wreck. According to the <b>owners</b> of the <b>tug,</b> “the purpose of finding the boat was to locate bodies, not the hull." [...] The President of Steers Sand and Gravel Company, J. Rich Steers, stated that “we’ve already written off {{the value of the}} hull” and that divers “combed the interior of the ship despite the thick mud which entombs her hold…they found no one aboard her.” [...] While the United States Army Corps of Engineers conducted their own review for the proposed demolition, a private marine salvage firm with no connection to Steers, “filed for salvage rights” and that “salvages rights were being negotiated.” [...] The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stated that the Gwendoline Steers “would have to be removed from the federal channel.” regardless of whether Steers dynamited the wreck, or the salvage company raised the vessel for scrap. One week later, the Army Corp abruptly reversed their decision. The salvage company also dropped their claim.|$|R
