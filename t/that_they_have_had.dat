5|$|At {{the same}} time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{informed}} by Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) that he has health problems as Tracy has a weakened system only found on dead people. Tracy and his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) meet with Jack and Tracy reveals what Dr. Spaceman told him. Angie becomes concerned {{on whether or not}} their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses—even admitting she likes the concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget.|$|E
5|$|Lucy {{returns and}} Chris rejects her offer of being father to her child when Nate confesses {{he does not}} want children; however, Chris changes his mind when Nate {{supports}} him. Nate later helps Chris and Lucy see that they need to think the idea through more thoroughly, and they draw up a contract detailing how their child will be raised. When they learn that they are both carriers of spinal muscular atrophy, Chris tells Lucy that she should find another donor. But when Chris sees how down Lucy is, he changes his mind and they go ahead with the insemination. A couple of weeks later, Lucy calls Chris to tell him that she is pregnant. Chris plans to visit New York for the scan, but Nate confesses he is banned from the States for overstaying his visa there previously. Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) agrees to help lift the ban, but Nate misses a meeting and Chris accuses him of not taking it seriously. Lucy returns for a visit and Chris decides he wants to split his time between Erinsborough and New York when the baby comes, although Nate is against this idea. Nate realises that they want different things, and they break-up. Chris then decides to move to New York with Lucy and leaves after a farewell party at The Waterhole. A few months later, Amber contacts Chris and Lucy via video call after learning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a daughter. Chris and Lucy introduce her to Anne, and Chris asks Amber to say hello to Nate for him.|$|E

In Donna Eder's study, Navajos were interviewed about storytelling practices <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> in the past and what changes they want to see in the future. They notice that storytelling makes an impact on the lives of the children of the Navajos. According to some of the Navajos that were interviewed, storytelling is one of many main practices that teaches children the important principles to live a good life. In indigenous communities, stories are a way to pass knowledge on from generation to generation.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of Areala {{has its roots}} in the , or the Fraternity of Our Lady, a traditionalist Catholic organization. In 1991, a chapter was established in New York City's East Harlem in order to found a soup kitchen. It was in New York that Sister Marie Chantel who had been a black belt in Judo learned Taekwondo under a Hell's Kitchen martial arts master. Her fellow nuns, including the Mother Superior, also learned self-defense hearing that the neighborhoods were dangerous, though they insist that their martial arts training is mostly for sport and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> no problems with the surrounding neighborhoods.

25|$|Regional {{studies found}} a {{different}} prevalence {{of sexual harassment}} by teachers. For example, {{in a survey of}} 148 high school graduates in North Carolina in 1989 the graduates were given a definition of sexual harassment and asked if they had experienced sexual harassment during their high school years. 43% reported inappropriate comments, looks, or gestures by a teacher, 17.5% reported sexual touching, and 13.5% indicated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> sexual intercourse with a teacher. In another study college students were asked to recall if they or other students had experienced sexual harassment by high school teachers. 6.5% of the respondents reported having personally experienced sexually inappropriate attention from high school teachers. Furthermore, more than 33% said that they knew of a sexual relationship between a high school student and a teacher.|$|E
25|$|Modern logicists (like Bob Hale, Crispin Wright, {{and perhaps}} others) have {{returned}} to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as Hume's principle (the number of objects falling under the concept F equals the number of objects falling under the concept G {{if and only if}} the extension of F and the extension of G can be put into one-to-one correspondence). Frege required Basic Law V {{to be able to give}} an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem so obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.|$|E
25|$|Barking geckos {{were common}} in shrublands {{all around the}} Wellington region up until the 1960s and 1970s but populations have {{declined}} enormously since then. DOC has tried to establish populations of this species on Mana Island {{but there are so}} few animals left in wild populations in the region <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> to resort to transferring animals taken either from the jaws of pet cats or captive bred animals from private collections. Both the Naultinus released on Mana and a natural population on Kapiti Island have failed to thrive, which is mysterious, because these habitats are rodent free. One suggested cause about which little research has been done is vespid wasp predation, as these insects have been observed killing both adult and baby Naultinus. Naultinus gemmeus are known from the mainland of Southland from a few sightings by members of the public but despite numerous searches in recent years, not a single animal has been sighted or photographed here and it is speculated that this population is either critically endangered or already functionally extinct.|$|E

500|$|Whitney first appears {{when she}} and her family—mother figure Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer), {{half-sister}} Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith), and Bianca's sons Liam Butcher (James Forde) and Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs)—are evicted by their landlord. The children spend a week in care after Bianca is arrested for assaulting a police officer, returning to her custody a week later and moving into Pat Evans' (Pam St. Clement) house. Over the next few months, Bianca becomes the beneficiary of a mystery [...] "guardian angel", who is revealed to be Whitney. Whitney tells Bianca she found a winning lottery ticket, but kept it secret as she knew that Bianca would spend the money. Bianca reluctantly agrees to deposit the money; however Whitney hides some to be used in emergencies. It is revealed that Bianca's imprisoned boyfriend Tony King (Chris Coghill) has been grooming Whitney since she was 12 and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> a sexual relationship. Having served a year-long prison sentence for assaulting a boy who apparently harassed Whitney, Tony is released in September 2008. He makes it clear to Whitney that they will resume their sexual relationship, and Whitney reveals that she has kept some of the lottery winnings so they can run away together. When Bianca harangues him about the prospect of marriage, he gives her Whitney's money to put a down-payment on a flat. When Whitney and classmate Peter Beale (Thomas Law) are cast in a school play, Tony is jealous of them rehearsing in private and punches Peter. Whitney convinces Peter and his sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield) not to report the attack to the police, but Tony blames her for the incident and ends their affair. Devastated when Tony accepts Bianca's marriage proposal, Whitney locks herself in her bedroom. Not knowing what to do, Bianca accepts Dr Poppy Merritt's (Amy Darcy) help and she refers Whitney to a psychiatrist. Bianca takes her away on holiday, attempting to mend their relationship. When they return, Tony and Whitney share a passionate kiss, and Tony informs Whitney that their relationship is back on.|$|E
