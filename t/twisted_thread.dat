60|$|The old gentlewoman stole behind Phoebe, and peeped {{from the}} {{passageway}} into the shop, to note {{how she would}} manage her undertaking. It {{was a case of}} some intricacy. A very ancient woman, in a white short gown and a green petticoat, with a string of gold beads about her neck, and what looked like a nightcap on her head, had brought a quantity of yarn to barter for the commodities of the shop. She was probably the very last person in town who still kept the time-honored spinning-wheel in constant revolution. It was worth while to hear the croaking and hollow tones of the old lady, and the pleasant voice of Phoebe, mingling in one <b>twisted</b> <b>thread</b> of talk; and still better to contrast their figures,--so light and bloomy,--so decrepit and dusky,--with only the counter betwixt them, in one sense, but more than threescore years, in another. As for the bargain, it was wrinkled slyness and craft pitted against native truth and sagacity.|$|E

40|$|The {{authors wish to}} {{recognise}} {{funding from}} EPSRC through the Fusion Centre for Doctoral Training (Fusion-CDT - grant code: EP/K 504178 / 1) through which this project is possible. Support from STFC for PKB and AWH is also acknowledged (grant numbers ST/L 000768 / 1 and ST/N 000609 / 1). Context: Heating the solar corona requires dissipation of stored magnetic energy, which may occur in twisted magnetic fields. Recently published numerical simulations show that the ideal kink instability in a <b>twisted</b> magnetic <b>thread</b> may trigger energy release in stable twisted neighbours, and demonstrate an avalanche of heating events. Aims: We aim to construct a Taylor relaxation model for the energy release from two flux ropes and compare this with the outcomes of the simulations. We then aim to extend the model to large numbers of flux ropes, allowing the possibility of modelling a heating avalanche, and calculation of the energy release for ensembles of <b>twisted</b> <b>threads</b> with varying <b>twist</b> profiles. Methods: The final state is calculated by assuming a helicity-conserving relaxation to a minimum energy state. Multiple scenarios are examined, which include kink-unstable flux ropes relaxing on their own, as well as stable and unstable flux ropes merging into a single rope {{as a result of}} magnetic reconnection. We consider alternative constraints that determine the spatial extent of the final relaxed state. Results: Good agreement is found between the relaxation model and the magnetohydrodynamic simulations, both for interactions of two <b>twisted</b> <b>threads</b> and for a multi-thread avalanche. The model can predict the energy release for flux ropes of varying degrees of twist, which relax individually or which merge through reconnection into a single flux rope. It is found that the energy output of merging flux ropes is dominated by the energy of the most strongly twisted rope. Conclusions: The relaxation approach provides a very good estimate of the energy release in an ensemble of <b>twisted</b> <b>threads</b> of which one is kink-unstable. PostprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The crinkle {{tendency}} {{is due to}} the technological conditions of the spun yarn productionand the physical fiber properties. Above all, the “technological conditions of thespun yarn production” means the turning moment of the thread. A <b>twisted</b> <b>thread</b> will alwaystry to twist when it hangs freely between two fixed points {{in the form of a}} loop. In doing this, it gives up a part of its original twist which becomes spirals whose twisting direction is opposite to the original twist direction. This development of twist in the opposite direction occurs as the twisted yarn attempts to reach equilibrium.|$|E
50|$|In a {{spinning}} mule, the roving is pulled off bobbins and sequentially fed through rollers operating at several different speeds, thinning the roving at a consistent rate. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cop as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than ring spinning. Spinning by the mule machine is an intermittent process as the frame advances and returns. It is the descendant of a device invented in 1779 by Samuel Crompton, and produces a softer, less <b>twisted</b> <b>thread</b> that is favored for fines and for weft.|$|E

As the frost perches, the branches of the trees moan, Soughing mournfully, far off, yet clear. A spurned exile's stripped and scattered guts Sizzle and scald where the water boils up. Life is like a tortured, <b>twisted</b> <b>thread,</b> A road on which we balance, following a single strand.

40|$|One of the {{questions}} addressed here is ”How can a <b>twisted</b> <b>thread</b> correct itself?”. We consider a theoretical model where the studied mathematical object represents a 2 D twisted discrete thread linking two points. This thread is made of a chain of agents which are “lost”, i. e. they {{have no knowledge of}} the global setting and no sense of direction. Thus, the modifications made by the agents are local and all the decisions use only minimal information about the local neighborhood. We introduce a random process such that the thread reorganizes itself efficiently to become a discrete line between these two points. The second question addressed here is to reorder a word by local flips in order to scatter the letters to avoid long successions of the same letter. These two questions are equivalent. The work presented here is at the crossroad of many different domains such as modeling cooling process in crystallography [2, 3, 8], stochastic cellular automata [6, 7], organizing a line of robots in distributed algorithms (the robot chain problem [5, 11]), and Christoffel words in language theory [1]. ∗This work is partially supported by Programs ANR Dynamite, Quasicool and IXXI (Complex System Institute...|$|E
30|$|Historically, {{the fashion}} handbag has partly been {{determined}} by its function, with some features remaining constant, {{such as a}} place for money, cosmetics, keys, handkerchief, diary, note pad, pencil, and even printed literature such as a novel or commercial pocket book. Riding in {{a car in the}} early 20 th century, a passenger could be wrapped in a blanket wearing a cap or veil, and sheltered under thick goggles; often, the fashionable passenger held a flat Morocco leather bag in her arms. Its simple form, in varying sizes, stored readily available items: gloves, stole, vials. This was the prelude to the handbag and fashion bag, which flourished in the 20 th and 21 st centuries (Louis Vuitton 2017). After World War I, women needed handbags for utility purposes because they increasingly occupied jobs outside the home. In the 20 th century, the fashion bag took on both utility and fashion; utilitarian and fashionable bags became known worldwide. In the 1930 s, the clutch bag was very popular and during and after World War II, a shoulder bag was functional, first as part of the military, and later gaining widespread popularity. In the 1970 s, a trend of the hippy style was to incorporate various fabric patches and <b>twisted</b> <b>thread</b> bags; in the 1980 s, sports bags were popular; and by the 1990 s, the fashion handbag was being designed to consider both ergonomics and function (Jeon 2005).|$|E

Karamiori is an old and highly respected textile production method. The Japanese divide karaori into three basic styles based on structure: sha (紗), ro (絽), and ra (羅).

50|$|During {{the second}} half of the 3rd century BC, mosaic glass, also known as 'millefiori', literally, a {{thousand}} flowers, emerged. The group consists mostly of fused and slumped broad plates and shallow dishes with upright or out-splayed rims or hemispherical bowls. Sub-groups of mosaic glass production are 'network' or 'lacework' hemispherical bowls and vessels with meandering or spiral decorative patterns that imitate onyx. Often these bowls had a rim formed of a single ‘network’ cane of spirally <b>twisted</b> <b>threads</b> which gives a 'striped' effect. It is best represented in burial contexts from several large tombs in Canosa di Puglia (ancient Canusium) in Italy. They are open vessels since they are made with a mould but still opaque, like the widely produced core-formed vessels.|$|R
