500|$|Harrison echoed Martin's {{description}} of his stabilising role: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; {{but he was always}} there for us to interpret our madness – we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Smith {{spoke to}} Q Radio {{about the new}} album. [...] "It's {{still going to be}} fairly electronic, I think, {{compared}} to our earlier records. So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> need to, kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well. It's our fourth record and we don't want to feel like we're doing the same thing again." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with HipHopDX, Legacy said the album was, [...] " [...] pretty much like the lifestyle {{and the culture of}} the typical California teenager put in music. It’s going to surprise a lot of people, {{because a lot of people}} <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> make the jerk songs [...] dance music." [...] According to Legacy, only two tracks on the album are jerking songs. He also stated that the album is about a lot of different topics, and was quick to point out that most of them were pre-"Jerk" [...] stating they were fifteen songs in before 'You're a Jerk'. Most of the producers on the album were mostly unknown, local producers. Legacy said, [...] "We have no big producers on our album. All of our producers are like kids ...|$|E

500|$|Santiago and Thompson {{shared a}} room {{at the start of the}} second semester. Santiago soon {{introduced}} his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: [...] "Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing Black Flag and Angst. Initially, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music... He'd write 'em , and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar." [...] In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words [...] "We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams"; Santiago replied, saying [...] "Yes, now's the time." [...] Upon receiving this reply, Thompson decided to return to Amherst to start a rock band with Santiago.|$|E
2500|$|A Florida {{family court}} judge revoked Lázaro's {{temporary}} custody, {{clearing the way}} for González to be returned to his father's custody. On April 20, Reno made the decision to remove Elián González from the house and instructed law enforcement officials to determine the best time to obtain the boy. After being informed of the decision, Marisleysis said to a Justice Department community relations officer, [...] "You <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> have cameras in the house? If people try to come in, they could be hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{reactions}} by both professional {{critics and}} fans {{to the release}} of Confield were mixed, though generally positive. According to Sean Booth, [...] "most of Confield came out of experiments with Max that weren't really applicable in a club environment." [...] In contrast, 2003's Draft 7.30 was seen by some as an easier record to grasp. Booth stated in an interview around the release of Draft 7.30 that [...] " [...] doesn't seem to limit us in the way it did when we first started. Now I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> get it, we're totally fluent in it and can be more expressive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Foster grimly; [...] "I rather <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were <b>just</b> in time. It's very {{possible}} that he'd have run over me if I'd {{been in the}} road. An accident of that kind would have suited him well. But I thought I was a fool for jumping." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] and Mary {{tossed her}} curly head. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> have <b>just</b> as good times as you boys, every bit; but we don't {{have to be}} rough about it;" [...] and then she ran off {{to play a game}} of lawn tennis with her cousin Martha.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, rumors began {{circulating}} {{that the}} restaurant would be closing. The Sassalos' initially denied immediate plans to close, but conceded, [...] "Our business, per se, {{is not up}} for sale, but do they <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can <b>just</b> go on forever? At some point {{we have to have}} an end game. Wouldn't you if you were 80?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In a post-show {{interview}} clip on Austin City Limits, guitarist Munaf Rayani {{said about}} {{their status as}} instrumentalists, [...] "I mean, I think we discussed singing for half a second, {{and then it just}} kinda, we just dropped it. We just didn't go back to it because we were comfortable enough." [...] Drummer Chris Hrasky added, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> liked the idea of a band that there was not a leader or main songwriter, everyone sort of collaborating and has their own say. I don't think any of us want the sort of 'leader role', so a leaderless band is kind of the best option for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to conventional, paid advertising, In-N-Out benefits from positive {{word of mouth}} spread by enthusiastic fans. For many years, it has given customers free bumper stickers which simply say [...] "In-N-Out Burger". The company helps devoted customers advertise its brand by selling souvenir clothing with the In-N-Out logo. Celebrity fans and free endorsements in mass media also promote the business. When Heisman Trophy winner and Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith raved about In-N-Out cheeseburgers during a press conference before the 2007 BCS National Championship Game, a senior executive said, [...] "It does not get much better than that for us. We're kind of a small company, {{and we do not}} have any celebrity endorsers. But I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> got the best one we could have." [...] Huell Howser was allowed, in what is believed to be a first, to film with his television cameras inside a store for a California's Gold Special. The show also included a behind-the-scenes tour of the In-N-Out Headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{members of}} Our Lady Peace began writing new {{material}} together {{soon after the}} Gravity tour began. In October 2002 they returned briefly to Bob Rock's Maui studio to record two unfinished songs from Gravity that were planned to be released on a soundtrack, which never happened. [...] "Working with him on that soundtrack song was just another reaffirmation for us how well we work together," [...] Maida stated in an October interview. [...] "With the way this band has grown, and the way we've come to trust Bob, it would be ridiculous for us to look for another producer now. When we're all together, {{we feel like we}} can do anything. We have to go at least one more round with him. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> scratched the surface of what we can do together." [...] By the end of 2002, the band was eager to re-enter the studio in Maui to begin laying down demos with Rock. Two new songs, [...] "Not Afraid" [...] and [...] "Talk is Cheap" [...] were premiered in March 2003 while touring in Europe with Avril Lavigne.|$|E

5000|$|On the Rolling Stones' {{experiments}} with country, Jagger said in 2003, [...] "The country songs, like 'Factory Girl' or 'Dear Doctor', on Beggars Banquet were really pastiche. There's {{a sense of}} humour in country music anyway, a {{way of looking at}} life in a humorous kind of way - and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were <b>just</b> acknowledging that element of the music." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, this is {{the real}} texture of life, this is what we refined secure people forget. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> the whole thing is {{straight}} and noble at bottom, and it isn't. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> if <b>we</b> <b>just</b> defy the friends we have and go out into the world everything will become easy and splendid. One doesn't realize that even the sort of civilization one has at Morningside Park is held together with difficulty. By policemen one mustn't shock.|$|R
2500|$|Films and {{television}} programs {{made in the}} 1980s had different visions of what World War III would be like. Red Dawn (1984) portrayed a near future in which a Communist revolution occurs in Mexico, the United States and Britain become strategically isolated from continental Europe, and the Soviet Union is threatened with famine after {{the failure of the}} wheat harvest in Ukraine. World War III subsequently begins unexpectedly, with a surprise Soviet and Cuban invasion of the United States, with large portions of the country falling under Soviet occupation. The central United States and China are obliterated with nuclear weapons and Europe remains neutral. A small band of teenagers fight the occupation forces in Colorado using guerrilla tactics, and are ultimately killed by the Spetsnatz. According to the film's epilogue, the United States repulses Soviet forces and wins the war. In the 1983 James Bond film Octopussy, James Bond tries to prevent World War III from being started by a renegade Soviet general. WarGames (1983) had a teenage gamer accidentally hacking the U.S. nuclear defense network (thinking he'd hacked a computer game company), which reveals a potentially catastrophic flaw in the newly automated system. [...] Spies Like Us depicts US agents in the USSR accidentally launching a missile at the US, leading one of them to say [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> started World War III." ...|$|E
2500|$|Passing {{the civil}} rights bill in the house {{required}} getting it through the Rules Committee, which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it. Johnson decided on a campaign to use a discharge petition to force it onto the house floor. Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it {{to the floor of the}} full house, which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290–110. In the Senate, since the tax bill had passed three days earlier, the anti-civil-rights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans, who were growing less supportive due to the fact that their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill. According to Caro, it was ultimately Johnson's ability to convince Republican leader Everett Dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; after 75 hours of debate, the bill passed the senate by a vote of 71–29. Johnson signed the fortified Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on July 2. Legend has it that the evening after signing the bill, Johnson told an aide, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come", anticipating a coming backlash from Southern whites against Johnson's Democratic Party.|$|E
2500|$|Guitarist Brad Delson {{experimented with}} an EBow when {{the band was}} piecing {{together}} [...] "The Little Things Give You Away". The band decided {{not to use the}} effect for the solo in that song and instead ended up creating [...] "No More Sorrow" [...] out of the effect. In [...] "Given Up", he jingles the keys that are heard while several clap sounds are overlaid in the intro of the song (as mentioned in the lyric book: Brad added the sounds on the intro song: multiple tracks of claps - and keys jingling.). Shinoda and Delson teamed up with David Campbell to add string elements to six songs; [...] "Leave Out All the Rest", [...] "Shadow of the Day", [...] "Hands Held High", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", as well as the two b-sides [...] "No Roads Left" [...] and [...] "Blackbirds" [...] (which was instead later used in the iPhone game 8-Bit Rebellion! as well as being included as a bonus track for A Thousand Suns), respectively. All scratching elements by Joe Hahn that existed in the previous two studio albums are largely absent because of the low mixing, except on the songs [...] "What I've Done", [...] "Wake", [...] "The Little Things Give You Away", [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] and [...] "In Pieces". Hahn contributes more with programming, electronics, and other elements to many of the songs. The church organ and military drumbeat on [...] "Hands Held High" [...] were originally to be used as the backdrop to melodic vocals, but Rubin recommended that the band try the opposite approach according to the album booklet. For the album, the band recorded fifty to sixty songs in August 2006. Their previous albums took only about three to six months to complete, while this one took 14 months. They spent over six months writing the songs. In previous albums, they composed an average of 40 songs, but they made over 100 this time. [...] "Shadow of the Day" [...] is one of two songs (the other being [...] "No Roads Left") to have Bennington playing the guitar. During live performances, Shinoda is generally playing the keyboard for [...] "Shadow of the Day", while Bennington plays rhythm guitar. Shinoda stated in an interview: [...] "We were looking back at the things that we had done in the past... and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> figured that we had exhausted that sound. It was easy for us to replicate, it was easy for other bands to replicate, and we just needed to move on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2009, they {{announced}} that writing has begun on Series 5, but by May 2010, Turner said: [...] "We sort of {{felt like it}} was the end two years ago. We thought, ‘We’ve done enough and the well is dry and <b>we</b> can’t <b>think</b> of any more ideas’ … <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> might <b>just</b> leave it for now."

I have some writing to do, and I think you told me, Rupert, that you thought of going to the Dulwich Gallery. I was rather too impetuous. Very likely he wouldn't be in. But if we get down by the 5.15, which gets to Purley about 6, I expect <b>we</b> shall <b>just</b> catch him." ...|$|R
5000|$|With new recruit Glenn Girard they {{renamed the}} band Red Red Meat. The band's name {{possibly}} came from Ben's Truck washing business which cleaned meat carrying trucks {{on their way}} out of Chicago. Regarding the band name, Tim Rutili said in an interview: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>just</b> thought it sounded good." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "A {{lot more}} mature. A lot more focused. We {{just had a}} lot more time to spend with it.
