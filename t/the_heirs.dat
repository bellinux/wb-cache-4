A 1947 newspaper article estimated that the new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work the state had done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. The Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls was built at this time.|$|E

50|$|In Eiffel, feature {{redefinition}} {{is analogous}} to method overriding in C++ and Java. Redefinition {{is one of three}} forms of feature adaptation classified as redeclaration. Redeclaration also covers effecting, in which an implementation is provided for a feature which was deferred (abstract) in the parent class, and undefinition, in which a feature that was effective (concrete) in the parent becomes deferred again in <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> class. When a feature is redefined, the feature name is kept by <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> class, but properties of the feature such as its signature, contract (respecting restrictions for preconditions and postconditions), and/or implementation will be different in <b>the</b> <b>heir.</b> If <b>the</b> original feature in the parent class, called <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> feature's precursor, is effective, then the redefined feature in <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> will be effective. If the precursor is deferred, the feature in <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> will be deferred.|$|R

5|$|Before Tiberius, <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> of Augustus {{were the}} sons of Marcus Agrippa, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, whom he adopted and made heir. They {{advanced}} through their careers at the same pace {{and were going to}} rule together; however, they died young, forcing Augustus to draw another line of succession. In AD 4, Augustus adopted Tiberius on condition that Tiberius adopt Germanicus. This made Tiberius the heir of Augustus, and Germanicus the heir of Tiberius. Like {{the sons of}} Agrippa, it was the intention of Augustus that Germanicus and Drusus would rule together.|$|E
5|$|By 1944, {{space was}} running short, and Monsanto began {{negotiations}} {{to acquire the}} Runnymede Playhouse in the wealthy residential Dayton suburb of Oakwood. Built in 1927, the Playhouse was a leisure facility that included an outdoor swimming pool, a ballroom, a squash court, a tennis court with a cork floor and a stage for community theater. It had showers with Italian marble and a -story garage. The estate was owned by the Talbott Realty Company, which was controlled by Thomas's wife's family.

5|$|When a Liu-family {{relative}} of an emperor—usually a princely son—was designated as his heir apparent, he was provided living quarters within the palace {{and a personal}} staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor. During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> apparent, known as the Grand Tutor of <b>the</b> <b>Heir</b> Apparent (ranked 2000–dan) and Junior Tutor of <b>the</b> <b>Heir</b> Apparent (ranked 2000–dan), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan). During Eastern Han, the Grand Tutor of <b>the</b> <b>Heir</b> Apparent lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-dan; the Junior Tutor remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-dan. The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished. Other Western Han staff offices of <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> apparent were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of the Kitchen and the Household Prison of <b>the</b> <b>Heir</b> Apparent. If he reached adulthood, <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> apparent could be married to a principal wife who led a harem of his concubines.|$|R
5|$|During the 1860s and 1870s Verdi paid great {{attention}} to his estate around Busseto, purchasing additional land, dealing with unsatisfactory (in one case, embezzling) stewards, installing irrigation, and coping with variable harvests and economic slumps. In 1867, both Verdi's father Carlo, {{with whom he had}} restored good relations, and his early patron and father-in-law Antonio Barezzi, died. Verdi and Giuseppina decided to adopt Carlo's great-niece Filomena Maria Verdi, then seven years old, as their own child. She was to marry in 1878 the son of Verdi's friend and lawyer Angelo Carrara and her family became eventually <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> of Verdi's estate.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes. This practice was later adopted by Angevin Kings of England, Kings of Hungary and other European monarchs. From the moment of their coronation, <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> were regarded as junior kings (rex iunior), but they exercised little power and historically {{were not included in the}} numbering of monarchs if they predeceased their fathers. The nobility disliked this custom, as it reduced their chances to benefit from a possible succession dispute.|$|E
5|$|In New Hampshire {{the timber}} dispute was {{overlaid}} by ongoing disputes between local landowners and Samuel Allen, a London merchant who had acquired the territorial claims of <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> of John Mason, the province's founder, and was pursuing them against those landowners. Allen, {{who had been}} commissioned governor of the province in 1692, only came to the colony in 1698 to take a direct interest in its affairs. During Bellomont's brief visit to New Hampshire in July and August 1699, Allen attempted to buy him to his side. Allen offered his daughter (with a large dowry) as a marriage match for the earl's son; Bellomont refused the offer.|$|E

40|$|The novel, Guy Mannering, {{reflects}} a universal urge {{for law and}} justice. The main focus of the writer's analysis of this novel is on the restoration of a lost heir to his identity and property by the main characters, Meg Merrilies and Paulus Pleydell. <b>The</b> <b>heir's</b> rights have been seized since his childhood by a bad lawyer, Gilbert Glossin. He even tries to kill <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> in order to fulfil his ambition, that is pursuing <b>the</b> <b>heir's</b> estate. However, through the hands of Meg Merrilies and Paulus Pleydell, <b>the</b> lost <b>heir</b> finally is able to get his rights back. The thesis writer is curious to know why Meg Merrilies and Paulus Pleydell want to achieve justice for <b>the</b> lost <b>heir.</b> <b>The</b> discussion of this thesis begins with the description of Meg Merrilies' and Paulus Pleydell's character traits, proceeds to the motivation that lead them to decide to help <b>the</b> lost <b>heir,</b> and ends with their efforts in achieving justice which shows that they are really the champions of justice. Meg Merrilies' sacrifice in restoring <b>the</b> <b>heir's</b> true identity and Paulus Pleydell's ambition in solving <b>the</b> <b>heir's</b> problems makes <b>the</b> thesis writer conclude that their good character traits have the greatest influence in their achievement of justice for <b>the</b> lost <b>heir</b> as <b>the</b> rightful <b>heir...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Law of Succession Amendment Act, {{which came}} into {{operation}} on October 1, 1992, amended the Intestate Succession Act {{as regards the}} rules for the disqualification of and the renunciation by an intestate heir of his inheritance.

5|$|Mehmed II and {{his successors}} {{continued}} to consider themselves heirs to the Roman Empire until {{the demise of}} the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century following World War 1. They considered that they had simply shifted its religious basis as Constantine had done before, and they continued to refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants (Orthodox Christians) as Rûm. Meanwhile, the Danubian Principalities (whose rulers also considered themselves <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> of the Eastern Roman Emperors) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.|$|E
5|$|On {{the seventh}} day after the person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word both for the funeral ale and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual drinking).

If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.|$|E

Years later, on March 4, 1949, <b>the</b> <b>heirs</b> of {{eighteen}} merchant seamen killed in the explosion were granted a total of $390,000 after gaining approval of their consent decrees in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.|$|E
50|$|The Legitimist {{stand is}} that the {{succession}} to the throne is based on customs and precedents thereafter unalterable. <b>The</b> <b>heir</b> to <b>the</b> throne, according to those customs, is <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> of Louis XIV, who cannot be excluded. The Orléanist stand {{is that the}} laws of succession could be altered, and that among those customs and precedents is the requirement that <b>the</b> <b>heir</b> must be French. <b>The</b> <b>heir</b> to <b>the</b> throne, according to them, is the Orléans line, since not one of Philip V's descendants was French when the succession opened in 1883.|$|R
