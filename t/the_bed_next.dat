500|$|According to Sharon Kinne, {{at around}} 5:30p.m. {{on the evening}} of March 19 she heard a gunshot from the {{direction}} of the bedroom in which her husband was sleeping. Entering the room, she found two-and-a-half-year-old Danna on <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to her father. Danna was holding one of James's guns, a [...]22 caliber Hi-Standard semi-automatic target pistol, and James was bleeding from an apparent gunshot wound in the back of his head. Kinne called the police, but James Kinne was dead by the time the ambulance carrying him arrived at the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Doyle {{was present}} when a 9-year-old girl was {{repeatedly}} raped by {{two other men}} in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to him while {{he had sex with}} two women, one of whom is the girl's mother. Doyle comes from a family that includes a serving District Court Judge, a retired District Court Judge and an Essex County Assistant District Attorney. [...] While discussing the sentence which they believed was far too lenient, Dennis and Callahan accused members of the Doyle family of interceding on behalf of Doyle and suggested that [...] "the fix was in".|$|E
6000|$|... 'They are in sad spiritual darkness,' said a {{voice from}} <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to me, when the nun had {{finished}} her kind offices and retired: 'they are in the night of error, {{and yet there is}} the light of faith in those poor creatures.' ...|$|E
50|$|As Barrientos recuperates in a {{military}} hospital ward, the nurse informs him {{that he is not}} the only survivor of his unit. Garces and Upaon are seen in <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> <b>next</b> to his, revealing that they too can morph. The ending scene shows a zombie soldier attacking a nurse.|$|R

6000|$|... "Off {{with your}} doublet," [...] he commanded, {{and as he}} spoke he set himself to empty the pocket of Kenneth's garment; a {{handkerchief}} and a few papers he found in them, and these he tossed carelessly on <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>Next</b> he assisted the Irishman to struggle into the stolen coat.|$|E
6000|$|Later,--It's night now. I was interrupted. I'll write a {{few more}} [...] lines. Hope you can read them. It's late and the wind is moaning [...] outside. It's so cold and dismal. The fellow in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to me [...] is out of his head. Poor devil! He broke his knee, and they put off [...] the operation--too busy! So few doctors and so many patients! And [...] now he'll lose his leg. He's talking about home. Oh, Lenore! Home! [...] I never knew what home was--till now.|$|E
60|$|For {{things are}} rather {{different}} {{when the man}} in <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> looks at the bedroom. Not only is the rose-bush still very obvious; but the other things are looking very odd. The perspective seems to have gone crooked; the walls seem to vary in measurement till the man thinks he is going mad. The wall-paper has a new pattern, of strange spirals instead of round dots. The table seems to have moved by itself {{across the room and}} thrown the medicine bottles out of the window. The telephone has vanished from the wall; the mirror does not reflect what is in front of it. The portrait of himself over the mantelpiece has a face that is not his own.|$|E

60|$|In {{the chamber}} where the mate lay, {{there were seven}} beds, all of them {{occupied}} by persons who had met with accidents. In {{the centre of the}} room was a stationary pine table, about the length of a man, intended, I suppose, to stretch patients upon for necessary operations. The furniture of the beds was plain and homely. I thought that the faces of the patients all looked remarkably intelligent, though they were evidently men of the lower classes. Suffering had educated them morally and intellectually. They gazed curiously at Mr. Wilding and me, but nobody said a word. In <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> <b>next</b> to the mate lay a little boy with a broken thigh. The surgeon observed that children generally did well with accidents; and this boy certainly looked very bright and cheerful. There was nothing particularly interesting about the mate.|$|E
6000|$|In 1879 he {{was acting}} with a strolling company, and came to Amherst, in Nova Scotia. Here he heard of a haunted house, known to the local {{newspapers}} as [...] "The Great Amherst Mystery". Having previously succeeded in exposing the frauds of spiritualism Mr. Hubbell determined to investigate the affair of Amherst. The haunted house was inhabited by Daniel Teed, the respected foreman in a large shoe factory. Under his roof were Mrs. Teed, [...] "as good a woman as ever lived"; little Willie, a baby boy; and Mrs. Teed's two sisters, Jennie, a very pretty girl, and Esther, remarkable for large grey eyes, pretty little hands and feet, and candour of expression. A brother of Teed's and a brother of Mrs. Cox made up the family. They were well off, and lived comfortably in a detached cottage of two storys. It began when Jennie and Esther were in bed one night. Esther jumped up, saying {{that there was a}} mouse in <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>Next</b> night, a green band-box began to make a rustling noise, and then rose a foot in the air, several times. On the following night Esther felt unwell, and [...] "was a swelling wisibly before the werry eyes" [...] of her alarmed family. Reports like thunder peeled through her chamber, under a serene sky. Next day Esther could only eat [...] "a small piece of bread and butter, and a large green pickle". She recovered slightly, in spite of the pickle, but, four nights later, all her and her sister's bed-clothes flew off, and settled down in a remote corner. At Jennie's screams, the family rushed in, and found Esther [...] "fearfully swollen". Mrs. Teed replaced the bed-clothes, which flew off again, the pillow striking John Teed in the face. Mr. Teed then left the room, observing, in a somewhat unscientific spirit, that [...] "he had had enough of it". The others, with a kindness which did them credit, sat on the edges of the bed, and repressed the desire of the sheets and blankets to fly away. The bed, however, sent forth peels like thunder, when Esther suddenly fell into a peaceful sleep.|$|E
