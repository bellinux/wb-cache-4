50|$|Grunters or <b>tigerperches</b> are fishes in {{the family}} Terapontidae (also spelled Teraponidae, Theraponidae or Therapontidae). Most are found in shallow coastal waters in the Indian Ocean and western Pacific, where they live in saltwater, {{brackish}} and freshwater habitats, {{but there are also}} true freshwater species found far from the coast. They grow up to 80 cm in length and feed on fishes and invertebrates.|$|E

Zoological Studies 38 (2) : 189 - 195. In order to understand tributyltin (TBT) toxicity to peripheral sensory functions, changes of visual and olfactory structures of <b>tigerperch</b> (Terapon jarbua Forsskål) were examined in juvenile and adult fish after exposure to 10, 50, and 100 µg TBT/l in juveniles and to 1 and 5 µg TBT/l in adults, respectively, for 7 d. Severe sloughing of squamous epithelial cells led to a thinning of the corneal epithelium. The retinomotor response of pigmented epithelium significantly decreased from 75. 33 % ± 2. 88 % (in the control group) to 63. 33 % ± 4. 04 % (p < 0. 05, n = 3) in the 100 µg/l group. The separation and necrotic corneal epithelium may lead to partial opacity and/or irregular abrasion and thus decrease retinomotor responses. In addition, scanning electron microscopic studies revealed edema, deformity, and sloughing of the microvilli, cilia, and rods in receptor cells of the olfactory epithelium. Electroolfactogram (EOG) responses significantly decreased from − 3. 0 ± 0. 6 mV to − 1. 3 ± 0. 5 mV (1 µg/l) and − 0. 4 ± 0. 1 (5 µg/l), respec-tively (n = 3) ...|$|R
40|$|Shueh-Fen Chen and Bao-Quey Huang (2000) Cytochemical {{profiles}} {{and quantitative}} analysis of fiber types in trunk muscle of <b>tigerperch,</b> Terapon jarbua. Zoological Studies 39 (1) : 28 - 37. Fiber types in trunk muscle of the <b>tigerperch,</b> Terapon jarbua, were classified by cytochemical profiles and image analysis techniques. Serial cross-sections of trunk muscle were examined by evaluating myosin ATPase (mATPase) to categorize the muscle fiber types, {{by measuring the}} oxidative enzyme activities of SDH, NADH-TR, and LDH to identify the metabolic patterns, and by determining the glycogen and lipid contents to specify the energy sources. The study revealed 3 muscle patterns (white, red, and pink muscles) distinguished by their enzyme activities. The different fiber types differed in their mATPase activities after preincubation in different pH solutions. Oxidative enzyme activities were quantitatively analyzed and correlated to their gray-level and fiber size. In white muscle only 1 histochemical fiber type (resembling type IIb fiber in mammals, with a large cross-sectional area, CSA) could be identified. Red muscle consisted of abundant type IIc fibers (with a smaller CSA) and a few type I fibers (with a medium CSA) sparsely interposed among IIc fibers. Fibers in a mosaic arrangement of pink muscle, with different histochemical reactions and of various sizes, were classified as type I, IIb, and IIc fibers. Type IIb fiber had larger cross-sectional areas (2969. 30 ± 1237. 27 ~ 3045. 66 ± 1088. 87 µm 2), type IIc had smaller (318. 77 ± 105. 02 ~ 353. 20 ± 122. 18 µm 2), and type I had medium areas (708. 65 ± 142. 62 ~ 1192. 09 ± 308. 28 µm 2) ...|$|R
