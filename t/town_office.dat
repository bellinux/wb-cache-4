500|$|While most of {{the jobs}} created in the new town's early years were in manufacturing, the {{tertiary}} sector developed strongly from the 1960s. The Manor Royal estate, with its space, proximity to Gatwick and good transport links, attracted airport-related services such as logistics, catering, distribution and warehousing; and the Corporation and private companies built offices throughout the <b>town.</b> <b>Office</b> floorspace in the town increased from [...] in 1965 to a conservative estimate of [...] in 1984. Major schemes during that period included premises for the Westminster Bank (later part of NatWest), British Caledonian, and The Office of the Paymaster-General—a government ministry within the remit of HM Treasury.

[...] Throughout the 17th century the selectmen, [...] "particularly those elected {{again and again}} for ten or twenty years, owned considerably more land than the average citizen.

2500|$|A {{decision}} was made to re-locate the town house in the mid-1930s. The former town house on the High Street was demolished in 1935. A site for the new town house was chosen {{to the north of the}} town centre, which involved the demolition of three main villas - Adelaide, St Oalfs and Tilehurst - to make space. Construction of the new town house began in 1939 from a competition-winning design by David Carr and William Howard of Edinburgh. Only the foundations of the building had been put in place before work was interrupted by the Second World War. The nearby Osborne House on East Wemyss Place would serve as a temporary <b>town</b> <b>office,</b> for the time being. Work on the town house resumed in 1950. This was split into two phases: the officers' section and the councillors' section. The first phase (including the officers' section) was opened by James Young, then Secretary of State for Scotland on 6 July 1953. The second and final phase (including the councillors' section and unveiling the statue of [...] "The Sower" [...] by Thomas Whalen) of the building was opened by the town provost, David Wright, on 6 July 1956. The town council had their first meeting in the new building on 12 November 1956. In 1975, the town house became the headquarters of Kirkcaldy District Council. Nowadays, the role of the town house is the headquarters of the central region of Fife Council.|$|E

60|$|No wonder Cynthia gasped. Jethro Bass, Chairman of the Board, in the honored seat of Deacon Moses Hatch, the {{perquisite}} of {{the church}} in Coniston! The idea was heresy. As a matter of fact, Jock himself uttered it as a playful exaggeration. Certain nonconformist farmers, of whom there were not a few in the town, had come into Jonah Winch's store that morning; and Jabez Miller, who lived on the north slope, had taken away the breath of the orthodox by suggesting that Jethro Bass be nominated for <b>town</b> <b>office.</b> Jock Hallowell had paused once or twice on his work on the steeple to look across the tree-tops at Coniston shouldering the sky. He had been putting two and two together, and now he was merely making five out of it, instead of four. He remembered that Jethro Bass had for some years been journeying through the town, baying his hides and wool, and collecting the interest on his mortgages.|$|E
