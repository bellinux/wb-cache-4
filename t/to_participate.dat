40|$|The {{method of}} {{simplest}} equation is applied for obtaining exact solitary traveling-wave solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations that contain monomials of odd and even grade with respect <b>to</b> <b>participating</b> derivatives. The used simplest equation is f xi(2) = n(2) (f(2) - f((2 n+ 2) /n)). The developed methodology is illustrated on examples of classes of nonlinear partial differential equations that contain: (i) only monomials of odd grade with respect <b>to</b> <b>participating</b> derivatives; (ii) only monomials of even grade with respect <b>to</b> <b>participating</b> derivatives; (iii) monomials of odd and monomials of even grades with respect <b>to</b> <b>participating</b> derivatives. The obtained solitary wave {{solution for the}} case (i) contains as particular cases the solitary wave solutions of Korteweg-devries equation and of {{a version of the}} modified Korteweg-devries equation. One of the obtained solitary wave solutions for the case (ii) is a solitary wave solution of the classic version of the Boussinesq-type equation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
