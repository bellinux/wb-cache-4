40|$|Pain is {{prevalent}} in clinical settings, {{and yet it}} is relatively under-represented in the education of most students in the health professions. Because pain includes both sensory-discriminative and affective features, <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>about</b> <b>pain</b> presents unique challenges and opportunities. The present article describes the evolution of a new blueprint for clinical excellence that, among other competencies, incorporates a need for the emotional development of clinical trainees. The framework has been applied to {{the development and implementation of}} two new courses in pain. The first course is designed to provide a comprehensive foundation of medical knowledge regarding pain, while integratively introducing students to the affective dimensions of pain. The second course is designed to enhance students’ appreciation for the protean effects of pain through use of the humanities to represent medical experience. It is concluded that, to be most effective, fostering the emotional development of trainees in the health professions necessitates the incorporation of affect-focused learning objectives, educational tasks and assessment methods...|$|E

40|$|Many American schools fail to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>about</b> {{the built}} environment. However, there is both {{scholarly}} and anecdotal evidence that using students' communities {{as a teaching}} tool is an effective method for increasing student engagement and increased knowledge retention, as well as improving their knowledge transfer and higher-level thinking skills. In this thesis, I argue that schools are missing an educational opportunity to by failing to incorporate students' neighborhoods into curricula in a sustained and interdisciplinary way. I argue that planning is an ideal vehicle for interdisciplinary education, but is also a worthwhile topic {{as an end in}} itself, <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>about</b> republicanism and civic engagement at a local level.

40|$|In <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>about</b> ethical {{decision}} making in social work, {{it is essential that}} the students are able to recognise the moral implications of their work and develop a deep understanding about ethical issues and their personal responsibility for making ethical choices. Thus, more than a “how to do it” approach is needed and <b>teaching</b> <b>students</b> <b>about</b> values and ethics is an essential thread that runs through our experience-based social work education program. The present paper describes a learning unit that sought to <b>teach</b> <b>students</b> <b>about</b> ethical {{decision making}} as a critical thinking process and, in so doing, to integrate students’ knowledge and experience of values, ethics, policy, and research in the final year of study. The relationship between values, ethics, policy, research, and social work practice provided an ideal context within which students could learn to integrate their knowledge and experience and apply it directly to their fieldwork practice. The paper ends with our critical reflection on this teaching experience and a critique of decisionist ethical frameworks...|$|R
