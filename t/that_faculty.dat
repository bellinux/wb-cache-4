25|$|Antioch College was {{insolvent}} the day {{it opened}} and faced financial difficulties from its first years. From 1857 to 1859, Antioch ran an annual deficit of $5,000, {{out of a total}} budget of $13,000. In 1858, Antioch was bankrupt. Mann died in 1859 and the college was reorganized, but deficits continued. Mann's successor, Thomas Hill, took Antioch's presidency on the condition <b>that</b> <b>faculty</b> salaries be paid despite deficits. Despite this stipulation, his salary was often not paid, and he supported his family with loans. Hill and a colleague attempted to raise an endowment, but potential donors were put off by the strong sectarian leanings of some of the college's trustees. Hill resigned in 1862 due to increasing financial troubles, sectarian conflict between Christian Connection and Unitarian trustees, and his election as president of Harvard. In 1862, the college was closed until finances improved and remained closed until {{after the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} sport on campus was rowing, but it {{initially}} had no coaches or tournaments. Other sports that developed {{early in the}} campus's history were tennis, basketball, golf, croquet, and baseball. The school's football program had such a limited selection of players <b>that</b> <b>faculty</b> had {{to be used to}} fill the roster. When the college merged with the junior college in 1921, the college {{became a member of the}} Junior College Conference. After the school won most of the conference titles in a variety of sports, the league requested that college leave out of fairness to the smaller schools. For its football program, the team outscored its opponents 249 to 52 in ten games, resulting in the first sales of season tickets in 1923. From 1925 to 1926, the college played as an independent. It then joined the Southern California Conference in 1926, where it did not win a football conference championship until 1936. However, in other sports including tennis and basketball, it excelled. The college remained with the conference until 1939, when it joined the California Collegiate Athletic Association.|$|E

2500|$|Internationally {{depression}} {{as well as}} {{distress in}} medical school is widely studied and gained more attention over the years. A recent study among German medical students at international universities displayed the significantly higher risk of depression symptoms being 2.4 {{times higher than the}} average population. 23.5% of these German medical students showed clinically relevant depressive symptoms. [...] In a South Korean study, 40% of medical students appeared to have depression. Medical students with more severe depression also may be less likely to seek treatment, largely from fear <b>that</b> <b>faculty</b> members would view them as being unable to handle their responsibilities.

2500|$|Following on the 1987 {{publication}} of [...] "Policy Statement on Higher Education Faculty Governance", in 1989 the NEA issued a [...] "Policy Statement on Higher Education Policy for Community College Governance."

[...] The statement is based on the same principles, believing cooperative decision-making and collective bargaining in governance should be based on “collegial” relationships. [...] Where statements from the NEA and the AAUP advocate the importance of faculty involvement in governance, the community college statement notes that many do not exercise the right when available and <b>that</b> <b>faculty</b> “at public institutions are not yet permitted to bargain collectively in many states”.

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that code-switching (CS) between {{languages}} in spoken discourse is prevalent in multilingual contexts and is used for many purposes. More recently, {{it has become the}} subject of much concern in academic contexts in negatively affecting students’ language use and learning. However, while the concern has been increasing, no rigorous studies have been done in L 1 Arabic academic contexts. In this paper, the researchers explore university faculty and students’ views on CS in higher education classes in an American-style institution in Lebanon. Data were collected through unstructured interviews, non-participant observations and questionnaires. Main findings show <b>that</b> <b>faculties</b> are unaware <b>that</b> they code-switch contrary to what non-participant observations showed. The surveys revealed that students code-switch to learn better and <b>that</b> their <b>faculty</b> code-switch in class. Recommendations to raise awareness of this phenomenon in bi/multilingual academic contexts are made. PublishedN/...|$|R

2500|$|Economist and philosopher F. A. Hayek said that, originally, [...] "the term 'natural' {{was used}} to {{describe}} an orderliness or regularity {{that was not the}} product of deliberate human will. Together with 'organism' {{it was one of the}} two terms generally understood to refer to the spontaneously grown in contrast to the invented or designed. Its use in this sense had been inherited from the stoic philosophy, had been revived in the twelfth century, and it was finally under its flag that the late Spanish Schoolmen developed the foundations of the genesis and functioning of spontaneously formed social institutions." [...] The idea that 'natural' was [...] "the product of designing reason" [...] is a product of a seventeenth century rationalist reinterpretation of the law of nature. Luis Molina, for example, when referred to the 'natural' price, explained that it is [...] "so called because 'it results from the thing itself without regard to laws and decrees, but is dependent on many circumstances which alter it, such as the sentiments of men, their estimation of different uses, often even in consequence of whims and pleasures". And even John Locke, when talking about the foundations of natural law and explaining what he thought when citing [...] "reason", said: [...] "By reason, however, I do not think is meant here <b>that</b> <b>faculty</b> of the understanding which forms traint of thought and deduces proofs, but certain definite principles of action from which spring all virtues and whatever is necessary for the proper moulding of morals." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johann von Staupitz, his {{successor}} as vicar of the congregation, followed in his footsteps. Staupitz had been prior at Tübingen, then at Munich, {{and had taken}} a prominent part in founding the University of Wittenberg in 1502, where he became a professor of theology and the first dean of <b>that</b> <b>faculty.</b> He continued to reform the order with the zeal of Proles, {{as well as in}} his spirit and with his methods. He collected the [...] "Constitutiones fratrum eremitarum S. August. ad apostolicorum privilegiorum formam pro Reformatione Alemanniae", which were approved in a chapter held at Nuremberg in 1504. A printed copy of these is still to be seen in the university library of Jena. Supported by the general of the order, Aegidius of Viterbo, he obtained a papal brief (15 March 1506), granting independence under their own vicar-general to the reformed German congregations and furthermore, 15 December 1507, a papal Bull commanding the union of the Saxon province with the German Congregation of the Regular Observants. All the Augustinian convents of Northern Germany were, in accordance with this decree, to become parts of the regular observance. But when, in 1510, Staupitz commanded all the hermits of the Saxon province to accept the regular observance on pain of being punished as rebels, and to obey him as well as the general of the order, and, on 30 September, published the papal Bull at Wittenberg, seven convents refused to obey, among them that of Erfurt, of which Martin Luther was a member—Luther seems to have gone to Rome on this occasion {{as a representative of the}} rebellious monks.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Cruzado's governance style has been highly lauded, but {{has also been}} questioned. On January 15, 2013, approximately 100 MSU faculty met in an off-campus meeting that the Bozeman Daily Chronicle called [...] "highly unusual". The off-campus meeting issued a press release that identified five complaints: 1) Rapid growth of student enrollment “without a clear plan to provide the additional faculty, staff and facilities needed to maintain the quality of an MSU education.”; 2) Worry about maintaining MSU’s “standing as a top-tier public research institution,” which drives economic development and attracts out-of-state students.; 3) Faculty concerns about a [...] “trend towards centralization of academic decisions.”; 4) <b>That</b> <b>faculty</b> and others are not being listened to by senior administrators; and 5) Perceived “misalignment” between senior administrators’ vision for MSU and that of faculty and academic leaders in departments and colleges. Some faculty expressed private concerns about micromanagement, failure to fill faculty vacancies, lack of follow-through after listening sessions, and too-rapid growth in enrollment that left faculty stressed. On January 17, 2013, Cruzado met face-to-face with three faculty members who facilitated the off-campus meeting, Sue Monahan, Robert Rydell, and Linda Young. This meeting also included Faculty Senate chair John Neumeier and chair-elect Robert Mokwa. Taking the concerns [...] "very seriously" [...] Cruzado issued a public, four-page letter on January 18, 2013. Cruzado reiterated that she was working with the Board of Regents to find funding {{to keep up with}} MSU’s student growth and to match federal research grants, and that she strives to maintain open communication with administrators, faculty, and students. To enhance communication and problem-solving, Cruzado and Provost Martha Potvin plan to attend department meetings “to work together in identifying possible solutions." [...] Cruzado also denounced as [...] "preposterous" [...] persistent rumors that she would leave Montana State to take a position at another university. Although the off-campus meeting represented about one-quarter of MSU's tenure-track faculty, it did not capture all opinions at Montana State University. Valerie Copie, a professor of biochemistry and chemistry emphasized that dissent is not necessarily widespread. She stated, “I support our president...Our administration is more open than ever." ...|$|E
