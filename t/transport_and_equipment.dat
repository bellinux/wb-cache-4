5|$|Joining {{the newly}} formed RAAF in August 1921, Mackinolty {{established}} himself as the service's senior logistician between the wars, first as Director of <b>Transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>Equipment</b> from 1929 to 1935, and thereafter as Director of Equipment. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1937. Soon after the outbreak of World WarII, he became Director of Supply and was promoted to group captain. In June 1942 he was raised to acting air commodore and appointed the Air Member for Supply and Equipment (AMSE). Promoted to air vice marshal in 1948, Mackinolty continued to serve as AMSE until his sudden death from cancer in February 1951, aged fifty-five.|$|E

On 20November that year, he married Eileen Moore at Christ Church, South Yarra; the couple had a son and a daughter. In 1925, Mackinolty was posted as Equipment Officer to No.3 Squadron at the recently established RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. [...] Promoted flight lieutenant, he was appointed Director of <b>Transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>Equipment</b> at RAAF Headquarters in 1929, effectively making him the Air Force's senior supply officer, a role he would occupy for the next twenty-two years. His continuous tenure in essentially the one post was comparable to the RAAF's other chief logistician, Squadron Leader (later Air Vice Marshal) Ellis Wackett, who served as its senior engineer for twenty-four years, from 1935 to 1959.|$|E

Senior project officer for the tests was Maj. Samuel B. Brown, with Capt. Russell M. Bobyna as assistant project officer. J. A. White of the 3206th Test Wing was project engineer.

2500|$|A hasty {{plan was}} made to block Dieppe harbour and on 10 June, [...] (Captain G. A. Garnon-Williams) escorted three blockships to the port. Two were sunk in the {{approach}} channel but the third ship hit a mine just outside, which prevented it being sunk {{at the entrance to}} the inner harbour. (James had signalled that many IX Corps troops would probably be trapped against the sea near St. Valery, where he had assembled flotillas of smaller craft under the local Senior Naval Officer.) Beach parties landed at Le Havre to take control of the evacuation on 10 June and after a 24-hour postponement, the evacuation began on 11 June. The embarkation was hindered somewhat by the damage to the port caused by Luftwaffe bombing; the troopship , was hit and beached, the electric power was also cut, rendering the cranes on the docks useless. Ramps were tried for vehicle loading but it was too slow. On 12 June, RAF fighters began patrolling the port and deterred more raids and an attempt {{was made to}} save the <b>transport</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> by diverting it over the Seine via the ferry crossings at Caudebec or the ships at Quillebeuf at the river mouth.
