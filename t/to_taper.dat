5|$|At State Street, NY38 leaves US20 and NY5 {{and heads}} north through the city's north side, {{crossing}} the Owasco Outlet and serving the Auburn Correctional Facility. The route passes through several blocks {{of commercial and}} residential development up to Grant Street, where it begins <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> off. It ceases almost entirely near the northern city line at York Street, where the homes along the highway become more sporadic and spaced apart.|$|E
5|$|By late 1944, rocket {{development}} and testing work began <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> off, and production models started {{to reach the}} Navy and USAAF in quantity. The director of the OSRD, Vannevar Bush saw an opportunity {{to use some of}} the expertise at Caltech on another secret wartime project he was involved with, the Manhattan Project. Bush arranged for Charles C. Lauritsen, the head of the rocket team at Caltech, to visit the Los Alamos Laboratory, and meet with the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the laboratory director, Robert Oppenheimer, and senior scientists at the Los Alamos laboratory. Oppenheimer and Lauritsen knew each other well, as Oppenheimer had worked at Caltech before the war. In addition to its scientists, Caltech also possessed an experienced procurement team, headed by Trevor Gardner. This group worked closely with its counterpart at Los Alamos, which was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Lockridge.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to toe in the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E
50|$|A {{drawback}} <b>to</b> <b>tapered</b> screw extractors is {{that their}} wedge action tends to expand the drilled, and thus weakened, screw. This wedging action can lock the screw even more tightly in place, making it difficult or impossible to extract.|$|R
50|$|The nest {{would usually}} consist of 2-3 eggs (sometimes 4) {{which tend to}} be an oval <b>to</b> <b>tapered</b> oval shape {{averaging}} 28mm by 20mm in size. The eggs appear chestnut in colour and can be a whitish pink to salmon red, or spotted purplish red to purple.|$|R

Laser prepared for independent firing pulse, which follows preionizing pulse. Winding is simple, light in weight, low in bulk and power consumption, and inexpensive...|$|R
5|$|The route heads {{northwest}} from Winthrop, {{passing through}} heavily forested areas of St. Lawrence County. As NY420 passes out of Stockholm and into Norfolk, the forests surrounding the highway begin <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> off and {{give way to}} small pockets of residences and cultivated fields. The amount of homes along the route begin to increase upon intersecting Plum Brook Road, at which point NY420 becomes lined with residences for much of its run through north Norfolk. However, the string of homes ends near the northern town line, and the highway becomes flanked by forests once more as it curves northward and enters the town of Massena.|$|E
25|$|Insight has a {{coefficient}} of drag of 0.25e. The absence of a rear seat allows the body <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> just behind the driver and the rear track is 110mm (approximately 4.3 inches) narrower than the front track.|$|E
25|$|Abueva's struggles {{seemed to}} {{continue}} towards the next season. He felt that {{his penchant for}} fouling out and getting into foul trouble {{early in the game}} limited his chances of helping the Aces down the stretch on most of their games. Although Abueva claims he had tried <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> off his overeagerness on the defensive-end so he can stay out of foul trouble.|$|E

50|$|Cultivated {{seedlings}} (measured at ca node 10): cotyledons bilobed; stems rounded in cross-section, slightly warty, usually glaucous; leaves sessile, opposite {{for many}} pairs, orbicular to cordate, 1-6 cm long, 0.5-5.3 cm wide, base rounded <b>to</b> <b>tapering,</b> margin entire or subcrenulate, apex rounded to pointed, glaucous or grey-green. Flowering {{has been recorded}} in January, February and March.|$|R
50|$|Baidak (байда́к) was {{a wooden}} sailing ship, {{similar to a}} cog. It had a flush-laid flat bottom {{approximately}} 3-4 metres wide, which narrowed <b>to</b> <b>tapered</b> ends, and one 5 metre mast. Measuring approximately 15-20 (or 36-60) metres in length, a baidak could carry a load of approximately 200 tons. It could be operated by oars or sail.|$|R
25|$|It {{was around}} this time that O'Keefe finally parted ways with his {{faithful}} backing group the Dee Jays, as he devoted {{more and more time}} to TV. It was an era in which many major artists mimed songs at outdoor locations, such at Manly Beach's Fairy Bower in 1967. Live performances began <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> off. The Dee Jays stayed together, however, and continued performing until 1980.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2012, India {{entered a}} period of reduced growth, which slowed to 5.6%. Other {{economic}} problems also became apparent: a plunging Indian rupee, a persistent high current account deficit and slow industrial growth. Hit by the US Federal Reserve's decision <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> quantitative easing, foreign investors began rapidly pulling money out of India – though this reversed with the stock market approaching its all-time high and the current account deficit narrowing substantially.|$|E
25|$|The narrow body, and {{corresponding}} low frontal area, was achieved with tandem seating, which also allowed the body <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> like an aircraft fuselage, within a practical length. The tandem seating also centralized {{the mass of}} the car along the longitudinal axis which, combined with the low center of gravity, low weight, and wheel placement at the vehicle's extremes, gave the Tg500 good handling characteristics. A more minor advantage of tandem seating was that it made an export version to countries that drive on the left unnecessary.|$|E
5000|$|Tapered fingers is {{when one}} end of the finger is diminished in thickness, causing the ends of the fingers to appear pointed. This {{deformity}} is not debilitating in any particular manner. In addition <b>to</b> <b>tapered</b> fingers, both hands and feet tend to be small. Some males were observed to have pes planus, also known as flat feet.|$|R
40|$|Hover {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on three small scale rotors to evaluate the effects of blade planform taper on rotor hover performance. Tests were conducted on a rectangular swept-tip configuration, on a configuration with a 3 <b>to</b> 1 <b>taper</b> over the outboard 20 percent of the span, and on a configuration with a 5 <b>to</b> 1 <b>taper</b> over the outboard 20 percent of the blade span. The investigation covered a range of thrust coefficients from 0 to 0. 0075 {{and a range of}} tip speeds from 300 to 600 ft/sec. The tests showed that both tapered configurations had better hover performance than the swept-tip rectangular configuration and that the 3 <b>to</b> 1 <b>taper</b> configuration was better than the 5 <b>to</b> 1 <b>taper</b> configuration. The test results were compared with predictions made with a prescribed wake analysis, a momentum analysis, and a simplified free wake analysis...|$|R
50|$|Melaleuca cliffortioides {{grows to}} {{a height of}} about 1.6 m. Its branchlets are densely covered with soft, fine hairs. The leaves are {{arranged}} alternately, 4-9 mm long, 1.6-2.5 mm wide, narrow oval <b>to</b> egg-shaped, <b>tapering</b> <b>to</b> a sharp point and have many prominent oil glands.|$|R
25|$|By 1874, skirts began <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> in {{the front}} and were adorned with trimmings, while sleeves {{tightened}} around the wrist area. Towards 1875 to 1876, bodices featured long but even tighter laced waists, and converged at a sharp point in front. Bustles lengthened and slipped even lower, causing the fullness of the skirt to further diminish. Extra fabric was gathered together behind in pleats, thus creating a narrower but longer tiered, draped train too. Due to the longer trains, petticoats had to be worn underneath {{in order to keep the}} dress clean.|$|E

25|$|According to Gray, {{this plan}} was first put into action {{when he had}} a meeting with Vernon Walters, then deputy {{director}} of the CIA, in which he quotes Walters as falsely saying, “If the investigation gets pushed further south of the border… it could trespass onto some of our covert projects. Since you’ve got these five men under arrest, it will be best <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> the matter off here.” This conversation implicitly stated that the FBI should not interview Manuel Ogarrio and Kenneth Dahlberg, individuals connected with the money used to fund the Watergate burglars.|$|E
50|$|Leaves: 'Virgin' (first-year) shoots {{are mostly}} pinnate with five {{leaflets}}, {{which range from}} 5-13 cm in length, while on fertile shoots leaflets are in threes or smaller.

50|$|Piper's {{transition}} <b>to</b> <b>tapered</b> wings for the Cherokee series {{resulted in}} a new wing for the PA-32 series as well. The tapered-wing version of the Cherokee Six was named the Saratoga and debuted in 1980. Due to product liability concerns and economic conditions, the general aviation industry went into decline in the early 1980s and Saratoga production ceased in 1985.|$|R

25|$|NY423 {{begins at}} a {{junction}} with NY9P in the hamlet of Snake Hill, {{located on the}} eastern shores of Saratoga Lake {{in the town of}} Stillwater. The route proceeds southeastward as a two-lane highway, winding its way past a handful of homes built {{on the side of a}} valley surrounding the lake. The residential surroundings begin <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> off at the top of the valley's edge, where NY423 meets the south end of County Route70 (CR70). From here, the highway turns slightly eastward, passing through a wooded, marshy area surrounding a small creek.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} side tanks was often limited {{in order to}} give access to the inside motion. If it was desired to extend them {{to the front of the}} {{locomotive}} for greater capacity, access could be facilitated by apertures provided at the appropriate location. With larger side tanks it was sometimes necessary <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> the tanks slightly at the front end to improve forward visibility. Side tanks almost all stopped at, or before, the end of the boiler barrel, with the smokebox protruding ahead. A few designs did reach to the front of the smokebox and these were termed 'flatirons'.|$|E
25|$|The suburbs slowly begin <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> off {{north of}} the Thruway, where NY298 becomes Collamer Road after Kinne Street leaves at a northeastern turn in the route. It narrows back into a two-lane {{undivided}} highway and proceeds through the pockets of residential and commercial development that comprise the hamlet of Collamer {{on its way to}} an interchange with I-481 at exit7. After the I-481 junction, it heads east yet slightly northwards into the town of Manlius, where the dense commercial and residential areas give way to more rural regions with only a handful of homes. NY298 continues across increasingly flat, wooded and undeveloped country to a four-way junction named Shepps Corners. Here, the route turns northeast once again, changing names to Minoa–Bridgeport Road as it enters Cicero.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Flexural {{motion of}} a {{cantilever}} bar {{can be used}} <b>to</b> monitor the <b>taper</b> angle measurements of the bar without incorporating any geometric measurement. This provides non-destructive taper measurement with fast processing in manufacturing line. The laser ablation of a free end of the cantilever bar enables to generate a recoil pressure at the irradiated surface while resulting in external forcing function for the initiation of the flexural motion. Consequently, in the present study, laser induced ablation of free end tapered cantilever bar and resulting displacement and frequency of the flexural motion is examined. The study is extended to include influence {{of positive and negative}} bar taper angles on the flexural characteristics. In addition, deviation of displacement and frequency of the flexural motion due <b>to</b> <b>tapered</b> bar from the parallel bar is examined. It is found that the flexural characteristics of the <b>tapered</b> bar enable <b>to</b> determine <b>taper</b> angle of the bar with high accuracy...|$|R

25|$|The all-wood wing pairs {{comprised}} {{a single}} structural unit throughout the wingspan, with no central longitudinal joint. Instead, the spars ran from wingtip to wingtip. There {{was a single}} continuous main spar and another continuous rear spar. Because of the combination of dihedral with the forward sweep of the trailing edges of the wings, this rear spar {{was one of the}} most complex units to laminate and to finish machining after the bonding and curing. It had to produce the correct 3D tilt in each of two planes. Also it was designed and made <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> from the wing roots towards the wingtips. Both principal spars were of ply box construction, using in general 0.25 in. plywood webs with laminated spruce flanges, plus a number of additional reinforcements and special details.|$|E
25|$|The main {{cemetery}} {{is approximately}} 210 metres in length from west to east, with a north-south width of 50 metres, although it appears <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> at both ends. Its interior totals around 10,500 square metres, about one hectare or 2½ acres. The graves were not evenly spaced in the cemetery, but often clustered together in what excavator Brian Philp suggested {{might have been}} family units. Most of these burials were on the southern side of the cemetery, and the site was more densely crowded in the west than the east. From the 198486 excavation, 50 of the graves contained a single skeleton, with the only exception being Grave 19, where two individuals had been buried together. In keeping with many Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, most of the inhumations were broadly aligned east to west. Philp considered it significant that 66% of the 51 burials excavated from 198486 were orientated between 70 and 109 degrees.|$|E
25|$|In 1882 the North Borneo Chartered Company {{opted to}} bring in Hakka labourers from Longchuan County, Guangdong. The first batch of 96 Hakkas brought to Sabah landed in Kudat on April 4, 1883 under the {{leadership}} of Luo Daifeng (Hakka: Lo Tai Fung). In the following decades Hakka immigrants settled throughout the state, with their main population centres in Kota Kinabalu (then known as Jesselton) and its surroundings (in the districts of Tuaran, Penampang, Ranau, Papar, Kota Belud as well as a lesser extent to Kota Marudu), with a significant miniority residing in Sandakan (mainly ex-Taiping revolutionists), and other large populations in other towns and districts, most notably in Tawau, Tenom, Kuala Penyu, Tambunan, Sipitang, Beaufort, Keningau and Kudat. The British felt the development of North Borneo was too slow and in 1920 they decided to encourage Hakka immigration into Sabah. In 1901, the total Chinese population in Sabah was 13897; by 1911, it had risen 100% to 27801. Hakka immigration began <b>to</b> <b>taper</b> off during World War 2 and declined to a negligible level in the late 1940s.|$|E
