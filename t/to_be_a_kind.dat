25|$|Empirical {{concepts}} are ultimately based on empirical perceptions. Kant, however, tried to claim that, analogously, pure concepts (Categories) {{also have a}} basis. This pure basis is supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of pure perception, which he called a schema. But such an empiricist analogy contradicts his previous rationalist assertion that pure concepts (Categories) simply exist in the human mind without having been derived from perceptions. Therefore, they are not based on pure, schematic perceptions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} tales of ghosts at the palace. One {{of them is}} the Grå Gubben (the Old Grey Man) who {{according}} to tradition lives in the cellar ruins of the old Tre Kronor Castle.

According to other legends it is no other than Birger Jarl standing guard. He is supposed to have appeared for Nicodemus Tessin the Younger, to tell him that he would not live to see the palace completed.|$|E

25|$|More speculatively, the Higgs {{field has}} also been {{proposed}} as {{the energy of the}} vacuum, which at the extreme energies of the first moments of the Big Bang caused the universe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of featureless symmetry of undifferentiated, extremely high energy. In this kind of speculation, the single unified field of a Grand Unified Theory is identified as (or modelled upon) the Higgs field, and it is through successive symmetry breakings of the Higgs field, or some similar field, at phase transitions that the presently known forces and fields of the universe arise.|$|E
25|$|An {{influx of}} Ca2+ ions into astrocytes is the {{essential}} change that ultimately generates calcium waves. Because this influx is directly caused {{by an increase in}} blood flow to the brain, calcium waves are said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of hemodynamic response function. An increase in intracellular calcium concentration can propagate outwards through this functional syncytium. Mechanisms of calcium wave propagation include diffusion of calcium ions and IP3 through gap junctions and extracellular ATP signalling. Calcium elevations are the primary known axis of activation in astrocytes, and are necessary and sufficient for some types of astrocytic glutamate release.|$|E

The sociologist Lewis F. Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu advaita, in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of dance or play of cosmic consciousness in which everything is sacred, has absolute worth and is an end in itself. While his contemporary Jiddu Krishnamurti did not approve of Rajneesh, there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.|$|E

25|$|After the betrothal, Sarada {{was left}} {{to the care of}} her parents and Ramakrishna {{returned}} to Dakshineswar. Sarada next met Ramakrishna when she was fourteen years old, and she spent three months with him at Kamarpukur. There, Ramakrishna imparted to Sarada instructions on meditation and spiritual life. Ramakrishna's frequent bhava samadhi (ecstasy) and unorthodox ways of worship led some onlookers to doubt his mental stability, while others regarded him as a great saint. Sarada joined Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar in 1872 on her own accord when she was eighteen, after hearing these rumours about his mental health. She found Ramakrishna <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> and caring person.|$|E
25|$|In October 2004, Cohen {{released}} Dear Heather, {{largely a}} musical collaboration with jazz chanteuse (and romantic partner) Anjani Thomas, although Sharon Robinson returned to collaborate on three tracks (including a duet). As light {{as the previous}} album was dark, Dear Heather reflects Cohen's own change of mood – {{he said in a}} number of interviews that his depression had lifted in recent years, which he attributed to Zen Buddhism. In an interview following his induction into the Canadian Songwriters' Hall of Fame, Cohen explained that the album was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of notebook or scrapbook of themes, and that a more formal record had been planned for release shortly afterwards, but that this was put on ice by his legal battles with his ex-manager.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{those within}} the same {{category}} (for example the four midfielders in a 4–4–2) would generally play as a fairly flat line across the pitch, with those out wide often playing in a slightly more advanced position. In many modern formations, {{this is not the}} case, which has led to some analysts splitting the categories in two separate bands, leading to four- or even five-numbered formations. A common example is 4–2–1–3, where the midfielders are split into two defensive and one offensive player; as such, this formation can be considered a type of 4–3–3. An example of a five-numbered formation would be 4-1-2-1-2, where the midfield consists of a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and an offensive midfielder; this is sometimes considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of 4-4-2.|$|E

25|$|Maaseh Merkabah (Working of the Chariot) is {{the modern}} name {{given to a}} Hekhalot text, {{discovered}} by scholar Gershom Scholem. Works of the Chariot dates from late Hellenistic period, {{after the end of}} the Second Temple period following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when the physical cult ceased to function. The idea of making a journey to the heavenly hekhal seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of spiritualization of the pilgrimages to the earthly hekhal that were now no longer possible. It is a form of pre-Kabbalah Jewish mysticism that teaches both of the possibility of making a sublime journey to God and of the ability of man to draw down divine powers to earth; it seems to have been an esoteric movement that grew out of the priestly mysticism already evident in the Dead Sea Scrolls and some apocalyptic writings (see the studies by Rachel Elior).|$|E

Infused with the DNA of a Finless Porpoise, Retasu's legs can change into a porpoise's tail while she is underwater, greatly improving her swimming ability and giving her an appearance of a mermaid. In the anime adaptation, this change can only occur when Retasu is {{in the presence of}} Mew Aqua. Retasu is portrayed as a shy and intelligent character lacking self-confidence and is the subject of frequent bullying from three girls. She is afraid of her Mew Mew powers at first, causing them to go out of control at her school until she is calmed by Ichigo and Minto. The other members of the group consider Retasu <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> and selfless person. As the series progresses, Retasu becomes a more confident person through the other Mew Mews' regular encouragement. In the anime, Retasu has a strong love interest towards Ryou and kissed him once, that only Bu-Ling is aware of their relationship.|$|E
