5|$|Actinium hydride was {{obtained}} by reduction of actinium trichloride with potassium at 300°C, and its structure was deduced by analogy with the corresponding LaH2 hydride. The source of hydrogen in <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> uncertain.|$|E
5|$|The Fischer indole {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction {{that produces the}} aromatic heterocycle indole from a (substituted) phenylhydrazine and an aldehyde or ketone under acidic conditions. <b>The</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> discovered in 1883 by Hermann Emil Fischer.|$|E

25|$|In {{the seminar}} {{paper on the}} total {{synthesis}} of (+)-monensin, Kishi and co-workers utilized the allylic strain to induce asymmetric induction in <b>the</b> hydroboration oxidation <b>reaction.</b> <b>The</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> regioselective and stereoselective. The regioselectivity of <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> due to <b>the</b> significant positive character developed at the tertiary carbon. The stereoselectivity of <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> due to <b>the</b> attack by the borane from the least hindered side to {{which is where the}} methyl group lies at.|$|R

30|$|The {{compound}} AuNP@MPA-PEG in {{ultrapure water}} {{was added to}} 200  μL anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) solution including 17  mg (0.045  mmol) LCA, and <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> solution <b>was</b> stirred for 24  h at 25  °C.

25|$|Draper {{returned}} home expecting to receive commendations for his capture of Manila, but <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> more mixed. In 1765 he was colonel of the 16th Regiment of Foot.

For metals unsuited for redox, sigma bond metathesis provides a pathway for introducing substituents without requiring oxidative addition.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>reaction</b> mixture <b>is</b> {{assumed to}} be {{homogeneous}} throughout i.e., its composition and catalyst distribution <b>are</b> uniform since <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> performed in a batch reactor.|$|R
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1920s Constructivism was the country's {{dominant}} architecture, {{and surprisingly}} many buildings of this period survive. Initially <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> towards an art decoesque Classicism that was initially inflected with Constructivist devices, such as in Iofan's House on Embankment of 1929–32. For a few years some structures were designed in a composite style sometimes called Postconstructivism.|$|E
25|$|In both Guerra dels Segadors and Guerra de Sucesión Española conflicts, the Andorran people (although {{with the}} {{statement}} neutral country) supported the Catalans who saw their rights reduced in 1716. <b>The</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> the promotion of Catalan writings in Andorra, with cultural works such as the Book of Privileges (Llibre de Privilegis de 1674), Manual Digest (1748) by Antoni Fiter i Rossell or the Polità andorrà (1763) by Antoni Puig.|$|E
25|$|Cyclopropane was {{discovered}} in 1881 by August Freund, who also proposed the correct structure for the new substance in his first paper.

25|$|When it {{was learned}} in Baltimore that Southern armies {{had crossed the}} Potomac, <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> one of {{instantaneous}} hysteria followed quickly by stoic resolution. Crowds milled in the street outside newspaper offices waiting for the latest bulletins, and the sale of liquor was halted to restrain the excitable. The public stocked up on food and other essentials, fearing a siege. Philadelphia was also sent into a flurry of frenzied preparations, despite being over 150 miles (240km) from Hagerstown and in no immediate danger.|$|E
25|$|Glucose oxidase (GOX) catalyzes the {{oxidation}} of β-D-glucose to D-glucono-δ-lactone {{with the}} simultaneous reduction of enzyme-bound flavin.

Studies showed that upon replacement of FAD with 8-hydroxy-5-carba-5-deaza FAD, the stereochemistry of <b>the</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>was</b> determined by reacting with the re face of the flavin. During turnover, the neutral and anionic semiquinones are observed which indicates a radical mechanism.|$|E
