The trains operating via Nassau Street would go to Brooklyn via the Montague Tunnel. During non-rush hours trains would terminate at Broad Street. There would be a passageway built from Grand Central via 43rd Street to Second Avenue to permit transfers.|$|E

5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the concession <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the line. Both established a bus services with a frequency as if the other operator did not exist. At the peak of the conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities.

5|$|Amtrak {{took over}} {{operation}} of most intercity rail passenger {{service in the}} United States on May 1, 1971; up until then such services were run by various private railroads. The private railroads chose to retain their most modern passenger locomotives <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. <b>To</b> <b>operate</b> these intercity services the company had to buy or lease from the private railroads whatever locomotives remained. This left Amtrak with an aging and mechanically-incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives. The mainstays of Amtrak's road diesel fleet were veteran EMD E8s and EMD E9s, which were all 10–20 years old and due for replacement.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s, many navies were {{pursuing}} the flotilla leader concept, building large destroyers {{similar to the}} World War I Royal Navy V and W-class destroyers.

The idea was that such a half-flotilla could defeat an Italian light cruiser of the Condottieri class. The Navy of the KSCS decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would {{have the ability to}} reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central Mediterranean, where they would be able <b>to</b> <b>operate</b> alongside French and British warships.|$|E
