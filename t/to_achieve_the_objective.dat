He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At this juncture, he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able {{to move out of the}} trench, he was hit by a bullet in his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E

Between 1940 and 1945, he served on the North-West Frontier and as an instructor, before deploying to Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. After independence, he took part in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, serving with the Indian Army's 6th Rajputana Rifles. During the battle, Singh was part of the leading section of a company that was assigned to capture a Pakistani post at Tithwal, in Jammu and Kashmir. Soon after their attack was launched, the company suffered heavy casualties. In time, Singh successfully occupied a Pakistani medium machine-gun post. But, by that time, the entire company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective.</b> He moved out and lobbed grenades at the next enemy post. Before moving to another trench, he received a mortal bullet wound to the head.|$|E
5|$|Warshaw {{used those}} days {{to design the}} {{structure}} of the game and segmented the concept into four ideas: world, objective, path <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective,</b> and obstacles. He envisioned a three-dimensional cube world as the setting and adapted part of the film's plot, E.T. phoning home, as the goal. Warshaw then conceived that E.T. would need to assemble a special phone to call his ship and arrive at a special landing site to achieve this goal. He considered obstacles as an element that would determine the success of a game, and experienced difficulties when taking into account the time constraints and technical limitations of the console. Inspired by the movie, adults were implemented as antagonists that would chase the alien. Feeling more adversity was needed, Warshaw included a time limit for players to accomplish the goal. Pits were devised as an element to hide the pieces of the phone as well as expand the game's world.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Warrior {{presents}} {{players with}} a clear objective from the start and uses a series of smaller scenarios to increase the hero's strength in order <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective.</b> The game begins in King Lorik's chamber in Tantegel Castle, where the hero receives information about the Dragonlord, whom he must defeat, and the stolen Balls of Light, which he must retrieve. After receiving some items and gold, the hero sets out on his quest. Much of Dragon Warrior is spent talking to townspeople and gathering information from them that leads to additional places, events, and secrets. Players are advised to take notes of these hints for future reference. Towns contain shops that sell improved weapons and armor; general stores where the player may buy other goods; inns that allow the hero to recover his health and magic, and shops that offer keys for purchase. Players may sell items at half price to shops that provide weapons, armor, or general goods. The hero's status window is shown whenever he stops moving, displaying his current experience level (LV) {{and the amount of}} hit points (HP), magic points (MP), gold (G), and experience points (E).|$|E

2500|$|With R v. Morgentaler, the Supreme Court of Canada removed {{abortion}} {{from the}} Criminal Code. Relying {{on the security}} of person clause of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the court determined that, while the state {{has an interest in}} protecting the fetus [...] "at some point", this interest cannot override that of the pregnant woman because: [...] "the right to security of the person of a pregnant woman was infringed more than was required <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> of protecting the fetus, and the means were not reasonable."

[...] The means used must be carefully designed <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective.</b> [...] They must not be arbitrary, unfair, or based on irrational considerations. [...] Professor Peter Hogg, who used to argue the rational connection test was redundant, continues to argue the criterion is of little use. [...] An example of the rational connection test being failed {{can be found in}} R. v. Morgentaler (1988), in which Dickson was of the opinion that laws against abortion should be struck down partly because of a breach of health rights under section 7 and an irrational connection between the objective (protecting the fetus and the pregnant woman's health), and the process by which therapeutic abortions were granted. [...] This process was considered unfair to pregnant women requiring therapeutic abortions, because committees meant to approve abortions were not formed or took too long. [...] (The law afterwards failed the other two proportionality criteria as well).|$|E
2500|$|The {{commander-in-chief}} of the Chinese and North Korean communist {{forces in}} the Field, General Peng Dehuai, planned to [...] "wipe out...the American 3rd Division...the British 29th Brigade and the 1st Division of the Puppet Army...after this we can wipe out the American 24th Division and 25th Division", and promised the capture of Seoul as a Mayday gift to Mao Zedong. <b>To</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective</b> Peng planned to converge on Seoul with three Chinese army groups and a North Korean corps; a total strength of some 305,000 men. The III and IX Army Groups were to attack the right flank of the American 3rd Division and the 24th and 25th Divisions on Line Utah, east of the Imjin where it turned north. The XIX Army Group on the Chinese right flank, west of the Imjin river where it turned north, were to attack {{the remainder of the}} 3rd Division and the ROK 1st Division. On the XIX Army Group front, the North Korean I Corps and Chinese 64th Army would attack the ROK 1st Division, while the 63rd Army would attack on their left, pitting it against 29th Brigade. The 63rd Army comprised three divisions, the 187th, 188th and 189th, with each division comprising three regiments, each of which comprised three battalions. Some 27,000 men in 27 battalions would be attacking 29th Brigade's four battalions, albeit in echelon, one division after the other.|$|E
2500|$|On 29 September 1918 Braithwaite's IX Corps {{was on the}} {{southern}} front line at the village of Bellenglise facing the canal, when the order came from Haig to attack through the Hindenburg Line. The assault was much more successful than earlier American efforts, encountering as they did, multiple gas attacks. The spearhead was led by the 46th (North Midland) Division. As Major H. J. C. Marshall, a divisional staff officer, recorded they were not expected to advance far, leaving that to the Americans and Australians to their left. If they {{could not get a}} foothold they were had orders to swim across the canal in ice cold water. But divisional HQ had spared no effort to find all necessary equipment <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> <b>objective.</b> They advanced one hour later than the Americans under a hail of machine gun bullets and [...] "cyclone of shells". A thick fog came down helping to mask them from German sight. Pushing on through the dawn's early light were a battalion of the North Staffordshire Regiment overran the German machine gun positions; the bridge's defenders were shot and killed, as the infantry fixed bayonets and charged. 5,000 German prisoners of war (POWs) were taken. For almost {{the first time in the}} war the attack had been an outstanding success. Brathwaite received plaudits from Monash and Rawlinson. The 46th Division recovered over 1,000 machine guns. [...] Weeks later King George V visited Bellenglise, the site where the Hindenburg Line was breached by a Territorial unit.|$|E
