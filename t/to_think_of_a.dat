5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> supernatural {{spin on the}} pirate genre. Walt Disney Pictures had Jay Wolpert write a script based on the ride in 2001, {{which was based on}} a story created by the {{executives}} Brigham Taylor, Michael Haynes, and Josh Harmon. This story featured Will Turner as a prison guard who releases Sparrow to rescue Elizabeth, who is being held for ransom money by Captain Blackheart.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the character's various television and film appearances, Quatermass was also seen {{in a variety of}} other media between the 1950s and the 1990s. In 1955 Kneale was invited by the publishers of the Daily Express to write a new prose Quatermass story for serialisation in their newspaper; as he was unable <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new storyline, they suggested he simply adapt Quatermass II, which he agreed to do. The serialisation ran in the Daily Express from 5 December 1955 to 20 December 1955, although Kneale was forced to draw it to a rapid conclusion when the paper lost interest in the project and instructed him to complete the story as soon as possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943, Alvarez {{returned}} to the United States with an offer from Robert Oppenheimer to work at Los Alamos on the Manhattan project. But Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the University of Chicago working with Enrico Fermi before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General Leslie Groves asked Alvarez <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> way that the US could {{find out if the}} Germans were operating any nuclear reactors, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly xenon 133. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring fission products for intelligence gathering. It would become extremely important after the war.|$|E

5|$|Michael (Steve Carell) has {{returned}} to his old job as regional manager of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch and announces that Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Ryan (B. J. Novak) have joined the sales team, retaining their old clients from the Michael Scott Paper Company. Dwight (Rainn Wilson), Andy (Ed Helms), Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) and Stanley (Leslie David Baker) are upset because most of those clients were ones Michael previously stole from them. They are also upset that Michael treats Pam and Ryan with more respect {{because they were the}} only people to follow him to his new company, with Michael believing his company operates within the branch despite the buyout. Dwight calls a secret meeting in the warehouse with the salespeople, minus Pam and Ryan, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> way to get their clients back.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. In {{the background of the}} classroom, there are several portraits of past United States presidents. These were added for the scene where Bart tries <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> name for his fictional letter writer, and sees a portrait of Woodrow Wilson. Woodrow's voice was performed by Harry Shearer, who did an impression of Ricardo Montalbán. The picture Bart sends Edna is of NHL and WHA star Gordie Howe. The writers had originally wanted to use a picture of American football player Johnny Unitas, but were unable to get the rights to use his image for free. Howe, their second choice, was suggested by Al Jean, who had been a Detroit Red Wings fan growing up. At the end of the episode, Howe's NHL and WHA statistics are shown because the writers decided to try something different in filling a slight time under-run.|$|E

25|$|The club courted {{controversy}} in 1949 by signing German goalkeeper Bert Trautmann {{as a replacement}} for England international Frank Swift, who had retired. Trautmann's story with Manchester City and importantly the English supporters was soon inscribed in English football folklore and it is hard <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> footballer who has been on such a life journey.|$|E
25|$|Abstraction (or modularity) – Types enable programmers {{to think}} {{at a higher}} level than the bit or byte, not bothering with {{low-level}} implementation. For example, programmers can begin <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> string as a set of character values instead of as a mere array of bytes. Higher still, types enable programmers to think about and express interfaces between two of any-sized subsystems. This enables more levels of localization so that the definitions required for interoperability of the subsystems remain consistent when those two subsystems communicate.|$|E

50|$|You have <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{unfinished}} {{flat surface}} as an uneven hilly yard. There are dips, valleys, and holes.

The gap between Michael's IQ {{and the rest of the}} family's seems to be increasing, but so is his libido. And Abi is still Abi, only more so! As for perennially put-upon Ben, what with a new arrival causing chaos in the surgery, being forced to take tango lessons and being officially {{declared}} dead, life is just one long major-league cirsis.|$|E
25|$|In Kandy, Rajasingha faced discontented nobles and a populace who {{had always}} been opposed to the {{alliance}} with the Dutch. The internal situation became so unstable {{that for a while}} Rajasingha was forced to abandon the palace and allow rebels to seize control of Sengkadagala, and even suspended the annual Perahara. In 1664, he faced open rebellion from a noble known as Ambanwela Rala, and, unable in his fury <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable punishment, sent him to the Dutch, assuming they would execute him as a Kandyan noble. It was a mistake — Ambanwela Rala traded his knowledge of the workings of Kandy for a large coconut estate in Dutch territory and died a rich man.|$|E
25|$|The {{filming of}} Ploning was entirely {{done on the}} {{municipality}} of Cuyo in Palawan. It was directed by Dante Nico Garcia, who incidentally, {{is a native of}} the town. According to him, the film is based on his childhood memories of the town. When he wrote the screenplay for the film with Benjamin Lingan, he decided to use his native tongue, Cuyonon. He had stated that the inspiration for the character Judy Ann Santos played in the film is based on a Cuyonon folk song about a girl's hidden feelings, originally sung by a male but was first recorded by a female. This led him <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> story of a woman singing the song while remembering her lover.|$|E

25|$|Some Nuraghe bronzes clearly {{portray the}} figures of chief-kings, {{recognizable}} by their wearing a cloak and carrying a staff with bosses. Also depicted are other classes, including miners, artisans, musicians, wrestlers (the latter {{similar to those of}} the Minoan civilizations) and many fighting men, which has led scholars <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warlike society, with precise military divisions (archers, infantrymen). Different uniforms could belong to different cantons or clans, or to different military units.The priestly role may have been fulfilled by women. Some small bronzes also give clues about Nuragic personal care and fashion. Women generally had long hair; men sported two long braids on each side of the face, while their head hair was cut very short or else covered by a leather cap.|$|E
25|$|Distraction from sadness using {{art therapy}} {{may be a}} better {{alternative}} than venting sadness. Two studies by Drake and Winner (2012) published from the American Psychological Association compared venting (expressing negative feelings) and distraction (expressing something that is not related to negative feelings) in one study. To distract oneself, the participants were told to draw something unrelated to a sad film they had watched. The participants who had vented were told to draw something related to the film. In study 2, the participants were told <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sad event and were put into the venting, distraction, and calming position or sitting conditions. The sitting condition allowed the passage of time to be evaluated. In study 1, the distraction method in which the participants drew something unrelated to the sad film significantly improved negative mood compared to the venting condition. In study 2, the distraction method in which the participants drew a house (something unrelated to the sad event), had significantly improved negative mood compared to venting (drawing the sad event) or the sitting condition (sat quietly for 10 minutes). Therefore, art therapy could be beneficial to people suffering from depressive moods through a way of distraction rather than venting.|$|E

Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one. Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.|$|R
