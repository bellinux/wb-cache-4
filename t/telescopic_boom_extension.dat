The cylinder support crane <b>telescopic</b> <b>booms</b> deformation {{and stability}} analysis {{model in the}} lifting plane is equivalent with the multistep column with elastic restraint. To analyze the lateral flexibility and vertical stability of the <b>telescopic</b> <b>booms</b> with elastic restraint accurately, this paper established the deflection differential equations of multi-sectioned <b>telescopic</b> <b>booms</b> with second-order effect, introduced proper boundary conditions, obtained the precise recurrence lateral deflection differential equations and the buckling characteristic equations of arbitrary sectioned <b>telescopic</b> <b>booms,</b> and some practical applications of the buckling characteristic equations were presented.

40|$|AbstractIn this investigation, a {{modeling}} {{procedure of}} a <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> of cranes is developed using the absolute nodal coordinate formulation {{together with the}} sliding joint constraints. Since <b>telescopic</b> <b>booms</b> are extracted and retracted under various operating conditions, the overall length of the boom changes dynamically, leading to the time-variant vibration characteristics. For modeling the <b>telescopic</b> structure of <b>booms,</b> a special care needs to be exercised since {{the location of the}} sliding contact point moves along the deformable axis of the flexible boom and the solution to a moving boundary problem is required. This issue indeed makes the modeling of the <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> difficult, despite the significant needs for the analysis. It is, therefore, the objective of this investigation to develop a modeling procedure for the flexible <b>telescopic</b> <b>boom</b> by considering the sliding contact condition with the dynamic frictional effect. To this end, the sliding joint constraint developed for the absolute nodal coordinate formulation is employed for describing relative sliding motion between flexible booms, while flexible booms are modeled using the beam element of the absolute nodal coordinate formulation, which allows for modeling the large rotation and deformation of the structure...|$|R

Traditional proportional-integral-derivative controller (PID) and fuzzy PID controls were, respectively, adopted in the position loop, and the control performance was simulated. The results showed that a system with fuzzy PID control eliminates “flat top” position tracking and “dead zone” speed tracking, which are generated by traditional PID, and thereby decreases the effect of friction on the performance of the servo system.
