30|$|Kim et al. [3] {{developed}} a system called, AdNext, that uses Bayesian networks {{to build a}} transition matrix for the shopping mall clients in order to predict the business type of the next location that a <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> could visit. AdNext uses the business type {{of the last two}} locations visited by a <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> to predict the business type of the next location for that client. In addition, AdNext detects the current location of the <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> by using the shopping mall’s access points. Based on the discovered location of the <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> and the predicted business type, AdNext will start generating a list of ads for every store that lies under the predicted business type and it is also {{in the area of the}} detected location. However, predicting the exact next store that could be visited by a client is significantly different from predicting the business type of the next location. Predicting the business type of the next location could result in generating many ads, because such a list will include ads from every store that falls under the predicted type of business. Furthermore, the knowledge of the business type of the last two visited locations is crucial for AdNext to be able to predict the business type of the next location. Consequently, if a <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> has a plan to only visit one or two stores, then, AdNext will not be able to make any predictions. Instead of predicting the business type, our prediction algorithm, P-DPA, predicts a set of stores that could be visited by a <b>targeted</b> <b>client,</b> and then, uses the predicted stores to generate a list of advertisements for the <b>targeted</b> <b>client.</b> In addition, P-DPA algorithm can predict the first store to visit by a <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> while AdNext will need to wait for the <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> to visit at least two stores in order to be able to make any predictions.|$|R

40|$|Marketing is {{a process}} that can help {{managers}} of libraries and information centers achieve their objectives of providing the right information to the right client at the right time, the right place, and the right way; and increasing the satisfaction of their client. Marketing calls more than just developing good products, pricing them attractively, and making them available to <b>target</b> <b>clients.</b> Libraries and information centers must also communicate with existing and potential clients to make them aware of the improved and competitive products offered, and also to build and maintain good customer relationship. However, to communicate effectively the marketing communicator must understand the client’s field of experience. Community libraries in Indonesia recognize that they can not appeal to all clients in the same way. They are too varied in characteristics that affect their needs. Identifying the <b>target</b> <b>clients,</b> developing an effective message, and selecting the massage channel are the marketing communication strategies which should be applied to reach the <b>target</b> <b>clients...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Current IP-geolocation mapping schemes [10], [12], [13], [14] {{primarily}} take delay-measurement approach, {{and most}} of them are based on the assumption of a strong correlation between networking delay and geographical distance between the <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> and the landmarks. In this paper, however, we investigate a large region of the Internet and find the delaydistance correlation is weak. We call this kind of Internet regions moderately-connected Internet regions. But we discover a more probable rule — with high probability the shortest delay comes from the closest distance. Based on this closest-shortest rule, we propose a simple and novel IP-geolocation mapping scheme for involving moderatelyconnected Internet regions, called GeoGet. In GeoGet, we take a large number of Web servers as passive landmarks and map a <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> to the geolocation of the landmark that has the shortest delay. We further use JavaScript at <b>targeted</b> <b>clients</b> to generate HTTP/Get probing for delay measurement. To control the measurement cost, we adopt a multi-step probing method to refine the geolocation of a <b>targeted</b> <b>client,</b> finally to city level. We have implemented GeoGet, and the evaluation results show that when probing about 100 landmarks, GeoGet correctly maps 35. 4 % clients to city level, which outperforms current schemes such as GeoLim [12] and GeoPing [10] by 270 % and 239 %, respectively; and the median error distance in GeoGet is around 120 km, outperforming GeoLim and GeoPing by 37 % and 70 %, respectively.

Traditionally, these servers are identified by the client honeypot monitoring state changes that result from a server interaction. These, so called high-interaction, client honeypots are slow and expensive to operate because they require an entire operating system to be hosted. We have developed a componentbased low-interaction client honeypot that emulates only the essential features of our <b>target</b> <b>clients</b> and that applies signature matching to allow fast static analysis of server responses. Performance measurements of a prototype implementation <b>targeting</b> <b>clients</b> using the HTTP 1. 1 protocol indicate that low-interaction client honeypots are faster and cheaper than high-interaction client honeypots.

50|$|One of the easy-to-use {{conventions}} of oneSIS {{is that all}} configuration settings for all nodes within a cluster are controlled by a single file on the master node, /etc/sysimage.

Changes applied to the master images appear instantly to the nodes using said images. Changing a node to boot into a different image only requires a quick modification to /etc/sysimage and a reboot of the <b>target</b> <b>client.</b> Since oneSIS was designed with the Linux-systems administrator in mind, users will not find proprietary-GUI frontends here; all the tools to image a box, copying root-images, converting diskless machines diskfull, etc. are accessible exclusively through the command line interface (CLI).

In January 2010, the government’s newly appointed National Rapporteur published Macedonia’s first annual report on trafficking, which also covered migrant smuggling. The report {{was presented to}} the stakeholders, the international community, and NGOs for comment, but the final product lacked a comprehensive assessment of anti-trafficking efforts in Macedonia and contained cursory recommendations for improvement. The government continued to rely on NGOs and international organizations to assist in conducting many of its anti-trafficking prevention programs; it forged partnerships with NGOs to distribute general anti-trafficking leaflets in specified locations and schools throughout 2009. It also translated IOM’s “Buy Responsibly” campaign and in November 2009 began broadcasting it over state television as part of a campaign to <b>target</b> <b>client</b> demand for products potentially resulting from labor trafficking. The government continued seminars in the University of Skopje and collaborated with another NGO on a series of workshops that addressed client demand for victims of sex trafficking. It also provided $1,000 to an NGO to conduct trafficking prevention lectures to youth around the country in 2009. In September 2009, the government formally adopted its 2009-2012 National Action Plan on trafficking, {{and for the first time}} budgeted specific funding for the plan’s implementation.|$|E
30|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} designed a framework called LASA, Location Aware Shopping Advertisement, that uses an ontology based formulation of clients and products profiles {{to generate a}} list of ads related to the selection history of a <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> [5]. LASA uses the shopping mall’s Wi-Fi access points to detect the current location of a client, and once the client’s location is detected, it will send a list of titles of different products available in all stores in the coverage area of the access point that discovered the client’s current location. Nevertheless, the coverage area of an access point may include a big number of stores which could result in generating {{a long list of}} products’ titles from those stores. Furthermore, a number of access points could detect the signal of a client’s mobile phone which could affect the accuracy of determining the current location of that client. Consequently, failing to discover the correct location of a <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> will hinder the process of determining the list of products’ titles that should be sent to that client. In addition, our P-DPA algorithm predicts a set of stores that could be visited and then generate a list of ads for those stores instead of just generating a possibly long list of ads for every store in the discovered area of a <b>targeted</b> <b>client</b> as in LASA.|$|R

50|$|India is {{considered}} to be a major destination for legal outsourcing due to its availability of affordable English-speaking lawyers, some of whom are UK and/or US educated, and due to a legal system that is based on English common law. Recently, new frontiers for legal outsourcing have emerged in geographic areas closer to their <b>target</b> <b>client</b> markets. Other established LPO providers can be found in Argentina, Australia, China, France, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea, each offering unique advantages concomitant with their distinctive geographic location, language capabilities and regional expertise."There is natural arbitrage between the excellent talented and low cost professionals in India, compared to the US and other developed jurisdictions, especially in the litigation management space", believes Zia Mody, managing partner AZB & Partners, one of the biggest law firms in India. Argentina, by way of example, is an increasingly desirable LPO centre for the U.S. client market due to its proximity in terms of its western hemisphere location, time zone similarity, and cultural ties to the United States. Sri Lanka, as an additional example, is an Indian competitor whose success has come from a familiarity with British law, a strong economic infrastructure, online freedom, and marketing by Indian policymakers. LPO providers in India and in these new frontiers are increasingly utilizing onshore and offshore US and UK-licensed attorneys as part of their outsourcing offering as a means to create greater quality controls, expand into more sophisticated offerings, and instill higher confidence in the ethical treatment of client sensitive data.|$|E
40|$|People {{have the}} {{tendency}} to rely on stereotypes while making judgments due to limitations of cognitive capacity. The shifting standards model suggests that people tend to use stereotypes as a standard when they make subjective judgments about members of stereotyped groups and that they unconsciously shift their standards based on stereotypes they hold for particular groups. Researchers have found that White therapists tend to shift their standards while making clinical judgment of their clients of Color. The majority of the research to date has focused on White therapists and Black clients, while the research on White therapists and Asian clients is scant. The current study investigated whether White psychology trainees shift standards in making subjective clinical judgment based on race and residency status of a fictitious White, Asian and Asian-American clients described in a vignette. The study also examined the potential relationships among White psychology trainees' level of self-reported Asian stereotype endorsement, multicultural counseling competence, and motivation to respond without prejudice {{and their impact on}} White trainees' initial clinical judgment. Participants included 439 (350 females, 89 males) White psychology trainees across the US. It was expected that White trainees would show less concern regarding symptom severity and a more optimistic prognosis for Asian target clients compared to a White <b>target</b> <b>client.</b> Furthermore, it was expected that White trainees would show less concern for symptom severity and a more optimistic prognosis for an Asian international student target compared to an Asian American <b>target</b> <b>client.</b> Results of an ANOVA revealed that White trainees did show less concern for symptom severity and more optimistic prognosis for an Asian international <b>target</b> <b>client</b> compared to a White <b>target</b> <b>client.</b> However, the results showed no difference between the ratings of symptom severity and prognosis for an Asian international student versus an Asian American student <b>target</b> <b>client.</b> For ratings of prognosis, regression analyses identified interaction effects between <b>target</b> <b>client</b> race and Asian competence stereotype endorsement, and also between <b>target</b> <b>client</b> race and participants' age.

All examined Hsp 90 homologs exhibit similar ATPase rates and undergo similar conformational changes. One of the key differences is that cytosolic Hsp 90 interacts with a large number of cochaperones that regulate the ATPase activity of Hsp 90 or have other functions, such as <b>targeting</b> <b>clients</b> to Hsp 90.
