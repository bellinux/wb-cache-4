40|$|Money {{laundering}} is the disguising of {{the illegal}} origin of money by bringing {{it back into the}} legal financial circuit. Therefore, in this dissertation I try to establish a theoretical framework to understand the role of social networks, and the link between criminals and legal actors in the money laundering process. I focus on the money laundering method called smurfing; the splitting of large criminal proceeds into small inconspicuous amounts, and since this technique typically requires a network, it requires potential criminals to form links with other people and to construct a money laundering network to launder their money. The research questions are focused on how the networks are formed when criminals strategically form links to launder their money and what the shape of the network is at the macro-level. Moreover, focus is also on optimal policies to fight crime and money laundering, both at the national and the international level. Towards this end, I introduce social network and game theory into the field of money laundering. The study also includes some simulations in order to find the optimal budget for anti-money laundering policy. InChapter 2, I analyze a typical drug-crime scenario by presenting a simple model to study the formation of a money laundering network in this context. I assume that there are three types of actors: criminal bosses, foot soldiers, and dishonest workers. I show that the money laundering network at the macro level has an extended inter-linked star structure in which the talented criminal bosses are fully interconnected. I also show that agents’ willingness to become criminals is endogenously dependent on the wage of workers. In Chapters 3 and 4, I consider only two groups of agents in the network, potential criminals and workers. After characterizing the network I analyze the national and international policy to combat money laundering. The crucial focus of Chapter 3 is the analysis of the optimal mixture of anti-crime and anti-money laundering policies. Which policies should a law enforcement agency focus on to combat either crime or money laundering in order to minimize total criminal activity in a society? In the present model, this is expressed in terms of an optimal budget sharing rule. I also empirically implement the model using real world data and calculate the optimal policy response numerically with a macro-level “sufficient statistics’’ approach. The aim of Chapter 4 is to theoretically assess different options for <b>transnational</b> <b>policy</b> <b>cooperation</b> to fight crime and money laundering. I consider four regimes to combat money laundering: a decentral regime without an international information exchange; a decentral regime with an information exchange; a central regime with an evenly split budget among the two countries; a central regime with a tailor-made budget. I determined the best option from the viewpoint of each country and from the overall viewpoint, considering countries that differ in average income and country sizes. My findings show that the first-best regime is to implement a central authority which allocates tailor-made budgets...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple counterexample {{to the belief}} that <b>policy</b> <b>cooperation</b> among benevolent governments is desirable. It also explains circumstances under which such counter-examples are possible and relates them to the literature on time inconsistency. Since the work of Hamada (1976), investigating the effects of increasing <b>policy</b> <b>cooperation</b> among countries has been a major topic in international economics. A standard conclusion of this work is that increasing <b>policy</b> <b>cooperation</b> among countries is desirable. In a seminal paper, Rogoff (1985) has challenged this view. Using a simple monetary model, Rogoff shows that <b>cooperation</b> among <b>policy</b> makers can lead to a lower level of welfare than noncooperation does. Rogoff's result has caused much consternation among those who advocate <b>policy</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and his work has been criticized along several dimensions. For example, some authors, including Canzoneri and Henderson (1988), have noted that a key assump-tion in Rogoff's model is that the objective function of each country's policy maker does not coincide with the objective function of its residents. Indeed, if in his model policy makers maximize the welfare of their country's residents, the counterexample is overturne...|$|R

40|$|In a {{wide variety}} of {{international}} macroeconomic models monetary <b>policy</b> <b>cooperation</b> is optimal, non-cooperative policies are inefficient, but optimal policies can be attained non-cooperatively by optimal design of domestic institutions/contracts. We show that given endogenous institutional design, inefficiencies of non-cooperation cannot and will not be eliminated. We model the delegation stage explicitly and show that subgame perfect, credible contracts (chosen by governments based on individual rationality) are non-zero, but are different from optimal contracts and hence lead to inefficient equilibria. Optimal contracts require cooperation at the delegation stage, which is inconsistent with the advocated non-cooperative nature of the solution. A general solution method for credible contracts and an example from international monetary <b>policy</b> <b>cooperation</b> are considered. Our results feature delegation as an equilibrium phenomenon, explain inefficiencies of existing delegation schemes and hint to a potentially stronger role for supranational authorities in international policy coordination.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the ambition}} {{of the article}} is not sorely to test the explanatory power of the path dependency argument but more generally to understand the underlying driving forces. This opens up for the relevance of applying alternative theoretical frameworks. One of these frameworks is <b>transnational</b> <b>policy</b> learning mechanisms. As historians have pointed out intra-Nordic transnational learning and lessons {{has been an important}} factor in the shaping of the national welfare systems (Kettunen & Petersen, 2011) and it {{raises the question of whether}} <b>transnational</b> <b>policy</b> learning mechanisms have been involved in the formation of this policy area from the 1990 s and upwards. Research has shown how transnational learning mechanisms were present back in the 1960 s and 1970 s in the area of immigration and integration policy (Brochmann & Hagelund, 2012). The methodological approach based on process tracing and thick description allows us to take these dynamics into account by studying whether these mechanisms are prevalent. Furthermore, based on these theoretical assumptions one could expect to find common approaches to activation for newcomers in the three countries.|$|R
40|$|After {{the end of}} the Cold War, the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) {{developed}} into a highly dynamic area of cross-border cooperation and transnational networking.

Governance towards sustainable development of the Baltic Sea Region undoubtedly requires a combination of national governance with these governance types beyond the nation-state. In this respect, <b>transnational</b> (<b>policy)</b> networks and the European Union provide promising new approaches that can complement the traditional forms of international and intergovernmental cooperation between nation-states.
