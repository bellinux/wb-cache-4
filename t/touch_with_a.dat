Community purchased an 18,000kilogram (40,000lb) container of Maraba beans at the above-average rate of US$3 per kilogram. The beans were transported to Louisiana, where they were roasted and blended {{into one of the}} company's gourmet coffees.

5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way of {{covering}} the Taliban's growing influence in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E

There is nothing that could prevent a miniature from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves from becoming an effective help of Christian meditation today.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War, a Jewish {{group called}} Nakam {{formulated}} several plans to kill Germans in revenge for the Holocaust. Nakam's leader Abba Kovner, a former Lithuanian partisan, {{testified that he}} had approached Weizmann (at that time, President of the World Zionist Organization) with plans for a mass poisoning and that Wiezmann had put him in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chemist who arranged for a quantity of poison to be procured. According to the story, Kovner did not tell Weizmann of his intention to poison millions of Germans via their water supply, but only of the backup plan to poison SS members who were in allied POW camps. The lesser plan was put into operation in April 1946 at Stalag 13. Kovner's story was repeated in 1998 by another Nakam leader Yulik Harmatz. There is no independent evidence for the meeting and some historians doubt it. Kovner's biographer Dina Porat wrote that Weizmann was not in Palestine on {{the date of the}} alleged meeting but allows that he might have met Weizmann in early 1946 instead.|$|E

500|$|Regarding Dewdney's writing, the {{reviewer}} for Publishers Weekly {{wrote that}} Dewdney writes carefully and [...] "confidently". Another reviewer called the book [...] "engaging and recreational". Gisèle Baxter, in Canadian Literature, found {{his use of}} language [...] "provok consideration through its elegant turns of phrase and image" [...] and Laura Wright, in Discover called the imagery [...] "arresting". In The Globe and Mail, poet and novelist Margaret Atwood wrote, [...] "The prose moves from the strictly informative to the lyrical to the charming to the amusing to the odd to the strangely moving without batting an eye." [...] Another reviewer noted Dewdney [...] "combined a deft lyric <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> deep interest in science". The reviewer for Canadian Geographic wrote that [...] "the strength {{of the book is}} in its artful mix of science and poetry". Literary critic Sven Birkerts found Dewdney to be [...] "an engaging enough narrator and solid, enthusiastic stylist". The book's structure received mixed reviews, some reviewers found Dewdney was able to effectively transition between various topics while other reviewers did not. Birkerts wrote the book has [...] "a fun-facts-fished-from-the-data-ocean... end-of-term crammer" [...] sense to it. The Quill & Quire and The Economist reviewers found the topics were too cursory, like [...] "an encyclopedia entry". Birkerts concluded [...] "that any one of Dewdney's excursions could earn its keep as a column in a popular science magazine" [...] but assembled into one book the topics seemed random.|$|E

The advance of the 3rd Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Brigades from Oghratina to Bir el Abd was to begin at daylight on 9 August, with the 5th Mounted Brigade forming the reserve. On {{the left of the}} New Zealanders, Royston's Column; a composite of the depleted 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades, had gone to Katia to water and had then march through the night to the Hod Hamada [...] north-west of Bir el Abd, where they arrived at 03:00 on 9 August. They were to bivouaced for one and a half hours before advancing to a point [...] north-east of Bir el Abd, to cooperate with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade's attack on the rearguard position at 06:30. Since the attack, supported by only four horse artillery batteries, was on a prepared position held in superior strength, strong in machine guns, and covered by double the number of guns, including heavy howitzers, it was something of a gamble. The attacking force's only advantage was its mobility.|$|E
500|$|In 1967, {{after having}} {{wrestled}} with other partners, including {{a stint as}} The Internationals with Karl Von Brauner, Costello decided {{that he wanted to}} reform The Fabulous Kangaroos. He got in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend from Great Britain, Tinker Todd, and asked him to be his new partner and reform The Fabulous Kangaroos. Todd agreed, taking the name [...] "Ray St. Clair" [...] and adopting an [...] "Australian" [...] persona. George [...] "Crybaby" [...] Cannon had managed Costello and Von Brauner when they wrestled as The Internationals, and he was brought in to be The Kangaroos new manager. Not long after Costello and St. Clair hit the circuit, they captured both gold and the hatred of the crowd, just like the original Kangaroos. A couple of months after reforming, Costello and St. Clair won the NWA Detroit version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship from Fred Curry and Billy Red Lyons, but lost the titles to Fred Curry and Dan Miller a few weeks later. Costello and St. Clair showed the same gift for riling up the fans as Costello and Heffernan had and even caused their own share of riots. One particular event in Cincinnati, Ohio saw the predominantly African American crowd start a riot after The Kangaroos spat {{in the eye of the}} African American Bobo Brazil during a match. The crowd rushed towards the ring when a fan fell from the balcony, causing a diversion that enabled Costello and St. Clair to escape the ring and get back to their dressing room. When fans started to break down the door to the dressing room, The Kangaroos ducked out the back, ran down an alley and hid in a half full dumpster overnight. The next morning when The Kangaroos returned to their car, they found all four tires slashed. Despite the success of the new version of The Fabulous Kangaroos, the Costello / St. Ray team did not last more than six tumultuous months. St. Clair missed his native Britain and was suffering from a debilitating knee injury that meant he had to retire from wrestling altogether.|$|E
