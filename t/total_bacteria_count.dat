Ozonation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation are two technologies {{that have been}} used to treat relatively large aquaculture flows, including flows within freshwater systems that recirculate water. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of ozone application alone or ozone application followed by UV irradiation to reduce abundance of heterotrophic and <b>total</b> coliform <b>bacteria</b> in a water reuse system. Results indicate that when only ozone was applied at dosages – defined by the product of the ozone concentration times the mean hydraulic residence time (Ct) – that ranged from 0. 10 to 3. 65 minmg/L, the <b>total</b> heterotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> and <b>total</b> coliform <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> in the water exiting the contact basin were reduced to, respectively, 3 – 12 cfu/mL (1. 1 – 1. 6 LOG 10 reduction) and 2 – 18 cfu/ 100 mL (1. 9 – 3. 1 LOG 10 reduction). Bacteria inactivation appeared to be just as effective at the lowest ozone ct dosage (i. e., 0. 1 mg/L ozone after a 1 min contact time) as at the highest ozone ct dosage (i. e., 0. 2 mg/L ozone after a 16. 6 min contact time). As with our previous research on UV inactivation of bacteria, we hypothesize that the recirculating system provided a selection process that favors bacteria that embed within particulate matter or that form bacterial aggregates that provides shielding from oxidation. However, when ozonation was followed by UV irradiation, the <b>total</b> heterotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> and <b>total</b> coliform <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> in the water exiting the UV irradiation unit were reduced to, respectively, 0 – 4 cfu/mL (1. 6 – 2. 7 LOG 10 reduction) and 0 – 3 cfu/ 100 mL (2. 5 – 4. 3 LOG 10 reduction). Thus, combining ozone dosages of only 0. 1 – 0. 2 minmg/L with a UV irradiation dosage of approximately 50 mJ/cm 2 would consistently reduce <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> to near zero. These findings were orders of magnitude lower than the <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> measured in the system when it was operated without disinfection or with UV irradiation alone.

The first was lairage in stanction housing and in-stall milking pipeline system and embodied average values TBC from 10 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1 till 179 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1. The second breed was lairaged in loose grate without littered housing and got milking parlour and embodied average values TBC from 5, 5 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1 till 68, 75 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1. The third and the fourth breeds were lairaged in loose cubicle littered housing and got milking parlour and embodied average values TBC from 5 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1 till 34, 33 ∙ 103 ∙ ml- 1. There was not statically conclusive difference in analysis of <b>total</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> on level - significance P < 0, 05 between lairage in stanction littered housing and in-stall milking pipeline system and lairage in loose cubicle littered housing and milking parlour and lairage in loose cubicle littered housing and milking parlour, when the Students test was used. The stud with lairage in loose grate without littered housing and milking parlour had the top microbial contaminaton of milk. It had serious defections of hygiene lairage and milking. It succeeded to significant differences in value TBC in bulk milk sample on level - significance P < 0, 05...|$|E
40|$|Hide {{contamination}} {{represents a}} {{main source of}} microbiological contamination of carcass surface. In {{order to reduce the}} potential health risks for the consumer the EU implemented measures {{in the context of the}} regulations no. 852 /-, 853 /- and 854 / 2004. These imply that only clean cattle are suitable for slaughter in order to eliminate the risk of meat contamination via hide or skin. Food business operators are responsible for ensuring that the requirements are met. One problem is, that the meaning of cleanliness is not defined clearly enough. Therefore some European states implemented regulations for the grading of hide cleanliness. The main objective of the own analysis was to point out the correlation between the level of hide contamination and the <b>total</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> of the surfaces of the carcasses. Therefore an ascending hide cleanliness classification system for beef cattle was developed which is based on two vertical hide regions, an area measure as well as aspects of cleanliness and humidity based on three major-classes for hide-cleanliness. In total 180 female bovine cattle were classified by their hide, digitally photographed from four perspectives (two standing and two stunned) as well as slaughtered and examined in a group of equal or very similar level of conta- mination on test days. The sampling technique was based on stalked sponge swabs, which were pulled over four exactly defined locations of the freshly flayed carcass twice (front and back side) through a self-developed oblong template measuring 100 cm 2. The four incre- mental samples per animal were pooled and tested for the hygiene indicators aerobic colony count as well as for Enterobacteriaceae count and Escherichia coli count. Analyzing the data set statistically all logarithmized aerobic colony counts were normally distributed. Three ordinal scores for aerobic colony count were defined (Score 1 : 0 bis≤ 2 log 10 cm- 2,Score 2 : 2 bis≤ 3 log 10 cm- 2 andScore 3 :> 3 log 10 cm- 2) and tested in conjunction with the three major classes of hide contamination. The general finding was that the amount of animals with low <b>total</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> (Score 1) decreased with higher major class. The amount of cattle with moderate Summary 119 ￼bacteria content (Score 2) increased slightly with the major class. The amount of animals with high <b>total</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> (Score 3) increased substantially with the major class. It could be shown that major-class-I included a statistically significant lower amount of animals with high <b>total</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> compared to major-class-II. The same held for the comparison of major-class-II and -III as well as of major- class-I and -III. E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae could be evidenced only on about a third of the carcasses and thus be analyzed in combination with the major-classes and the three Scores. Applying the reduced population respectively the same correlation could be confirmed approximately. Overall the described correlations can be taken as indication that the considered colony counts rise with an increasing visual level of contamination. In case of development and implementation of a regulation system in Germany the application of a maximum of three ascending classes of hide contamination appears to be justifiable. Furthermore the terms „clean“ and „cleanliness“ should be complemented with attributes as „sufficient(ly) “...|$|E
40|$|In a {{prospective}} follow-up study conducted in 52 French alpine villages, one weekly water sample {{was taken in}} each village provided with untreated ground water and analyzed as {{to the presence of}} four indicator bacteria: total plate count, total coliforms, thermotolerant (fecal) coliforms, and fecal streptococci. Cases of acute gastro-intestinal disease (AGID) occurring among 29, 272 inhabitants were reported through physicians, pharmacists, and primary school teachers. A loglinear model identified fecal streptococcus (FS) as the best predictor; the presence of fecal coliforms enhanced the effect of FS. The <b>total</b> <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> and the total coliforms had no independent contributions. A threshold analysis suggested that any level of indicator bacteria above zero was associated with an excess of AGID...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to microbiologically evaluate the Sudanese fermented dairy product ‘mish’during storage. Ninety samples were collected on the first day from three dairy plants (P 1, P 2, P 3), transportedto the laboratory in icebox and stored at 7 ºC. The samples were examined for <b>total</b> viable <b>bacteria,</b> coliformbacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, psychrotrophic bacteria and yeasts and molds counts at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. The results show ed that coliform bacteria, S. aureus, psychrotrophic bacteria and yeasts and molds countswere high in P 2, while <b>total</b> viable <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> was high in P 1. During storage, <b>total</b> viable <b>bacteria</b> andcoliform <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> increased till day 14, followed by a slight decrease at day 21 and then increasedtowards the end. S. aureus count decreased at day 14, increased at day 21 and then decreased.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of manipulating carbon–nitrogen (C/N) ratio and fish stocking density on pond productivity: <b>total</b> heterotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts,</b> plankton biovolume and benthic macro-invertebrates. Labeo victorianus juveniles were reared for 72 days in 18 hapas suspended in six ponds measuring 150 m 2 at densities of 10, 15 and 25 fish m- 2. Fish in hapas received a locally formulated and prepared feed containing 295 g kg- 1 crude protein, and ponds were treated with a C/N ratio of either 10 or 20. All treatments were carried out in triplicate. Increasing C/N ratio from 10 to 20 increased phytoplankton by 13 % and zooplankton biovolume by 25 % {{in the water column}} (P < 0. 001). Total benthic macro-invertebrates biovolumes were also 30 % higher (P < 0. 05) with a C/N ratio of 20 compared to 10. <b>Total</b> heterotrophic <b>bacteria</b> <b>counts</b> increased both in water and sediment by 29 % while net yield increased by 15 % from 1534 (C/N 10) to 1821 (C/N 20) kg ha- 1 72 day- 1. C/N ratio of 20 and a stocking density of 25 fish m- 2 led to the highest yield, survival, production and net benefits. It is suggested that polyculture may lead to better utilization of pond communities to further improve pond productivit...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports on}} the {{different}} disinfection effects by special UV light on bacteria in real waste water of a sewage plant. The disinfecting UV-light is not emitted by a common UV-light source using mercury excitation at 254 nm. This light source creates the light by an excimer emission caused by a microwave irradiated plasma with main wavelengths maxima at 222 nm (KrCl) and a combination of 222 nm and 248 nm (KrF). Real waste water samples in Petri dishes were irradiated for different irradiation times and at different wavelengths. The disinfection effect on e. coli, coliforms except e. coli, gram-negatives except coliforms, <b>total</b> aerobic <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> {{as well as for}} enterobacteriaceae was determined and compared. A reduction for all investigated species, in microbiological low charged waste water(10 (4) - 10 (5) cfu/ml) down to the detection limit of the semi-quantitative bacteria (test (10 ² cfu/ml) and in high charged water (> 10 (7) cfu/ml) down to 10 ³ cfu/ml, was obeserved. For <b>total</b> aerobic <b>bacteria</b> <b>count</b> the disinfection effect for the light with only 222 nm emission is as effectice as the combined irradiation at 222 nm and 248 nm. For enterobacteriaceae the combination of 222 nm and 258 nm light showed improved results when compared to 222 nm alone...|$|R
