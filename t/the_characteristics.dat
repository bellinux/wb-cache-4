5|$|After the August 1943 Quebec Agreement merged the British and American {{atomic bomb}} projects, Mark Oliphant persuaded the Admiralty to release Massey {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project. In November 1943, Massey set out with Oliphant for the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber. The Radiation Laboratory's part was to develop an {{electromagnetic}} isotope separation process. Massey was in charge of its Theoretical Group, which included American David Bohm and Australian Eric Burhop. They studied <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> of electric discharges in magnetic fields, today known as Bohm diffusion, and studied the ionization of uranium compounds used as feed in the electromagnetic uranium enrichment process such as uranium tetrachloride (UCl4) and uranium hexafluoride (UF6). Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission in Berkeley by Massey. Wartime papers produced by the group were collected and published in <b>The</b> <b>Characteristics</b> of Electrical Discharges in Magnetic Fields (1949).|$|E
