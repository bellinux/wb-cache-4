Although procedures may take place simultaneously, they cannot start on the same day (that is, simultaneous procedures start on consecutive days)". These assumptions generated some criticisms especially by countries that were able to complete one or more procedures simultaneously and could therefore be penalized in the final rank. [...] World Bank claimed that the same criteria are applied to all economies and therefore would not produce biased results. In 2014 the possible biases in applying the DB <b>time</b> <b>indicator</b> were mathematically demonstrated in a scientific article appeared on the Rivista italiana di economia demografia e statistica (Italian Review of Economics, Demography and Statistics - RIEDS). [...] World Bank partially reviewed the criteria inserting a new assumption for telematics procedures: [...] "each telematics procedure accounts for 0.5 day instead of one day (and telematics procedures can also take place simultaneously)".|$|E
2500|$|From the {{information}} {{given in the}} novel two time references for the two blocks of action that constitute the narrative can be pinpointed: May 1460 and January 1461. The important <b>time</b> <b>indicator</b> is the Battle of Wakefield, 30 December 1460, which Stevenson describes in {{the first chapter of}} Book 3: [...] It is because Richard Crookback (later Richard III of England) is presented as an adult active in the Wars of the Roses in January 1461 that Stevenson provides the footnote: [...] "At the date of this story, Richard Crookback could not have been created Duke of Gloucester; but for clearness, with the reader's leave, he shall so be called." [...] Richard was born in 1452, so he would have been merely 8 {{years old at the time}} of this story. A later footnote emphasises this again: [...] "Richard Crookback would have been really far younger at this date [...]" [...] Stevenson follows William Shakespeare in retrojecting Richard of Gloucester into an earlier period of the Wars of the Roses and portraying him as a dour hunchback—Stevenson: [...] "the formidable hunchback." [...] (See Henry VI, part 2; Henry VI, part 3; and Richard III.) This characterisation closely follows the Tudor myth, a tradition that overly vilified Richard of Gloucester and cast the entire English Fifteenth century as a bloody, barbaric chaos in contrast to the Tudor era of law and order.|$|E
30|$|Part 1 : In {{order to}} get the SOC and {{serialized}} <b>time</b> <b>indicators</b> of the PrEV cluster, the temporary behavior process of each PrEV individual is iteratively structured and simulated. By dynamically calibrating and restructuring the processes in each procedural simulating cycle, the regular distributions of the SOC and serialized <b>time</b> <b>indicators</b> for the PrEV cluster are gradually refined. This part includes the following two parallel sub-processes.|$|R

This paper describes different approaches to condition monitoring supporting sustainability. In this context guidelines to sustainable design of electronic products are discussed. The concept of Life <b>Time</b> <b>Indicators</b> using so called monitor structures is explained in detail and illustrated with an example. With monitor structures, the remaining life time of a system can be estimated in field use under varying load. The design and evaluation of monitor structures sensible to thermo-mechanical load is shown. Technological boundaries are taken into consideration and an example of a flip chip based monitor structure is presented. Conclusions are drawn for further development of sustainable condition monitoring using Life <b>Time</b> <b>Indicators...</b>|$|R

Used to can be used with or without an indicator of temporal location in the past (We used to do that, We used to do that in 1974); but the <b>time</b> <b>indicator</b> cannot be too specific; for example, *We used to do that at 3pm yesterday is not grammatical.|$|E
5000|$|In 1932 three {{systems were}} used: {{official}} hand timing, hand started photo-finish times, and the Gustavus Town Kirby timing device, {{which was designed}} by Kirby to determine the correct order of finish in horse races.

One was stopped by hand {{at the time the}} runners hit the tape. The other was provided with a motion picture camera which photographed the runner at the tape and the dial of the <b>time</b> <b>indicator</b> simultaneously."
