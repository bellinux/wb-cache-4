5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides kept up constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> Americans, and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone wall on the crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.|$|E

The 27th ditinguished itself in several critical battles, including the Battle of the Bowling Alley.|$|E
5|$|Basil II's {{first attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> {{defenders}} of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable {{to pass through the}} valley, which was defended by 15,000–20,000 Bulgarians. Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and surround the Bulgarians, while he continued the assaults on the wall. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the guards, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarian soldiers abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.|$|E

5|$|One {{specific}} {{failure in}} the massive operation was the critical lack of transport aircraft for the operation, an unsolved flaw that had dogged every large-scale airborne operation the Allies had conducted. In the original planning for Varsity, an extra airborne division, the 13th, had been included; however, a lack of transport aircraft to drop this division led to it being excluded from the final plan. Thus, the unsolved problem of a shortage of transport aircraft meant {{that a third of}} the planned troops to be used were discarded, weakening the fighting power of the airborne formation. In the event, the airborne troops actually employed were sufficient <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> defenders.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{supplies}} and reinforcements carried on Thétis to reach the Caribbean may have {{had an effect on}} the outcome of the subsequent invasion of Martinique in January 1809. Except for one reinforcement frigate, Amphitrite, none of the subsequent French efforts to transport supplies or soldiers to Martinique were successful, and a large British expeditionary force was able <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> island's poorly-supplied defenders in a brief campaign. The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies, preventing the despatch of food and military supplies and contributing to the captures of both Île de France and Guadeloupe in 1810.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{situation}} in the North Sea in late 1918 remained much as it had been for the previous four years—with the Grand Fleet maintaining its endless watch over the High Seas Fleet—the war on the Western Front was rapidly drawing to a close.

5|$|Upon {{seeing the}} Unity approaching, Moore opened full sail and cut away his boats {{in an attempt}} to escape. As the Unity pulled closer, Moore opened fire.

Both sides exchanged musket shots as Moore tossed hand grenades onto the Unity. Moore was taken down by Samuel Watts with a musket shot to the chest. Once the Falmouth Packet caught up to the attack, it managed to pull along the other side of Moore's ship.

With the help of Cortana, the Chief defeats the Didact, who falls into a slipspace portal generated underneath the Composer.

The Chief is found by a UNSC rescue team and is taken back to Infinity, where he, mourning the loss of Cortana, talks with Lasky about Earth, humanity, and what his duty as a soldier means.|$|E
5|$|Each {{enemy was}} {{designed}} to exhibit a unique behavior toward the character; random elements were programmed into the enemies' behaviors to make the game more interesting. The first two designed were the simplest: Electrodes and Grunts. Electrodes are stationary objects that are lethal to the in-game characters, and Grunts are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him. Grunts were designed <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> player with large groups. While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies, Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay's excitement and fun. As a result, they began steadily {{increasing the number of}} on-screen enemies to over a hundred to see if more enemies would generate more enjoyment.|$|E

5|$|Once Edward's {{force had}} {{gathered}} sufficient strength, {{he dropped the}} ruse and headed south towards London. Fighting off Exeter's and Oxford's attacks, he besieged Warwick at Coventry, hoping to engage the earl in battle. Although Warwick's force had more men than Edward's army, the earl refused the challenge. He {{was waiting for the}} arrival of Clarence, who wanted to use their combined strength <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> Yorkists. When he learned of this, Edward sent Gloucester to entreat Clarence to return to the House of York, an offer that Clarence readily accepted. Reconciled, the royal brothers moved towards Coventry, and Clarence urged Warwick's surrender. Infuriated with his son-in-law's treachery, Warwick refused to speak to Clarence. Unable to fight the earl at this time, Edward turned again towards London.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} {{artillery}} would not break the Polish, General von Toll devised {{a new plan}} of attack. He decided to disregard Paskevich's order not to assault Warsaw. Although dusk was nearing, von Toll ordered an all-out assault on both the western and southern fronts. As {{there was no time}} for proper artillery preparation, von Toll wanted <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> defenders by sheer numerical superiority, even if it meant increased casualties from Polish artillery. To distract the Polish artillery at Czyste and prevent it from firing at the Russian columns attacking Forts 21 and 22, Muraviev's forces were to lead the attack directly towards the Jerozolimskie Gate. Before 15:00, von Toll dispatched General Neidhardt to Paskevich to receive his blessing for the new plan, but Paskevich categorically refused, and ordered his subordinate to continue shelling the Polish forts with artillery at least until 16:00. As the Russian commander-in-chief was away, von Toll decided to act despite Paskevich's orders.|$|E

5|$|The Invasion of Isle de France was a {{complicated}} but successful amphibious {{operation in the}} Indian Ocean, launched in November 1810 during the Napoleonic Wars. During the operation, a substantial British military force was landed by the Royal Navy at Grand Baie on Isle de France (now Mauritius). Marching inland against weak French opposition, the British force was able <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> defenders {{in a series of}} minor engagements, culminating in the capture of the island's capital Port Napoleon and the surrender of Charles Decaen, the French governor. The surrender eliminated the last French territory in the Indian Ocean and among the military equipment captured were five French Navy frigates and 209 heavy cannon. Isle de France was retained by Britain {{at the end of the}} war under the name of Mauritius and remained part of the British Empire until 1968.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese had {{developed}} the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas {{up until that}} point they had usually withdrawn {{in the face of}} the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to the closeness of the fighting, along with some 37mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the indirect method that would characterise their operations during this phase of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving up a steep slope that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was able to deliver a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position early in the evening.|$|E

5|$|The {{convergence}} {{of the two}} columns on the French at Ostrach demonstrated {{the advantage of the}} superiority of Austrian numbers. From every angle, the Austrians threatened <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> French. Jourdan wrote that his men disappeared under a cloud of red coats. Battalion after battalion of Austrians threw themselves against the French defenses. By late morning, Charles' troops pushed the French out of Hoßkirch, and into Ostrach, which the French nearly lost until Jourdan sent reinforcements. The fighting remained fierce until about 1600, when the French pulled back toward Pfullendorf, encouraged by Austrian cavalry. Once out of Ostrach, and established on the road at and around Pfullendorf, the French formed a new perimeter, reinforced by reserves of Soulham, and enjoyed the benefit of altitude from which they could fire down upon the attacking Austrians. Despite the punishing musket fire, Charles' strategy worked. The far right wing (Ferino's force), which had not been attacked yet, fell back to Salem Abbey, to maintain communication with the French center.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight at}} Masan {{remained}} a bitter stalemate {{during the entire}} six weeks of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter.

The battle itself was a tactical tie, since neither side could decisively defeat the other, however the UN units achieved their strategic goal of preventing the North Koreans from advancing further east and threatening Pusan. Instead, they were able to hold the line against repeated attacks until the Inchon attack, and were thus successful in defeating the North Korean army in subsequent engagements.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the middle}} of 24s run, the series {{attracted}} significant criticism for its depictions of torture, {{as well as its}} negative portrayal of Muslims. The frequent use of ticking time bomb scenarios in storylines, as well as the main character, Jack Bauer portraying torture as normal, effective, acceptable and glamorous, was criticized by human rights activists, military officials, and experts in questioning and interrogation, with concerns raised that junior U.S. soldiers were imitating techniques shown on the series. In response to these concerns, members of the U.S. military met with the creators of the show. Partly {{as a result of these}} discussions, and the military's appeal to the creators of the show to tone down the scenes of torture since it was having an impact on U.S. troops, there was a reduction in torture in subsequent seasons of the series. However, the writers stated that they reduced the number of torture scenes, not as a concession, but because it was starting <b>to</b> <b>overwhelm</b> <b>the</b> storytelling.|$|E
