However, because of the processing routes and heat treatments used in the production process, the material within the cell walls may behave differently from the bulk, and therefore the in situ mechanical properties are often unknown.

In the present manuscript, we review fundamental principles that govern the self-organized initiation of anodic TiO 2 nanotubes. We start with the fundamental question: Why is self-organization taking place? We illustrate the inherent key mechanistic aspects that lead to tube growth in various different morphologies, such as rippled-walled <b>tubes,</b> smooth <b>tubes,</b> <b>stacks</b> and bamboo-type <b>tubes,</b> and importantly the formation of double-walled TiO 2 nanotubes versus single-walled tubes, and the drastic difference in their physical and chemical properties.

Finally, we show how by selecting the right growth approach to TiO 2 nanotubes specific functional features can be significantly improved, e. g., an enhanced electron mobility, intrinsic doping, or crystallization into pure anatase at extremely high temperatures can be achieved. This in turn can be exploited in constructing high performance devices based on anodic TiO 2 {{in a wide range}} of applications. Comment: from Nanoscale Horiz., 2016, Advance Articl...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe present paper aims at {{investigating}} the homogenisation of cellular materials {{in view of}} the modelling of large but finite cellular structures. Indeed, computation costs associated with the complete modelling of such structures can be rapidly prohibitive if industrial applications are considered. The use of a homogeneous equivalent medium (HEM) for these cellular materials can be an efficient approach to address this issue, but it requires the calibration of relevant homogeneous equivalent laws (HELs). Here, the considered cellular materials are tube stackings. Various uni-axial and multi-axial loading cases have been simulated, through the finite element method, on representative volume elements of such periodic stackings. From these simulations, anisotropic compressible elasto-plastic constitutive equations have been identified for the HEL. The anisotropy of the yield surfaces is discussed depending on the pattern of the <b>tube</b> <b>stacking</b> (e. g. square or hexagonal). A validation of the identified laws is proposed by simulating uni-axial compression and simple shear tests on sandwich structures made of tube stackings for their cores. A systematic comparison, between the results obtained from the fully meshed structures and those obtained from the structures whose core has been replaced with its HEM, allows us to address the limitations of the HEM-based approach and the boundary layer effects observed on finite structures...|$|R

Experimental validation has mainly been based on the measurements at the far field from the porous media exit. Detailed near field data are rare. In this paper, the fluid dynamics characteristics of a tubular heat exchanger concept developed for aero-engine intercooling by the authors are presented.

It is a preliminary work to the mechanical characterisation of regular tube stackings which focuses on the evolutions of both microstructures and mechanical properties of Inconel 600 resulting from brazing heat treatment and diffusion of the brazing compounds. Reference is made to Inconel 600 <b>tube</b> <b>stacking</b> brazed using a nickel-phosphorus alloy in view of aeronautical applications, for instance impact resistance. The paper interests more precisely the experimental characterisation of the mechanical properties faces to dynamic loads. Different material configurations are thus characterised and compared, involving both tensile tests from quasi-static to dynamic. Results show that a viscous effect on the mechanical behaviour of Inconel 600 exists in the tubes before heat treatment. However, the heat treatment acts such as a recovery treatment on the plastic properties of the tube material eliminating viscous effects. Electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) post-mortem analyses of the tensile specimens show a strong texture too, resulting from the tensile loading and a quite homogeneous intragranular misorientation is observed inside the grains, reflecting large plastic deformations. EBSD analyses are presented in more details in a paper by Davoine et al. Different mechanical properties have also been identified according to Johnson-Cook's model.

The work comprises 3 D coupled CFD analysis of the internal flow (in-flow, cross-over and out-flow duct) using porous media modelling for the <b>tube</b> <b>stacks.</b> Several design iterations on the internal flow configuration has been performed applying two splitter vanes and a flow guide vane.

In addition to providing heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics, the correlations are set up to allow intercooler installation space constraints to be taken into account. The fuel burn benefits of the presented intercooled engine are attributed to the use of a variable geometry separate exhaust nozzle and to providing an adequate amount of intercooling. The amount of intercooling should be sufficient to enable the high OPR at take-off, and allow a compact engine design. In cruise, on the other hand, it is beneficial to reduce the intercooling to establish an optimum between intercooling and incurred pressure losses...|$|R

40|$|SummaryPolar body {{extrusion}} (PBE) is {{the specialized}} asymmetric division by which oocytes accomplish reduction in ploidy {{and retention of}} cytoplasm. During maternal gametogenesis, as in male meiosis and mitosis, cytokinesis is accomplished by a ring rich in active Rho, myosin, and formin-nucleated F-actin [1 – 7]. However, unlike mitosis, wherein the contractile ring encircles the cell equator, the polar body ring assembles as a discoid cortical washer. Here we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, the meiotic contractile ring transforms during closure from a disc above the spindle to a cylinder around the spindle midzone. The meiotic midbody <b>tube</b> comprises <b>stacked</b> cytoskeletal rings. This topological transition suggests a novel mechanism for constriction of an initially discoid cytokinetic ring. Analysis of mouse PBE indicates that midbody tube formation is a conserved process. Depletion of the scaffold protein anillin (ANI- 1) from C. elegans results in large and unstable polar bodies that often fuse with the oocyte. Anillin is dispensable for contractile ring assembly, initiation, and closure but {{is required for the}} meiotic contractile ring to transform from a disc into a tube.
