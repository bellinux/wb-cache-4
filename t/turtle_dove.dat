The handle was decreasing, and the officials could not afford the purses for the races. To help increase the handle, Maryland racetrack officials voted to allow inter-track simulcasting between all Maryland tracks and authorized off-track betting parlors throughout the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{agricultural}} food staples during Han were wheat, barley, rice, foxtail millet, proso millet, and beans. People of the Han also consumed sorghum, Job's tears, taro, mallow, mustard green, melon, bottle gourd, bamboo shoot, {{the roots of}} lotus plants, and ginger. Some of the fruits the Han ate included the chestnut, jujube, pear, peach, plum (including the plum of Prunus salicina and Prunus mume), melon, apricot, red bayberry, and strawberry. The Han Chinese domesticated and ate chickens, Mandarin ducks, geese, camels, cows, sheep, pigs, and dogs. The type of game animals hunted during the Han included rabbit, sika deer, <b>turtle</b> <b>dove,</b> goose, owl, Chinese bamboo partridge, magpie, common pheasant, and cranes, while fish and turtles were taken from streams and lakes. Beer—which could be an unfermented malt drink with low alcohol content or a stronger brew fermented with yeast—was commonly consumed alongside meat, but virtually never consumed alongside grains such as rice. Wine was also regularly consumed.|$|E

5|$|In 1593 and 1594, {{when the}} theatres were closed because of plague, Shakespeare {{published}} two narrative poems on sexual themes, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece. He dedicated them to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. In Venus and Adonis, an innocent Adonis rejects the sexual advances of Venus; while in The Rape of Lucrece, the virtuous wife Lucrece is raped by the lustful Tarquin. Influenced by Ovid's Metamorphoses, the poems show the guilt and moral confusion {{that result from}} uncontrolled lust. Both proved popular and were often reprinted during Shakespeare's lifetime. A third narrative poem, A Lover's Complaint, in which a young woman laments her seduction by a persuasive suitor, was printed in {{the first edition of}} the Sonnets in 1609. Most scholars now accept that Shakespeare wrote A Lover's Complaint. Critics consider that its fine qualities are marred by leaden effects. The Phoenix and the Turtle, printed in Robert Chester's 1601 Love's Martyr, mourns the deaths of the legendary phoenix and his lover, the faithful <b>turtle</b> <b>dove.</b> In 1599, two early drafts of sonnets 138 and 144 appeared in The Passionate Pilgrim, published under Shakespeare's name but without his permission.|$|E

It is one of the most abundant and widespread of all North American birds. It is also a leading gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and for meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six broods of two young each in a single year.

500|$|A {{review of}} semipalmated sandpiper records {{took place in}} the 1970s, {{resulting}} in seven of the twelve records being rejected. A review of black-headed wagtail records was initiated in 1983. The results were published in 1994 and 1995, and nine previously accepted records were judged to be unsound, due to possible confusion with grey-headed wagtail. A review of rufous <b>turtle</b> <b>dove</b> records took place in 1994, and concluded that three of the eight accepted records should no longer stand. A review of lesser kestrel records, begun in 1994, and completed in 1995, concluded that six accepted records of this species should no longer be regarded as acceptable. Five of the six were from autumn, whereas the overwhelming majority of records the committee continued to accept are from the spring/summer period. All 24 spring records of Siberian stonechat were reconsidered in 2002–04, in the light of new information on the variability in appearance of European stonechats in spring; the committee decided that all but five should remain accepted. In 2003, the committee revised its assessment criteria for male pine buntings, redefining some birds previously considered hybrids [...] as acceptable, but requiring an overall greater level of precision in descriptions, and reviewed past records in the light of these changes.|$|E

Here we examine sub-clinical infection by Trichomonas gallinae in a declining population of free-living European <b>Turtle</b> <b>Doves</b> and suggest caseous lesions cause mortality in adults and nestlings through subsequent starvation and/or suffocation.
