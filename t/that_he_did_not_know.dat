5|$|Altgens was {{featured}} in two AP dispatches issued on November 22, 1963. He initially reported hearing two shots, but thought someone had been setting off fireworks. For a November 25 story, Altgens wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{the origin of the}} gunshots until later, but he believed they came {{from the other side of}} Elm Street, opposite the presidential limousine from where he was standing.|$|E

When he refuses, Rockslide calls him a sissy, which Anole finds offensive {{enough for him to}} reveal his sexual identity to Rockslide and attack him. Rockslide apologizes, swearing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know.</b> Later, in a misguided attempt at group bonding, Rockslide voices his acceptance of Anole's sexuality, outing him to some of the other students, though Loa states that she was already aware and that everyone already knew.|$|E

He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{how much of it}} could be linked to human activity. He was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), building more nuclear power plants, and reducing the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} Sidel’s {{criticism of}} certain Kerschensteiner’s views about work-school and work-education. Sidel disputed that Kerschensteiner was {{the creator of}} the idea about work-school, emphasizing that, significantly before Kerschensteiner, he put forth this idea in his papers, in which he proved the pedagogical value of work and the need for work-school. Sidel objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> convincingly elaborate the need for introducing work-school, that, when explaining the need for handcraft, he underestimated the significance of books for education and culture in general, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> specify the term "giftedness", <b>that</b> is, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> indicate <b>that</b> besides spiritual, there are other kinds of giftedness and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand correctly the relation between work and obviousness. Sidel also thinks that Kerschensteiner <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand the relation between the society, state and education, i. e. <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> demonstrate <b>that</b> school reform is conditioned by social reasons, that work-school is a social an political need, that work education is the need and interest of modern society and state. Also, he objects to Kerschensteiner <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> understand nor emphasize the significance and value of handcraft for artistic education, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak about the role of work in the development of inventive spirit of the young, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> sufficiently emphasize <b>that</b> significance of handcraft for the development of will, moral and character, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> speak in which way work-school can be realized, i. e. <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see the mutual relationship between social development and school and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> demand any social changes for the purpose of accomplishing that goal. Sidel concludes that Kerschensteiner’s work-school, introduced in the conditions of monarchist organization of schools in Germany, cannot be a role model which should be followed...|$|R

In fact, the show's creators made Sara Sidle while thinking of a future love interest for Grissom, but during the show's first three seasons, Grissom flirted with all the female characters, and when Sara asked him out to dinner, he rejected her, claiming <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{what to do about}} what is going on between them.|$|E
5|$|To {{resolve the}} {{possibility}} of his bigamy being exposed, Minnie pushed Brinkley to file for divorce from Sally, which he did in December 1915. To prevent the court from inquiring of Sally directly, he wrote {{that they had been}} married in New York City, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> her current place of residence. The divorce was finalized on February 21, 1916. Four days later, Minnie and Brinkley were married again, this time in Liberty, Missouri. Brinkley had not waited the required six months from divorce to subsequent remarriage.|$|E
5|$|Common public {{explanations}} for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure. In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with its demise. Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order. Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives to the status quo. He aimed to produce students who could counterbalance society with independence of thought, but admitted <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> how to facilitate this.|$|E

5|$|Franchitti was {{considered}} one of the favorites to win the race having won the event two years previously and hoped to keep a recent string of good results in the 2001 season going at the track. Bräck expected to perform well despite retiring from the previous year's event and hoped he could regain the momentum he built {{from the start of the}} season. The race's defending champion Michael Andretti had secured six of his 40 career victories in Toronto and stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> if luck played a part but noted his driving style was suited to the circuit. Having finished in the points-scoring position in three of the previous four races, Alex Tagliani said it encouraged him heading into the Indy Toronto.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} {{original}} letter given to Bixby is unknown. William A. Bixby, a son of Oliver, told The New York Times in an August 9, 1925 interview <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{what happened to the}} letter after his grandmother received it, though he doubted it still survived. A few days later, William's sister, Mrs. Towers told the Boston Herald that she also did not know the letter's fate but speculated Bixby may have torn it up, resenting that it incorrectly said five of her sons had been killed. William's son, Arthur March Bixby, told the New York Sun in 1949 that he recalled his father telling him that she had angrily destroyed the letter after receiving it.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{thinking}} that the Garza murder {{had taken place in}} San Antonio because Feit had trained there, Tacheny called authorities in that city and said that he could no longer keep the secret of Feit's confession. The investigation into Garza's death was reopened that year. Texas Rangers investigator Rudy Jaramillo contacted Father Joseph O'Brien, a priest who worked with Feit {{at the time of the}} Garza murder. O'Brien told a television program in 2000 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> anything about Garza's death. He softened with Jaramillo, first telling the investigator that he had suspected Feit at the time, then admitting that Feit had confessed shortly after the murder. In August 2002, the polygraph examiner who tested Feit in 1960 said that he questioned the reported results. Feit had been said to have passed his polygraph and documentation was later amended to show that the results were inconclusive, but the examiner felt that Feit had failed the test.|$|E

5|$|In the National Football League (NFL), a tied game {{occurs when}} a regular season game ends with both teams having an equal score. Since the National Hockey League {{eliminated}} ties by adopting the shootout following the 2004–05 NHL lockout, the NFL {{is the only one}} of the four major professional sports leagues in North America to have tied games in regular-season play, as Major League Baseball (in the modern era since 1900) and the National Basketball Association have historically played until there is a winner. Unlike soccer (association football), in which teams routinely play for a draw (for the benefit of a point in the standings), NFL teams rarely play for ties. In general, tied games in the NFL are frowned upon by both teams and fans. Because tied games are rare, some players have not known they were allowed in the NFL, such as former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb, who said after a tie game against the Cincinnati Bengals <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> a tie was a possible result.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often {{the center of attention}} among his peers.|$|E
5|$|Samoa Joe and Booker T {{started a}} rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship {{following}} Slammiversary. On the June12 episode of Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat {{him at the}} event due to interference from Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match later in the broadcast. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road on July13 for the title. On the July10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> {{which of the two}} would win at Victory Road, but that he would be there to watch. At the event, Joe beat Booker T till he was bloody, causing several referees and security personnel to try to stop him to no avail. He was stopped when Sting interfered in the contest by bashing Joe with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe for an unofficial pinfall victory that was counted by Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell. The match result was ruled a no-contest, with Joe retaining the title.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} at Victory Road {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title, which Joe won to remain champion. On the June12 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Joe's mentor Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road for the title. Since Houston is Booker T's hometown, TNA promoted the match as him attempting to win the championship {{for the people of}} Houston. On the July 10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> which of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he would be there to watch.|$|E
5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations were coming to nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{was drawn}} into the Holley {{controversy}} during the 1824 presidential election. When no candidate achieved {{a majority of the}} electoral votes cast, the contest was resolved by the U.S. House of Representatives. Desha and the New Court partisans in the General Assembly instructed the state's congressional delegation to cast their votes for Andrew Jackson, but the delegation, led by House Speaker Henry Clay, defied these instructions and voted instead for John Quincy Adams. Because of this vote, Clay, a trustee for Transylvania and supporter of Holley, became Desha's political enemy. Desha's hostility for Transylvania and Holley worsened when, {{in the aftermath of the}} Isaac Desha trial, a student at Transylvania delivered a speech critical of the governor in the university's chapel. Although Holley was present for the speech, Transylvania historian John D. Wright, Jr. wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> the student's topic beforehand and after hearing the speech, made no effort to condone its content. It was Holley's practice, however, to allow students to speak openly about current political matters, regardless of which position they took. Desha maintained that, because Holley had not silenced the student, he was at fault for tacitly condoning disrespectful criticism of the state's chief executive.|$|E
