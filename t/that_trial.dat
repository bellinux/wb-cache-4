5|$|The court {{decided that}} the {{evidence}} against Thornton was not overwhelming, and <b>that</b> <b>trial</b> by battle was a permissible option under law; thus Thornton was granted trial by battle.

Thornton emigrated to the United States, where he died around 1860.|$|E
5|$|A {{systematic}} review in 2012 found and analysed four randomized controlled trials of ketogenic diet {{in children and}} young people with epilepsy, as well as six prospective and five retrospective studies. The trials were done among {{children and young people}} for whom drugs failed to control their seizures, and only one of the trials compared a group assigned to ketogenic diet with a group not assigned to one. The other trials compared types of diets or ways of introducing them to make them more tolerable. Nearly 40% of the children and young people had half or fewer seizures with the diet compared with the group not assigned to the diet. Only about 10% were still on the diet after a few years. Adverse effects such as hunger and loss of energy in <b>that</b> <b>trial</b> were common, with about 30% experiencing constipation.|$|E
500|$|Several {{individuals}} {{closely tied}} to the government requested <b>that</b> the <b>trial</b> be held in Winnipeg in July 1885.

Tom Flanagan states that an amendment of the North-West Territories Act (which dropped the provision <b>that</b> <b>trials</b> with crimes punishable by death should be tried in Manitoba) meant <b>that</b> the <b>trial</b> could be convened within the North-West Territories and {{did not have to be}} held in Winnipeg.|$|R

5|$|Attorneys {{have long}} used {{peremptory}} challenges to exclude undesirable prospective jurors, {{but have not}} always been successful. Much of the early efforts were based on lawyers' folklore about who makes a good juror for their case. Early examples of scientific jury selection were similar. For example, in the 1975 Joan Little trial, defense attorneys used an astrologer to help choose the jury. More rigorous methodology was on display during the first major use of SJS, the 1972 Harrisburg Seven trial. During <b>that</b> <b>trial,</b> social scientists used demographic characteristics to identify biases in favor of conviction. The consultants in the case had conducted surveys that indicated women and Democrats would make defense-friendly jurors, and the religious, those with college degrees, and Reader's Digest subscribers would be better for the prosecution. Although surveys had indicated that 80% of citizens in conservative Harrisburg, Pennsylvania would convict the defendants, they were acquitted of all serious charges.|$|E
5|$|Easter Road {{was briefly}} the home ground for Edinburgh Rugby, a {{professional}} rugby union team, {{in the late}} 1990s. Heineken Cup matches against Ebbw Vale and Toulouse were played at the ground during the 1998–99 season, with attendances of a few thousand. Edinburgh again expressed interest in using Easter Road in both 2004 and 2006, but this was opposed by Hibs manager Tony Mowbray, who was concerned that playing rugby would damage the pitch. The Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) included Easter Road in a bid for Edinburgh to host the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup finals in 2014. In June 2015, the SRU chief executive indicated <b>that</b> <b>trial</b> matches could be played at Easter Road {{with a view to}} Edinburgh Rugby moving there for a longer term. It has since been announced that the team will move to Myreside from January 2017.|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the complex construction of randomized controlled <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> lies behind {{the rhetoric of}} the gold standard. Drawing on insights from Science and Technology Studies and empirical material, I argue <b>that</b> <b>trials</b> in the field of cardiovascular disease prevention are constituted as ‘research’ rather than ‘science’. In these examples, control emerges out of a dual concern with practices of purification and involvement of aspects of the world outside the experiment, as the designers of trials aspire to relevance as well as rigour. Such strategies of ‘contextualization’ mean <b>that</b> <b>trials</b> are more like alchemy than assay, proceeding by complex moves to transform ‘base’ matters rather than distilling elements of clinical practice...|$|R

50|$|Equipoise {{is also an}} {{important}} consideration in the design of a trial from a patient’s perspective. This is especially true in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for surgical interventions, where both trial and control arms are likely to have their own associated risks and hopes for benefits. The condition of the patient is also a factor in these risks. Ensuring <b>that</b> <b>trials</b> meet the standards of clinical equipoise is {{an important}} part of patient recruitment in this regard; it is likely <b>that</b> past <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> did not meet conditions of clinical equipoise suffered from poor recruitment.|$|R

25|$|Milenko Trifunović, Brane Džinić, Aleksandar Radovanović, Slobodan Jakovljević, Branislav Medan - the Appellate Panel ruled <b>that</b> <b>trial</b> {{verdict is}} altered {{in the sense}} that the accused, being aware of the {{existence}} of the genocidal plan of others, performed the actions by which they considerably contributed to the commission of that offense, and therefore they participated in the criminal offense of Genocide as accessories (not as co-perpetrators), since it was not proven beyond reasonable doubt that the accused themselves acted with genocidal intent. Hence, Trifunović was sentenced to 33 years, Džinić to 32 years, Radovanović to 32 years, Jakovljević to 28 years and Medan to 28 years.|$|E
30|$|To {{explore the}} {{robustness}} of the results, we conducted the following post hoc sensitivity analyses: For all outcomes, we excluded <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> used per-protocol analysis, trials published in abstract form, <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> did not explicitly blind patients and healthcare personnel, <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> administered control formulae containing omega- 3, and <b>trials</b> <b>that</b> did not administer {{the control group}} a placebo feed.

25|$|The balloon {{analogue}} risk task (BART) {{was designed}} to assess risk-taking behavior. Subjects are presented with a computer depiction of a balloon that can be incrementally inflated by pressing a response key. As the balloon inflates, the subject accumulates rewards with each new key-press. The balloon is programmed with a constant probability of popping. If the balloon pops, all rewards for that balloon are lost, or the subject may choose to stop inflating and 'bank' the reward for that balloon at any time. Therefore, more key-presses equate to greater reward, but also greater probability of popping and cancelling rewards for <b>that</b> <b>trial.</b> The BART assumes that those with an affinity for 'risk-taking' {{are more likely to}} pop the balloon, earning less reward overall than the typical population.|$|E
25|$|That year {{stands out}} in the American Civil Rights Movement as Omaha became the {{location}} of the pivotal 1876 trial of Standing Bear v. Crook. In <b>that</b> <b>trial</b> a U.S. district court judge at Fort Omaha set U.S. legal precedent by recognising the personhood of Native Americans, thereby granting American Indians the rights of citizens. With Standing Bear, a Ponca chief on trial, local journalist Thomas Tibbles, Omaha Susette LaFlesche and General Crook himself testified on behalf of acknowledging Native American rights. For the first time, a U.S. court had ruled that an Indian was, officially, a person. Standing Bear won the case, securing the right of his tribe to leave their Indian Territory reservation and return to their Nebraska homelands.|$|E
25|$|At any rate, in 1464 (9 Aug.), Billing {{was added}} to the three judges of the king's bench, but by the king's writ only: and the {{question}} being thereupon raised, it was decided that a commission in addition to the writ was required for the appointment of a justice of assize. Baker in his Chronology,' and Hale in his ‘Pleas of the Crown,' says that on the trial of Walter Walker for treason in 1460, for having said to his son, 'Tom, if thou behavest thyself well, I will make thee heir to the Crown' i.e. of the Crown Inn, of which he was landlord, Billing ruled a conviction, and Lord Campbell accepts the story. But it would seem from the report of the judgment of Chief-justice Bromley in the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, 17 April 1554, that the judge at <b>that</b> <b>trial</b> was John Markham, afterwards chief justice next before Billing, and that he directed an acquittal.|$|E

25|$|In England and Wales jury {{trials are}} used for {{criminal}} cases, requiring 12 jurors (between the ages of 18 and 75), although the trial may continue with as few as 9. The right to a jury trial has been enshrined in English law since Magna Carta in 1215, and is most common in serious cases, although the defendant can insist on a jury trial for most criminal cases. Jury trials in complex fraud cases have been described by some members and appointees of the Labour Party as expensive and time-consuming. In contrast, the Bar Council, Liberty and other political parties have supported the idea <b>that</b> <b>trial</b> by jury {{is at the heart}} of the judicial system and placed the blame for a few complicated jury trials failing on inadequate preparation by the prosecution. On 18 June 2009 the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge, sitting in the Court of Appeal, made English legal history by ruling that a criminal trial in the Crown Court could take place without a jury, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.|$|E
25|$|Self-paced reading: The {{participants}} {{are faced with}} a screen, on which a text appears in successive segment. They are asked to process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, which is to be presented on <b>that</b> <b>trial</b> and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for the right words, while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.|$|E
25|$|The third White Rose {{trial was}} {{scheduled}} for 20 April 1943, Hitler's birthday, which was a public holiday in Nazi Germany. Judge Freisler had intended to issue death sentences against Wilhelm Geyer, Harald Dohrn, Josef Söhngen and Manfred Eickemeyer. Because {{he did not want}} to issue too many death sentences in a single trial, he therefore wanted to postpone his judgment against those four until the next day. However, the evidence against them was lost, and the trial finally took place on 13 July 1943. In <b>that</b> <b>trial,</b> Gisela Schertling—who had betrayed most of the friends, even fringe members like Gerhard Feuerle—changed her mind and recanted her testimony against all of them. Since Freisler did not preside over the third trial, the judge acquitted for lack of evidence all but Söhngen, who was sentenced to a six months' term in prison. After her acquittal on 19 April, Traute Lafrenz was placed under arrest again. She spent the last year of the war in prison. Trials kept being postponed and moved to different locations because of Allied air raids. Her trial was finally set for April 1945, after which she probably would have been executed. Three days before the trial, however, the Allies liberated the town where she was held prisoner, thereby saving her life.|$|E
