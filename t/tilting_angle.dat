In the present work, a computational algorithm is developed for the calculation of the optimum <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> that would orient a non-tracking solar collection system (concentrating or non-concentrating) in its best position for the maximum average daily, monthly seasonal or yearly intercepted radiation.

50|$|The {{difference}} between the two equations is the effect of conrod <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> that lowers the smallend position whenever it is not at TDC or BDC. This means the imbalance is proportional to the ratio of conrod length to stroke, i.e. the longer the conrod in relation to stroke, the less this imbalance becomes. Also, inertia force is created not by a steady speed, but by acceleration and deceleration of mass movement, so the strength is proportional to the square of crankshaft rotational speed, making the imbalance particularly speed sensitive.|$|E

Although pistons do not move in the fashion defined by either of these two components, it is easier to analyze the motion as a combination of the two.

30|$|From (20), it can {{be found}} that the optimal <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> is a {{function}} of the positions of the LED and the PD. In this paper, the position of the LED (i.e., [u,v,w]) is fixed, but the position of the PD (i.e., [a,b,c]) is variable. Therefore, to realize the angle tilting of the receiver plane, the first step is to determine the position of the PD. With an arbitrary <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> larger than zero, the tilted receiver can obtain its position by using the three-dimensional positioning method proposed in our previous work [25]. After obtaining the position of the PD, the optimal <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> for the receiver can be calculated by using (20). Finally, according to the optimal <b>tilting</b> <b>angle,</b> the receiver can realize the angle tilting by employing an electrical machinery. The electrical machinery first makes the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> to be zero and then increases the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> until the optical <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> is achieved.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the relatively large <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of AgNRs, we also find the influence of substrate temperature on the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle.</b> Even though no noticeable change was observed in this work, the observation in a previous report clearly shows that the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of AgNRs decreases as the substrate temperature is lowered [25]. The <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of the AgNRs, fabricated by an e-beam evaporator with 86 ° of deposition angle, was observed to decrease by ~ 2 ° when the substrate temperature was lowered from room temperature to 140 K [25]. Our observation of no noticeable variation of the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> in the whole temperature range, 10 – 70 °C {{can be interpreted as}} the variation of the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> was too small to be observed clearly.|$|E
30|$|The {{specific}} <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> of AgNRs and its {{dependence on}} the substrate temperature mentioned above can be understood by the two diffusion effects. The aforementioned behaviors of the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> follow general observations. That is to say, as random diffusion becomes larger, the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> moves toward the vapor incidence direction. And {{it is well known}} that the small energy barrier of Ag crystal and the increase in the substrate temperature elevate the random diffusion effect, which leads to the observations. However, the <b>tilting</b> <b>angle</b> is determined by complicated interplay between the two diffusion effects, and so detailed understanding cannot be obtained yet.|$|E

However, in transient situations, such as upon turn-in, a <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> error exists and the active steering system acts to reduce or eliminate the driver’s steering input.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> of active regions {{increase}} with their latitude (Joy's law). It has never been checked before, however, whether the average <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> change from one cycle to another. Flux transport models show the importance of <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> for the reversal and build up of magnetic flux at the poles which is, in turn, correlated with {{the strength of the}} next cycle. Here we analyse time series of <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> measurements and look for a possible relationship of the <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> with other solar cycle parameters, in order to glean information on the solar dynamo and to estimate their potential for predictions of solar activity. We employ <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> data from Mount Wilson and Kodaikanal observatories covering solar cycles 15 to 21. We analyse the latitudinal distribution of the <b>tilt</b> <b>angles</b> (Joy's law), their variation from cycle to cycle and their relationship to other solar cycle parameters, such as the strength, amplitude and length. The two main results are: 1. An anti-correlation between the mean normalized <b>tilt</b> <b>angle</b> of a given cycle and the strength (or amplitude) of that cycle, with a correlation coefficient of r=- 0. 95 and r=- 0. 93 for Mount Wilson and Kodaikanal data, respectively. 2.
