2500|$|Facing a Dallas {{defense that}} had allowed its {{previous}} six opponents {{an average of}} less than ten points per game, the Buccaneers were in immediate trouble. Doug Williams was sacked on the game's very first play. Field position was a problem, with the Buccaneers' first-half drives starting {{at an average of}} the 19-yard line. Tampa Bay was only able to advance beyond midfield four times during the entire game, and Williams was pressured into mistakes by a constant Dallas pass rush. The ground game was held to only 2 yards in the second half, with James Owens starting at running back in place of the injured Jerry Eckwood. The Dallas front four of Ed [...] "Too Tall" [...] Jones, Harvey Martin, Randy White, and John Dutton dominated the Buccaneers' offensive line, moving them backwards with 59 yards in sacks and forcing two intentional grounding penalties. They batted down several of Williams' passes, and Jones caught one of Williams' four interceptions. Tom Landry said that it was the best performance by a Dallas front four since their Super Bowl XII victory over Denver in 1978, and credited their intensity for the difference. Interceptions by Jones and Michael Downs set up two third-quarter touchdowns, helping the Cowboys to match their largest-ever margin of victory. Dallas committed no turnovers, and all tipped passes wound {{up in the hands of}} Cowboys players.

Maeve McDermott of USA Today described the song as [...] "dramatic and dark" [...] and noted a sound comparable to works of R&B artist The Weeknd. [...] "Knew Better / Forever Boy" [...] consists of two integrated songs, which last for a duration of 4:59.

However, after the group learn that he works part-time at a pharmacy doing delivery, they bring them into his world for the summer, in exchange for his stealing prescription drugs for them. Jonah's mother, Sandra (Daryl Hannah), is too busy working multiple jobs to try to keep up appearances, to try to deal with her son's sudden change in behavior. As <b>the</b> group <b>gets</b> more experimental with their drugs of choice, Jonah unravels as he becomes more and more obsessed with Sara. After Troy dies under questionable circumstances, his parents hire private investigator Phil Hackwith (Bruce A. Young) {{to try to find out}} the truth. The investigator questions all four of the teens with little results. A few days later, Sara comes to visit Jonah at work, stating that she feels empty and doesn't know why she's there. Jonah asks her to come away to Tijuana with him for the weekend, she agrees. The next morning, the private investigator watches from his parked car as they pull out of the driveway together. They proceed to drink lots of tequila and drunkenly kiss in the hotel room, which leads to sex, during which Sara asks Jonah to stop and he does not. Afterwards, she is clearly distraught and demands to be taken home. They return to California that evening. The next day at work, Lucas storms in and informs Jonah's boss that Jonah has been stealing pills and selling them. Jonah is not able to deny this and is subsequently fired. He shows up in Sara's backyard uninvited later that night, ignoring her requests that he leave, and confesses that he was the one who bought the drugs for Troy. He asks her if she will run away to Mexico with him, saying he'll rob the pharmacy for pills and money. She says [...] "okay", primarily <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> out of her backyard. On the day they are scheduled to depart. Jonah loses his temper and physically abuses his mother.
