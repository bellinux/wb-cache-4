5|$|Although {{the family}} {{received}} an inheritance from Olivia's mother, {{they continued to}} live in Bayswater. For a period Dorothy was at boarding school, after which she {{was sent to a}} finishing school in Geneva. To save money, the family often left London during the summer, to take long visits <b>to</b> <b>relatives</b> in the country, in particular her brother Henry Tucker. Not until 1905 did the family lease a house in Brunswick Gardens, near Kensington Palace, when Dorothy returned home to live with her parents.|$|E

5|$|Among her {{maternal}} ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields, a slave on Henry Walls Shields' 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and {{born into}} slavery about 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers {{said his father}} was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of her master. Melvinia did not talk <b>to</b> <b>relatives</b> about Dolphus' father. Dolphus Shields moved to Birmingham, Alabama after the Civil War, {{and some of his}} children migrated to Cleveland, Ohio and Chicago.|$|E
5|$|Barrow {{was born}} in Springfield, Illinois, the oldest of four children, all male, born to Effie Ann Vinson-Heller and John Barrow. Barrow's father fought in the Ohio Volunteer Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, Barrow's parents, with John's mother, brothers, and sisters, {{traveled}} in a covered wagon to Nebraska; Barrow was born on a hemp plantation belonging <b>to</b> <b>relatives</b> during the trip. The Barrows lived in Nebraska for six years before moving to Des Moines, Iowa. His middle name, Grant, was bestowed on him in honor of Ulysses S. Grant, the Civil War general.|$|E
5|$|In {{the land}} {{adjacent}} to Carthy's Castle is Orlagh House {{which has been}} owned by the Augustinian Order since the mid-nineteenth century and is a retreat and conference centre run by the friars. It was built in 1790 by Mr Lundy Foot, a wealthy snuff merchant, who named the house Footmount. He was also a magistrate and was instrumental in condemning {{three members of the}} Kearney family to death for the murder of John Kinlan, the gamekeeper at Friarstown, near Bohernabreena, in 1816. Foot was subsequently murdered in 1835, an act that was attributed <b>to</b> <b>relatives</b> of the Kearneys. In fact, Foot was killed by James Murphy, the son of an evicted tenant farmer whose land Foot had bought following the eviction.|$|E

5|$|Newton died in {{his sleep}} in London on 20 March 1727 (OS 20 March 1726; NS 31 March 1727) and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Voltaire may have been present at his funeral. A bachelor, he had {{divested}} much of his estate <b>to</b> <b>relatives</b> during his last years, and died intestate. His papers went to John Conduitt and Catherine Barton. After his death, Newton's hair was examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.|$|E

His health continued to deteriorate and Conn realized that he was dying. He arranged for Thomas Smythe to take over the Conn Smythe Foundation, and he made gifts of money <b>to</b> <b>relatives.</b> Conn Smythe {{died at the age of}} 85 in 1980 at his home on Baby Point. He is interred with Irene at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|As {{reports of}} the grave {{registration}} work became public, the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers. By 1917, 17,000 photographs had been dispatched <b>to</b> <b>relatives.</b> In March 1915, the Commission, {{with the support of}} the Red Cross, began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests. The Graves Registration Commission became the Directorate of Graves Registration and Enquiries in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to enquiries from relatives of those killed. The directorate's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war, with units deployed in Greece, Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E

5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) <b>to</b> <b>relatives</b> and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal to spread out payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E
5|$|Gross {{salary was}} subject to {{deductions}} for food, clothing, boots and hay (probably for the company mules). It is unclear whether the cost of armour and weapons was also deducted, or borne by the army. Deductions left the soldier with a net salary of 78 denarii. This sum was sufficient, {{on the basis of}} the food deduction, to amply feed an adult for a year. In 84AD Domitian increased basic legionary pay by 33% (from 225 to 300 denarii): a similar increase was presumably accorded to auxiliaries, boosting their net income to 140 denarii, i.e. more than two food allowances. It was entirely disposable, as the soldier was exempt from the poll tax (capitatio), did not pay rent (he was housed in fort barracks) and his food, clothing and equipment were already deducted. It should be borne in mind that most recruits came from peasant families living at subsistence level. To such persons, any disposable income would appear attractive. It could be spent on leisure activities, sent <b>to</b> <b>relatives</b> or simply saved for retirement.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} compete with rival {{shipping}} company Cunard, the White Star Line offered their steerage passengers modest luxuries, {{in the hopes that}} emigrants would write <b>to</b> <b>relatives</b> back home and encourage them to travel on White Star Line ships. Third class passengers had their own dining facilities, with chairs instead of benches, and meals prepared by the third class kitchen staff. On other liners, the steerage passengers would have been expected to bring their own food. Rather than dormitory-style sleeping areas, third class passengers had their own cabins. The single men and women were separated, women in the stern in two to six berth cabins, men in the bow in up to ten berth cabins, often shared with strangers. Each stateroom was fitted with wood panelling and beds with mattresses, blankets, pillows, electric lights, heat and a washbasin with running water, except for the bow cabins which did not have a private washbasin. Two public bathtubs were also provided, one for the men, the other for women.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{permitted}} the POWs to build septic systems and irrigation ditches throughout the prisoner {{side of the}} camp. An onsite commissary was available to sell items such as bananas, eggs, coffee, notebooks, and cigarettes. Recreational activities allowed for baseball, horseshoes, and ping pong matches. In addition, a 3,000-book library was allowed (much of which {{was provided by the}} Red Cross), and films were shown occasionally. A bulldog was kept by the prisoners, and served as a mascot for the camp. Each year around Christmas, the Japanese guards gave permission for the Red Cross to donate a small box to each of the prisoners, containing items such as corned beef, instant coffee, and tobacco. Prisoners were also able to send postcards <b>to</b> <b>relatives,</b> although they were censored by the guards.|$|E
5|$|The {{constant}} {{change of}} colonial administrators, {{and the corresponding}} reissue of encomienda licenses <b>to</b> <b>relatives</b> {{and friends of the}} incoming official, prolonged the instability in the province of Chiapa. In 1531, Pedro de Alvarado finally took up the post of governor of Chiapa. He immediately reinstated the old name of San Cristóbal de los Llanos upon Villa Real. Once again, the encomiendas of Chiapa were transferred to new owners. The Spanish launched an expedition against Puyumatlan; it was not successful in terms of conquest, but enabled the Spanish to seize more slaves to trade for weapons and horses. The newly acquired supplies would then be used in further expeditions to conquer and pacify still-independent regions, leading to a cycle of slave raids, trade for supplies, followed by further conquests and slave raids.|$|E
