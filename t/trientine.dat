40|$|Angiogenesis is now {{recognized}} {{to play a}} pivotal role in tumor development, and even in the process of carcinogenesis. <b>Trientine</b> dihydrochloride (<b>trientine)</b> is used in clinical practice as a copper (Cu) -chelating agent. In this study, we elucidate that the effect of <b>trientine</b> on tumor development and carcinogenesis is due to the suppression of angiogenesis in the murine hepatocellular carcinoma cell (HCC) xenograft model and in the rat hepatocarcinogenesis model, respectively. <b>Trientine</b> suppressed the tumor development associated with suppression of intra-tumoral angiogenesis. <b>Trientine</b> treatment also resulted in a marked increase of apoptosis in the tumor, although tumor cell proliferation itself was not altered. In vitro studies also showed that <b>trientine</b> is not cytotoxic for the tumor cells, but it significantly suppressed the endothelial cell proliferation.

40|$|Background Defective copper {{regulation}} is implicated as a causative mechanism of organ damage in diabetes. Treatment with <b>trientine,</b> a divalent-copper-selective chelator, improves arterial and renal structure/function in diabetes, wherein it also ameliorates left-ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. However, direct in vivo evidence that <b>trientine</b> can improve cardiac function in heart failure has hitherto been lacking. Methods To determine whether <b>trientine</b> treatment could improve in vivo outcome, we measured cardiac function {{in groups of}} trientine-treated diabetic (TETA-DIA), non-drug-treated diabetic (DIA) and sham-treated control (SHAM) rats, by using in vivo high-field cardiac magnetic-resonance imaging (cMRI) and an ex vivo isolated-perfused working heart method. Forty age-matched animals underwent a cMRI scan after which 12 were randomized to the SHAM group and 28 underwent streptozotocin-injection; of these, 25 developed stable diabetes, and 12 were then randomized to receive no treatment for 16 weeks (DIA) and the other 13 to undergo 8 -weeks’ untreated diabetes followed by 8 -weeks’ drug treatment (TETA-DIA). Animals were studied again by cMRI at 8 and 16 weeks following disease induction, and finally by measurement of ex vivo cardiac function. Results After eight weeks diabetes, rats (DIA/TETA-DIA) had developed significant impairment of LV function, as judged by impairment of ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output (CO), and LV mass (LVM) /body-mass (all P[*]<[*] 0. 001), {{as well as other}} functional indexes. LVEF, CO (both P[*]<[*] 0. 001) and the other indexes deteriorated further at 16 weeks in DIA, whereas <b>trientine</b> (TETA-DIA) improved cardiac function by elevating LVEF and CO (both P[*]<[*] 0. 001), and also partially reversed the increase in LVM/body-mass (P[*]<[*] 0. 05). In ex vivo hearts from DIA, the CO response to increasing preload pressure was deficient compared with SHAM (P[*]<[*] 0. 001) whereas the preload-CO relationship was significantly improved in TETA-DIA animals (P[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Purpose. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the efficacy of dietary supplementation with the metal chelators, <b>trientine</b> or citric acid, in preventing the development of cardiomyopathy in the Zucker diabetic rat. Hypothesis. We hypothesized that dietary chelators would attenuate metal-catalyzed oxidative stress and damage in tissues and protect against pathological changes in ventricular structure and function in type II diabetes. Methods. Animals (10 weeks old) included lean control (LC, fa/+), untreated Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF, fa/fa), and ZDF rats treated with either <b>trientine</b> (triethylenetetramine) or citrate at 20 &#x 2009;mg/d in drinking water, starting when rats were frankly diabetic. Cardiac functional assessment was determined using a Millar pressure/volume catheter placed in the left ventricle at 32 weeks of age. Results. End diastolic volume for the ZDF animals increased by 36 &# 37; indicating LV dilatation (P&#x 003 C;. 05) and was accompanied by a 30 &# 37; increase in the end diastolic pressure (P&#x 2264;. 05). Both <b>trientine</b> and citric acid prevented the increases in EDV and EDP (P&#x 003 C;. 05). Ejection fraction and myocardial relaxation were also significantly improved with chelator treatment.

Methods: A national survey was conducted in the 6 French centers using zinc acetate to treat WD. Clinical and biological parameters, dosage, and outcome were recorded. Results: A total of 26 children were reported to be treated with zinc acetate, alone or in association with chelators. Of the 9 children (35 %) who received zinc alone as a first-line therapy, 2 were switched to D-penicillamine because of inefficacy and 7 remained on zinc alone, but serum transaminase levels normalized in only 4 of them. Five children (19 %) were initially treated with zinc in association with D-penicillamine (n = 4) or <b>Trientine</b> (n = 1) with good efficacy.

40|$|Medical {{treatment}} in Wilson’s disease includes chelators (d-penicillamine and <b>trientine)</b> or zinc salts {{that have to}} be maintain all the lifelong. This pharmacological treatment is categorised into two phases; the first being a de-coppering phase and the second a maintenance one. The best therapeutic approach remains controversial, as only a few non-controlled trials have compared these treatments. During the initial phase, progressive increase of chelators’ doses adjusted to exchangeable copper and urinary copper might help to avoid neurological deterioration. Liver transplantation is indicated in acute fulminant liver failure and decompensated cirrhosis; in cases of neurologic deterioration, it must be individually discussed. During the maintenance phase, the most important challenge is to obtain a good adherence to lifelong medical therapy. Neurodegenerative diseases that lead to a mislocalisation of iron can be caused by a culmination of localised overload (pro-oxidant siderosis) and localised deficiency (metabolic distress).

40|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} an {{autosomal}} recessive disorder of copper metabolism. The culprit gene is ATP 7 B. The worldwide prevalence is about 1 in 30, 000, which may vary by population. Higher prevalence rates were reported using more sensitive screening techniques and pilot population screening. Typical presentations include neuropsychiatric and hepatic dysfunction, whereas atypical presentations are protean. Diagnosis {{relies on a}} high clinical suspicion, typical neurological symptoms, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and reduced serum ceruloplasmin concentration. The conventional value of < 0. 20 g/l is not a universal diagnostic value. Age of the subjects and analytical variations should be considered when interpreting these levels. Patients with inconclusive findings require further investigations such as 24 h urinary free-copper excretion, penicillamine challenge test, liver copper measurement, and detection of gene mutations. Direct molecular diagnosis remains the most decisive tool. Other tests such as non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper are unreliable. Potential pitfalls and limitations of these diagnostic markers are critically reviewed in this paper. The mainstays of therapy are <b>trientine,</b> penicillamine, and/or zinc. Liver transplantation is lifesaving for those with advanced disease.

METHODS: Twenty-eight children (twelve females and sixteen males) with Wilson’s disease were evaluated retrospectively between 1987 and 2009, with a follow-up of 72 months (1 – 240 months). The clinical, laboratory, and histologic features at diagnosis were recorded {{at the end}} of the study. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 11 years (2 – 18 years). Twelve patients were asymptomatic, seven had hepatitis symptoms, five had raised aminotransferase levels, three had hepatomegaly associated with neurological disorders, one had fulminant hepatitis with hemolytic anemia, and six patients presented with a Kayser-Fleischer ring. A histological analysis revealed that six children had chronic hepatitis, seven had cirrhosis, two had steatosis, one had portal fibrosis, and one had massive necrosis. The treatment consisted of D-penicillamine associated with pyridoxine for 26 patients.

The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is characterized by excessive copper deposition, predominantly in the liver and brain. Diagnosis of the condition depends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters {{and the presence of}} the Kayser–Fleischer ring, and a new diagnostic scoring system has recently been proposed. Mutations in ATP 7 B can occur anywhere along the entire 21 exons, which makes the identification of gene defects particularly challenging. Identification of carriers and presymptomatic family members of affected individuals is achieved by polymerase-chain-reaction-based marker analysis. The traditional treatment for WD is based on copper chelation with agents such as d-penicillamine, but use of this drug has been questioned because of reported side effects. The use of agents such as <b>trientine</b> and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate has been advocated, although results of long-term trials are awaited. In selected cases, orthotropic hepatic transplantation can reverse the basic metabolic abnormality in WD and improve both hepatic and neurological symptoms. Studies of the underlying defects in ATP 7 B and its suspected modifiers ATOX 1 and COMMD 1 are expected to unravel the disease’s genotype–phenotype correlation, and should lead to the design of improved drugs for ameliorating the suffering of patients.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Wilson disease (WD) is an {{inherited}} disorder of human copper metabolism, characterised by accumulation of copper predominantly {{in the liver}} and brain, leading to severe hepatic and neurological disease. Interesting findings in animal models of WD (Atp 7 b -/- and LEC rats) showed altered lipid metabolism with {{a decrease in the}} amount of triglycerides and cholesterol in the serum. However, serum lipid profile has not been investigated in large human WD patient cohorts to date. Patients and Methods This cohort study involved 251 patients examined at the Heidelberg and Dresden (Germany) University Hospitals. Patients were analysed on routine follow-up examinations for serum lipid profile, including triglycerides, cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL). Data on these parameters at time of diagnosis were retrieved by chart review where available. For statistical testing, patients were subgrouped by sex, manifestation (hepatic, neurological, mixed and asymptomatic) and treatment (D-penicillamine, <b>trientine,</b> zinc or combination). Results A significant difference in total serum cholesterol was found in patients with hepatic symptoms, which diminished under therapy. No alterations were observed for HDL, LDL and triglycerides. Conclusion Contradictory to previous reports using WD animal models (Atp 7 b -/- and LEC rats), the most obvious alteration in our cohort was a lower serum cholesterol level in hepatic-affected patients, which might be related to liver injury. Our data suggested unimpaired cholesterol metabolism in Wilson disease under therapy, independent of the applied medical treatment. </p...|$|E
40|$|Copper, an {{essential}} trace element acquired through nutrition, {{is an important}} co-factor for pro-angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Decreasing bioavailable copper {{has been used as}} an anti-angiogenic and anti-cancer strategy with promising results. However, the role of copper and its potential as a therapy in mesothelioma is not yet well understood. Therefore, we monitored copper levels in progressing murine mesothelioma tumors and analyzed the effects of lowering bioavailable copper. Copper levels in tumors and organs were assayed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Mesothelioma tumors rapidly sequestered copper at early stages of development, the copper was then dispersed throughout growing tumor tissues. These data imply that copper uptake may {{play an important role in}} early tumor development. Lowering bioavailable copper using the copper chelators, penicillamine, <b>trientine</b> or tetrathiomolybdate, slowed in vivo mesothelioma growth but did not provide any cures similar to using cisplatin chemotherapy or anti-VEGF receptor antibody therapy. The impact of copper lowering on tumor blood vessels and tumor infiltrating T cells was measured using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Copper lowering was associated with reduced tumor vessel diameter, reduced endothelial cell proliferation (reduced Ki 67 expression) and lower surface ICAM/CD 54 expression implying reduced endothelial cell activation, in a process similar to endothelial normalization. Copper lowering was also associated with a CD 4 (+) T cell infiltrate. In conclusion, these data suggest copper lowering is a potentially useful anti-mesothelioma treatment strategy that slows tumor growth to provide a window of opportunity for inclusion of other treatment modalities to improve patient outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Wilson's disease (WD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive defect of cellular copper export. Early diagnosis in children is difficult {{due to its}} obscure clinical presentations. The efficacy of zinc salts is well documented, although there are limited data concerning zinc use in pediatric patients with WD. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical features, laboratory results and treatment responses in children with WD diagnosed at Taichung Veterans General Hospital between 1996 and 2008. Diagnosis was established by low serum ceruloplasmin, high 24 -hour urinary copper excretion, presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings, and mutation analysis. Results: Eleven children were included in this study. The main initial presentations were impaired liver function tests (6 / 11) and hemolytic anemia (2 / 11). Gene studies in seven children showed six different mutations (G 934 D, R 778 Q, C 490 X, 304 insC, IVS 4 - 1 G > C, P 992 I) and one possible novel mutation (L 1181 P). All patients had improved liver function tests and hemoglobin levels after treatment with D-penicillamine, <b>trientine</b> and zinc supplement therapy. During a mean period of 3. 4 ± 2. 1 years with zinc therapy, six patients had serum zinc levels above the normal limit, and seven patients had serum copper levels below the normal range. Conclusion: Serum ceruloplasmin and 24 -hour urinary copper examinations {{could be used to}} rule out WD in children with chronic hepatitis and hemolytic anemia. Gene analysis is helpful for prompt diagnosis of asymptomatic siblings and patients with atypical features. Zinc treatment is generally safe in pediatric patients with WD. However, its adverse effects should be monitored...|$|E
