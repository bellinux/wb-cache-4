5|$|As White had {{expected}} the survivors to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle, but White believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew up the first CH-46 helicopter that was still intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 anti-tank weapon. The order-of-march was led by a group of Nung soldiers, who were followed by White and <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marine artillery detachment, and behind them was another group of Nung soldiers covering the tail of the column. Together they evaded VC formations surrounding the hill feature of Ngok Tavak and marched eastward towards Khâm Đức.|$|E
5|$|By 30 November, the 6th Brigade was {{surrounded}} and the Afrika Korps, including the Italian Ariete Division, began attacking after midday with tanks and infantry. Despite {{the support of}} anti-tank guns, the New Zealanders were overrun. Shuttleworth was made a prisoner-of-war along with his surviving company commanders. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 25th Battalion, now commanded by Major Henry Burton, the sole surviving company commander, had been moved into reserve a few days previously and managed to withdraw before Sidi Rezegh was overrun.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the film, Spielberg founded <b>the</b> <b>Survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shoah Visual History Foundation, a nonprofit {{organization}} with the goal of providing an archive for the filmed testimony of as many survivors of the Holocaust as possible, to save their stories. He continues to finance that work. Spielberg used proceeds from the film to finance several related documentaries, including Anne Frank Remembered (1995), The Lost Children of Berlin (1996), and The Last Days (1998).|$|E

5|$|In 1981 a {{memorial}} {{to the men who}} died in the disaster was unveiled by the National Coal Board, followed by a second in 2006, to honour the dead of both the 1901 and 1913 explosions. In October 2013, on the centenary of the tragedy, a Welsh national memorial to those killed in all Wales's mining disasters was unveiled at the former pithead, depicting a rescue worker coming to the aid of one of <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosion.|$|E

5|$|The {{battalion}} {{arrived at}} the battery at 04:00.

5|$|The {{demographic}} decline due to {{the plague}} had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30 to 40% {{in most parts of}} Europe between 1350 and 1400. Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.|$|E
5|$|The series follows <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{crash of}} a {{commercial}} passenger jet flying between Sydney and Los Angeles, on a mysterious tropical island somewhere in the South Pacific Ocean.

5|$|At 02:00 on 13 June the 13th/18th Royal Hussars {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} 'C' Company's {{position at the}} crossroads, later followed by fifty-one men from the 22nd Independent Parachute Company. Bréville was now in British control again {{for the third time}} since the landings on 6 June. But not in the numbers to defend against a German counter-attack, so the 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles, part of the 6th Airlanding Brigade, was moved into the village to take over from <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack.|$|E

5|$|By 13 January most of <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet had limped back to France in a {{state of}} disrepair. One ship of the line that {{remained}} at sea, the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme, was commanded by Commodore Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse and carried over 1,300men, 700–800 of them soldiers, including General Jean Humbert. Detached from {{the main body of the}} fleet during the retreat from Bantry Bay, Lacrosse made his way to the mouth of the Shannon alone. Recognising that the weather was still too violent for a landing to be made, Lacrosse acknowledged the failure of the operation and ordered the ship to return to France, capturing the British privateer Cumberland en route.|$|E
5|$|In June 1918, Tucker {{joined the}} escorts {{working out of}} Brest, France. On 1 August, while {{steaming}} out to meet an inbound convoy, she received word that the group's escort, the , had been torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. The American destroyer soon {{arrived on the scene}} and helped to save <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stricken French warship from the waters of the Bay of Biscay. Tuckers efforts, and those of the five other American destroyers who were also present, were rewarded by a commendation from the Préfet Maritime, on behalf of the French Ministry of Marine.|$|E
5|$|In {{isolated}} {{areas with}} small populations, tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties {{to contribute to}} the founder's effect as survivors repopulate their place. For example, around 1775, a typhoon hit Pingelap Atoll, and in combination with a subsequent famine, reduced the island's population to a low level. Several generations after the disaster, as many as 10% of Pingelapese have a genetic form of color-blindness called achromatopsia. This is due to one of <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depopulation brought on by the typhoon having a mutated gene, which the population bottleneck caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations.|$|E

5|$|Private William Hudson (Bill Paxton) is the Colonial Marines' comedian and comtech expert. Arrogant and overconfident, he soon cracks {{under the}} stress of the failed {{incursion}} into the Alien hive. Hudson despairs and panics until Ripley and Newt reassure him, enabling him to regain his composure. He fights to the end in the colony's operation room, where <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party make their final stand, and is pulled through a floor grate by an Alien while providing cover fire. In Aliens: Colonial Marines, Hudson's corpse was discovered in the sewers with a large hole in his chest, revealing that Hudson was impregnated by a Facehugger after he was dragged beneath the grates and later died when a chestburster erupted from his chest.|$|E
5|$|The Raid on Genoa {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought in}} the harbour of the Italian city of Genoa {{during the first year}} of the French Revolutionary Wars. French Republican forces in the Mediterranean, under pressure from Austrian and Spanish armies, Royalist uprisings and British blockade had suffered the loss of their principal naval base and the fleet stationed there when British forces under Lord Hood seized Toulon at the invitation of the city's Royalist faction. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French fleet were scattered across the Mediterranean, several sheltering in neutral Italian harbours, including the frigates Modeste at Genoa and Impérieuse at Leghorn.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{assigned}} to the 5th Cruiser Squadron from 1906 to 1908 and was then transferred to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. When the Royal Navy's cruiser squadrons were reorganized in 1909, Duke of Edinburgh rejoined the 5th Cruiser Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet. On 13 August 1910 Duke of Edinburgh ran aground on Atherfield Ledge, Isle of Wight. She was successfully refloated, but in the resulting Court-martial to investigate the incident, the ship's Captain and Navigating Officer were severely reprimanded and the latter dismissed from the ship. She helped to rescue <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS Delhi which ran aground off the coast of Morocco in December 1911. From 1913 to 1914 she served with the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet.|$|E

5|$|The trail {{came to a}} {{dead end}} at the steep banks of the Se Pone River and the force was trapped. The North Vietnamese closed in and savage rearguard actions ensued. Two bulldozers were finally helilifted into the ARVN {{perimeter}} to create a ford, and <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force crossed into South Vietnam on 23 March. By the 25th, 45 days after {{the beginning of the}} operation, the remainder of the South Vietnamese force that had survived had left Laos behind. The forward base at Khe Sanh had also come under increasing artillery bombardment and sapper attacks and by 6 April it was abandoned and Operation Lam Son 719 was over.|$|E
5|$|Active, {{the only}} British ship still in {{fighting}} condition, took up {{pursuit of the}} retreating enemy and at 12:30 caught the Corona in the channel between Lissa and the small island of Spalmadon. The frigates manoeuvred around one another for the next hour; captains Gordon and Pasqualigo each seeking the best position from which to engage. The frigates engaged in combat at 13.45, Active forcing Coronas surrender 45minutes later after a fire broke out aboard the Italian ship. Active too had suffered severely and as the British squadron was {{not strong enough to}} continue the action by attacking the remaining squadron in its protected harbour on Lesina, the battle came to an end. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Franco-Venetian squadron had all reached safety; Carolina and Danaé had used the conflict between Active and Corona to cover their escape while Flore had indicated to each British ship she passed that she had surrendered and was in British possession despite the absence of a British officer on board. Once Flore was clear of the British squadron she headed for safety, reaching the batteries of Lesina shortly after her Carolina and Danaé and ahead of the limping British pursuit. The smaller craft of the Franco-Venetian squadron scattered during the battle's final stages and reached Lesina independently.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the U.S. Naval Academy in 1867, Sebree was posted {{to a number of}} vessels before being {{assigned}} to a rescue mission to find the remaining crew of the missing Polaris in the Navy's first mission to the Arctic. This attempt was only a partial success—the Polaris crew was rescued by a British ship rather than the US Navy—but this led to Sebree's selection eleven years later for a second expedition to the Arctic. That mission to rescue Adolphus Greely and <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady Franklin Bay expedition was a success. Sebree was subsequently appointed as the second acting governor of American Samoa. He served in this position for only a year before returning to the United States. In 1907, he was promoted to rear admiral and given command of the Pathfinder Expedition around the South American coast before being appointed commander of the 2nd Division of the Pacific Fleet and then commander-in-chief of the entire fleet. He retired in 1910 and died in Coronado, California, in 1922. Two geographical features in Alaska—Sebree Peak and Sebree Island—are named for Admiral Sebree.|$|E
