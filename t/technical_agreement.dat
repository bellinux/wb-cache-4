25|$|With {{the entry}} of France into World War II the same year, {{broadcasts}} ceased and the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was sabotaged. On September 3, 1940, French television was seized by the German occupation forces. A <b>technical</b> <b>agreement</b> was signed by the Compagnie des Compteurs and Telefunken, and a financing agreement for the resuming of the service is signed by German Ministry of Post and Radiodiffusion Nationale (Vichy's radio). On May 7, 1943 at 3:00 evening broadcasts. The first broadcast of Fernsehsender Paris (Paris Télévision) was transmitted from rue Cognac-Jay. These regular broadcasts (5 hours a day) lasted until August 16, 1944. One thousand 441-line sets, {{most of which were}} installed in soldiers' hospitals, picked up the broadcasts. These Nazi-controlled television broadcasts from the Eiffel Tower in Paris were able to be received on the south coast of England by R.A.F. and BBC engineers, who photographed the station identification image direct from the screen.|$|E
500|$|On 8 April 1958, still {{resisting}} Khrushchev's {{call for}} a moratorium, Eisenhower invited the Soviet Union to join these technical negotiations {{in the form of}} a conference on the technical aspects of a test-ban, specifically the technical details of ensuring compliance with a ban. The proposal was, to a degree, a concession to the Soviet Union, as a test ban would be explored independent of the previously demanded cutoff in fissionable-material production. Khrushchev initially declined the invitation, but eventually agreed [...] "in spite of the serious doubts" [...] he had after Eisenhower suggested a <b>technical</b> <b>agreement</b> on verification would be a precursor to a test ban.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, {{while still}} a flight director, Lunney was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} members of a NASA delegation to the Soviet Union, which was to discuss the possibility of cooperation between the two countries in the field of manned spaceflight. [...] "For me it was out of the clear blue sky", said Lunney, who was told of the plans while at a conference in early October. [...] "I did not know anything about [...] until that time." [...] The trip took place in late October. While in Moscow, Lunney gave a presentation to Soviet engineers on the techniques that NASA used for orbital rendezvous, and on the compromises that would have to be made in order to achieve a rendezvous between American and Soviet spacecraft. The <b>technical</b> <b>agreement</b> that he helped to draft laid the groundwork for the mission which was to become the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). It was intended to be a joint mission, whose highlight was to be a docking between an American Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{international}} monitors {{had been}} deployed, {{it became clear}} {{by the next day}} that they would have nothing to monitor, as mutual accusations between Russia and Ukraine over who was responsible for blocking gas flow continued. The Russian side claimed that its attempts to restore gas flow were still being blocked, while the Ukrainian side argued that no supplies could be received because no <b>technical</b> <b>agreement</b> had been reached between the parties. [...] Naftogaz sent a letter to Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller arguing that Gazprom was not only responsible for supplying technical gas, but also additional linepack gas of [...] in order to restart the system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{level of}} {{blending}} above 10% (V/V) is chosen both from a technical (safety) perspective and {{to distinguish the}} product in Europe from regular unleaded petrol for reasons of taxes and customer clarity. Small-scale tests have shown many vehicles with modern engine types can run smoothly on this hydrous ethanol blend. Mixed tanking scenarios with anhydrous ethanol blends at 5% or 10% level do not induce phase separation. As avoiding mixing with E0, in particular at extremely low temperatures, in logistic systems and engines is not recommended, a separate specification for controlled usage is presented in a Netherlands <b>Technical</b> <b>Agreement</b> NTA 8115. The NTA 8115 is written for a worldwide application in trading and fuel blending.|$|E
2500|$|On January 12, Gazprom {{announced}} that it was ready to start delivering gas through the Sudzha metering station that traverses Ukraine towards Southeastern Europe, but Ukraine refused the offer, claiming this would have left its eastern regions of Donetsk, Luhansk and portions of Dnipropetrovsk starved of gas. [...] Naftogaz suggested an alternative route through the Valuyki and Pisarevka metering stations, but later added that it was unprepared to partially accept gas for transfer to Europe. It insisted that deliveries be fully restored because the system had been partially reconfigured to work in reverse in order to supply consumers in eastern Ukraine with backup supplies, and European transit pipelines were working {{in such a way that}} they were unable to accept Russian gas for transit to Europe without cutting off those eastern regions. [...] Naftogaz added that a resumption of transit would require conclusion of a <b>technical</b> <b>agreement.</b> According to a report by the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies: [...] "This reversal of one of the world’s largest gas transit systems was unprecedented. It seems hard to believe that it could have been undertaken spontaneously, which suggests that, whichever side precipitated the shutdown, Naftogaz's engineers had prepared for it." [...] Gazprom rejected this counterproposal, saying that the Valuyki and Pisarevka routes were unsuitable for deliveries to Europe.|$|E

40|$|This {{publication}} examines seed {{trade liberalization}} in Africa, identifies lessons learnt during earlier liberalization efforts, and discusses {{the impacts of}} liberalization on agro-biodiversity. ICRISAT and Michigan State University collaborated on an FAO-funded project to study these issues, {{with a view to}} strengthening ongoing government efforts to reform and harmonize seed policy and seed trade regulations in various regions in Africa. These are the proceedings of the end-of-project workshop held at Matopos, Zimbabwe, during 5 - 6 Dec 2002. The proceedings review the status of seed policy reform in West Africa, East Africa and Southern Africa; discuss lessons learned through an analysis of the reform process; and identify and prioritize follow-up activities. An economic model is also presented, as a framework for analyzing the costs and benefits associated with various reforms, for example regional registration of new varieties, harmonization of phytosanitary laws; and appropriate strategies for national and regional plant breeding programs. The reform and harmonization process is relatively advanced in East Africa, and could provide a model for other regions. But key issues still remain to be addressed. In East Africa, <b>technical</b> <b>agreements</b> established during earlier discussions need to be implemented, and the reform process extended beyond the three countries currently involved. In Southern Africa, such <b>technical</b> <b>agreements</b> are yet to be established. In West Africa a coordinating agency must be identified, to guide the reform process, and governments must strengthen the almost non-existent private seed sector. Capacity building will be needed in all regions, in order to effectively implement reforms. Seed Trade Liberalization i...|$|R
