25|$|In the US, {{the long}} curing time {{of at least}} a month for Rosendale cement made it unpopular after World War One in the {{construction}} of highways and bridges and many states and construction firms turned to the use of Portland cement. Because of the switch to Portland cement, {{by the end of the}} 1920s of the 15 Rosendale cement companies, only one had survived. But in the early 1930s it was discovered that, while Portland cement had a faster setting time it was not as durable, especially for highways, to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait, an engineer whose company had worked on the construction of the New York City's Catskill Aqueduct, was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, and came up with a blend of both Rosendale and synthetic cements which had the good attributes of both: it was highly durable and had a much faster setting <b>time.</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section of highway near New Paltz, New York, using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement. It was proved a success and for decades the Rosendale-synthetic cement blend became common use in highway and bridge construction.|$|E

Back inside the town hall after they entered through a tunnel, Regina and Robin uses Zelena's distraction to take the baby, only to be caught by Hades, who wants to use the crystal to destroy Regina first explaining that the crystal won't allow the person {{to move on to the}} Underworld but rather simply destroying their very presence, but Robin sacrifices himself as he saves Regina from being destroyed by Hades. Then Zelena comes in, and picks up the crystal as Hades tempted Zelena to kill Regina, only to have Zelena realize that Hades never changed and kills Hades instantly by stabbing the crystal through his heart. Later, Emma, Henry, Mary Margaret, David, Regina, Zelena and others attend Robin Hood's funeral, as Zelena tells Regina that she has named her daughter Robin in honor of her father. Emma decides to stay for a couple more minutes, and notices a resurrected Hook, who was brought back by Zeus as a reward for helping to defeat Hades, and the two are happily reunited.

The Snow Queen enacts the spell of Shattered Sight to make everyone kill each other; however, she is given a letter written by Elsa and Anna's mother that shows how much she was loved. Seeing she let herself become a monster, the Snow Queen ends the spell by killing herself. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gold plots to free himself of the Dark One dagger's control by crushing Hook's heart in a ceremony; however, Belle uses the dagger to force Gold to leave Storybrooke. Gold reunites the Queens of Darkness (Ursula, Cruella De Vil and Maleficent) to find the Author responsible for writing their stories and force him to give them happy endings. Emma also learns that her old friend Lily is Maleficent's daughter, helping the two reunite.

Things get worse as the darkness in Gold escapes, being revealed to be the true Dark One. To save Regina from becoming possessed by it, Emma forces the Darkness to take her instead.|$|E
