5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> is viewed from a sufficient distance, {{it appears to have}} only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches <b>the</b> <b>hose,</b> one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E

5|$|Around 1954, NATC {{modified}} the sole surviving XAJ-1 to conduct inflight refueling tests using the probe and drogue configuration. The turbojet engine was removed and the fuel hose and its drogue extended {{out from the}} jet's former exhaust opening. Aircraft in service retained the turbojet and had their bomb bay doors modified to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> and drogue. They were refueling aircraft during late 1954.|$|E
40|$|A new {{physical}} model of <b>the</b> <b>hosing</b> instability that includes relativistic laser pulses and moderate densities is presented and derives the density dependence of <b>the</b> <b>hosing</b> equation. This is tested against two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. These simulations further examine {{the feasibility of}} using multiple pulses to mitigate <b>the</b> <b>hosing</b> instability in a Nd:glass-type parameter space. An examination {{of the effects of}} planar versus cylindrical exponential density gradients on <b>the</b> <b>hosing</b> instability is also presented. The results show that strongly relativistic pulses and more planar geometries are capable of mitigating <b>the</b> <b>hosing</b> instability which is in line with the predictions of the {{physical model}}...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>hoses</b> are {{color-coded}} {{for visual}} identification. The color of <b>the</b> <b>hoses</b> varies between countries. In the United States, <b>the</b> oxygen <b>hose</b> is green, and <b>the</b> fuel <b>hose</b> is red. In the UK and other countries, <b>the</b> oxygen <b>hose</b> is blue (black hoses {{may still be}} found on old equipment), and <b>the</b> acetylene (fuel) <b>hose</b> is red. If liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel, such as propane, is used, <b>the</b> fuel <b>hose</b> should be orange, indicating that it is compatible with LPG. LPG will damage an incompatible hose, including most acetylene hoses.|$|R
50|$|The simple {{vacuum system}} had the major defect {{that in the}} event of one of <b>the</b> <b>hoses</b> {{connecting}} <b>the</b> vehicles becoming displaced (by the train accidentally dividing, or by careless coupling of <b>the</b> <b>hoses,</b> or otherwise) <b>the</b> vacuum brake on the entire train was useless.|$|R
5|$|Compressor diving is a {{rudimentary}} method of surface-supplied diving {{used in some}} tropical regions such as the Philippines and the Caribbean. The divers swim with a half mask and fins and are supplied with air from an industrial low-pressure air compressor on the boat through plastic tubes. There is no reduction valve; the diver holds <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> end in his mouth with no demand valve or mouthpiece and allows excess air to spill out between the lips.|$|E
5|$|When Engine Co. 22 arrived, it {{was ordered}} to pump water on the {{warehouse}}. The company's firefighters entered the warehouse and dragged a hose up a staircase to direct water onto the fourth floor. When heavy black smoke began coming down the stairway, Foreman Garrett B. Lane ordered his firemen to evacuate. Fireman Francis Hart, Jr., became trapped while trying to collect <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> {{and was forced to}} flee to the roof and escape over neighboring rooftops.|$|E
5|$|Briarcliff Manor's fire company {{existed for}} more than a year before Briarcliff Manor's incorporation. Frederick C. Messinger (a fireman in Kingston for ten years) and {{thirteen}} local men founded the private fire company in 1901. Thirty-six men became the company's charter members on March 4, 1902, and dues were set at 25cents per month. On April 15 of that year, the company took the name Briarcliff Steamer Company No. 1. The company's first equipment was a 1901 hand-drawn chemical apparatus, with a tank containing a mixture of water and sodium bicarbonate. Sulfuric acid would be added to the tank, creating carbon dioxide, which would propel the solution through <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> and help extinguish the fire. That first apparatus was white, which Messinger thought more visible than the conventional red in a village without street lights, and the village's engines remain white.|$|E
50|$|A truckmount carpet cleaner is {{a carpet}} and {{upholstery}} cleaning unit that is generally mounted {{to the floor}} of a van or trailer. Its cleaning method is hot water extraction. The operator would park the van near the premises, connect <b>the</b> vacuum <b>hose</b> and solution line <b>hose</b> into <b>the</b> machine, bring <b>the</b> <b>hoses</b> into <b>the</b> building, and connect a carpet cleaning wand to the end of <b>the</b> <b>hoses.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{threaded}} connectors on <b>the</b> <b>hoses</b> are handed to avoid accidental mis-connection: the thread on <b>the</b> oxygen <b>hose</b> is right-handed (as normal), while <b>the</b> fuel gas <b>hose</b> has a left-handed thread. The left-handed threads {{also have an}} identifying groove cut into their nuts.|$|R
50|$|An {{resistance}} temperature detector (RTD) is used to acquire temperature readings. These readings are used to compensate for temperature. A pressure transducer is used to account for changes in pressure. Pressure affects the rigidity of <b>the</b> flexible <b>hose.</b> Changes in rigidity affect the way that <b>the</b> flexible <b>hose</b> deflects. <b>The</b> flexible <b>hose</b> is used to measure deflection. Larger weights cause more deflection in <b>the</b> flexible rubber <b>hose.</b> <b>The</b> flexible <b>hose</b> must be repeatable, accurate, and precise. Without these three attributes, an accurate measurement cannot be obtained.|$|R

They sneak {{into the kitchen and}} plants a hose in the fryer to suck it into the car, but Willie spots them and {{attempts}} to stop them, claiming the grease to be his retirement plan. Homer tries to escape, but Willie grabs his legs and strangles him with <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> sucking the grease, which explodes due to the increased pressure, causing the grease to flood into the dance hall. A grease fight begins among the students, where Alex eventually joins in after being told by Lisa to act her own age.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2003, Dechaineux was {{operating}} near her maximum safe diving depth {{off the coast}} of Western Australia when a seawater hose burst. The high-pressure seawater flooded the lower engine room before <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> was sealed off: it was estimated that if the inflow had continued for another twenty seconds, the weight of the water would have prevented Dechaineux from returning to the surface. The RAN recalled the Collins-class submarines to base after the incident; after engineers were unable to determine any flaws in the pipes that could have caused the incident, the maximum safe diving depth of the class was reduced.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to get control of the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Hose’s</b> langurs of East Kalimantan, Indonesia, {{were among}} the most common {{primates}} in the area. In 2003, the population densities of <b>the</b> <b>Hose's</b> langurs have decreased from 50-80% over the seven-year span. The sudden drop in population arises from the rising demand for its bezoar stones and to prevent crop-raiding, and the rapid deforestation and removal of the primate's habitat.|$|R
50|$|On 17 December 2005 two firefighters from Tübingen, Germany, died {{inside a}} burning {{building}} {{when one of}} <b>the</b> <b>hoses</b> inside <b>the</b> building burst and they were left without extinguishing agent. In the following reconstruction of the tragedy, experts were surprised {{to find out that}} CAFS filled hoses are more likely to burst under heat because the foam is unable to cool <b>the</b> <b>hoses</b> sufficiently.|$|R
40|$|The E 157 {{experiment}} {{is designed to}} demonstrate highgradient Plasma Wake Field Acceleration over a significant length. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>the</b> electron <b>hose</b> instability of <b>the</b> drive beam will degrade the performance of this experiment because <b>the</b> <b>hosing</b> tailelectrons will not fully sample the highest acceleration field. In this paper a parasitic experiment designed to test the extent of <b>the</b> <b>hosing</b> instability is described. In particular, we discuss how the initial beam conditions are determined so that the extent to which any transverse perturbations grow due to hosing can be determined...|$|R
5|$|The {{aspect of}} the {{colouring}} which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red in the shadows. While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, {{there is no such}} gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green in the shadows, while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> of the young man in the Mathan lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E

25|$|In this method, {{similar to}} the probe-and-drogue method but more complicated, the tanker {{aircraft}} released a flexible hose from its wingtip. An aircraft, flying beside it, had to catch <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> with a special lock under its wingtip. After <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> was locked, and the connection was established, the fuel was pumped. It was used on {{a small number of}} Soviet Tu-4 and Tu-16 only (the tanker variant was Tu-16Z).|$|E
25|$|Flashback is the {{condition}} of the flame propagating down the hoses of an oxy-fuel welding and cutting system. To prevent such a situation a flashback arrestor is usually employed. The flame burns backwards into <b>the</b> <b>hose,</b> causing a popping or squealing noise. It can cause an explosion in <b>the</b> <b>hose</b> with the potential to injure or kill the operator. Using a lower pressure than recommended can cause a flashback.|$|E
50|$|Fracking hoses are {{solutions}} {{derived from}} <b>the</b> fire <b>hose</b> industries. <b>The</b> fire <b>hose</b> manufacturers manufacture NBR or TPU covered hoses for fire fighting, water discharge, irrigation etc. The fracking industries borrowed the idea from <b>the</b> fire <b>hose</b> industries and use these hoses in fracking.|$|R

Like <b>the</b> <b>Hose’s</b> civet, <b>the</b> banded palm civet is strictly nocturnal and more ground dwelling; <b>the</b> distribution of <b>Hose’s</b> civet, however, is much more restricted and more confined to higher altitude forest.|$|R
