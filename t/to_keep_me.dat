25|$|People don't {{understand}} {{how difficult it}} is living with a head injury. It's really hard; it sucks; it's aggravating. It feels like I'm a little off on things, a little slower. My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel as sharp as it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

Next to arrive was striker Eduardo, who signed from Dinamo Zagreb, shortly followed by French defender Bacary Sagna. Lassana Diarra was purchased on transfer deadline day from Chelsea, but later transferred to Portsmouth in January after he was frustrated at limited playing time; he said, [...] "I read that the club [...] wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me.</b> But {{when you want to}} keep someone, you do it by playing them.

500|$|Sandra Dee, Dodd Darin, Jimmy Scalia and Steve Blauner responded enthusiastically to Spacey's {{work on the}} film. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt Spacey {{looked too}} old to portray Darin convincingly and called the film [...] "one of the most {{embarrassing}} spectacles of 2004" [...] and [...] "jaw-droppingly awful, a misbegotten and ill-conceived vanity project." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post praised the actor's work, but also felt Spacey did not convincingly portray Darin in his early music career. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli found the storyline to be overtly clichéd, but added, [...] "Despite the choppy narrative and inappropriate casting of Spacey, Beyond the Sea managed <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> entertained." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, {{speculation}} arose that Richardson {{would leave}} the show, due to his participation in ITV ice skating competition Dancing on Ice. Richardson said [...] "I'm not leaving, I'm staying put". He added his participation in the reality television series was for [...] "fun", and stating: [...] "I still want to stay at Hollyoaks and progress in my career there" [...] {{because he did not}} think he was a good enough actor to pursue other projects. However, he later revealed he was not sure executive producer Paul Marquess would renew his contract. In November 2010, Richardson commented on his future with the show, branding it a new era and thankful to be part of it. Richardson stated: [...] "Marquess loved everything I've been doing and wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> on. I'm hoping to stick with the show no matter what." ...|$|E

500|$|Although he {{was born}} in Marion, Ohio, Huff grew up in Mineral Wells, Texas. When he was six years old, his father, Aubrey II, was killed as an {{innocent}} bystander in a domestic dispute while working as an electrician. That left Huff's mother Fonda in charge of raising him and his sister Angela. Growing up, Huff regularly practiced baseball in his yard, which had a batting cage with lights and a pitching machine. He said, [...] " [...] it more <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> out of trouble." [...] He grew up rooting for the Texas Rangers and frequently attended their games. One of his favorite players was Nolan Ryan. Huff initially attended Mineral Wells High School but then transferred to Brewer High School when his family moved to Fort Worth. Although he was selected to the All-District baseball team in high school, he was better known as a basketball player. He graduated in 1995.|$|E
500|$|On July 16, 2007, LeMond {{rode the}} L'Étape du Tour cyclosportive with his son, {{and found it}} to be a {{defining}} moment in his post-competition life. [...] "I had the time of my life", he said, despite getting [...] "650th place" [...] and being [...] "impressed that I even finished". LeMond continued, [...] "I decided that day that nobody's going <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> from cycling, not Trek, not Armstrong, not Verbruggen, not anybody." [...] At the time, LeMond was alluding to a series of public and private disputes related to his anti-doping advocacy that hampered his enjoyment of cycling. Especially significant was LeMond's appearance as a USADA witness in the Floyd Landis doping case. There, on the eve of LeMond's testimony in May 2007, Landis' business manager called and threatened to disclose publicly that LeMond was the victim of childhood sexual abuse, should he appear in court as scheduled the following day. Undeterred, LeMond took the stand and testified, before admitting to the world that he had been molested.|$|E
500|$|Walsh {{was passed}} over {{in favor of}} Bill [...] "Tiger" [...] Johnson for the head {{coaching}} job when Brown retired. In a 2006 interview, Walsh said Brown worked against his candidacy to be a head coach anywhere in the league. [...] "All the way through I had opportunities, and I never knew about them", Walsh said. [...] "And then when I left him, he called whoever he thought was necessary <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> out of the NFL." [...] Brown stayed on as team president following his retirement, and the Bengals later made two trips to the Super Bowl, losing both games to Walsh and the 49ers. He rarely appeared in public, however. He died on August 5, 1991 at home of complications from pneumonia. He and Katie had three sons: Robin, Mike and Pete. Following Katie's death {{of a heart attack}} in 1969, he married his former secretary Mary Rightsell in 1973. His son Robin died of cancer in 1978. Brown is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Massillon.|$|E

She was determined {{to stay out of}} trouble and be a good student, which was what her father wanted for her. By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy). She attended Whitney Young High School, Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita. The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours. She recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it [...] "to fuel me, <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> going." [...] She recalled experiencing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought. She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, {{was a member of the}} National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer. She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{received}} positive reviews. Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic {{praised the}} episode saying, [...] "Body of Proof threw just enough curves <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> guessing {{this week and}} provided enough personal interaction between our characters to {{make me want to}} tune in for more". She praised the interaction between Megan and Lacey calling their conversation [...] "cute", adding [...] "It's nice to watch Megan make extra time to spend with her daughter". She called the Alan's actions [...] "pathetic" [...] for trying to apologize to Martin for killing his wife saying, [...] "You've got to be kidding!". Orlando added that she did not [...] "see coming" [...] Martin's reaction to the apology; he shot Alan, stating [...] "I could understand the sentiment". She praised the interaction between Megan and Peter, highlighting their conversation over Peter's girlfriend. Orlando said that she could not understand Megan's facial expressions to Peter's girlfriend, whether it was one of jealousy or tease. She said, [...] "Megan was certainly giving Peter a lot of ribbing about his new girlfriend. Was Megan just having fun with him or did it bother her a little? I couldn't quite tell". She finished in saying, [...] "A [...] "Hunting Party" [...] led to a tragic death and a merry go round of suspects on Body of Proof this week".|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{made his}} first post-illness public {{appearance}} on July 9, when he surprised the Senate by showing up to supply the added vote to break a Republican filibuster against a bill to preserve Medicare fees for doctors. Though additionally ill from an attack of kidney stones and {{against the advice of}} some associates, Kennedy insisted on appearing during the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention on August 25, 2008, where a video tribute to him was played. Introduced by his niece, Caroline Kennedy, the senator said, [...] "It is so wonderful to be here. Nothing– nothing– is going <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> away from this special gathering tonight." [...] He then delivered a speech to the delegates (which he had to memorize, as his impaired vision left him unable to read a teleprompter) in which, reminiscent of his speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention, he said, [...] "this November, the torch will be passed again to a new generation of Americans. So, with Barack Obama and for you and for me, our country will be committed to his cause. The work begins anew. The hope rises again. And the dream lives on." [...] The dramatic appearance and speech electrified the convention audience, as Kennedy vowed that he would be present to see Obama inaugurated.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning rated the episode an 8 out of 10, saying it [...] "gave all {{the main characters}} an opportunity to shine" [...] and that the episode [...] "delivered some great laughs and elevated some standard sit-com plots to a much funnier level." [...] He argued that Liz helped make the episode good. Though, Canning found Elisa's secret disappointing and felt that Salma Hayek's exit from the show too much like a conventional sitcom. Entertainment Weeklys Aly Semigran wrote that the episode gave good character revelations about Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth, but that episode did not exceed expectations from the previous week's episode, [...] "Jackie Jormp-Jomp". Writing for The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall reported that despite the episode not being a 30 Rock classic it [...] "had more than enough funny things in it <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> satisfied." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that [...] "The Ones" [...] felt [...] "a little stock" [...] {{but that it was}} [...] "just pretty good." [...] He further added that [...] "" [...] gag featured in this episode [...] "was mildly amusing but a little obvious." [...] He felt that Elisa's secret felt more like a Soap opera secret than a 30 Rock one. Nonetheless, Rabin gave [...] "The Ones" [...] a B-. David Bauder of the Guelph Mercury, however, was complimentary towards Hayek's guest appearances throughout season 3, noting, that they are [...] "the best this absurdist comedy has to offer. Hayek throws herself into her role with gusto, matching Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin step for silly step".|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Boortz {{enrolled}} in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class {{in his spare}} time, while {{he and his wife}} Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing [...] "the money <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> in law school". After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team {{in the aftermath of a}} failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine [...] "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." [...] Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked a little about how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an [...] "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked [...] "It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control." [...] In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.|$|E
500|$|Reviews were positive. James Poniewozik of Time {{thought that}} [...] "Because You Left" [...] {{provided}} a good balance of characterization and mythology and commended {{the character of}} Faraday, partially [...] "because a perfectly-cast Jeremy Davies has {{turned him into a}} likeable, flawed, brusque, slightly-in-over-his-head nebbish-god." [...] Matt Mitovich of TV Guide stated that the premiere [...] "offer compelling twists … the foundation is laid for a pivotal penultimate season … it sends the mind reeling and uncorks infinite possibilities." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "it's hard to name a series that is as engaging, surprising and flat-out gorgeous as Lost, or one in which every effort and penny expended seems to be put to shimmering good use. [...] This is an epic big-screen adventure done for the small screen—and done {{in a way that makes}} most big-screen versions pale in comparison." [...] Bianco also commended the characterizations, noting them as realistic and compelling. [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune praised the opening sequence, calling it [...] "really, really great … nerd-tastic for [...] hardcore Lost fan; it's full of shout-outs and callbacks to classic Lost moments and trivia." [...] She concluded that the premiere is [...] "quite good" [...] (three and a half out of four stars) with [...] "a lot to like", specifically the expanded screen time for Faraday; however, Ryan expressed difficulty in understanding the use of time (travel) in the show and felt that one to two more viewings were warranted for her to give a better review of that aspect. [...] Verne Gay of Newsday summed up that [...] "The season's premiere represents pig-in-the-python storytelling—there's so much to work through, so many details, stories, characters and time dimensions to attend to, that after a while this all starts to feel like a very full meal. [...] A bloated feeling may result." [...] Among other pieces of praise, Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle was impressed by the [...] "parallel plotting" [...] of the characters on and off the island in different times. [...] Despite deeming the premiere [...] "riveting" [...] and the script [...] "tantalizing as ever", Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe had a mixed response, for he worried that he would not be able to handle a season's worth of time travel, stating that [...] "I may be alone in this, and I hope I will be proven wrong, but I expected the solution to [...] "Lost" [...] to be more metaphysical, and more original, than simply people being unstuck in time." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger deemed it [...] "really good, in terms of keeping the momentum from last season going, servicing the characters and their emotions, and providing an appropriate number of 'Whoa's per hour." [...] In a three out of four stars review, Thomas Connor of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "the time-travel training wheels are coming off—and the path thus far seems blissfully free of the usual stumbling blocks", due to the previous four seasons of [...] "baby steps" [...] that set up the science fiction driven fifth season. [...] Caryn Kunz of the Honolulu Advertiser said that [...] "This was a great episode to get back into every aspect of our favorite show: relationships, mythology, reunions/cameos, and enough whoa moments <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>me</b> on the edge of my seat throughout." ...|$|E
