5|$|There {{are several}} {{differences}} between the rules of coursing in Great Britain (where it is regulated by the National Coursing Club) and Irish coursing which has been organised by the Irish Coursing Club since 1916. Because hares are not plentiful {{in all parts of}} the island of Ireland, mainly due to modern agricultural practices, coursing clubs are licensed by the Irish government to net 70â€“75 hares for their events. The hares are then transported in boxes to the coursing venue where they are kept for up to eight weeks and <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coursed.|$|E

5|$|By 1942 Jackson {{had held}} {{a job at}} the Sperry Corporation for several years and his work was {{considered}} essential to the war effort. With a brother serving overseas, he was not permitted to train for combat until June 1944, at which point he signed up for the Air Corps branch of the United States Army. He <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bombardier at what is now Webb Air Force Base in Big Spring, Texas and graduated with the rank of second lieutenant. He served briefly as an instructor and then a combatant in the Pacific Theater of Operations until the surrender of Japan. He left the army in 1946 with the rank of First Lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|Depending on maturity, breed, {{and work}} expected, horses are usually put under saddle and <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ridden {{between the ages}} of two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses {{specifically}} bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60calendar months (five years) old.|$|E
5|$|Hawks's {{military}} {{records were}} {{destroyed in the}} 1973 Military Archive Fire, so the only account of his military service is his own. According to Hawks, he spent 15 weeks in basic training at the University of California in Berkeley where he was <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a squadron commander in the air force. When Pickford visited Hawks at basic training, his superior officers were so impressed {{by the appearance of}} the celebrity that they promoted him to flight instructor and sent him to Texas to teach new recruits. Bored by this work, Hawks attempted to secure a transfer {{during the first half of}} 1918 and was eventually sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia. The Armistice was signed in November of that year, and Hawks was discharged as a Second Lieutenant without having seen active duty.|$|E

5|$|In the 1682 {{assembly}} of the Riksdag of the Estates, the king put forth his suggestion for military reform, whereby each of the lands of Sweden were to have 1,200 soldiers at the ready, at all times, and two farms were to provide accommodations for one soldier. His soldiers were known as Caroleans, <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> skilled and preferring to attack rather than defend. Savaging and looting were strictly forbidden. Soldier huts around the country were the most visible {{part of the new}} Swedish allotment system. However, Charles also modernized the military techniques and worked to improve the overall skill and knowledge of the officers by sending them abroad to study.|$|E

5|$|Sadler {{graduated}} from Battle Creek College in 1894 and subsequently worked for John Kellogg's brother, William K. Kellogg as a health-food salesman. Sadler, a skilled salesman, persuaded William Kellogg to market his products through demonstrations in retail stores. In 1894, he oversaw {{the establishment of}} Life Boat Mission, a mission that Kellogg founded on State Street in Chicago. Sadler operated the mission and published Life Boat Magazine; its sales were intended to provide funds for Kellogg's Chicago Medical Mission. Sadler also contributed articles to other Adventist publications, including the Review and Herald. Around 1895, Sadler attended Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois, where he <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an evangelist, ultimately becoming an ordained minister in 1901.|$|E

5|$|FaurÃ© {{was born}} into a cultured but not {{especially}} musical family. His talent became clear when he was a small boy. At the age of nine, he was sent to a music college in Paris, where he was <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a church organist and choirmaster. Among his teachers was Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns, who became a lifelong friend. After graduating from the college in 1865, FaurÃ© earned a modest living as an organist and teacher, leaving him little time for composition. When he became successful in his middle age, holding the important posts of organist of the Ã‰glise de la Madeleine and director of the Paris Conservatoire, he still lacked time for composing; he retreated to the countryside in the summer holidays to concentrate on composition. By his last years, FaurÃ© was recognised in France as the leading French composer of his day. An unprecedented national musical tribute was held for him in Paris in 1922, headed {{by the president of the}} French Republic. Outside France, FaurÃ©'s music took decades to become widely accepted, except in Britain, where he had many admirers during his lifetime.|$|E

He created the rÃ´le of the Prince in Mikhail Baryshnikov's production of Cinderella, the leading male rÃ´le in Antony Tudor's The Tiller in the Fields (1978), Glen Tetley's Contredances (1979), the title rÃ´le of Peter Darrell's ChÃ©ri (1980) {{and the lead}} rÃ´le in Lynne Taylor-Corbett's Estuary (1983). In 1984, Bissell starred as a guest artist with the Universal Ballet Company in its first production, Adrienne Dellas's Cinderella. He was partnered by its leading ballerina and general director, Julia Moon. He also performed as a guest artist with the National Ballet of Canada, Scottish Ballet and Pacific Northwest Ballet. This is {{a stark contrast to}} Patrick's brother William, who <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a minister, but then went on to work in manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|The Rathores, {{rulers of}} Marwar and {{successful}} Rajput cavalry, were the traditional breeders of the Marwari. The Rathores were forced from their Kingdom of Kanauj in 1193, and withdrew into the Great Indian and Thar Deserts. The Marwari was vital to their survival, {{and during the}} 12th century they followed strict selective breeding processes, keeping the finest stallions {{for the use of}} their subjects. During this time, the horses were considered divine beings, and at times they were only allowed to be ridden by members of the Rajput families and the Kshatriyas warrior caste. When the Moguls captured northern India in the early 16th century they brought Turkoman horses that were probably used to supplement the breeding of the Marwari. Marwaris were renowned during this period for their bravery and courage in battle, as well as their loyalty to their riders. During the late 16th century, the Rajputs of Marwar, under the leadership of Moghul emperor Akbar, formed a cavalry force over 50,000strong. The Rathores believed that the Marwari horse could only leave a battlefield under one of three conditionsâ€“ victory, death, or carrying a wounded master to safety. The horses were <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extremely responsive in battlefield conditions, and were practised in complex riding maneuvers. Over 300years later, during the First World War, Marwar lancers under Sir Pratap Singh assisted the British.|$|E

5|$|While the 1st, 2nd and 4th Ranger Company each {{embarked}} for Korea {{shortly after}} their training was complete, the 3rd Ranger Company was retained at Fort Benning, {{to train the}} next cycle of Rangers along with the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th Ranger Company. After providing fillers to 1st and 4th companies to cover their training losses, the 3rd had 40 men left. In mid-December, they took an additional 80 men from 7th Company and completed a second cycle of Ranger training. This proved beneficial to the 3rd Company, as it was given cold-weather training alongside the 5th and 8th companies at Fort Carson, Colorado. After the first training cycle was complete; the Ranger units already in Korea had not received this training and were thus unprepared for the Korean winter. The 3rd Company also received additional training which better prepared it for combat, including tactics of the People's Volunteer Army, which the other companies had learned in battle and tracer designation of targets during night attacks. They also received 57mm M18 Recoilless Rifles, however, these were kept on the cargo truck due to the necessity {{to break up a}} rifle team to man a crew-served weapon, which didn't happen. The entire company was <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their own forward observers for artillery. In March 1951, the 3rd, 5th, and 8th Companies sailed for Korea, a trip which was fraught with frequent discipline problems as the Rangers continuously got into fights with U.S. Marines on board the troopship while en route. After spending one night in Kobe, Japan, the next morning they sailed for Pusan, South Korea.|$|E
