For plausible values of the galaxy mass-to-light ratio, the heating rate {{is comparable to the}} cooling rate due to X-ray emission.

We disentangle the disk magnetization at the foot point of the outflow as the main parameter that governs the properties of the outflow. We show how the four jet integrals known from steady-state MHD are correlated to the disk magnetization at the jet foot point. This agrees with the usual findings of the steady-state theory, however, here we obtain these correlations from time-dependent simulations that include the dynamical evolution of the disk in the treatment. In particular, we obtain robust correlations between the local disk magnetization and (i) the outflow velocity, (ii) the jet mass loading, (iii) jet angular momentum, and (iv) the local mass accretion rate. Essentially we find that strongly magnetized disks launch more energetic and faster jets, and, due to a larger Alfvén lever arm, these jets extract more angular momentum from the underlying disk. These kind of disk-jet systems have, however, a smaller mass loading parameter and a lower mass ejection-to-accretion ratio. The jets are launched at the disk surface where the magnetization is μ(r,z) ≃ 0. 1. The magnetization rapidly increases vertically providing <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>reservoir</b> for subsequent jet acceleration.

40|$|Based on <b>the</b> {{standard}} <b>energy</b> <b>reservoir</b> of gamma-ray burst (GRB) {{jets and}} the relationship between peak energy (E_p) of ν F_ν spectrum and <b>the</b> equivalent-isotropic <b>energy</b> (E_iso), we test the GRB probability distributions as a function of viewing angle (θ) and of viewing angle together with redshift z, P(θ) and P(θ,z), predicted by the universal-structured jet (USJ) model with simulations on observational bases for a detection threshold of S> 4 × 10 ^- 5 erg cm^- 2, where S is the total fluence in an energy band > 20 keV. We simulate a sample including 10 ^ 6 GRBs, and then derive P(θ) and P(θ,z). We show that both simulated and theoretical P(θ) and P(θ,z) are consistent with each other. This consistency seems to be regarded as support for the USJ model. A small difference between the theoretical and simulated results might be due to the observed E_p distribution used in our simulations, which perhaps suffers a little of biases for E_p< 100 keV.
