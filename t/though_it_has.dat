5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show was good to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show {{would be able to}} stay on the air very long, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E

5|$|In 1974, a {{wilderness}} study was submitted to Congress which identified 95% {{of the area}} of the park as qualifying for wilderness designation.

5|$|Since yttrium is {{chemically}} {{so similar}} to the lanthanides, it occurs in the same ores (rare-earth minerals) and is extracted by the same refinement processes. A slight distinction is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare-earth elements (HREE), but the distinction is not perfect. Yttrium is concentrated in the HREE group because of its ion size, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a lower atomic mass.|$|E

It is caught by line gear and used for meat, <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> minimal commercial significance.|$|E

5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela actively defends food trees, {{engaging in}} aggressive bill-wiping both {{in response to}} a threat and after chasing intruders from a tree.
