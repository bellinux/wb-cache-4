5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E

40|$|Anti-spam {{systems are}} {{software}} systems which filter spam e-mails. Spam e-mails are nowadays {{a serious problem}} which causes high losses to the institutions. This report proposes a new anti-spam prototype made up by three stages. The first, the pre-processing, analyses <b>the</b> <b>e-mails</b> to search for known spam patterns, as well as performs eliminations or replacements to simplify <b>the</b> <b>e-mails</b> and to make them uniform. The second stage, the feature selection, identifies the most relevant features of <b>the</b> <b>e-mails.</b> <b>The</b> third stage, the classification, consists in an artificial neural model — the multilayer perceptron — to classify <b>the</b> <b>e-mails.</b> <b>The</b> anti-spam prototype is exhaustively tested on three public corpora — SpamAssassin, LingSpam and Trec 2007 — available in the Internet. The prototype performance is assessed according to the percentage of correct classifications in both e-mail classes — legitimate (ham) and spam. It is also assessed the time spent in training and testing of the neural model. The results obtained are very promising. The anti-spam prototype has very good performance on the three corpora...|$|R

Some of <b>the</b> <b>e-mails</b> also revealed Jaime’s illegal acquisition of cars and his receipt of millions in commissions on the purchase in Spain and Portugal of railway parts.

In April of that year, anonymous e-mails from supporters of Hillary Clinton repeated the same rumor, including a Clinton Iowa campaign worker, who was fired for sending <b>the</b> <b>e-mail.</b> These and numerous other chain e-mails during the subsequent presidential election circulated false rumors about Obama's origin, religion, and birth certificate.|$|E

The Los Angeles Times reported that they had previously confirmed the accuracy of the quote from Navarro-Valls when the story first broke.

25|$|Another E-mail {{was sent}} to the Japanese Embassy in New Delhi on 30 July 2008 to bomb several {{locations}} in Delhi.

25|$|In October 2013, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, {{author of}} the Patriot Act, {{introduced}} a proposal to the House of Representatives called the USA Freedom Act to end the bulk collection of Americans' metadata and reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Senators introduced two different reform proposals. One, the USA Freedom Act (H.R. 3361/ S. 1599), would effectively halt “bulk” records collection under the USA Patriot Act, while it also would require a warrant to deliberately search for <b>the</b> <b>e-mail</b> and phone call content of Americans that is collected {{as part of a}} surveillance program targeting foreigners located overseas. Another proposal is the FISA Improvements Act that would preserve the program while strengthening privacy protections. It would also codifying the requirement that analysts have a “reasonable articulable suspicion” that a phone number is associated with terrorism to query the NSA phone records database; requiring that the FISA court promptly review each such determination; and limiting the retention period for phone records. Both proposals share the introduction of a special advocate to promote privacy interests before the FISA court.|$|E
25|$|In 1957 Finland, Denmark, {{and other}} Scandinavian {{countries}} formed a regional Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly.

For 1957 through 1962 Finland Bahá'í institutions were part of the regional National Spiritual Assembly of Scandinavia and Finland. In 1960, Hand of the Cause Adelbert Muhlschlegel visited in Finland. In 1962 Sweden, Finland, and Norway each elected their own National Spiritual Assembly. The members of the National Assembly who participated in the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963 were Quentin Hamilton Farrand, Godratollah Bidardel, Jeanne Welsh Farrand, Greta Sofia Jankko-Badeau, Rafael Garcia, Aminda Josephine Kruka, Elsa Maria Cubilla de Garcia, Mozaffar Namdar, Marco Antonio Martinez S., Gudrun Ofstegaard, Marcia Isabel Matamoros, Maija-Liisa Ravola, Mauricio Hernandez Munoz, Sirkka Inkeri Salmi, Josd Marfa Padilla, Mailis Kaarino Talvenheimo, Gabriel Torres S., and Habibu'llah Zabihian.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} 1, 073 e-mails {{that were}} hacked from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in November 2009. The incident was popularly dubbed 'Climategate', indicating that <b>the</b> <b>e-mails</b> reveal a scientific scandal. Here we analyse them differently. Rather than objecting to the exchanges {{based on some}} idea about proper scientific conduct, we see them as a rare glimpse {{into a situation where}} scientists collectively prepare for participation in heated controversy, with much focus on methodology. This allows us to study how scientists communicate informally about framing propositions of facts in the best possible way. Through the eyes of science and technology studies, <b>the</b> <b>e-mails</b> provide an opportunity to study communication as part of science in the making across disciplines and laboratories. Analysed as 'written conversation' <b>the</b> <b>e-mails</b> provide information about processes of consensus formation through 'agonistic evaluations' of other scientists' work and persuasion of others to support one's own work. Also, <b>the</b> <b>e-mails</b> contain judgements about other groups and individual scientists. Consensus-forming appeared as a precarious activity. Controversies could be quite resilient {{in the course of this}} decade-long exchange, probably reflecting the complexity of the methodological challenges involved...|$|R
