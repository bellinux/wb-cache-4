Black plastic {{might have an}} emissivity of around 0.95, meaning 95 percent of all radiation <b>that</b> <b>hits</b> it will be absorbed, and the remaining 5 percent reflected.|$|R
5|$|Elsewhere on the peninsula, Cyclone Gonu's waves {{damaged the}} port in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates. In 1995 {{and again in}} 1996, the {{remnants}} of a storm <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> Oman entered Rub' al Khali, or the Empty Quarter, of Saudi Arabia. In 2008, {{the remnants of a}} storm <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> Yemen brought rainfall and dust storms to Saudi Arabia and Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Based on his {{research}} for the book and mini-series The Pacific, author Hugh Ambrose suggested that Basilone was not killed by a mortar, but by small arms fire <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> him in the right groin and the neck, and nearly took off his left arm.|$|E

5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} been mapped and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> it in 1973.

5|$|The Linyphiidae {{generally}} make horizontal but uneven sheets, with tangles {{of stopping}} threads above.

5|$|Agricultural {{losses were}} heavy. In Florida, the second-largest {{producer}} of oranges in the world, {{damage to the}} citrus crop was estimated at $200million, and caused a 50% increase {{in the price of}} grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other storms <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> Florida during 2004, caused a total agricultural loss of $2.2billion. Other crops, nurseries, buildings, and agricultural equipment also suffered.|$|E

5|$|The 1939 California {{tropical}} storm, {{also called}} the 1939 Long Beach tropical storm, El Cordonazo, The Lash of St. Francis was a tropical cyclone <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> Southern California in September, 1939. Formerly a hurricane, {{it was the only}} tropical storm to make landfall in California in the twentieth century. The only other known tropical cyclone to directly affect California is the 1858 San Diego hurricane, and only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones have caused gale-force winds in the continental United States. The tropical storm caused heavy flooding, leaving many dead, mostly at sea.|$|E
5|$|The List of Florida hurricanes {{encompasses}} approximately 500tropical or subtropical cyclones {{that affected}} {{the state of}} Florida. More storms hit Florida than any other U.S. state, and since 1851 only eighteen hurricane seasons passed without a known storm impacting the state. Collectively, cyclones <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> the region have resulted in over 10,000 deaths, most of which occurring {{prior to the start}} of Hurricane Hunters flights in 1943. Additionally, the cumulative impact from the storms totaled over $141billion in damage (2017USD), primarily from Hurricane Andrew and hurricanes in the 2004 and 2005 seasons.|$|E

5|$|The drivers took to {{the track}} at 12:10 local time for a 15-minute warm-up session. It was due to run for 30 minutes but was first delayed by a light rain shower <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> {{the area in the}} early morning. Then the session was prematurely ended when Barron drove into pit road with a large amount of fluid coming out from his car. Nakano was the fastest driver with a time of 32.280 seconds which was {{recorded}} on his second timed lap. Bräck took second, and Herta rounded out the top three.|$|E
5|$|The {{exact number}} of cases of HIT in the general {{population}} is unknown. What is known is that women receiving heparin after a recent surgical procedure, particularly cardiothoracic surgery, have a higher risk, while the risk is very low in women just before and after giving birth. Some studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>HIT</b> is less common in those receiving low molecular weight heparin.|$|E

5|$|The ship {{also participated}} in the main attack on the Dardanelles forts on 18 March. This time a 6-inch (152mm) {{howitzer}} battery opened fire on Agamemnon and hit her 12 times in 25 minutes; five of the howitzer shells hit her armour and did no damage, but the seven <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> outside her armour protection did considerable structural damage and temporarily put one of her 12-inch (305-mm) guns out of action.|$|E
5|$|About {{half the}} {{potential}} prey <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> orb webs escape. A web has to perform three functions: intercepting the prey (intersection), absorbing its momentum without breaking (stopping), and trapping the prey by entangling it or sticking to it (retention). No single design {{is best for}} all prey. For example: wider spacing of lines will increase the web's area and hence its ability to intercept prey, but reduce its stopping power and retention; closer spacing, larger sticky droplets and thicker lines would improve retention, but {{would make it easier}} for potential prey to see and avoid the web, at least during the day. However, there are no consistent differences between orb webs built for use during the day and those built for use at night. In fact, there is no simple relationship between orb web design features and the prey they capture, as each orb-weaving species takes a wide range of prey.|$|E
5|$|After Leonid Brezhnev assumed {{power in}} 1964, much of Khrushchev's reforms were reversed. The Brezhnev era began {{a new state}} of stagnation, and saw a decline in both the quality and {{quantity}} of products in the Soviet Union. Armenia was severely affected by these policies, as was to be demonstrated several years later in the catastrophic earthquake <b>that</b> <b>hit</b> Spitak. Material allocated to the building of new homes, such as cement and concrete, was diverted for other uses. Bribery and a lack of oversight saw the construction of shoddily built and weakly supported apartment buildings. When the earthquake hit on the morning of December 7, 1988, the houses and apartments least able to resist collapse were those built during the Brezhnev years. Ironically, the older the dwellings, the better they withstood the quake.|$|E
