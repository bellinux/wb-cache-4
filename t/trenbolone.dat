25|$|Designer steroids are AAS {{that have}} not been {{approved}} and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Examples of notable designer steroids include 1-testosterone (dihydroboldenone), methasterone, <b>trenbolone</b> enanthate, desoxymethyltestosterone, tetrahydrogestrinone, and methylstenbolone.|$|E
25|$|Many 19-nortestosterone derivatives, {{including}} nandrolone, <b>trenbolone,</b> ethylestrenol (ethylnandrol), metribolone (R-1881), trestolone, 11β-MNT, dimethandrolone, and others, are potent agonists of the progesterone receptor (AR) {{and hence}} are progestogens {{in addition to}} AAS. Similarly {{to the case of}} estrogenic activity, the progestogenic activity of these drugs serves to augment their antigonadotropic activity. This results in increased potency and effectiveness of these AAS as s and male contraceptives (or, put in another way, increased potency and effectiveness in producing azoospermia and reversible male infertility).|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone enanthate, testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and <b>trenbolone</b> acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E

The magazine alleged that Angle had received prescriptions for <b>trenbolone</b> (which is not approved for human use by the FDA) and nandrolone, both anabolic steroids. Angle responded on his official website: [...] "I did not improperly receive prescriptions. It is well documented that in my career I have broken vertebrae in my neck on five occasions and each time the course of treatment was under the care and supervision of my doctors. Any attempt to link me to the athletes in the current news accounts who may have improperly sought performance-enhancing drugs is without foundation".|$|E

It is used in {{veterinary}} medicine in livestock to increase muscle growth and appetite. <b>Trenbolone</b> {{is used in the}} form of ester prodrugs, including <b>trenbolone</b> acetate (brand names Revalor (in combination with estradiol), Finaplix, Finajet) and <b>trenbolone</b> hexahydrobenzylcarbonate (Parabolan, Hexabolan).

It is the C17β enanthate ester and a long-acting prodrug of <b>trenbolone</b> (19-nor-δ9,11-testosterone). <b>Trenbolone</b> enanthate is used in scientific research and has been sold on the internet black market as a designer steroid for bodybuilders.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has both}} {{anabolic}} and androgenic effects. [...] Once metabolized, the drugs {{have the effect}} of increasing ammonium ion uptake by muscles, leading to an increase in the rate of protein synthesis. It may also have the secondary effects of stimulating appetite and decreasing the rate of catabolism, as all anabolic steroids are believed to; however, catabolism likely increases significantly once the steroid is no longer taken. [...] At least one study in rats has shown <b>trenbolone</b> to cause gene expression of the androgen receptor at least as potent as dihydrotestosterone (DHT). This evidence tends to indicate <b>trenbolone</b> can cause an increase in male secondary sex characteristics without the need to convert to DHT.|$|E

It {{is thought to be}} a prohormone of dienolone. The drug became a controlled substance in the US on January 4, 2010, and is classified as a Schedule III anabolic steroid under the United States Controlled Substances Act. Previous to this, it was sold as a bodybuilding supplement within the United States, and often mistakenly marketed as a prohormone for <b>trenbolone,</b> a veterinary steroid. Prior to its scheduling, {{it was part of a}} number of supplements that were seized during FDA enforcement of Bodybuilding.com for selling unapproved new drugs.

5000|$|Many bodybuilders {{and athletes}} use {{oxandrolone}} for its muscle-building properties.

50|$|THG was {{developed}} completely in secret by Arnold {{as a designer}} drug, {{on the basis that}} doping testers would be unlikely to detect a totally new compound. Arnold developed a chemical similar to two obscure steroids marketed by BALCO, norbolethone and desoxymethyltestosterone, which had been reported in scientific literature but never entered mass production, and the banned anabolic steroids <b>trenbolone</b> and gestrinone, the latter of which was used to synthesize it.|$|E
50|$|Although very potent in both {{activities}} in vitro, the AR/PR activational potency ratio of altrenogest {{was in the}} same range as that of other 19-nortestosterone progestins such as norethisterone, noretynodrel, norgestrel, and allylestrenol (ratio for all < 1.0), whereas the AR/PR activational potency ratio of its 17α-deallylated AAS analogue <b>trenbolone</b> was, at 64, profoundly increased (although the ratio of metribolone (the 17α-methylated variant of altrenogest), at 0.56, was almost {{the same as that of}} altrenogest).|$|E
50|$|Metribolone, {{also known}} as 17α-methyltrenbolone, as well as 17α-methyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone or 17α-methylestra-4,9,11-triene-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a 17α-alkylated derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). It is the C17α methylated derivative of <b>trenbolone</b> (δ9,11-19-nortestosterone) and the C9- and C11-dehydrogenated (δ9,11) analogue of normethandrone (17α-methyl-19-nortestosterone).

In addition to AAS, trimethyltrienolone (R2956; 2α,2β,17α-trimethyl-δ9,11-19-nortestosterone), a highly potent antiandrogen, has been derived from metribolone.|$|E
