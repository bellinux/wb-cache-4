5|$|By 01:00 on 12 May, U.S. commanders on {{the ground}} in Khâm Đức were {{notified}} of Westmoreland's decision to evacuate all military personnel, both American and Vietnamese, as well as their civilian dependents. However, most army units {{on the ground}} were left uninformed about the decision, and it led to chaos later when evacuation was underway. During the predawn hours of 12 May, elements of the PAVN 2nd Division continued to increase their pressure on the main compound of the Special Forces Camp. The North Vietnamese made final preparations for the main assault by capturing one mountain outpost at a time, which were manned by U.S. soldiers of the Americal Division, who had placed machine-guns around the main camp as advanced defensive positions. At 04:23, U.S. soldiers reported that outpost number 1 had been overrun, and fighter-bombers were scrambled in an attempt to save it. About 30 minutes later, the defenders of outpost number 7 reported that <b>their</b> <b>position</b> had been surrounded. They attempted to hold <b>their</b> <b>position</b> by calling on an AC-47 gunship to fire directly into <b>their</b> <b>position,</b> in order to stop the attack, but soon afterwards outpost 7 succumbed to the North Vietnamese and the defenders retreated back to Khâm Đức.|$|E
5|$|In Abels' view, Æthelred's sons {{attempted}} to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed {{so as to}} strengthen <b>their</b> <b>position</b> in the inevitable battle that would break out over the succession when Alfred died, and the Langandene assembly was Alfred's riposte.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, news reached the Allies that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they {{therefore}} resolved to maintain <b>their</b> <b>position.</b> They staged a hit-and-run attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them. On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked the Allies lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, the Allies held on to <b>their</b> <b>position,</b> but suffered severe losses (half the Athenian fleet was damaged); nevertheless, the Allies inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet. That evening, the Allies received news of the fate of Leonidas and the Allies at Thermopylae. Since the Allied fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|E

50|$|On August 16, a large Norwegian force {{attacked}} Rutencrantz' {{positions at}} Oviken.

30|$|Following {{the above}} reasoning, {{it is easy}} to see that, if d(0) is odd, after d(0)+ 1 / 2 time slots the SUs {{transpose}} <b>their</b> <b>positions</b> without meeting each other. Once the SUs transpose <b>their</b> <b>positions,</b> the new resulting distance is T− 1. Now, if T is even, the new distance, just after the SUs transpose <b>their</b> <b>positions,</b> is odd and the SUs indefinitely run through the ring without ever meeting. To overcome this problem, in what follows we restrict the analysis by making T odd.|$|R

5|$|A Viking funeral {{could be}} a {{considerable}} expense, but the barrow and the grave goods were not considered to have been wasted. In {{addition to being a}} homage to the deceased, the barrow remained as a monument to the social position of the descendants. Especially powerful Norse clans could demonstrate <b>their</b> <b>position</b> through monumental grave fields. The Borre mound cemetery in Vestfold is for instance connected to the Yngling dynasty, and it had large tumuli that contained stone ships.|$|E

5|$|A single pair of {{long and}} slender {{antennae}} is present, the segments {{of which are}} relatively few and elongated. They were most probably used as sensory organs, with most segments possessing small setae (bristles). A pair of short lobed structures (possible antennules) are also present, <b>their</b> <b>position</b> corresponding {{to the location of}} the second pair of antennae in modern-day crustaceans. In between them is a small triangular rostral plate with a narrow and sharp central ridge.|$|E
5|$|After 5:00 pm, Custer's {{division}} (including Capehart's brigade) remounted, {{and attacked}} a Confederate battery. The battery {{was unable to}} shoot low enough to hit the charging cavalry, and was soon captured. The rebels responded with a Rebel yell, and soon the opposing forces were fighting in close combat using sabers. Because of <b>their</b> <b>position</b> on the field, most of the Union casualties in this encounter belonged to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry—but {{a large portion of}} the loss was from wounds that were not lethal.|$|E

And, reinforced with two additional brigades, {{he ordered the}} Australian Mounted Division to advance towards Tel es Safi where they encountered a determined and substantial Ottoman counterattack.|$|E

5|$|At 17:30 {{a flight}} of Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Fw 190s {{attacked}} the Orne bridgehead, causing {{little in the way}} of any damage. Soon afterward, Royal Air Force Short Stirling bombers arrived to carry out a parachute resupply for the division. Included in the parachute drop were 6 pounder anti-tank guns, which until then had always been delivered by glider. Some forty-one of the 9th Parachute Battalion's missing men arrived at <b>their</b> <b>position</b> at 21:00, bringing the battalion strength up to around 200 men.|$|E
5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement <b>their</b> <b>position</b> was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E
5|$|Beginning around 1 pm, Union {{artillery}} fired first, initially upon infantry in the woods, {{and later}} upon any Confederate artillery that attempted {{to move into}} firing position. On the Confederate left flank, two batteries from Whiting's division and one from Jackson's soon began firing from <b>their</b> <b>position</b> upon Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, who were {{near the center of}} the Union line. This began a fierce firefight, with the Union's eight batteries and 37 guns concentrated against three Confederate batteries and sixteen guns. The Union fire silenced the Rowan Artillery and made <b>their</b> <b>position</b> untenable. The other two Confederate batteries, placed by Jackson himself, were in somewhat better positions, and managed to keep firing. Over a period of more than three hours, a total of six or eight Confederate batteries engaged the Union Army from the Confederate left flank, but they were usually engaged only one at a time.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s, Suharto's {{government}} came to {{be dominated}} by civilian politicians such as Habibie, Harmoko, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, and Akbar Tanjung, who owed <b>their</b> <b>position</b> solely to Suharto. As sign of Habibie's growing clout, when two prominent Indonesian magazines and a tabloid newspaper reported on criticism over Habibie's purchase of almost the entire fleet of the disbanded East German Navy in 1993 (most of the vessels were of scrap-value), the Ministry of Information ordered the offending publications be closed down on 21 June 1994.|$|E
