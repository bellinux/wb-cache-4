5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live in a world where you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

After his death, both his {{daughter}} and wife stated that although he was not religious, [...] "he did not deny his Jewishness, not at all". [...] His daughter noted that he wanted to make a film about the Holocaust, the Aryan Papers, having spent years researching the subject. Most of Kubrick's friends and early photography and film collaborators were Jewish, and his first two marriages were to daughters of recent Jewish immigrants from Europe. British screenwriter Frederic Raphael, who worked closely with Kubrick in his final years, believes that the originality of Kubrick's films was partly because he [...] "had a (Jewish?) respect for scholars". He declared that it was [...] "absurd <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> Stanley Kubrick without reckoning on Jewishness as a fundamental aspect of his mentality".|$|E

An angered Doctor sets out to the Shard on an anti-gravity motorbike and crashes it into Miss Kizlet's office.

The Doctor then reveals that he is still at the café and she was talking to the server he had hacked which he then uses to upload Miss Kizlet to the network. Trapped in the network, she orders her subordinates to release her (with the Doctor ensuring that they do so using a pad that controls her employees). By doing this, everyone else including Clara, is restored.|$|E

Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream."

500|$|Trescothick {{used the}} {{time to prepare for}} the {{following}} series in South Africa, even took up yoga in attempt to bolster his performances abroad. In December 2004, he made 85 not out against an N.F. Oppenheimer XI in South Africa. A partnership of 152 with Strauss in the opening Test against South Africa was followed by a partnership of 273 in the second, in which they both scored over 130. This was a record opening partnership at Durban and England's first 200 opening stand since Gooch and Mike Atherton in 1991. Before this, the difference between his home and abroad average was over 20, and his third overseas century went a long way to counter this. With regard to his touring difficulties, Trescothick stated [...] "I wouldn't say I've put it to rest, but I've made a big step forward to putting it to rest. It's a mental battle for me, something I have to deal with and work hard <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> what is different. He made a further improvement with an even larger score of 180, as England won the fourth Test. After batting slowly with Ashley Giles, the fall of Hoggard's wicket soon afterwards spurred Trescothick to start [...] "unleashing ferocious shots", setting up an unlikely victory with Steve Harmison partnering him. In the matches preceding the 2005 Ashes series, England wrapped up two easy victories against Bangladesh. Trescothick scored 194 in the first Test, and 151 in the second. He also scored 100 not out against Bangladesh in his 100th ODI, surpassing Gooch's record of eight ODI centuries for England.|$|E
