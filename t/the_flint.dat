5|$|Originally, Saginaw Road in <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> {{area was}} a part of the Saginaw Trail, a Native American foot path in the area. In the early 20th century, the highway {{was a part}} of the Dixie Highway through the area. When the state signed its highway system in 1919, Saginaw Road was part of M-10; later it was used as a section of US10 in 1926. In August 1926, <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> City Council renamed the former Western Road after Joasiah Dallas Dort, a partner in GM. In 1941, the highway was moved eastward to follow Dort Highway, and the route through the city was {{designated}} Bus. US10.|$|E
5|$|A freeway {{along the}} I-475 {{corridor}} was {{proposed in the}} 1950s. The 1955 Yellow Book, an early proposal for {{what would become the}} Interstate Highway System, contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> area, including a loop route freeway near the downtown area. Designated as part of the Interstate Highway System in 1957, I-475 construction was funded by the federal government.|$|E

After retiring, {{he attempted to}} gain the Democratic Party nomination for the 1912 mayoral race {{in his hometown of}} Martin's Ferry, Ohio. He died there, in 1922, at the age of 52 of apoplexy.|$|E

5|$|The second {{iteration}} of M-10 {{was designated}} in 1929 {{on a much}} shorter segment of the original M-10 through <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> area, serving as a business connection for the city as the through route, US10, bypassed it on the east. It was later redesignated as Business US 10 (Bus. US10) in 1941, and then as Bus. M-54 in 1962 before being turned back to local control in 1974.|$|E
5|$|West of Grand Blanc, US23 meets I-75, {{and the two}} freeways merge {{near the}} Bishop International Airport and {{continue}} along {{the west side of}} <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> metro area. I-75/US23 has an interchange with I-69 near the crossing with the Canadian National Railway line. Continuing northwards through suburban residential areas, the highway crosses <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> River while running along {{the west side of the}} city. In Mount Morris Township, the freeway intersects the northern end of I-475 before meeting M-57 near Clio. The highest traffic totals along US23 in the state of Michigan were recorded by MDOT near the M-57 interchange; in 2009 an average 68,800vehicles used that section of freeway daily. These traffic counts are expressed in terms of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeways}} in the Lansing area were {{completed}} in the 1960s through the 1980s, the highways through downtown changed designations. The section of I-96 west of Lansing opened in December 1962. In 1973, M-78 was converted to a freeway near <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> area, and from Olivet southwest of Lansing to the new freeway, the old highway was redesignated Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69). Additional segments of I-69 north of Lansing were finished in 1984 and 1987. I-69 was routed over I-96 and the new freeway north of Lansing, and the business loop was designated along M-43 and the former Temp. I-69 in 1987 after that second segment opened.|$|E

5|$|Iberville had {{approached}} the Spanish in January 1702, {{before the war}} broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza which left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance warning of the expedition and organized a defense {{at the head of}} <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> River, where they routed the Spanish-led force, with upwards of 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, M-21 was rerouted in <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> area. After the change, {{it turned}} south along M-13 on the Shiawassee–Genesee county {{line to the}} M-78 freeway and then routed eastward to replace M-78. The former routing of M-21 {{on the western side}} of the county into {{downtown}} was redesignated M-56. When the M-21 designation was replaced with the I-69 designation in 1984, the M-56 designation was retired and M-21 was restored in its place.|$|E
5|$|Judging by the {{organization}} of other paramount chiefdoms like Coosa and Cofitachequi, Hudson argues that Ocute's power may have extended beyond the core Oconee province. He suggests Ocute's sphere included Ichisi, {{as well as the}} Guale and the unknown chiefdom at the Savannah River headwaters. Ocute and Ichisi were both located on tributaries of the Altamaha River, home to the Guale, and alliances to the north and south would have given Ocute relative parity with their enemies, Cofitachequi. Hudson also entertains the possibility that Toa, perhaps on <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> River, was included.|$|E

5|$|M-21 passes {{into the}} {{community}} of Ovid and over the county line into Shiawassee County. Continuing east through the county, the highway enters Owosso. The trunkline follows Main Street into downtown and crosses the Shiawassee River between junctions with M-52 and M-71 in Owosso. M-21 runs roughly parallel to the river out into the country side. The remainder of the county is the same, dominated by farmland along a straight stretch of flat highway. North of Lennon, M-21 meets M-13 at an intersection on the Shiawassee–Genesee county line. The landscape starts to transition to residential subdivisions as the roadway approaches <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> area.|$|E
5|$|North of Ann Arbor, {{the freeway}} runs through {{woodlands}} and near several lakes. In {{the community of}} Whitmore Lake, US23 crosses into Livingston County near the city's namesake body of water. East of Brighton, the freeway intersects I-96 and continues north to an intersection with M-59 south of Hartland. The highway turns northeasterly by Runyon Lake and runs toward the city of Fenton. The trunkline passes through town and bends back toward the northwest, running between lakes Ponemah and Fenton. Continuing north, the environment around US23 transitions to rural farm fields as the freeway approaches {{the south side of}} <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> area.|$|E
5|$|Northeast of Emporia, the Emporia {{service area}} {{is located in}} the median at mile 132.

This interchange, Exit 147, is the only interchange along the I-335 section of the turnpike other than the two end junctions. It is a trumpet connection to US-56, which heads west to Council Grove and east to Osage City, {{and was one of the}} original 1956 interchanges.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010, Simon Parfitt {{and colleagues}} from University College London {{discovered}} flint tools near Happisburgh. The tools were dated to [...] "somewhere between 866,000 to 814,000 {{years ago or}} 970,000 to 936,000 years ago", around 100,000 years earlier than the finds at Pakefield. <b>The</b> <b>flints</b> were probably left by hunter-gatherers {{of the human species}} Homo antecessor who inhabited the flood plains and marshlands that bordered an ancient course of the river Thames. <b>The</b> <b>flints</b> were then washed downriver and came to rest at the Happisburgh site. In May 2013 the oldest human footprints outside of Africa, being more than 800,000 years old, were reported to have been discovered on the beach.|$|R
5|$|Oklahoma {{has four}} primary {{mountain}} ranges: the Ouachita Mountains, the Arbuckle Mountains, the Wichita Mountains, and the Ozark Mountains. Contained within the U.S. Interior Highlands region, the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains {{are the only}} major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians. A portion of <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> Hills stretches into north-central Oklahoma, and near the state's eastern border, The Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department regards Cavanal Hill as the world's tallest hill; at 1,999feet (609m), it fails their definition of a mountain by one foot.|$|E

Later, in 1962, US10 was moved again to follow the recently completed I-75 freeway; the former route of US10 was redesignated M-54 and its business loop was renumbered to match.|$|E
5|$|St Saviour's Church {{served the}} southwestern part of Round Hill until 1981. <b>The</b> <b>flint</b> and brick building, set {{below the level}} of Ditchling Road and on its west side, was in the Early English Gothic Revival style and was meant to have a tower; only a stub was ever built. The architects were Edmund Scott and F.T. Cawthorn. An {{extension}} was built in 1889, and in 1904 a large reredos designed by Richard Herbert Carpenter and W. Slater was moved to the church from Chichester Cathedral. Congregations declined, and the church was demolished in 1983; flats called St Saviour's Court and a rear archway in Vere Road recall its existence.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to elucidate the genesis of <b>the</b> Austin <b>Flint</b> murmur. Background. <b>The</b> Austin <b>Flint</b> murmur is an apical diastolic rumble associated with significant aortic regurgitation. The precise mechanism of the murmur remains unclear. Methods. The relation between <b>the</b> Austin <b>Flint</b> murmur and mitral inflow and aortic regurgitant flow dynamics was evaluated nonivasively in 13 patients with moderate to severe aortic regurgitation and 15 control subjects using phonocardiographic and pulsed and color-coded Doppler echocardiographic techniques. The severity of aortic regurgitation was determined by color-coded Doppler echocardiography {{on the basis of the}} maximal distance of the regurgitant signal. Results. The direction of aortic regurgitant flow was unrelated to the presence of <b>the</b> Austin <b>Flint</b> murmur. <b>The</b> severity of aortic regurgitation was greater in patients with than in those without this murmur. The peak mitral inflow velocity during early diastole (E) was significantly increased, and both peak mitral inflow velocity at atrial contraction (A) and the A/E ratio were significantly decreased in patients with <b>the</b> Austin <b>Flint</b> murmur compared with values in those without this murmur or in control subjects. However, the maximal amplitude of <b>the</b> Austin <b>Flint</b> murmur did not coincide temporally with the peak mitral inflow velocity. The murmur continued both after rapid mitral inflow had ended and during diastolic mitral regurgitation. Conclusions. The increased velocity of early diastolic mitral inflow in patients with <b>the</b> Austin <b>Flint</b> murmur is due to aortic regurgitation, but rapid mitral inflow is not an essential requirement for production of the murmur. In some cases, <b>the</b> Austin <b>Flint</b> murmur may be generated by aortic regurgitant flow alone...|$|R

5|$|The current M-54 was {{designated}} in 1962 for a former routing of US10 through <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> area; US10 was moved {{after the completion}} of the I-75 freeway, and the M-54 designation was applied to the Saginaw Road-Dort Highway routing of US10 from I-75 in Grand Blanc to M-83 in Birch Run. At the same time, Bus. US10 became Bus. M-54 through Flint. An extension of Dort Highway in 1987 relocated the southern end of M-54 in Grand Blanc to end at exit109 on I-75.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} {{highways}} along the US23 corridor were numbered M-65 from the Ohio line north to <b>the</b> <b>Flint</b> area and M-10 from Flint north to Mackinaw City by July 1, 1919. When originally designated, M-65 was in two sections: the southern segment {{ran from the}} Ohio state line north to the Dundee area; the northern section ran between Ann Arbor and Flint by way of Brighton and Fenton. The {{gap between the two}} segments was eliminated by the middle of 1926.|$|E
