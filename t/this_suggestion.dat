5|$|<b>This</b> <b>suggestion</b> was {{acted upon}} and in 1889 the first {{non-native}} fish were stocked into Yellowstone waters, {{a practice that}} continued until 1955 and helped create the angling experience Yellowstone National Park is renowned for.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{review of}} Asian nuthatches {{suggested}} {{that there are still}} unresolved problems in nuthatch taxonomy and proposed splitting the genus Sitta. <b>This</b> <b>suggestion</b> would move the red- and yellow-billed south Asian species (velvet-fronted, yellow-billed and sulphur-billed nuthatches) to a new genus, create a third genus for the blue nuthatch, and possibly a fourth for the beautiful nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{physician}} Pieter Pel {{first proposed}} a tissue {{stage of the}} malaria parasite in 1886, presaging its discovery by over 50 years. <b>This</b> <b>suggestion</b> was reiterated in 1893 when Golgi suggested that the parasites might have an undiscovered tissue phase (this time in endothelial cells). Pel in 1896 supported Golgi's latent phase theory.|$|E

5|$|Plans for an {{expansion}} of the high-speed line to Hamar have been launched, but have not been incorporated into any specific plans. <b>This</b> <b>suggestion</b> would increase the length of the high-speed rail north of Oslo with —almost a doubling.

5|$|Prior to the {{identification}} of HIV {{as the cause of}} AIDS in 1984, Sonnabend's investigations led him to propose that AIDS among gay men might be caused by multiple factors including Epstein–Barr virus and repeated exposure to cytomegalovirus and semen. <b>This</b> <b>suggestion</b> conflicted with the prevailing view that a single agent was likely responsible.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{afterwards}} Seaxburh {{moved to}} the double monastery at Ely, which was the precursor to Ely Cathedral, and where her sister Æthelthryth was abbess. The historian Barbara Yorke mentions the possibility that Seaxburh and her namesake Seaxburh of Wessex were the same person, but also notes that the accounts of Seaxburh's religious life at Ely contradict <b>this</b> <b>suggestion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of the toxins to the hooded pitohui has {{been the source of}} debate and research since its discovery. The initial suggestion was that the toxins acted as a chemical deterrent to predators. Some researchers cautioned <b>this</b> <b>suggestion</b> was premature, and others noted that the levels of batrachotoxins were three orders of magnitude lower than in the poison dart frogs that do use it in this way.|$|E
5|$|Claiming {{the right}} to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly {{proposed}} the name Neptune for this new planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des Longitudes. In October, he sought to name the planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support in this from the observatory director, François Arago. <b>This</b> <b>suggestion</b> met with stiff resistance outside France. French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.|$|E

5|$|Hatt-ı hümayuns usually {{were not}} dated, {{although}} some, concerning {{withdrawal of money}} from the treasury, did carry dates. Most late-period hatt-ı hümayuns and irades had dates. Abdulhamid I was especially inclined to date his hatt-ı hümayuns. His grand vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, later suggested this practice of dating hatt-ı hümayuns to Abdulhamid's successor Selim III {{so that he could}} follow up whether his orders were carried out. However, <b>this</b> <b>suggestion</b> was not adopted. Abdulhamid II used signatures toward the latter parts of his reign.|$|E
5|$|He {{then went}} to the Presidential Palace in central Yogyakarta, where the {{government}} leaders were discussing an ultimatum which stated that the city would be stormed unless the leadership accepted colonial rule. Sudirman urged that the president and vice-president leave the city and fight as guerrillas, actions they had previously promised, but <b>this</b> <b>suggestion</b> was rejected. Although his doctors forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat at the urging of Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, but were captured and exiled.|$|E
5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to {{accommodate}} a few individuals standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support <b>this</b> <b>suggestion,</b> he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E

5|$|In July 1942, the Germans ordered Gens {{to give up}} 500 {{children}} and old people, but by late July he had persuaded the Germans to abandon the order for children to be surrendered. He reduced the entire command to 100 older residents, and on 26 July handed over 84 elderly, mostly terminally ill or disabled, who were then executed by the Nazis. The Jewish administration employed over 1500 people in September 1942, including some intellectuals who were appointed to jobs to ensure their survival. <b>This</b> <b>suggestion</b> was made by community leaders and approved by Gens.|$|E
5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum, {{commonly}} known as the spiny puffball or the spring puffball, is a type of puffball mushroom in the genus Lycoperdon. The saprobic species has been found in Africa, Europe, Central America, and North America, where it grows on soil in deciduous woods, glades, and pastures. It has been proposed that North American specimens be considered a separate species, Lycoperdon americanum, but <b>this</b> <b>suggestion</b> has not been followed by most authors. Molecular analysis indicates that L.echinatum is closely related to the puffball genus Handkea.|$|E
5|$|The two white-tailed {{cockatoo}} {{species were}} called short-billed and long-billed black cockatoos in scientific works, {{yet they were}} called Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoo in Western Australia. Hence ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles pushed for the latter two names to be used. The International Ornithologists' Union has taken up <b>this</b> <b>suggestion</b> and uses these names as their official common names. The local Noongar people did not distinguish between Carnaby's and Baudin's black cockatoos. Nyungar names recorded include ngolyenok, ngoolyoo (from Northampton), and G'noo-le-a (from Geraldton).|$|E

5|$|Desha's major {{accomplishment}} {{as governor}} {{was in the}} area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that the state had split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and private investors. He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less responsive to <b>this</b> <b>suggestion.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Argentinean {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia {{suggested that}} Winge's Hesperomys simplex {{and the living}} Pseudoryzomys wavrini are in fact the same species. In a 1991 study, American zoologists Voss and Myers confirmed <b>this</b> <b>suggestion</b> after re-examining Winge's material, finding no appreciable differences among specimens of H. simplex and P. wavrini. Since then, the species has been known as Pseudoryzomys simplex (Winge, 1887), because simplex is the oldest specific name for the animal; Oryzomys wavrini Thomas, 1921, and Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi Pine and Wetzel, 1975, are junior synonyms. Voss and Myers also re-evaluated the relationships of Pseudoryzomys; they considered it closer to oryzomyines than to phyllotines, but declined to formally place it in Oryzomyini {{in the absence of}} explicit phylogenetic justification for such a placement.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} noted that the feather, the first {{specimen}} of Archaeopteryx described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of Archaeopteryx. It certainly is a flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this feather is known so far. As the feather had been designated the type specimen, the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer {{be applied to the}} skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or neotype. <b>This</b> <b>suggestion</b> was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.|$|E
