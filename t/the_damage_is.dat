5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve carries {{lower motor neurons}} that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage {{will depend on the}} position of damage in this pathway. If <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side. If <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The {{corn earworm}} {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest, with a large host range encompassing corn and many other crop plants. H. zea is the second-most important economic pest species in North America, next to the codling moth. The estimated annual cost of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> more than US$100 million, though expenditure on insecticide application has reached up to $250 million. The moth’s high fecundity, ability to lay between 500 and 3,000 eggs, polyphagous larval feeding habits, high mobility during migration, and a facultative pupal diapause {{have led to the}} success of this pest.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea is {{the most}} common and {{destructive}} pest of soybean growth in Virginia. About one-third of Virginia acreage is treated annually with pounds of insecticide, costing farmers around 2 million dollars. The degree of damage varies {{on the size of the}} pest infestation, the timing, and the stage of the plant. However, soybean plants are capable of withstanding a large amount of damage without substantial yield loss depending on soil moisture, planting date, and weather. If <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> early in the plants life, then damage will mostly be to the leaves. Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods. Most damage happens in August, when the plants are flowering. Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can't penetrate. Infestations that affect pod formation and seed filling have the potential to reduce yields, and because this happens in the later stages of plants, they have less time to compensate.|$|E
3000|$|... “share common damage characteristics” – for <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> to {{transition}} from simply random areas {{of damage to}} being classified as a pattern requires that <b>the</b> <b>damages</b> <b>are</b> clustered near {{to each other and}} that the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>are</b> similar.|$|R

5|$|Parts of {{the church}} date from the {{beginning}} of the 12th century. Although its plan dates from an earlier period, much {{of the church}} as it now stands was built between 1292 and 1370, with the south aisle and transept in the Decorated Gothic of the 13th century and the greater part of the building in the late 14th century Perpendicular. The patrons included Simon de Burton, Mayor of Bristol, and William I Canynges, merchant, five times Mayor of Bristol and three times MP. In the 15th century Canynges' grandson, the great merchant William II Canynges, also five times Mayor and three times MP, assumed responsibility for bringing the work of the interior to completion and filling the windows with stained glass. In 1446 much of this work was damaged when the spire was struck by lightning, and fell, causing damage to the interior; however the angle of the falling masonry and the extent of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> unclear. Although the spire was to remain damaged for the next 400 years, Canynges continued in his commitment to restore and beautify the church. He took Holy Orders after the death of his wife, and is buried in the church. Other families associated with St Mary Redcliffe include the Penns, the Cabots, the Jays, the Ameryks and the Medes.|$|E

25|$|Iron overload: People with {{thalassemia}} {{can get an}} overload of iron {{in their}} bodies, either from the disease itself or from frequent blood transfusions. Too much iron can result in damage to the heart, liver, and endocrine system, which includes glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout the body. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> characterized by excessive deposits of iron. Without adequate iron chelation therapy, almost all patients with beta-thalassemia accumulate potentially fatal iron levels.|$|E
25|$|Most of the time, ‘artificial’ {{tissue is}} grown from the patient’s own cells. However, when <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> so extreme {{that it is}} {{impossible}} to use the patient's own cells, artificial tissue cells are grown. The difficulty is in finding a scaffold that the cells can grow and organize on. The characteristics of the scaffold must be that it is biocompatible, cells can adhere to the scaffold, mechanically strong and biodegradable. One successful scaffold is a copolymer of lactic acid and glycolic acid.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} {{casualties}} and damage occurred in Bohol. A total of 209 people were confirmed dead, 877 people were confirmed injured, and 8 confirmed missing.

25|$|Isolated {{mechanical}} forces may not adequately explain ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> {{affected by the}} interaction of these forces and the pre-existing state of the lung tissues, and dynamic changes in alveolar structure may be involved. Factors such as plateau pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) alone do not adequately predict injury. Cyclic deformation of lung tissue may play a large part {{in the cause of}} VILI, and contributory factors probably include tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure and respiratory rate. There is no protocol guaranteed to avoid all risk in all applications.|$|E
25|$|Fragility and vulnerability: {{overhead}} electrification {{systems can}} suffer severe disruption due to minor mechanical faults or {{the effects of}} high winds causing the pantograph of a moving train to become entangled with the catenary, ripping the wires from their supports. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> often {{not limited to the}} supply to one track, but extends to those for adjacent tracks as well, causing the entire route to be blocked for a considerable time. Third-rail systems can suffer disruption in cold weather due to ice forming on the conductor rail.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its role as intermediate host for several economically important trematode species, Tarebia granifera has colonized water reservoirs, dams and ponds on the premises of three large industrial plants in northern KwaZulu-Natal and been pumped out {{of at least one}} of them, blocking water pipes and damaging equipment. This generally happens when snail densities are high and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> due to individuals being crushed so that pieces of shell and soft tissue are carried into machinery. Details of {{the nature and extent of}} this damage and the costs incurred are not available. There is no doubt that Tarebia granifera is able to pass unharmed through pumps, probably as juveniles.|$|E

25|$|On 10 June 1194, another fire caused {{extensive}} damage to Fulbert's cathedral. The true extent of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> unknown, though {{the fact that}} the lead cames holding the west windows together survived the conflagration intact suggests contemporary accounts of the terrible devastation may have been exaggerated. Either way, the opportunity was taken to begin a complete rebuilding of the choir and nave in the latest style. The undamaged western towers and façade were incorporated into the new works, as was the earlier crypt, effectively limiting the designers of the new building to the same general plan as its predecessor. In fact the present building is only marginally longer than Fulbert's cathedral.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{temporal}} lobe {{damage on the}} reminiscence bump is highly variable {{as a function of}} age at the time of injury. This is because patients with damage to the temporal lobes or underlying structures in the limbic system may lose the ability to form new memories, especially if <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> within the hippocampal formation, while retaining access to at least some memories from before the injury. Individuals with this type of brain damage are not able to form new memories after the incident that caused the brain damage, but they still have access to memories that happened before the brain damage occurred. If the brain damage was present at the age of 10, the individual may not remember anything from between the age of 10 and 30 and have no reminiscence bump.|$|E
25|$|A {{technical}} {{concern is}} that the 14 MeV neutrons produced by the fusion reactions will damage the materials from which the reactor is built. Research is in progress to determine whether and how reactor walls can be designed to last long enough to make a commercial power station economically viable {{in the presence of the}} intense neutron bombardment. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their normal position in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power station is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself. Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive. Another problem is that superconducting magnets are damaged by neutron fluxes. A new special research facility, IFMIF, is planned to investigate this problem.|$|E
40|$|The {{residual}} {{tensile strength}} of a thick graphite/epoxy composite with impact <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> predicted using surface crack analysis. <b>The</b> <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> localized to a region directly beneath the impact site and extended only part way through <b>the</b> laminate. <b>The</b> <b>damaged</b> region contained broken fibers, and the locus of breaks in each layer resembled a crack perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} fibers. In some cases, the impacts broke fibers without making a visible crater. <b>The</b> impact <b>damage</b> <b>was</b> represented as a semi-elliptical surface crack with length and depth equal to that of <b>the</b> impact <b>damage.</b> <b>The</b> maximum length and depth of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>were</b> predicted with a stress analysis and a maximum shear stress criterion.

25|$|Abfraction {{is another}} type of tooth wear that is {{postulated}} to occur with bruxism, although some still argue whether this type of tooth wear is a reality. Abfraction cavities are said to occur usually on the facial aspect of teeth, in the cervical region as V-shaped defects caused by flexing of the tooth under occlusal forces. It is argued that similar lesions {{can be caused by}} long-term forceful toothbrushing. However, the fact that the cavities are V-shaped does not suggest that <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> caused by toothbush abrasion, and that some abfraction cavities occur below the level of the gumline, i.e., in an area shielded from toothbrush abrasion, supports the validity of this mechanism of tooth wear. In addition to attrition, erosion is said to synergistically contribute to tooth wear in some bruxists, according to some sources.|$|E
25|$|While {{toxicokinetics}} {{describes the}} changes in the concentrations of a toxicant over time due to the uptake, biotransformation, distribution and elimination of toxicants, toxicodynamics involves the interactions of a toxicant with a biological target and the functional or structural alterations in a cell that can eventually lead to a toxic effect. Depending on the toxicant’s chemical reactivity and vicinity, the toxicant may be able to interact with the biological target. Interactions between a toxicant and the biological target may also be more specific, where high-affinity binding sites increase the selectivity of interactions. For this reason, toxicity may be expressed primarily in certain tissues or organs. The targets are often receptors on the cell surface or in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Toxicants can either induce an unnecessary response or inhibit a natural response, which can cause damage. If the biological target is critical and <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> severe enough, irreversible injury can occur first at the molecular level, which will translate into effects at higher levels of organization.|$|E
25|$|Only {{ten years}} {{previously}} the Bissett lordship was {{weakened by the}} invasion of Gerald Mór FitzGerald into the region, who after entering the O'Neill Clandeboye lordship and taking the castle of Belfast marched through into Bissett territory, where he destroyed the Mac Eoin's castle and plundered much of the Glens and surrounding countryside. This misfortune was itself preceded by another, although not of the same magnitude, in 1495, when the O'Donnells of Tyrconnell to the west, the leading rivals of the O'Neills, made a small stealthy raid on the Mac Eoin's personal estates, {{and according to the}} Annals of the Four Masters succeeded in capturing him, his praiseworthy wife, steeds and hound, who were all considered to be the finest in the area, as well as an amount of his personal fortune. This not always completely reliable compilation, being the work of biased Tyrconnell scholars, claims this was caused by the Mac Eoin's refusal to give up his fine steed to Conn O'Donnell after it has been requested. The actual extent of <b>the</b> <b>damage</b> <b>is</b> uncertain and the event is reported in no other source.
