25|$|Type not trait: The MBTI sorts for type; it {{does not}} {{indicate}} the strength of ability. It allows the clarity of a preference to be ascertained (Bill clearly prefers introversion), but not the strength of preference (Jane strongly prefers extraversion) or degree of aptitude (Harry is good at thinking). In this sense, it differs from trait-based tools such as 16PF. Type preferences are polar opposites: a precept of MBTI is that people fundamentally prefer one <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> the other, not a bit of both.|$|E
25|$|According to Yuji Horii, {{he wanted}} to have {{something}} the player went around collecting as the previous Dragon Quest games had crests and orbs respectively. However, {{he did not want to}} do the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game. The promotional illustrations for the Japanese version was drawn by famed manga artist Akira Toriyama, whom provided the artwork for the previous games in the series and would continue to do so for every future installment.|$|E
25|$|Attlee and Bevin worked {{together}} on the decision to produce a British atomic bomb, despite intense opposition from pro-Soviet elements of the Labour Party, a group Bevin detested. The decision was taken in secret by a small Cabinet committee. Bevin told the committee in October 1946, that 'We've got to have this <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> here whatever it costs … We've {{got to have the}} bloody Union Jack flying on top of it.' It was a matter of both prestige and national security. Those ministers who would have opposed the bomb on grounds of cost, Hugh Dalton and Sir Stafford Cripps, were excluded from the meeting in January 1947 at which the final decision was taken.|$|E

25|$|Along with asking moral questions, Slaughterhouse-Five {{is also a}} {{novel that}} focuses on the philosophies of fate and free will. In the novel, Billy Pilgrim tries to {{determine}} what his role in life is and what the purpose of everything going on around him is as well. When abducted by the Tralfamdorians, Pilgrim asks them why he is chosen among all the others. He questions the fate of the situation and what led up to that point. Billy Pilgrim considers his fate and actions {{to be a part of}} a larger network of actions, his future manipulated by one <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> another based on decision. All things that happen would happen for a reason. Indeed, Pilgrim’s beginning mindset would suggest that he believed in free will, fate, whys, decisions and things happening for reasons. However, many of these thoughts are quickly challenged by the Tralfamadorians' ideology.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

He despaired of being [...] "a clerk, a machine, a riding-school hack, eating and drinking and sleeping at fixed hours. I should be like everyone else. And that's what they call living, that life at the grindstone, doing the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> and over again.... I am hungry and nothing is offered to appease my appetite". He announced his intention to become a writer.|$|E

Don Cherry's passionate defence of the Canadian team led to a sharp increase in his popularity. Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard had special gold medals made up for the Canadian team. Ballard stated that [...] "I believe the Canadian boys deserve the gold medal and I'm going to see to it that they get them.

500|$|DecembeRadio felt {{pressure}} to meet growing expectations following the accolades received for their previous album, DecembeRadio (2006), which won a Gospel Music Association Dove Award and {{was nominated for}} a Grammy Award. [...] "We had some great stuff go on with the first record, but I think the biggest <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> the past two years has been trying to make sure Satisfied is not a sophomore slump" [...] said lead guitarist Brian Bunn. [...] While the self-titled album was written and recorded with little thought to how the songs would translate in concert, the experience of opening for Third Day helped DecembeRadio learn what works best live. [...] Thus it was the band's goal to [...] "make sure every single song on the [...] album worked well in a live concert setting", according to Bunn.|$|E
500|$|Grand Theft Auto Vs {{multiple}} protagonist {{design was}} envisioned {{to improve the}} series core mechanics. The team sought to innovate game storytelling and negate stale familiarity by not evolving the gameplay's core structure. [...] "We didn't {{want to do the}} same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again", said Houser. The multiple protagonist idea was first raised during San Andreas development, but contemporaneous hardware restrictions made it infeasible. Garbut explained, [...] "It didn't work from a tech point of view because the three characters need three times as much memory, three types of animation, and so on". After Grand Theft Auto IVs release, the team developed [...] and , episodic content packages that followed new protagonists. The three interwoven stories received positive remarks, so the team structured Grand Theft Auto V around this model.|$|E

500|$|The {{passage of}} the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 (McMahon Act) in August 1946, {{made it clear that}} the UK would no longer be allowed access to the United States' atomic research. This partly {{resulted}} from the arrest for espionage of Alan Nunn May in February 1946. On 8 January 1947, Attlee formed a secret Gen 163 Cabinet committee, consisting of six cabinet ministers, which decided that Britain required the atomic bomb to maintain its position in world politics. In the words of the Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, [...] "That won't do at all... we've got to have this... I don't mind for myself, but I don't want any other Foreign Secretary of this country to be talked to or at by a Secretary of State in the United States as I have just had in my discussions with Mr Byrnes.

If others want to, that’s for them. For myself, I have to move on. Life is too short to live in the past. There is a lot to be done." [...] On the same topic, Henry more recently said in 2016 [...] "For me, music was a time and a place. I never really enjoyed being in a band. It was in me and it needed to come out, like a 25-year exorcism. One day, I woke up, and I didn’t have any more lyrics.

Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commended Gaga for being [...] "willing to try new things" [...] and felt that the album shows [...] "she's not complacent with doing the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> again [...] Gaga is allowed {{to make a few}} mistakes on her way towards pop nirvana—and judging what she's aiming for with The Fame Monster, there's a good chance she's going to get there sooner than later."

2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing the same <b>thing</b> <b>over</b> and over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it.
