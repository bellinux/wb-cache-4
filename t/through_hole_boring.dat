60|$|As Rose {{stood looking}} in that direction, and {{wondering}} if a rat had got shut in, {{the door of the}} case swung slowly open, and with a great start she saw a bony arm lifted, and a bony finger beckon to her. For a minute she was frightened, and ran to the study door with a fluttering heart, but just as she touched the handle a queer, stifled sort of giggle made her stop short and turn red with anger. She paused an instant to collect herself, and then went softly toward the bony beckoner. A nearer look revealed black threads tied to the arm and fingers, the ends of threads disappearing <b>through</b> <b>holes</b> <b>bored</b> {{in the back of the}} case. Peeping into the dark recess, she also caught sight of the tip of an elbow covered with a rough gray cloth which she knew very well.|$|R

50|$|The balangay was {{basically}} a plank boat put together by joining the carved out planks edge to edge, using pins or dowels. The planks, which were made from a hardwood called doongon in the Philippines (Heritiera littoralis), were fastened together every 12 centimetres, also by hardwood pin measuring some 19 centimetres long, which were driven into holes {{on the edge of}} each plank. On the inner side of the boat the planks were provided, at regular intervals, with raised rectangular lugs, carved from the same plank, <b>through</b> which <b>holes</b> were <b>bored</b> diagonally from the sides to the surface.|$|R
60|$|The {{head of the}} Patchwork Girl was {{the most}} curious part of her. While she waited for her husband to finish making his Powder of Life the woman had found ample time to {{complete}} the head as her fancy dictated, and she realized that a good servant's head must be properly constructed. The hair was of brown yarn and hung down on her neck in several neat braids. Her eyes were two silver suspender-buttons cut {{from a pair of}} the Magician's old trousers, and they were sewed on with black threads, which formed the pupils of the eyes. Margolotte had puzzled over the ears for some time, for these were important if the servant was to hear distinctly, but finally she had made them out of thin plates of gold and attached them in place by means of stitches <b>through</b> tiny <b>holes</b> <b>bored</b> in the metal. Gold is the most common metal in the Land of Oz and is used for many purposes because it is soft and pliable.|$|R

5000|$|They call {{themselves}} Ni Mii Puu, meaning simply [...] "the people", or [...] "we the people". The name Sahaptin or Saptin {{comes through the}} Salishan tribes. When Lewis and Clark came through the area in 1805, they were called Chopunnish, possibly another form of Saptin. The popular and official name of Nez Percés, [...] "Pierced Noses", originally bestowed by the French trappers, refers to a former custom of wearing a dentalium shell <b>through</b> a <b>hole</b> <b>bored</b> in the septum of the nose. In 1805 they numbered, {{according to the most}} reliable estimates, probably over 6,000 but have greatly decreased since the advent of the whites, and they are still on the decline. Contributing causes were incessant wars with the more powerful Blackfeet in earlier years; a wasting fever, and measles epidemic (1847) from contact with immigrants; smallpox and other diseases following the occupation of the country by miners after 1860; losses in the war of 1877 and subsequent removals; and wholesale spread of consumption because of their changed condition of living under civilization. In 1848 they were officially estimated at 3,000; by 1910 they were officially reported at 1,530.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{stand-alone}} small hole drilling EDM machines with an x-y axis {{also known as}} a super drill or hole popper that can machine blind or <b>through</b> <b>holes.</b> EDM drills <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> with a long brass or copper tube electrode that rotates in a chuck with a constant flow of distilled or deionized water flowing through the electrode as a flushing agent and dielectric. The electrode tubes operate like the wire in wire-cut EDM machines, having a spark gap and wear rate. Some small-hole drilling EDMs are able to drill through 100 mm of soft or through hardened steel in less than 10 seconds, averaging 50% to 80% wear rate. Holes of 0.3 mm to 6.1 mm can be achieved in this drilling operation. Brass electrodes are easier to machine but are not recommended for wire-cut operations due to eroded brass particles causing [...] "brass on brass" [...] wire breakage, therefore copper is recommended.|$|R
25|$|The railway {{was built}} as single track {{but with a}} {{trackbed}} wide enough to allow upgrading to double track for expansion. Although the work was estimated to take approximately one year, delays including buying land for the line, a cow eating the plans near Oakworth and engineering problems meant the work took nearly two years to complete. In particular the southern tunnel to Ingrow West had quicksand oozing <b>through</b> <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> that required additional piles to be driven down to the bedrock to support and stabilise the tunnel. Unfortunately the work damaged the foundation to the Wesley Place Methodist Church resulting in the church receiving £1,980 from the railway compnay.|$|R
50|$|Not all {{the loss}} of life in the mines was caused by explosions. Some like the Troehydriw {{disaster}} of 1877 and the Townhead disaster of 1913 involved extensive flooding in which some men survived after air and supplies were passed to them <b>through</b> <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> while they awaited rescue. The rescue took ten days in Troehydriw and the country including Queen Victoria expressed concern for the men and she requested photographic proof of their safe rescue. The survivors at Townhead had to wait for five days before rescue in 1913. Both of these were incidents that William Galloway had to attend as mining inspector.|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of a high-power laser beam with plasma has been explored {{extensively in the}} context of laser-driven fusion, plasma-based acceleration of ions and electrons and high energy-density physics. One of the fundamental processes common to all these studies is the penetration of intense light into a dense matter <b>through</b> the <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> effect and self-induced transparency. Light with a given wavelength will be reflected once the electron density equals the critical electron plasma density. The radiation pressure exerted on the critical density layer is characterized by the ponderomotive force of a focused laser pulse which scales with a laser intensity, as Wμm 2 /cm 2. At ~ 1017 Wμm 2 /cm 2 and above, it becomes possible for the laser pulse not only to steepen the plasma profile but to push the overcritical plasma with creating a cavity or a hole in the target. The phenomenon of <b>hole</b> <b>boring,</b> whereby a laser pulse propagates through a reduced density cavity to reach and push the critical density layer, is of importance in fast-ignition fusion because it may allow the laser pulse to deliver its energy closer to the compressed fuel where it can be converted into fast electrons that are needed to ignite {{a small portion of the}} fuel. The layer of plasma pushed by the radiation pressure can reflect and accelerate ions via the so called Hole Boring Radiation Pressure Acceleration mechanism. Also the density pile- up in combination with the strong electron heating at the critical density layer can facilitate the formation of a collisionless shock. This shock wave acceleration can produce high energy ion beams with a narrow energy spread. Numerous experiments have been carried out to study dynamics of laser plasma interaction indirectly using solid state targets that are opaque for 1 μm laser. However, by using a longer wavelength CO 2 laser, = 10. 6 μm, the critical plasma density is decreased by a factor of 100 (). Therefore overdense CO 2 laser plasma is transparent for a fast optical probe which opens a unique opportunity to study the physics of laser <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> in the temporal and spatial domain simultaneously. This thesis reports the first direct measurements of the laser <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> velocity in an overdense plasma using a four-frame picosecond green pulse interferometry. The plasma was created by tunnel ionization of a plume of He gas from a gas jet using a train of 3 ps long CO 2 laser pulses. For probing the plasma, a ~ 2 ps frequency-doubled (532 nm) Nd:Glass laser pulse is used in a four-frame interferometry scheme. Spatio-temporal dynamics of <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> in CO 2 laser-plasma interaction at 2 × 1018 Wμm 2 /cm 2 are studied with a ~ 15 µm spatial and better than 2 ps time resolutions. Experimental measurements indicate the <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> process is determined by a balance between the radiation pressure and thermal pressure. As a result of this competition, increases during the risetime of the laser pulse where but decreases with a larger slope rate on the falling edge.

50|$|A {{vertical}} {{closed loop}} field {{is composed of}} pipes that run vertically in the ground. A <b>hole</b> is <b>bored</b> in the ground, typically 50 to- 400 ft deep. Pipe pairs in the hole are joined with a U-shaped cross connector {{at the bottom of}} the hole. The borehole is commonly filled with a bentonite grout surrounding the pipe to provide a thermal connection to the surrounding soil or rock to improve the heat transfer. Thermally enhanced grouts are available to improve this heat transfer. Grout also protects the ground water from contamination, and prevents artesian wells from flooding the property. Vertical loop fields are typically used when there is a limited area of land available. <b>Bore</b> <b>holes</b> are spaced at least 5-6 m apart and the depth depends on ground and building characteristics. For illustration, a detached house needing 10 kW (3 ton) of heating capacity might need three boreholes 80 to 110 m deep. (A ton of heat is 12,000 British thermal units per hour (BTU/h) or 3.5 kilowatts.) During the cooling season, the local temperature rise in the bore field is influenced most by the moisture travel in the soil. Reliable heat transfer models have been developed <b>through</b> sample <b>bore</b> <b>holes</b> as well as other tests.|$|R
50|$|The process {{starts with}} the {{receiving}} hole and entrance pits. These pits will allow the drilling fluid to be collected and reclaimed to reduce costs and prevent waste. The first stage drills a pilot hole on the designed path, and the second stage (reaming) enlarges the hole by passing a larger cutting tool known as the back reamer. The reamer's diameter depends {{on the size of}} the pipe to be pulled back <b>through</b> the <b>bore</b> <b>hole.</b> The driller increases the diameter according to the outer diameter or the conduit and to achieve optimal production. The third stage places the product or casing pipe in the enlarged hole by way of the drill stem; it is pulled behind the reamer to allow centering of the pipe in the newly reamed path.|$|R
50|$|In {{the last}} few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be {{fastened}} together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt, of which, nowadays, the screw bolt, with its nut and washer, {{is by far the most}} common. The second type of bolt is the pin bolt or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a tapered <b>hole</b> forged <b>through</b> the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt. The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked <b>through</b> a <b>hole</b> <b>bored</b> <b>through</b> the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened this way.|$|R
