The aim of the research is to investigate the most common <b>infringements</b> <b>of</b> social provisions committed by commercial vehicle drivers involved in road transport accidents (RTA). The data included in this paper refer particularly to infringements committed by the drivers involved in driving vehicles which were registered in the Latvian registry. The paper summarizes and evaluates most common <b>infringements</b> <b>of</b> social legislation requirements for drivers involved in RTA in accordance with the Directive 2009 / 5 /EC of the European Commission and the corresponding Latvian Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No. 411 entered into force in 2008. Offences on drivers' allowed work and rest time periods, shortcomings at record keeping and inappropriate use of recording equipment (tachograph) by drivers of commercial vehicles are characterized in this paper based on findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies, advisory opinions and expert conclusions. The paper provides evaluation <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> <b>of</b> social legislation requirements by their importance in relation to road safety, by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> recording equipment fitted to vehicles, by the quantity and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> offences committed simultaneously, as well as by other minor aspects.

40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the risk}} of intellectual property (IP) infringements by competitors from abroad and in particular whether this risk is higher for international innovating firms. We distinguish three different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> IP <b>infringements</b> from abroad: the usage of firms' technical inventions, product piracy and copying of corporate names and designs. Our analysis rests on the German data from the Europe-wide Community Innovation Survey (CIS). We use a unique data set of about 900 observations which are retrieved from two survey waves. While the earlier wave contains information about international and domestic innovation activities the later wave reports IP infringements. In a second analysis, the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> from innovation host countries and no innovation host countries abroad is examined. Before the empirical analysis, an explorative study {{has been carried out}} in China with interviews of German firms with innovation activities in China and with a legal advisor for small and medium sized German enterprises. The results show that firms with international R&D activities are increasing their chances to lose technological knowledge to their local competitors abroad. R&D activities in countries with weak intellectual property rights increase the risk for all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement.</b> Infringements by competitors from the host country are driven by the production of innovations in this country. Export intensity is the major driver <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> from no innovation host countries. R&D activities in China and North America also increase the risk <b>of</b> an <b>infringement.</b> However, firms that innovate only in their home country experience significantly more product piracy cases than internationally innovating firms...|$|R

40|$|Libertarian self-ownership {{views in}} the {{tradition}} of Locke, Nozick, and the left-libertarians have supposed that we enjoy very powerful deontological protections against infringing upon our property. Such a conception makes sense when we are focused on property that is very important to its owner, such as a person’s kidney. However, this stringency of our property rights is harder to credit when we consider more trivial infringements such as very mildly toxic pollution or trivial risks such having planes fly overhead. Maintaining that our rights against all infringements are very powerful threatens to implausibly make such pollution and trivial risk broadly impermissible. This paper suggests that self-ownership views have tended to inappropriately conflate the seriousness <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> and that treating all infringements so seriously is implausible because it would make too much impermissible. I consider several ways to avoid this result within a self-ownership framework and conclude that the best approach is to allow that the strength of the protection against infringements should be tied to the seriousness of the harm <b>of</b> the <b>infringement...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the current European private antitrust enforcement policy. The European Commission’s White Paper of 2008, the unofficial Draft Directive of 2009 and the collective redress consultation of 2011 consider a facilitated access to private actions for all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> antitrust violations under articles 101 and 102 TFEU {{in order to}} effectively compensate the victims of anticompetitive conduct. Assuming that changes are necessary, the paper argues {{that it might be}} worthwhile to limit this policy to damages claims against hardcore violations such as cartels. This suggestion is based on two main arguments. Firstly, the current European private antitrust policy probably underestimates the risks of more damages actions against all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> neglecting insights from the economic analysis of law. Secondly, a revised approach is not only in line with the thinking that underpins the reform but also addresses an actual need as revealed by a comparison of litigation data from different jurisdictions. Refining the European private antitrust policy, it is argued that a focus on hard-core anticompetitive constraints such as price fixing would mitigate the potential for a strategic use of antitrust litigation and reduce the likelihood that the reform of European antitrust damages actions will lead to negative outcomes.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the risk {{associated}} with the transport of stock calves imported from France to Italy, information obtained from inspections carried out in Piedmont by competent authorities between 2001 and 2010 was considered. The inspections concerned 246 trucks transporting a total of 13, 857 fattening calves. Based on the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> recorded, several hazards related to animal welfare, such as overcrowding, tying by the horns and inappropriate mixing, were identified and characterized. The inspection of vehicles revealed hazards concerning partitions, bedding, decks, lighting, drinking and mechanical ventilation systems. A calculation {{was made of the}} incidence <b>of</b> these <b>infringements</b> and the consequent exposure of calves to such hazards and risk characterization was performed. The ranking shows overcrowding and the absence of partitions to be major risks in stock calf transportation from France to Italy. A logistic regression was adopted to evaluate the effect on the exposure to hazards of the only two variables recordable during the inspections: number of calves inside each vehicle and distance of the journey. The results showed a direct relationship between the number of calves per vehicle and exposure to overcrowding or to absence of partitions. The journey distance was found weakly and inversely related to exposure to the absence of partitions. The information obtained from the inspections provides not only a basis for evaluating the welfare of calves during transport but also an objective contribution to the assessment of the risks tied to their transportation. </p...|$|R

In order to know the possible presence of these varieties of soya in products on the market and to test the degree of compliance with the regulations in force, the National Food Centre (CNA) under the Spanish Agency for Consumer Affairs, Food Safety and Nutrition (AECOSAN), has conducted a study on 28 product samples acquired on the Spanish market. The complete GMO analysis process consisted of the homogenisation of the sample, the extraction and purification of DNA by means of the CTAB method (cetri monium bromide), in order to subsequently carry out the detection, identification and quantification of the genetically modified soya content by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique and real time PCR (RT-PCR). The results obtained showed the presence of trans genic sequences in 25 % of the samples analysed.

40|$|The {{distinction}} between restrictions “by object” and “by effect” has re-surfaced {{in the last}} few years as a central issue in the EU competition debate in parallel with a number of recent decisions by the Court of Justice. This is still a largely unresolved and, admittedly, quite confusing area, which may appear surprising given its crucial, central role within EU antitrust law. Without any ambition of systematically going through the vast literature on the topic, the aim of this article is, moving from the legal rationale underlying the antitrust assessment of agreements/concerted practices, to propose a framework of analysis for determining when a “restriction by object” is the right category to use. For this purpose, the key role of this distinction in the EU competition system and the major ambiguities contained in the Court of Justice statements around the “object/effect” dichotomy will be outlined, thereby attempting a general schematization of the main positions on the issue. A proposed framework of analysis will then be illustrated, arguing that the key criterion to be followed is the likelihood of anticompetitive effects and, through this, it is possible to differentiate between hard-core/“naked” infringements, (other) object restrictions (requiring a well construed theory of harm to show likelihood of effects) and effects restrictions (ascertained on the based of full empirical analysis). In practice, a four-step test is proposed: i) verify whether the alleged infringement could be classified as “hard-core”; in the negative, ii) proceed by testing whether there is a clear likelihood of anticompetitive effects; then, absent this, iii) make a deeper/empirical effects analysis; finally (in all cases) iv) verify whether Art. 101 (3) may play any role.

40|$|What form of {{intellectual}} property rights (IPR) policy contributes to economic growth? Should a company with a large technology lead receive the same IPR protection as a company with a more limited advantage? Should followers be able to license the products of technology leaders? We develop a general equilibrium framework to investigate these questions. The economy consists of many industries and firms engaged in cumulative (step-by-step) innovation. IPR policy regulates whether followers in an industry can copy the technology of the leader, whether they can license their innovations, and what <b>types</b> <b>of</b> patent <b>infringement</b> fees {{they are expected to}} pay. With full patent protection, followers can catch up to the leader in their industry only by making the same innovation(s) themselves.

40|$|Abstract: Based upon a {{comparative}} institutional {{analysis of the}} institutional frameworks involved in the governance of Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) systems in France and in the US, both {{in the domain of}} patents and copyrights, we demonstrate that the differences of performances among contrasted systems of property rights do not only depend upon the wording of the Law, but also result from the governance mechanisms that implement and complete the Law. In particular we show that there are essential complementarities between public and private institutions designed by the owners of IPRs. Institutions allow agents to reduce the costs of settling and defending exclusive rights of use over intangible goods by collectivizing the related operation. Collectivization can however generate mal-adaptation costs since the management of these rights cannot be customized. We then show that the optimal division of labour between public institutions, private institutions and individuals varies according to the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> IPRs <b>infringement</b> and according to the diffusion strategy used by the owner(s) of the IPRs. We conclude by pointing out that the design of the organization of the institutional frame should be more carefully taken into account when dealing with the optimal design of IPRs systems to solve the protection/diffusion dilemma...|$|R
