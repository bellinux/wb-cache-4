This allows the system to operate optimally when satellites are {{in direct contact with}} the ground station, making it suitable for a system like the Japanese QZSS. Low satellite mass and low satellite manufacturing and launch cost are significant advantages of this system.

In insects, as in other animals, cellular clocks are embodied in clock neurons capable of sustained autonomous circadian rhythmicity, and those clock neurons are organized into clock circuits. Drosophila fl ies spend their entire lives in small areas near the ground, and use their circadian brain clock to regulate daily rhythms of rest and activity, so as to organize their behaviour appropriately to the daily rhythms of their local environment.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} {{motivation for the}} leap second {{in the context of}} the historical evolution of time measurement. The periodic insertion of a leap second step into the scale of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) necessitates frequent changes in complex <b>timekeeping</b> <b>systems</b> and is currently the subject of discussion in working groups of various international scienti � c organizations. UTC is an atomic time scale that agrees in rate with International Atomic Time (TAI), but differs by an integral number of seconds, and is the basis of civil time. In contrast, Universal Time (UT 1) is an astronomical time scale de � ned by the Earth’s rotation and is used in celestial navigation. UTC is presently maintained to within 0. 9 s of UT 1. As the needs of celestial navigation that depend on UT 1 can now be met by satellite systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), options for revising the de � nition of UTC and the possible role of leap seconds in the future are considered...|$|R

40|$|Though {{the level}} of precise {{timekeeping}} for military satellite communications (milsatcom) applications {{may not be as}} stringent as that required for satellite navigation, milsatcom poses its own unique timekeeping problems.

40|$|Abstract The {{influence}} of circadian <b>timekeeping</b> <b>systems</b> on behavior and phys-iology can change substantially as female mammals undergo {{the transition from}} a nonpregnant to a pregnant state. Here, we examined the possibility that site-specific changes in extra-SCN oscillators and in local rhythms might coincide with the emergence of new patterns of temporal organization among various behavioral and physiological rhythms. Specifically, we compared daily patterns of immunoreactive FOS and PER 2 in 3 brain regions of pregnant and diestrous rats. We found that, in the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BnST-ov), the peak of the PER 2 rhythm occurred approximately 12 hours out of phase in pregnant and diestrous females. In contrast, the phase of the rhythm in FOS was the same, but pregnant rats expressed more FOS in the BnST-ov than diestrous ones. In the central amygdala (CEA) of diestrous females, PER 2 expression was arrhythmic, but Fos expression was elevated at night. No rhythms were seen in this region of pregnant females, nor were any rhythms seen in the basolateral amygdala of either group. Overall, the patterns in th...|$|R
