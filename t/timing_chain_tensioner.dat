2500|$|The XK8 was {{launched}} in 1996 to replace the XJ-S. [...] Two body styles were produced - a coupé and a convertible. [...] The car {{was the first in}} the Jaguar line-up to use Jaguar's newly developed V8 engine - the AJ-V8. [...] In 2000, the supercharged XKR was added to the range. [...] The XKR featured 370 supercharged horsepower, a subtle rear spoiler, wire mesh front grille, and red exterior emblems. [...] The XKR's motor was made in England, the ignition system was from NGK in Japan, the transmission was a Mercedes-Benz 722.6, the lighting system was by Valeo in France, and the supercharger was made by Eaton in the USA. [...] So it was truly a world car. [...] The 2000-2002 XKR's had the 4.0 engine which featured a plastic <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> and plastic finned water pump. [...] Replacement of these plastic items with metal ones is a prudent investment. The 2000 XKR received positive reviews from magazines including Road & Track, Car & Driver, and Automobile.|$|E
50|$|The twin cam 1.9 L (1,858 cc) 10R was {{produced}} from 1967 through Feb 1971, {{when it was}} renamed the 8R-G. The later 8R-G version did not receive a <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> {{in an effort to}} make it more silent.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{affected}} by an oil sludge problem and premature <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> failure, which were fixed around 2002-2004. The oil sludge issue {{appears to have been}} caused by issues with the crankcase ventilation system, and while it affected a minority of engines, it could cause complete failure In some cases, neglected maintenance aided in premature failure (missed oil changes or increased intervals between oil changes). Also this engine was plagued with issues regarding the water pump gasket leaking coolant internally and diluting the oil. Such coolant leaks must be addressed instantly or engine failure is imminent.|$|E
5000|$|All {{versions}} {{featured a}} low-maintenance <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> with a self-adjusting hydraulic <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> and hydraulic valve tappets. The M42 also incorporates the Bosch Motronic M1.7 DME, eliminating a distributor {{in favor of}} fully electronic ignition timing. [...] The DME was configured to fire four individual remotely mounted coils. Furthermore, in markets that required emissions controls, the DME also incorporates an upstream O2 sensor and three-way catalyst.|$|R
50|$|Toyota swapped the dual-row <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> used {{in older}} engines for a single-row chain with plastic guides in 1983. The new system reduced {{drag on the}} engine but {{introduced}} a new maintenance problem. After about 100,000 miles of operation, the chain may stretch {{to the point that}} the hydraulic-operated <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> cannot take up any more slack. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> then impacts the plastic driver's side chain guide, breaking it within a short period of time and creating a noticeable chattering sound in the front of the engine, especially when cold. If the engine continues to be operated without the guide restraint, the chain will vibrate excessively on the driver's side and stretch rapidly. The result is any of several failure modes.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{versions of}} the M42 developed problems with the camshaft chain drive. The hydraulic <b>tensioner,</b> <b>chain</b> guides, idler wheel and rear lower chain case have all been updated to resolve mechanical wear problems experienced in the early {{versions of the}} M42. Since the updated cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> is shared with the M44, people commonly refer to the revised tensioner as a [...] "M44 tensioner".|$|R
5000|$|On {{bicycles}} with fixed chain-lines, no <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> is required, eliminating a {{part that}} could otherwise become damaged in rough terrain- an advantage for off-road cyclists. Where a tensioner is required, a short cage is usually sufficient {{to take up}} the chain slack.|$|R
50|$|Because most full {{suspension}} frame designs either {{have a single}} pivot that is not concentric with the bottom bracket, or a linkage with a variable center of rotation, {{the distance between the}} bottom bracket and rear axle varies throughout the suspension's travel. This requires a sprung <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner,</b> similar to a rear derailleur, to be used. Only relatively uncommon frame designs with single pivots that are concentric with the bottom bracket allow the use of more desirable static <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners.</b> Another consideration is the generally increased amount of pedalling while standing up that is inherent to single speed mountain biking, which increases losses from suspension bob and squat. Therefore, full suspension mountain bikes are fairly rare, with hardtails and rigid bikes being much more common.|$|R
5000|$|Distinctive {{components}} made by Surly {{include the}} Dingle cog, cranksets with separately detachable spiders, a reversible <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner,</b> and the [...] "Large Marge," [...] {{one of the}} first production fatbike rims. Surly also sells lifestyle items such as wool jerseys and flasks bearing the Surly logo.|$|R
25|$|Less {{common is}} the use of a double or triple {{chainring}} in conjunction with an internally geared hub, extending the gear range without having to fit multiple sprockets to the hub. However, this does require a <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> of some sort, negating some of the advantages of hub gears.|$|R
50|$|The {{brake discs}} were {{increased}} {{in size to}} aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners</b> were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, {{with the addition of}} a thermostatically controlled fan.|$|R
50|$|The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> was {{hydraulic}} tensioned and had {{a ratchet}} mechanism to keep the <b>chain</b> tight. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> rode on one pivoting chain guide resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> guide in between the camshaft sprockets. The <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> was lubricated via cast-off {{from the top of}} the cylinder head and one 'squirter' on the oil pump housing. The SOHC and DOHC engines used different <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> sets.|$|R
50|$|In {{keeping with}} the {{evolutionary}} development of the Boxer line, the engine was a longitudinal opposed 2-cylinder boxer engine with lower camshaft and overhead valves. Driving the camshaft was a duplex (later simplex) chain with a spring-loaded <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner.</b> The clutch was a single dry plate with cable actuation. A 5-speed manual transmission, with an optional kickstarter for the early models, and shaft drive to the rear wheel completed the drivetrain.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{derailleur}} serves double duty: moving the chain between rear sprockets and taking up chain slack caused by {{moving to a}} smaller sprocket at the rear or a smaller chainring by the front derailleur. In order to accomplish this second task, it is positioned {{in the path of}} the bottom, slack portion of chain. Sometimes the rear-derailleurs are re-purposed as <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners</b> for single-speed bicycles that cannot adjust chain tension by a different method.|$|R
50|$|Some systems combine {{internally}} geared hubs {{with external}} derailleurs. A freewheeling hub with a sprocket suitable for narrow chain {{can be combined}} with a double or triple crankset and front derailleur, {{in order to provide}} a wider range and closer gear ratio spacing. A <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> or a rear derailleur is needed to take up chain slack, and care is needed not to over-torque the hub by using too small a chainring/sprocket ratio.|$|R
50|$|The changes {{extended}} to the engine where Honda's late 1970s issues with cam chains were dealt with via the introduction of an automatic tensioner replacing the manual version on the earlier models. Other changes also meant that the standard valve clearances were reduced, possibly through tighter manufacturing control. Sports model engines are identifiable via {{the lack of a}} cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> bolt and the revised valve covers which feature black painted stripes and satin alloy flat areas.|$|R
40|$|Development of {{combustion}} engines {{can be characterized}} by continuous {{increase in the number}} of computational simulations being applied in all areas. There is a clear trend to use chain or belt drives for the design of timing drives. Computational simulation of these drives has not been developing too long due to high demands on the computational technology. The paper focuses on simulation of dynamics of the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> drive with the use of a multi-body system. A mass-produced four cylinder in-line engine with two camshafts and two valves per cylinder has been used as a computational model. Key words: chain drive, four cylinder in-line engine, contact force, <b>tensioner,</b> <b>chain</b> stiffnes...|$|R
50|$|Built to {{celebrate}} the centenary of Jaguar's founder, 500 'XKR 100' coupes and convertibles combined total were made in 2002. The XKR 100 featured all the available optionals and an Anthracite paint finish, Recaro seats, 20-inch BBS alloy wheels, Brembo brakes, specific dark wood dashboard panels and GPS.As it was produced only after 2001 all the engines were fitted with upgraded metal <b>chain</b> <b>tensioners</b> and fuel pump, solving the common engine failures due to the weakness of plastic and semi-plastic tensioners.|$|R
50|$|The cam lobes act {{directly}} on bucket type tappets, which are adjusted {{by means of}} shims between {{the underside of the}} bucket and the top of the valves. Two duplex chains drive the camshafts, one from the crankshaft to a sprocket {{at the level of the}} combustion chambers, and one from the sprocket to each camshaft. The original sprung slipper design of the lower cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> proved to be too weak and after a couple of years was changed to an improved hydraulic design, using engine oil pressure.|$|R
50|$|Single-speed bicycle {{builders}} have converted {{many former}} multi-geared cycles into single or fixed speed through {{the removal of}} the derailleurs and associated hardware. The simplest conversion uses the existing freewheel/cassette and crankset, the chain being cut to fit the desired gear ratio. However this retains unnecessary weight and the chainline will most likely not be perfect. A more thorough conversion will involve replacing the freewheel with a single-speed one, and re-dishing the rear wheel. On bicycles with vertical dropouts, a <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> is often required to allow the correct tension on the resulting shorter chain.|$|R

50|$|The VH41DE {{also used}} a double row <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> {{compared}} to the VH45DE that used a single row <b>timing</b> <b>chain.</b> Its alternator is also located {{at the top of}} the engine which creates an overall narrower engine package which can be handy in engine conversions where it may otherwise foul on the chassis rails.|$|R
50|$|A <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> {{also called}} a sync chain, {{is used on}} tandem bicycles, to {{synchronize}} crank movement between the captain (front rider) and stoker (rear rider). As with auto engines, proper tension of the <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> is necessary to prevent premature wear of the drivetrain components. Tension is adjusted {{by means of an}} eccentric bottom bracket.|$|R
50|$|To {{maintain}} the necessary {{tension on the}} <b>timing</b> <b>chain,</b> many tandems use an eccentric that {{is placed in the}} front rider's bottom bracket shell. An alternate solution is to implement a pulley, or idler, {{on the bottom of the}} <b>timing</b> <b>chain</b> to take up slack. Idlers add friction and a potential point of failure to the drive train.|$|R

50|$|Manufactured from 1987 to 1996 in the USA to late 1999 in {{the rest}} of the world, the Hurricane went through only three major revisions. In 1989, the bike {{received}} a cosmetic makeover with a complete redesign of the front fairing, improvements to the bike's front suspension, larger tyres were added to help cope with the bike's heavy weight and to accommodate radial tyres, improvements were also added to the bike's cam <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner</b> in an attempt to remove the annoying cam chain rattle some riders had reported. The 1989 model also had its power slightly increased, and it gained weight.|$|R
50|$|Rear {{vertical}} dropouts {{have the}} slot facing downwards. The {{advantage is that}} the wheel axle cannot slip forward compared with horizontal dropouts. The disadvantage is that on a bicycle without a rear derailleur but with vertical dropouts, the chain tension cannot be adjusted by moving the wheel forwards or backwards, and needs another means of chain-tensioning, by a derailleur, <b>chain</b> <b>tensioner,</b> or eccentric bottom bracket or rear hub. Fixed wheel bicycles cannot use any form of chain tensioning device, because the lower run of chain is pulled very tight when using the transmission as a brake.|$|R
