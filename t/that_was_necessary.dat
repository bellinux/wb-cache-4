5|$|The Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act, first {{tentative}} {{draft in}} 1925 and fifth final version in 1932, {{was a result}} of work by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. It was argued that the traffic in narcotic drugs should have the same safeguards and the same regulation in all of the states. The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed the Harrison Act in 1914 and the Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary.</b> The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power in regard to seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or in regard to punishment of those responsible. The act was recommended to the states for that purpose. As a result of the Uniform State Narcotic Act, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics encouraged state governments to adopt the act. By the middle of the 1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis.|$|E

25|$|Construction resumed on May 18, 1922, and entailed the {{construction}} of an island platform between the two cast iron-lined tunnels, a mezzanine, and a station entrance, which required excavation from the street. On June 11, 1924, the Lawrence Street station opened with the Lawrence Street entrances; the Bridge Street entrances opened later. A special train to Prospect Park operated for the station's opening. A unique feature at the west end of the station was a folding platform edge <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to clear a crossover switch that was partially underneath the platform.|$|E
25|$|After the Pennsylvania State Capitol {{building}} {{burned to}} ground in 1897, plans were drawn up {{to improve and}} expand the park that surrounds the Capitol building. The plans were for a more impressive Capitol building that would prevent other Pennsylvania cities like Philadelphia from challenging Harrisburg's claim as {{the seat of the}} state government. After the land <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> for the expansion was acquired in 1916, Arnold Brunner was hired to design the plans for the construction and landscaping of the new buildings. Planning was interrupted by World War I.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} land was the {{dominant}} election issue: The business strategy of the Canterbury Association was to sell land at a price that was sufficient to finance all the development <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> for the new settlement. The other two candidates, James FitzGerald and Henry Tancred, were therefore both proponents of a high land price. Campbell {{on the other hand}} was in favour of setting a low price for land outside the Canterbury Block. Hence there was a real possibility that vote splitting would result in neither Tancred nor FitzGerald being elected.|$|E

25|$|Cellars {{have always}} been much more {{important}} in Continental Europe than in the United Kingdom, and especially in Germany almost all houses and apartment blocks have been and still are built with cellars. For this reason, air-raid precautions during World War II in Germany could be much more readily implemented by the authorities than was possible in the UK. All <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> was to ascertain that cellars were being prepared to accommodate all the residents of a building; that all the cellar hatch and window protections were in place; that access to the cellars was safe {{in the event of}} an air raid; that once inside, the occupants were secure for any incidents other than direct hits during the air raid; and that means of escape in case of a real emergency were easily available.|$|E

25|$|The German Navy was for Germany mainly an {{instrument}} for putting political pressure on Britain. Before the war, Germany would {{have been willing to}} cease or moderate its naval competition with Britain but only in return for a promise of its neutrality in any European conflict. Hitler attempted the same thing by different methods, but he saw only one side of the picture like other German politicians. It is clear from his writings that he was enormously impressed with the part played by the prewar naval rivalry in creating bad {{relations between the two countries}}. Thus, he argued that the removal of this rivalry all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to obtain good relations. By making a free gift of an absence of naval competition, he hoped that relations between the two countries would be so improved that Britain should not, in fact, find it necessary to interfere with Germany's continental policy.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols {{carefully}} scouted out and {{spied on}} their enemies {{in advance of}} any invasion. Prior to the invasion of Europe, Batu and Subutai sent spies for almost ten years {{into the heart of}} Europe, making maps of the old Roman roads, establishing trade routes, and determining the level of ability of each principality to resist invasion. They made well-educated guesses as to the willingness of each principality to aid the others, and their ability to resist alone or together. Also, when invading an area, the Mongols would do all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to completely conquer the town or cities. Some tactics involved diverting rivers from the city/town , closing supplies to the city and waiting for its inhabitants to surrender, gathering civilians from the nearby areas to fill the front line for the city/town attack before scaling the wall, and pillaging the surrounding area and killing some of the people, then letting some survivors flee to the main city to report their losses to the main populace to weaken resistance, simultaneously draining the resources of the city with the sudden influx of refugees.|$|E

500|$|Although {{his father}} destined John for a {{clerical}} career, {{according to the}} late 13th-century Tales of the Minstrel of Reims he [...] "was unwilling". Instead, the minstrel continued, John fled to his maternal uncle at the Clairvaux Abbey. Encouraged by his fellows, he became a knight and earned a reputation in tournaments and fights. Although elements of the Tales of the Minstrel of Reims are apparently invented (for instance, John {{did not have a}} maternal uncle in Clairvaux), historian Guy Perry wrote that it may have preserved details of John's life. A church career was not unusual for youngest sons of 12th-century noblemen in France; however, if his father sent John to a monastery he left before reaching the age of taking monastic vows. John [...] "clearly developed the physique <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to fight well" [...] in his youth, because the 13th-century sources Akropolites and Salimbene di Adam emphasize his physical strength.|$|E
500|$|Another {{well-known}} duel in the American West {{happened in}} Fort Worth, Texas, and {{was known as}} the Luke Short-Jim Courtright Duel. Timothy Isaiah [...] "Longhair Jim" [...] Courtright was running the T.I.C. Commercial agency in Fort Worth, which provided [...] "protection" [...] to gambling dens and saloons in return for a portion of their profits. At the same time, Luke Short, a former friend of Courtright's, was running the White Elephant Saloon and Jim was trying to get Short to utilize his services. But the Dodge City gunfighter told Courtright to [...] "go to Hell," [...] that he could do anything <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> {{to take care of his}} business. On February 8, 1887, the two quarreled, and with Bat Masterson at Short's side, Courtright and Short dueled in the street. They drew their pistols at close range, and Short fired first, blowing off Courtright's thumb. Courtright attempted the [...] "border shift", a move where a gunfighter switches his gun to his uninjured hand, but he was too slow. Short shot him in the chest, killing him.|$|E
500|$|In each settlement, {{one of the}} Jesuits was {{responsible}} for church matters, while another dealt with commercial affairs and the general well-being of the community. As the Swiss priest, musician and architect Fr. Martin Schmid wrote in a 1744 letter from San Rafael: [...] The Jesuits administered labor, {{the introduction of new}} technologies, and the disposition of goods. They designated that each family receive all <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>necessary</b> to live. The Jesuits did not rely on donations, because by right the priests received a fixed income (usually insufficient for their needs) from the community to support their work. The thriving economy in the reductions enabled them to export surplus goods to all parts of Upper Peru, although ironically not to Paraguay – the region the Jesuits most wanted to reach. The income was used to pay royal tributes and to purchase goods not locally available, such as books, paper, and wine, {{from as far away as}} Europe. In the missions themselves money was not used. This laid the foundation of the belief that the Jesuits were guarding immense riches acquired through local labor. In reality the communities were economically successful but hardly constituted any important source of income for the Jesuit order.|$|E
