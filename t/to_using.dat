30|$|The {{empirical}} {{demonstration of the}} proposed model enabled to identify predictors that determine intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. Social influence has {{significant impact on the}} study participants’ behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. As social influence <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism increases, the behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it also increases. There is also strong positive association between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in the tourism. This shows that users are more interested to integrate ICT in their tourism activities when they think that such technologies will be helpful. The finding also showed significant positive relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. That means tourism organizations are motivated <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICTs when such technologies are easy <b>to</b> <b>use</b> letting them <b>to</b> have more time for other activities. There was significant association between cost effectiveness and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. Cost-effective ICT facilities are more preferable by tourism organizations. Moreover, there is significant relationship between competitive advantage and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. This suggests that users’ behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism increases when they believe that the technology will improve their competitive advantages over their counter parts. Besides, the research illustrated significant association between facilitating conditions and behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT in tourism. Tourism organizations’ behavioral intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ICT increases when facilitating conditions such as users’ experience, resources, and background ICT skill increases.|$|R
30|$|For marital status, the {{category}} of divorced/widowed/separated was positively associated with informal care.

For dual coverage, people with dual insurance coverage were more likely <b>to</b> <b>use</b> informal care than those with only UCS insurance. Lastly, chronic status was negatively related to informal care. Beneficiaries without any defined chronic/congenital diseases tended <b>to</b> <b>use</b> informal care, while those with a defined chronic/congenital disease tended <b>to</b> <b>use</b> designated facility care.|$|R
