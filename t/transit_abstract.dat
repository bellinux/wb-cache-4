Based on the summary of the related research results, the service networks are divided into two classes as the matrix type and the network type according to the different construction methods. The modeling principles and methods of the network type service network are then proposed. The methods are explained in three aspects including node modeling, segment (or arc) modeling, and partial network modeling, which can, for a certain physical network and a certain line plan, construct the virtual service network that is required by the passenger flow assignment process. Corresponding modifications are required when using these methods in specific researches. Service network, which is constructed based on the line plan or timetable, is virtual and {{does not exist in}} the real world. It can show transfer paths and travel costs to passengers as well as fully record the travel procedure of passengers with the paths on it. The points on the service network can represent real stations and behaviors of passengers and trains (e. g., for passengers: enter/leave a station, begin to wait for a train, begin to transfer; for trains: arrive at a station, leave a station) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} India’s behaviour as {{a foreign}} policy actor by looking at India’s changing relations {{over the past decade}} with the EU, US, China, Japan, Myanmar, Pakistan, Nepal and, in a historical departure, the former princely state of Sikkim. It argues that though India has almost always been a normative actor, Indian foreign policy is today <b>transiting</b> from <b>abstract,</b> and frequently ‘unrealpolitik,’ views of what constitutes normative behaviour. India’s ‘Look East’ policy has been the cornerstone of this transition, indicating that economic growth, maritime capability and peace and stability in its neighbourhood are key goals of India’s present behaviour as a normative foreign policy actor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Transiting</b> planet discoveries {{have largely}} been {{restricted}} to the short-period or low-periastron distance regimes due to the bias inherent in the geometric transit probability. Through the refinement of planetary orbital parameters, and hence reducing the size of transit windows, long-period planets become feasible targets for photometric follow-up. Here we describe the TERMS project that is monitoring these host stars at predicted transit times. 1...|$|R

Strong near-IR bands should support detection of water vapor via G 141 spectroscopy of the bright star HD 209458 (H= 6. 13) by comparing in- and out-of-transit ratios of in- and out-of-band spectral intensity ratios. The reduction and analysis of science observations in which the goal is to support 1 part in 10, 000, or better, development of spectral diagnostics using NICMOS grism-based spectroscopy is discussed. 1...|$|R

Transit spectroscopy probes the transition region between the day and night sides, called limb. We present a re-analysis of existing HST/STIS transmission spectra of HD 209458 bs atmosphere.

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Transits</b> of Mercury and Venus {{across the}} face of the Sun are rare. The 20 th century had 15 transits of Mercury and the 21 st century will have 14, the two most recent {{occuring}} on 15 November 1999 and 7 May 2003. We report on our observations and analyses of a blackdrop effect at the 1999 and 2003 transits of Mercury seen in high spatial resolution optical imaging with NASA’s Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) spacecraft. We have separated the primary contributors to this effect, solar limb darkening and broadening due to the instrumental point spread function, for the 1999 event. The observations are important for understanding historical observations of transits of Venus, which in the 18 th and 19 th centuries were basic for the determination of the scale of the solar system. Our observations are in preparation fo...|$|R
40|$|Transport {{policies}} {{have changed over}} the past sixty-three years since {{the reconstruction of the}} Austrian Republic in 1945. This thesis analyses transport and associated concerns in all government declarations and agreements as well as summarisations of several concepts for transport policy. Furthermore, this paper tries to emphasise differences in political intentions embedded in a changing political and economic environment. Thereby, particular attention is turned to funding aspects of constructing and maintaining infrastructure. Whereas reconstruction and guaranteeing transport services in all regions dominated political objectives in the early years, balancing budgets and preserving habitat and anthroposphere have become more important since the late eighties. European transport policy has also increased its influence as Austria finally joined the European Union in 1995. Since then, the national political activity has to deal with the loss of autonomy versus <b>transit</b> purposes.

40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Transiting</b> {{planets are}} {{generally}} {{close enough to}} their host stars that tides may govern their orbital and thermal evolution of these planets. We present calculations of the tidal evolution of recently discovered transiting planets and discuss their implications. The tidal heating that accompanies this orbital evolution can be so great that it controls the planet’s physical properties and may explain the large radii observed in several cases, including, for example, TrES- 4. Also because a planet’s transit probability depends on its orbit, it evolves due to tides. Current values depend sensitively on the physical properties of the star and planet, {{as well as on}} the system’s age. As a result, tidal effects may introduce observational biases in transit surveys, which may already be evident in current observations. Transiting planets tend to be younger than non-transiting planets, an indication that tidal evolution may have destroyed many close-in planets. Also the distribution of the masses of transiting planets may constrain the orbital inclinations of non-transiting planets...|$|R
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Transit</b> Node Routing (TNR) is a {{fast and}} exact {{distance}} oracle for road networks. We show several new results for TNR. First, we give a surprisingly simple implementation fully based on Contraction Hierarchies that speeds up preprocessing by {{an order of}} magnitude approaching the time for just finding a Contraction Hierarchies (which alone has two orders of magnitude larger query time). We also develop a very effective purely graph theoretical locality filter without any compromise in query times. Finally, we show that a specialization to the online many-to-one (or one-to-many) shortest path further speeds up query time by {{an order of magnitude}}. This variant even has better query time than the fastest known previous methods which need much more space. 1 Introduction and Related Work Route planning in road networks has seen a lot of results from the algorithm engineering community in recent years. With Dijkstra’s seminal algorithm being the baseline, a number of techniques preprocess the static input graph to achieve drastic speedups. Contraction Hierarchies (CH) [1, 2] is a speedup-technique that has a convenient trade-off between preprocessing effort and query efficiency. Road network with millions of node...|$|R
40|$|<b>Abstract.</b> <b>Transit</b> {{oriented}} developments (TODs) are master planned communities {{constructed to}} reduce the dependence on the private car and promote the modes of transport such as public transport, walking and cycling, which are presumed by many transport professionals to be more sustainable. This paper tests this assumption that TOD is a more sustainable form of development than traditional development, with respect to travel demand, by conducting travel surveys for a case study TOD and comparing the travel characteristics of TOD residents with the travel characteristics of residents of Brisbane, Australia who live in non TOD suburbs. The results of a household comparison showed that the Kelvin Grove Urban Village (KGUV) households had slightly smaller household size, lower vehicle and bicycle ownership compared to Brisbane Statistical Division (BSD), Brisbane’s inner north and inner south suburbs. The comparison of average trip characteristics showed that on an average KGUV residents undertook fewer trips on the given travel day (2. 6 trips/person) compared to BSD (3. 1 trips/person), Brisbane Inner North Suburbs (BINS) (3. 6 trips/person) and Brisbane Inner South Suburbs (BISS) (3. 5 trips/person) residents. The mode share comparison indicated that KGUV residents used more public transport and made more walk-only trips in comparison to BSD, BINS and BISS residents. Overall, 72. 4 percent of KGUV residents used a sustainable mode of transport for their travel on a typical weekday. On the other hand, only 17. 4 percent, 22. 2 percent and 24. 4 percent residents of BSD, BINS and BISS used sustainable modes of transport for this travel. Th...|$|R
