5|$|As well as {{producing}} electricity, <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> {{is intended}} to increase the Yangtze River's shipping capacity and reduce the potential for floods downstream by providing flood storage space. China regards the project as monumental {{as well as a}} success socially and economically, with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines, and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> flooded archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3million people, and is causing significant ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> has been controversial both domestically and abroad.|$|E
5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care {{had to be}} taken to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock and the structure of <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E
5|$|Construction of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> {{started in}} 1919 and was {{finished}} in 1923, {{with the first}} water delivered in 1934 after numerous delays. From 1935–38 <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> was raised to increase its capacity for water supply and power generation. <b>The</b> <b>dam,</b> aqueduct and appurtenant hydroelectric systems are collectively known as the Hetch Hetchy Project. Deriving from a largely wild and pristine area of the Sierra Nevada, the Hetch Hetchy supply {{is some of the}} cleanest municipal water in the US, requiring only primary filtration and disinfection.|$|E
50|$|In 1987 <b>the</b> <b>dams,</b> and all <b>the</b> {{assets of}} Crown Zellerbach, were {{acquired}} by the James River Corporation, which owned <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> until 2000. Concerned that it might someday be required to remove <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> and pay for river restoration, the corporation, sought to transfer <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> to <b>the</b> federal government. In February 2000, the government bought <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> and related facilities for $29.5 million. Until removal, <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> had been operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, with National Park Service oversight. When the federal government purchased <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> in 2000, it freed the James River Corporation from any further liability related to {{the damage caused by}} <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> in <b>the</b> past or potentially in the future.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Baath <b>Dam</b> is one {{of three}} <b>dams</b> on <b>the</b> Syrian Euphrates, the other two being <b>the</b> Tabqa <b>Dam,</b> and <b>the</b> Tishrin <b>Dam</b> 80 km south of the Syro-Turkish border. Like <b>the</b> Baath <b>Dam,</b> <b>the</b> Tishrin <b>Dam</b> is also {{functionally}} related to <b>the</b> Tabqa <b>Dam.</b> Construction of <b>the</b> Tishrin <b>Dam</b> was partly motivated by the disappointing performance of the hydroelectric power station in <b>the</b> Tabqa <b>Dam.</b> Before <b>the</b> civil war, Syria had plans to construct a fourth <b>dam</b> - <b>the</b> Halabiye <b>Dam</b> - on <b>the</b> Euphrates, downstream from <b>the</b> Baath <b>Dam.</b>|$|R

5|$|Except for the locks, <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> {{project was}} {{completed}} and fully functional as of July 4, 2012, {{when the last}} of the main water turbines in the underground plant began production. The ship lift was complete in December 2015. Each main water turbine has a capacity of 700MW. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> body was completed in 2006. Coupling the dam's 32 main turbines with two smaller generators (50MW each) to power the plant itself, the total electric generating capacity of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> is 22,500MW.|$|E
5|$|Fargo {{developed}} {{new methods}} {{for construction of}} earth embankment dams on foundations of soft soils, which made use of hydraulic sluicing. <b>The</b> <b>dam</b> was built during the summer, between 25 June and 3 September 1907. The powerhouse and spillway sections of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> were completed first, and used conventional contemporary engineering designs.|$|E
5|$|Hetch Hetchy {{represented}} {{the first great}} environmental controversy in the US, and debate over <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> and reservoir continues today. Preservationist {{groups such as the}} Sierra Club lobby for the restoration of the valley, while others argue that leaving <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> in place would be the better economic and environmental decision.|$|E
3000|$|The {{landslides}} {{caused the}} streambeds {{to be elevated}} from 4 to 30  m forming <b>the</b> <b>dams.</b> <b>The</b> landslide lakes diminished in size over one to several years through stream incision into <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> and sediment infilling. <b>The</b> longest-lived <b>dam</b> persisted for up to 20  years. For two <b>dams,</b> incision into <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> lowered <b>the</b> lake levels by {{about half of the}} total depth, while the remainder of the water in the basins was displaced by sediment infilling. After the lakes drain, the sediment accumulations behind <b>the</b> <b>dams</b> can persist for decades. The stability analyses overpredicted unstable conditions which is  inconsistent with the observed longterm persistence of <b>the</b> <b>dams.</b>|$|R

Electricity generation equipment is located between Driekloof Dam and Kilburn <b>Dam.</b> Since <b>the</b> Driekloof Dam/Sterkfontein <b>Dam</b> also forms part of the Tugela-Vaal Water Project some of the water pumped to Driekloof Dam might end up flowing to <b>the</b> Vaal <b>Dam</b> and not be available for return to <b>the</b> Kilburn <b>Dam.</b> <b>The</b> Woodstock <b>Dam</b> and Driel Barrage are used to supply this additional water to Kilburn Dam when required.|$|R
5|$|In 1927, when Syria was a French mandate, it was {{proposed}} {{to build a}} dam in the Euphrates near the Syro–Turkish border. After Syria became independent in 1946, the feasibility of this proposal was re-investigated, but the plan was not carried out. In 1957, the Syrian government reached {{an agreement with the}} Soviet Union for technical and financial aid {{for the construction of a}} dam in the Euphrates. Syria, as part of the United Arab Republic (UAR), signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 for a loan to finance the construction of <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> After Syria left the UAR in 1961, a new agreement about the financing of <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> was reached with the Soviet Union in 1965. A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction of <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> In the early 1960s Swedish geomorphologist Åke Sundborg worked as advisor in <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> project with the task of estimating the amount and fate of sediments that would enter into <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> Sundborg developed for this purpose a mathematical model on the prognosed growth of a river delta in <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b>|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma {{set up the}} Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA) on January 10, 1935. Eventually, on September 18, 1937, {{with the}} help of Oklahoma Representative Wesley E. Disney, Senator Elmer Thomas and {{engineer}} W. R. Holway, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved $20 million in funding through the New Deal's Public Works Administration for <b>the</b> <b>dam.</b> The higher cost for <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> was attributed to a project that was approved for additional purposes, including hydroelectric power generation and recreation. Additional costs for <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> were covered by the state government and by GRDA municipal bond auctions which appropriated or raised $11 million. Disney had pushed much of the legislation for <b>the</b> <b>dam,</b> comparing the higher electric utility rates in Oklahoma compared to other states. Senator Thomas helped appropriate additional state and public funding for <b>the</b> <b>dam</b> while also being instrumental in its legislation.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 1931, the Bureau {{made the}} bid {{documents}} available to interested parties, at five dollars a copy.
