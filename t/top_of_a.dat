5|$|Battlements {{were most}} often found surmounting curtain {{walls and the}} tops of gatehouses, and {{comprised}} several elements: crenellations, hoardings, machicolations, and loopholes. Crenellation is the collective name for alternating crenels and merlons: gaps and solid blocks on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wall. Hoardings were wooden constructs that projected beyond the wall, allowing defenders to shoot at, or drop objects on, attackers {{at the base of}} the wall without having to lean perilously over the crenellations, thereby exposing themselves to retaliatory fire. Machicolations were stone projections on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wall with openings that allowed objects to be dropped on an enemy {{at the base of the}} wall in a similar fashion to hoardings.|$|E

5|$|A medal {{ceremony}} is held after each Olympic event is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> three-tiered rostrum {{to be awarded}} their respective medals. After the medals are given out by an IOC member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country plays. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.|$|E

5|$|Although {{presented}} in two-dimensional side-scrolling format, the game retains the action-oriented approach of its predecessors, with the player controlling the character Kratos {{in the same}} combination of combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements. Platforming elements include jumping across chasms, climbing ladders, and swinging on ropes. Some puzzles require Kratos to move a box on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> switch (thus activating it), or moving a box {{to use it as}} a jumping-off point to reach a pathway unreachable with normal jumping. Game length is approximately two to four hours, and it consists of ten levels.|$|E
5|$|An {{assortment}} of unusual sculptures are {{scattered around the}} park, including: Still Water, a massive horse head lapping up water; Jelly Baby Family, a family of giant Jelly Babies standing on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large black cube; and Vroom Vroom, which resembles a giant human hand pushing a toy car along the ground. The sculptor Jacob Epstein constructed several works in Hyde Park. His memorial to the author William Henry Hudson, featuring his character Rima caused public outrage when it was unveiled in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Bobby Roode, who was {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore, fought Lance Hoyt in the following encounter. D'Amore interfered in the contest several times by distracting Hoyt, the referee, or aiding Roode in some way. Roode won the bout after performing his signature Northern Lariat maneuver at 7 minutes and 24 seconds. After the bout, Hoyt performed a backflip splash from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> padded turnbuckle onto a prone D'Amore in the ring.|$|E

Modern composers for percussion have sometimes used the temple bell to replace the now common sound of the orchestral tam-tam.|$|E

It crosses Boyer Creek as 76 Road and enters the hamlet of Speedsville, a small community located on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mountain. Here, CR115 turns to the northwest to run along the base of a valley surrounding Boyer Creek. The creek reaches its source at an intersection with Yaple Road; however, CR115 continues northwestward to serve the hamlet of Caroline Center.|$|E

5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between thick and thin lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E

5|$|During the American Revolution, {{the road}} was an {{important}} artery over which the British and the colonists fought. In January 1777, the colonists brought a cannon to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hill and fired at the British. The hill, now inside Woodlawn Cemetery, was locally called Gun Hill afterwards. The road was known as Kingsbridge Road (part of the original Boston Post Road) until 1875, when it was renamed Gun Hill Road. It did not originally extend east of White Plains Road but was extended by segments to the Hutchinson River, by 1938.|$|E

The town and surrounding areas suffered bombing by the Luftwaffe. V1 flying bombs fell on the town between June 1944 and March 1945. The first recorded bombing using a V1 was on 22 June 1944 at 07:00, when the bomb passed over the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bus and hit four houses nearby.

5|$|Entoloma murrayi, {{commonly}} known as the yellow unicorn Entoloma or the unicorn pinkgill, is a species of fungus in the Entolomataceae family. First described from New England (USA) in 1859, the species is found in eastern North America, Central and South America, and southeast Asia, where it grows on the ground in wet coniferous and deciduous forests. The fungus produces yellow mushrooms that have a characteristic sharp umbo on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conical cap. The mushroom is inedible and may be poisonous. Other similar species can be distinguished from E.murrayi by differences in color, morphology, or microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Even {{more complex}} {{morphological}} changes are sometimes possible. For example, when starved of amino acids, Myxobacteria detect surrounding cells {{in a process}} known as quorum sensing, migrate towards each other, and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500micrometres long and containing approximately 100,000 bacterial cells. In these fruiting bodies, the bacteria perform separate tasks; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation. For example, about one in ten cells migrate to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fruiting body and differentiate into a specialised dormant state called a myxospore, which is more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions.|$|E
