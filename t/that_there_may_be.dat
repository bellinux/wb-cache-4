The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E
5|$|However, {{justiciability}} is {{a concept}} that eludes precise categorization or definition, and this has caused disquiet amongst some critics.

Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E
5|$|Seven offered Johns the 10.30pm Thursday timeslot, which Johns had {{the option}} of declining owing to a clause in his contract.

Consequently, Johns declined the offer and sat out 2011 on full pay. It has also been suggested that success of The Matty Johns Show depended on the success of related AFL show The Bounce, which failed in 2010. The future of The Matty Johns Show is currently unclear.|$|E

5|$|The {{texts and}} artwork of Jainism show Indra as a dancer, {{although}} not identical but generally resembling the dancing Shiva artwork found in Hinduism, particularly {{in their respective}} mudras. For example, in the Jain caves at Ellora, extensive carvings show dancing Indra next to the images of Tirthankaras {{in a manner similar}} to Shiva Nataraja.

5|$|Anderson admits <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> death metal {{influences}} in the vocals, but {{says that it}} was not a conscious design, and that the music does not have any other similarities to death metal. He claims that there are no black metal influences. He says that describing Celestiial's music as folk is a bad idea, as folk is such a broad, vague description as to make it meaningless. He says that what he is creating is neither folk, nor traditional, and even the harp songs are not traditional works, though they are influenced by the traditional music of the United Kingdom and traditional Irish music.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{do not possess}} an {{intrinsic}} interest in freedom. Therefore, owning or using nonhuman animals is not, in itself, unjust. This aspect of his thought has generated responses by others, including the political theorist Robert Garner and the philosopher John Hadley, who argue <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> reasons to claim that nonhuman animals do possess an interest in freedom. Cochrane has also proposed a cosmopolitan alternative to Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's picture of a political animal rights, explicated in their 2011 book Zoopolis. Though Donaldson and Kymlicka have defended their account against Cochrane's criticism, they {{have said that they}} welcome attempts to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own. Cochrane's other research focusses variously on bioethics, punishment, just war and human rights.|$|E

5|$|More common, {{but still}} infrequent, is a {{conjunction}} of a planet (especially, but not only, Mercury or Venus) {{at the time of}} a total solar eclipse, in which event the planet will be visible very near the eclipsed Sun, when without the eclipse it would have been lost in the Sun's glare. At one time, some scientists hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a planet (often given the name Vulcan) even closer to the Sun than Mercury; the only way to confirm its existence would have been to observe it in transit or during a total solar eclipse. No such planet was ever found, and general relativity has since explained the observations that led astronomers to suggest that Vulcan might exist.|$|E
5|$|Subject matter. First, the {{justiciability}} of {{an issue}} depends on the subject matter at hand and not the source of decision-making power. This was the principle stated in GCHQ and reiterated in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Where the executive has the best access to available materials, its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive. It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> matters of fact not {{in the public domain}} which may be known only to the executive. Where sensitive facts are concerned, Singapore's adversarial system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial. Furthermore, not all pertinent facts might be presented before the court.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{function}} of various patterns of animal coloration {{that have been}} called countershading has been debated by zoologists such as Hannah Rowland (2009), with the suggestion <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> multiple functions including flattening and background matching when viewed from the side; background matching when viewed from above or below, implying separate colour schemes for {{the top and bottom}} surfaces; outline obliteration from above; and a variety of largely untested non-camouflage theories. A related mechanism, counter-illumination, adds the creation of light by bioluminescence or lamps to match the actual brightness of a background. Counter-illumination camouflage is common in marine organisms such as squid. It has been studied up to the prototype stage for military use in ships and aircraft, but it too has rarely or never been used in warfare.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} named after Spica, a binary star system in the {{constellation}} Virgo {{and one of the}} brightest stars in the nighttime sky. It appears as one star because of the relatively low center-to-center distance between the two component stars, estimated at an average of 11 million miles (17.7 million km). Astronomical observations also suggest <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> additional stars in the Spica system. In the story, Asumi mentions Spica's distance to Earth as 350 light-years. This figure is also cited by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; however, other sources indicate a distance of approximately 260 light-years.|$|E

5|$|A lead {{scientist}} for a pharmaceutical company is {{killed by a}} blue powder that turns his bones into dust. The Fringe division traces {{the source of the}} package which contained the powder to a former Marine; when they search his home, Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds the man nearby and gives chase, but the man is hit by a car and knocked into a coma. Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind to learn of any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable to control his telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being able to read the mind of Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering if he still feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E

5|$|Acts of Congress are {{the supreme}} {{law of the}} land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while {{treaties}} are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty-making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found.|$|E
5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{about the number}} of species in the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch taxonomist Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> as many as 100 species in the genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin {{is rapidly}} dephosphorylated {{in the body}} to psilocin, which is a partial agonist for several {{serotonin}} receptors, which are also known as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the human brain, and with a slightly lower affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor. Psilocin binds with low affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, including 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D. Serotonin receptors are located in numerous parts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, and {{are involved in a}} wide range of functions, including regulation of mood and motivation. The psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimicking) effects of psilocin can be blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by the 5-HT2A antagonist drug ketanserin. Various lines of evidence have shown that interactions with non-5-HT2 receptors also contribute to the subjective and behavioral effects of the drug. For example, psilocin indirectly increases the concentration of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the basal ganglia, and some psychotomimetic symptoms of psilocin are reduced by haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist. Taken together, these suggest <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> an indirect dopaminergic contribution to psilocin's psychotomimetic effects. Unlike LSD, which binds to D2-like dopamine receptors in addition to having strong affinity for several 5-HT receptors, psilocybin and psilocin have no affinity for the dopamine D2 receptors.|$|E
