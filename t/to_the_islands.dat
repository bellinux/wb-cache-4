Building work across the Scilly Isles continued, expanding to include the neighbouring island of St Mary's, and at least 540 oak trees from South Wales were dispatched <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> in early 1550, since the islands lacked suitable sources of timber of their own. Orders were given in 1551 to send bows, arrows and the ingredients required to make gunpowder <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands,</b> where construction teams were kept at work through to the end of 1552.|$|E

50|$|Under communism, access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> was {{restricted}} {{due to its}} proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Austrian border and the only access bridge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> was guarded by soldiers.

5|$|There {{are various}} {{important}} prehistoric structures, {{many of which}} pre-date the first written references <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> by Roman and Greek authors. In the historic period the earliest known settlers were Picts {{to the north and}} Gaels in the southern kingdom of Dál Riada prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> becoming part of the Suðreyjar kingdom of the Norse, who ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by various clan chiefs, principally the MacLeans, MacLeods and MacDonalds. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in recent years that population levels have ceased to decline.|$|E
50|$|From {{the port}} of Oslob, there are various boats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b> Another route <b>to</b> Sumilon Island is via Dumaguete City since it is also close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island.</b>|$|R

50|$|Selbjørn is {{connected}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neighboring <b>islands</b> of Stolmen and Huftarøy by the Stolma Bridge {{on the west}} side of <b>the</b> <b>island</b> and <b>the</b> Selbjørn Bridge on the northeast side. The municipality of Austevoll is not connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of Norway by any roads, so one must take a ferry from the mainland of Bergen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Huftarøy or take a ferry from <b>the</b> large <b>island</b> of Stord <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> of Huftarøy. <b>The</b> ferry from Bergen stops at Hufthammar on the north takes about 35 minutes <b>to</b> get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> and <b>the</b> ferry from Stord stops at Husavik and takes about 25 minutes.

5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds {{were brought to the}} site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was not protected from the predators that had been introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00UTC on August5, the CPHC {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm watch for the island of Hawaii; forecasts issued by the NHC as early as August2 illustrated the possibility of Iselle tracking over or {{in the vicinity of}} the Hawaiian archipelago. As the hurricane tracked closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands,</b> watches were extended as far westward as Oahu. The first hurricane warning associated with Iselle was issued on August6 for Hawaii County. Later that day, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Oahu. By early on August7, the tropical storm warning was extended to include Kauai, placing all of the main Hawaiian islands under some form of tropical cyclone warning. The potential for flooding also resulted in the issuance of a flash flood watch for the entirety the island chain. By August9, all warnings were lifted as Iselle no longer posed a threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b>|$|E
50|$|Under the English many {{surnames}} introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> were {{translated into}} Manx, while many indigenous Manx surnames became Anglicised. Immigration from Ireland brought Hiberno-Norman surnames <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> as well.|$|R

5|$|Before, during, {{and after}} the Second World War, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were {{suspected}} by many in government and society of being Nazi sympathisers. In 1937, they visited Germany and met Adolf Hitler. In 1940, the Duke was appointed governor of the Bahamas, and the couple moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> until he relinquished the office in 1945.|$|E
5|$|British {{aircraft}} received fighter {{control from}} warships in San Carlos Water, although its effectiveness was limited by their being stationed close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands,</b> which severely limited {{the effectiveness of}} their radar. The differences in tactics and training between 800 Squadron and 801 Squadron has been a point of criticism, suggesting that the losses of several ships were preventable had Sea Harriers from Hermes been used more effectively.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, the Spanish Crown {{had lost}} most of its {{possessions}} in the Americas. Two of its remaining possessions were Puerto Rico and Cuba, {{both of which were}} demanding more autonomy and had pro-independence movements. The Spanish Crown issued the Royal Decree of Graces (Real Cédula de Gracias) which was originated August 10, 1815, with the intention of attracting European settlers who were not of Spanish origin <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b>|$|E

50|$|White Bermudians or Bermudians of European descent are Bermudians whose ancestry {{lies within}} the {{continent}} of Europe, most notably the British Isles and Portugal. Initially, the White population of Bermuda made {{up the majority of}} <b>the</b> <b>island</b> who came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> as indentured servants. This remained the case until Black Slaves were taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island,</b> Free Blacks began <b>to</b> migrate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> during <b>the</b> 17th century. Many Scots and Irish were also brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> as white slaves and made up large pockets of the population. In the 19th century the Black population surpassed the white majority. Black Bermudian remains <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> largest ethnic group. A number of European Bermudians are foreign-born nationals, many are from the United States and Canada - due to its close proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>island</b> - as well as the United Kingdom (this may be because <b>the</b> <b>island</b> is a British Overseas Territory).|$|R
50|$|The Norwegian National Road 70 highway connects <b>the</b> <b>island</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Kristiansund {{and south}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mainland.

British administration was restored {{two months later}} {{at the end of}} the Falklands War. Most Falklanders favour the archipelago remaining a UK overseas territory, but its sovereignty status is part of an ongoing dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the ill-fated}} 1263 {{expedition}} of Haakon IV of Norway, the Outer Hebrides {{along with the}} Isle of Man, were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland {{a result of the}} 1266 Treaty of Perth. Although their contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> can still be found in personal and placenames, the archaeological record of the Norse period is very limited. The best known find from this time is the Lewis chessmen, which date from the mid 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Implicit in the {{decision}} to develop atomic bombs was the need to test them. The preferred site was the American Pacific Proving Grounds. As a fallback, sites in Canada and Australia were considered. In September 1950, the Admiralty suggested that the Monte Bello Islands in Australia might be suitable, so Attlee sent a request to the Prime Minister of Australia, Robert Menzies, for permission to send a survey party {{to have a look at}} the islands. Menzies agreed, and in November 1950, a three-man party headed by Air Vice Marshal E. D. Davis was sent out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands.</b> The Australian government formally agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>islands</b> being used in May 1951, and in December 1951 the new British government under Winston Churchill confirmed the choice of test site. On 26 February 1952 Churchill announced in the House of Commons that the first British atomic bomb test would occur in Australia before the end of the year.|$|E
