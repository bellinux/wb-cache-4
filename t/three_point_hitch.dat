50|$|Harry Ferguson {{applied for}} a British patent for his three-point hitch in 1926, a three-point {{attachment}} of the implement to the tractor and the simplest and the only statically determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering. The Ferguson-Brown Company produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor with a Ferguson-designed hydraulic hitch. In 1938 Ferguson entered into a collaboration with Henry Ford to produce the Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. The three-point hitch soon became the favorite hitch attachment system among farmers around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (PTO) shaft {{that could be used}} to power <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch</b> mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers. This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.|$|E
50|$|The Farmall H, {{produced}} from 1939 to 1954 (the last two model {{years it was}} sold as the Super H, but was the same basic tractor with a slightly larger engine and disc type brakes), became the number two selling tractor model of all time in North America with 420,011 sold, (the last 28,784 being Super H's). Only the Ford 8n (due primarily to Ford's much greater economies of scale, the fact it sold for a significantly lower price, in 1952 versus $2000 for the H the same year and to its exclusive Ferguson <b>Three</b> <b>Point</b> <b>Hitch</b> system) was a slightly better seller, at 524,076 sold. The Farmall H, however, {{was and still is}} the number one selling row crop tractor of all time.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the geometry of the hitch on the behaviour of the tractor and of the implement is theoretically analysed. Three-point hitches are compared to one-point hitches. In the vertical plane the possibility, when a three-point hitch is used, to position the virtual <b>hitch</b> <b>point</b> very low and very {{far ahead of the}} implement is found to be advantageous, together with its property to allow easy adjustment of the position of the virtual <b>hitch</b> <b>point.</b> In the horizontal plane, the tractional <b>hitch</b> <b>point</b> of a three-point hitch normally does not coincide with its directional <b>hitch</b> <b>point.</b> When a one-point hitch is used the tractional and the directional <b>hitch</b> <b>points</b> coincide. This very fundamental difference gives the three-point hitch some unique properties. Equations describing the angle deflection and the lateral deflection of both directional and non-directional implements are presented. They show that a non-directional implement's lateral deflection as well as its angle deflection when used on a hillside or when asymmetrically loaded, normally are much smaller when a three-point hitch is used than when a one-point hitch is used. An equation is also presented describing the return of an implement after a lateral deflection. The theory of a laterally mobile, but stable, front-mounted three-point hitch is presented...|$|R

The next size up {{is designed to}} be towed behind a garden tractor or ATV. Very similar in size to the tow behind units are broadcast seeders that mount to the three-point hitch of a compact utility tractor, these are ideal for landscape and small property maintenance. Still larger are commercial broadcast seeders/spreaders designed and sized appropriately for agricultural tractors and mount to the tractor's <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch.</b> The broadcast seeders that are mounted to a three-point hitch are powered by a power take-off (P.T.O.) shaft from the tractor.

50|$|By {{the early}} 1930s the linkage design was {{finalised}} {{and is now}} adopted as international standard category I. Just one prototype Ferguson System tractor, known as the Ferguson Black, was built to further technical development and for demonstrating to potential manufacturers. During 1936 the first production Ferguson tractors were built in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, by the David Brown Company. This tractor, the Ferguson Model 'A', incorporated Harry Ferguson's 'suction side' hydraulic control system, the key to solving sensitive automatic control of three point mounted implements and patented on 5 February 1936 (patent no 470069). The combination of Ferguson's converging <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch,</b> patented on 3 July 1928 (patent no 320084) with his 'suction side control' valve {{is the key to}} the success of all subsequent Ferguson and later Massey Ferguson 'Ferguson System' tractors, the most important of which are the TE and TO 20 models. (It was the production of the Model 'A' that led in 1939 to the David Brown line of tractors).|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to compare and unveil efficiency of electro-hydraulic control (EHR) system to mechanical <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch</b> regulation in mouldboard ploughing. Increase of working velocity and <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch</b> automatic regulation activity decreased depth of ploughing at both regulation systems but electro-hydraulic system done it more accurately since deviation from default value was 10 % less than at mechanical regulation system. Electro-hydraulic <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch</b> control system decreased wheel slip up to 30 % in comparison to mechanical regulation system. Net energy requirement at mechanical <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch</b> regulation system spent 3 % more energy than electro-hydraulic control system. If wheel slip reduction influenced by electro-hydraulic control system would be added one could account on greater energy savings than previously mentioned value.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is force effect {{analysis}} of ploughing rigs. MSC Adams software was used for mathematical-physical model drafting and subsequent evaluation of measured data from tensometrical load sensing. Designed model was utilized for force reactions calculations under the driving wheels of a tractor using analysis of spatial system of forces of tractors <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch.</b> Field measurement data and data from MSC Adams software were tabular and graphically processed. Dependencies between plough and tractor connection setting and output performance of ploughing rigs were clarified. Results from experimental measurement with fully-mounted plough point out on the utilization of longitudinal and lateral position of ploughs CG for reducing of difference in load between furrow and land wheel with properly adjusted connection between plough and tractor. A result from experimental measurement with semi-mounted plough confirms the fact of significant difference in vertical load between rear axle wheels. This negative phenomenon could be eliminated with usage of traction cylinder localized in construction of semi-mounted ploughs over the horizontal joint. Correct adjustment of tractors <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch</b> in case of fully-mounted ploughs and utilization of traction cylinder in case of semi-mounted ploughs have got positive influence on fuel consumption and field performance of ploughing rigs...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} in design of universal <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch</b> dynamometer. Approaches in different hitch dynamometers are explained and {{pros and cons}} are mentioned. Also main parts and functional principle of draft sensor are clarified. The main goal {{of this research is}} clarification and examination of draft sensor output signal on angular draft force dependences. Utilization of draft sensor as a source for draft force sensing in lower arms is intended and examined. Research was focused on loading of draft sensor in different directions for proper screening of voltage output. Special loading device was designed and used with respect of real mounting conditions and force loading identically to bearing pins of tractor hitch lower arms. With usage of calibrated load cell and National instrument sensing control unit stage loading diagram of draft sensor was obtained. Results show basic feedback of voltage output on force load angle variation. In non-load condition, voltage output fluctuates around 5 V. In the main direction of draft force application voltage drop occurs from 5 V up to 3. 16 V. Reverse direction of loading brings the voltage output increment from 5 V up to 7. 06 V. When the load is applied with angular inclination voltage output changes are diminished up to 90 ° and draft sensor shows voltage output symmetry against the main axis. Based on stage loading diagram the appropriateness of draft sensor usage in design of universal <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch</b> dynamometer is discussed in paper summary. Also further research opportunities and results application are suggested...|$|E

The slash accumulated and the trunks staked manually. fts 2, 4 and 6 - At the landing the coppice have been chipped by drum chipper with manual feed. The machine was a tractor powered chipper. At the landing the wood has been differentiated in two types. The type from the yards “fts 1, 3, 5 ” were 2 meters length trunks and the other type from the yards “fts 2, 4, 6 ” were chips for energy production. For the 2 meters length trunks the transport has been done by truck with 16 t of load capacity, and hydraulic crane. This material at the staple will be chipping by drum chipper with autonomous engine and mechanical feed. The chips transport will be done by truck with 17 t of load capacity. From the working times analysis and the wood quantitative obtained we studied the energy balance in the yards. We used the GER (Goss Energy Requirement) method. From the results obtained, the best work methodology seems to be that of full trees chipping directly at the landing and the chips transport at the staple. For the bunching and the extraction the best productivity result is given from the tractor with one drum forest winch. Considering the energy balance the yard that guarantees the greater efficiency is the “fts 4 ”, where has been employed for the extraction the tractor with two drums forest winch. The mechanization typology that supplied the better energy efficiency is that of the yards “fts 2, 4 and 6 ” where the full trees has been chipped to the landing...|$|E

40|$|Measuring soil {{compaction}} {{is a factor}} of interest to monitor soil fertility, which {{plays an important role}} in crop production cycle. Soil penetration resistance is the most commonly used method to measure {{soil compaction}}. It is fast and simple although it presents important limitations due to its close relationship with soil water content and the existence of high variability in the field, which requires increased number of samples that is effort demanding and time consuming. In this work, a fast and robust 5 -point penetration resistance system was developed attached on the tractor <b>three</b> <b>point</b> <b>hitch</b> using load cells and combined with a GPS receiver. An ultrasonic sensor to monitor the penetrating depth was also attached. A software program using Microsoft Visual Basic was developed for data acquisition. Security pins and software alarm was added to secure the equipment safety when stones or soil harder than a limit was encountered. The system was successfully tested in an experimental field, where five tillage methods were studied, including no tillage. The results indicated the system's ability to recognize compacted soil layers and depict the spatial variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of setup of three point linkage on {{energetic}} and performance parameters of tractor aggregate. For this purpose were made two series of measurements. The first series was realized with the tractor NewHolland T 7050 aggregate with 5 -furrow reversible plough plough KUHN HUARD VM 150 5 NS.
