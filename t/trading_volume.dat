25|$|The market {{mechanism}} {{for agricultural products}} is not particularly developed given the traditional nature of the agricultural sector and the numerous governmental interventions in the market prices. The market mainly consists {{of a large number}} of retail traders who purchase the crops from the farmers in small quantities and bring them to the major traders in the bazaar, which is the system that was the predecessor to the modern markets. In order to improve market efficiency and transparency, the Iranian government has allowed trading of agricultural products on the Iran Mercantile Exchange (IME) for the past seven years. More than 22 different agricultural products are currently traded on the IME and the <b>trading</b> <b>volume</b> for them is approximately 200,000 tonnes per annum. Nonetheless, given the direct impact of the prices of agricultural products on people’s daily lives and welfare, the government actively intervenes in the market by setting prices, importing products in large amounts, subsidising certain products, and restricting exports in order to supply domestic demand.|$|E

New York City remains the largest global center for trading in public equity and debt capital markets, driven in part by the size and financial development of the U.S. economy.

The results show that, asymmetric TGARCH and EGARCH models have more forecast accuracy performance for modeling the behavior of dynamic volatility of <b>trade</b> <b>volume</b> than symmetric ARCH models. Interpretation of EGARCH coefficients show that, good news has more effects than bad news on volatility of <b>trade</b> <b>volume</b> growth rate in TSE. Thus, information flow in TSE is asymmetric.
