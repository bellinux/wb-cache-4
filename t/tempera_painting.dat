5|$|William Moreton III used what {{is today}} {{known as the}} Exhibition Room as a bedroom in the mid-17th century; it is entered through a doorway from the {{adjoining}} Withdrawing Room. Following William's death in 1654 his children Ann, Jane and Philip divided the house into three separate living areas. Ann, whose accommodation was in the Prayer Room above, then used the Exhibition Room as a kitchen. The adjoining Chapel, begun in 1508, is accessible by a doorway from the courtyard. The Chapel contains Renaissance-style <b>tempera</b> <b>painting,</b> thought to date from the late 16th century. Subjects include passages from the Bible. The chancel was probably a later addition dating from the mid-16th century. It is separated from the nave by an oak screen and projects eastwards from the main plan of the house, with a much higher ceiling. The stained glass in the east wall of the chancel is a 20th-century addition installed by Charles Abraham, the last private owner of Little Moreton Hall, as a parting gift on his transfer of ownership to the National Trust.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, {{uncertain}} about {{a career as}} a painter, Kossowski began architecture studies at Warsaw Technical University. But after two years there, he turned to painting and was accepted into the Cracow Academy of Fine Arts. During his time in Cracow he worked on the restoration of paintings at Wawel Castle. In 1929 he returned to Warsaw and its Academy of Fine Arts. Travelling on a government grant, Kossowski experienced Italian art in Rome (where he studied <b>tempera</b> <b>painting</b> techniques), Florence, Naples and Sicily.|$|E

The first set of murals called [...] "The Circus" [...] were painted by Louis Schanker and located on the four walls of the dining room. They consisted of eleven panels depicting clowns and other circus characters. The second series of murals, called [...] "Children at Work and Play", were created by Helen West Heller. The 23 panels portray children taking part in games and activities, and include disabled children. Both artists utilized <b>tempera</b> <b>painting.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{introduction}} of oil painting {{changed the way}} colours looked {{and how they were}} used. [...] Ultramarine pigment, for instance, was much darker when used in oil painting than when used in <b>tempera</b> <b>painting,</b> in frescoes. [...] To balance their colours, Renaissance artists like Raphael added white to lighten the ultramarine. [...] The sombre dark blue robe of the Virgin Mary became a brilliant sky blue. Titian created his rich blues by using many thin glazes of paint of different blues and violets which allowed the light to pass through, which made a complex and luminous colour, like stained glass. He also used layers of finely ground or coarsely ground ultramarine, which gave subtle variations to the blue.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{historical}} perspective, Bellini {{was essential to}} the development of the Italian Renaissance for his incorporation of aesthetics from Northern Europe. Significantly influenced by Antonello da Messina, who had spent time in Flanders, Bellini made prevalent both the use of oil painting, different from the <b>tempera</b> <b>painting</b> being used at the time by most Italian Renaissance painters, and the use of disguised symbolism integral to the Northern Renaissance. As demonstrated in such works as St. Francis in Ecstasy [...] (c.1480) and the San Giobbe Altarpiece (c.1478), Bellini makes use of religious symbolism through natural elements, such as grapevines and rocks. Yet his most important contribution to art lies in his experimentation with the use of color and atmosphere in oil painting.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} lubki were woodcuts. The Koren Picture-Bible, 1692-1696 {{established the}} most prominent style, an [...] "Old Russian" [...] rendering of international iconography and subjects, most {{closely related to the}} frescos of the Upper Volga. By mid-18th century, however, the woodcuts were mostly replaced with engraving or etching techniques, which enabled the prints to be more detailed and complex. After printing on paper, the picture would be hand-colored with diluted <b>tempera</b> <b>paints.</b> While the prints themselves were typically very simplistic and unadorned, the final product, with the <b>tempera</b> <b>paint</b> added, was surprisingly bright with vivid colors and lines. The dramatic coloring of the early woodcut prints was to some extent lost with the transfer to more detailed engravings.|$|R

5000|$|The {{paintings}} were only applied on one side, entirely using <b>tempera</b> <b>paints</b> applied after all firing. This {{is a significant}} difference from most other Greek vase-painting, although some later vases had added some painting after firing {{as well as the}} traditional fired ceramic painting, and Greek terracotta figurines were often painted in this way. The colours tend to be pastel shades, which can include white, pink, black, blue, yellow, red, gold, rarely also green. Pink, magenta, or red backgrounds are typical. As well as a main scene with a few figures, the ornamental zones are at least partly painted, and elements might be gilded. [...] In the main scene, outlines were drawn in black after firing, a white ground applied within the areas to be fully painted, which allowed the lines still to be seen, and finally <b>tempera</b> <b>paints</b> applied.|$|R

5000|$|When he {{received}} the commission for The Last Supper, Leonardo da Vinci had never worked {{on a piece of}} this great a size, fifteen feet high by almost twenty-nine feet wide. [...] He also had very limited experience working in the technique known as fresco, mixing pigment into wet plaster to create a permanent bond. [...] Traditionally, fresco painters put down many successive layers of plaster before and during the painting process. [...] This method requires fresco painters to work quickly and with a pre-set plan. However, this is not how Leonardo worked, and because of that, he chose a new technique of putting a mixture of oil and <b>tempera</b> <b>paints</b> onto a dry wall. According to Ross King, “In essence, Leonardo took <b>tempera</b> <b>paints</b> and mixed emulsifying oils into them.” [...] This allowed Leonardo to include richer colors, finer details, and at a slower work pace.|$|R
