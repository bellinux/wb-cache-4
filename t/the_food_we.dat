2500|$|Following the match, {{many former}} Australian players {{called for the}} tour to be abandoned, citing {{the safety of the}} team. Nevertheless, the series {{continued}} and Lawry's men received a positive welcome upon arrival for the Fifth Test in Madras. Lawry made 33 as Australia batted first and made 258, taking a 95-run lead. He then fell for 2 as Australia collapsed for 153 in the second innings to give the hosts an opening, but they won the match in just over three days by 77 runs to clinch the series 3–1, but Lawry's team left India with Australia's reputation severely dented. Perhaps {{as a result of the}} controversy, Lawry could only manage 239 runs at 34.14 for the series. On reflection, Lawry stated [...] "It was the toughest tour I've ever been on. There were very pleasant memories on the field, but very unpleasant ones from the accommodation, the type of travel, <b>the</b> <b>food</b> <b>we</b> were getting and lack of support we were getting from the board." ...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{based on}} the {{imbalance}} of the supply-demand relationship of <b>food,</b> <b>we</b> design a spreading model of food safety risk, which is about from food producers to consumers in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply chain. <b>We</b> use theoretical analysis and numerical simulation to describe the supply-demand relationship and government supervision behaviors’ influence on the risk spread of <b>food</b> safety and <b>the</b> behaviors of <b>the</b> <b>food</b> producers and <b>the</b> <b>food</b> retailers. <b>We</b> also analyze {{the influence of the}} awareness of consumer rights protection and the level of legal protection of consumer rights on the risk spread of food safety. This model contributes to the explicit investigation of the influence relationship among supply-demand factors, the regulation behavioral choice of government, the behavioral choice of food supply chain members and food safety risk spread. And this paper provides a new viewpoint for considering food safety risk spread in <b>the</b> <b>food</b> supply chain, which has a great reference for food safety management.|$|R

A large expanse of water spread to the westward of us and beyond were a cluster of roofs and one or two church towers.
