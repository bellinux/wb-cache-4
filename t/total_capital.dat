5|$|The IFC prepares {{consolidated}} {{financial statements}} in accordance with United States GAAP which are audited by KPMG. It reported income before grants to IDA members of $2.18 billion in fiscal year 2011, up from $1.95 billion in fiscal 2010 and $299 million in fiscal 2009. The increase in income before grants is ascribed to higher earnings from the IFC's investments and also from higher service fees. The IFC reported a partial offset from lower liquid asset trading income, higher administrative costs, and higher advisory service expenses. The IFC made $600 million in grants to IDA countries in fiscal 2011, up from $200 million in fiscal 2010 and $450 million in fiscal 2009. The IFC reported a net income of $1.58 billion in fiscal year 2011. In previous years, the IFC had reported {{a net loss of}} $151 million in fiscal 2009 and $1.75 billion in fiscal 2010. The IFC's <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> amounted to $20.3 billion in 2011, of which $2.4 billion was paid-in capital from member countries, $16.4 billion was retained earnings, and $1.5 billion was accumulated other comprehensive income.

At all times, at least 26 per cent of the paid-up capital will have to be held by residents.

25|$|Having nearly reached 20m in 1923/4, {{the number}} of bus {{passengers}} carried in 1924/5 dropped back to 15.5m after The Mound and Hanover Street route was converted from bus operation to electric trams. By May 1925, the Corporation had 88 buses in regular use. Despite the size, and after a <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> expenditure of nearly £200,000 on buses and garages (of which around three-quarters had already been paid off), they now returned an annual loss of £8,174 on revenues of £109,400, although the loss included the cost of converting half the fleet to pneumatic tyres (without which, the loss would have been £1,357).|$|E
25|$|In {{defense of}} {{the theory that the}} organic {{composition}} of capital does rise in the long term (lowering the average rate of profit), Mandel claimed that there does not exist any branch of industry where wages are a growing proportion of total production costs, as a secular trend. The real trend is the other way: toward semi-automation and full automation which lowers total labor costs in the <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> outlay. Critics of that idea point to low-wage countries like China, where the long run trend is for average real wages to rise. For example, the Chinese Communist Party aims to double Chinese workers' wages by 2020.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} long-run time series for price {{aggregates}} is, {{that they often}} disregard many qualitative changes in the components of those aggregates, or, {{it is assumed that}} these qualitative changes have no real quantitative significance for comparative purposes. A variable is thought to stay qualitatively the same across time, when in reality it does not remain the same. Michael Perelman, for example, shows that the content and economic meaning of capital aggregates can change considerably even within one decade or so. For example, the changing stratification of physical capital assets in the <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> stock, in terms of their age, exerts an independent influence on the productivity and profitability of enterprises.|$|E

25|$|There are differing {{estimates}} of the <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> held by Iranian expatriates. One estimate places the number at $1.3 trillion US dollars. Whatever the actual number, {{it is clear that}} these funds are sufficiently large enough to buy significant stakes in all state companies. In Dubai alone, Iranian expatriates are estimated to have invested up to $200 billion. Even a 10 percent repatriation of capital would have a significant impact. In 2000, the Iran Press Service reported that Iranian expatriates had invested between $200 and $400 billion in the United States, Europe, and China, but almost nothing in Iran. FIPPA provisions apply to all foreign investors, and many Iranian expatriates based in the US continue to make substantial investments in Iran.|$|E
25|$|The {{neutron economy}} of heavy water {{moderation}} and precise control of on-line refueling allow CANDU {{to use a}} great range of fuels other than enriched uranium, e.g., natural uranium, reprocessed uranium, thorium, plutonium, and used LWR fuel. Given the expense of enrichment, this can make fuel much cheaper. There is an initial investment into the tonnes of 99.75% pure heavy water to fill the core and heat transfer system. In {{the case of the}} Darlington plant costs released as part of a freedom of information act request put the overnight cost of the plant (four reactors totalling 3,512 MWe net capacity) at $5.117 billion CAD (about $4.2 billion USD at early 1990s exchange rates). <b>Total</b> <b>capital</b> costs including interest were $14.319 billion CAD (about $11.9 billion USD) with the heavy water accounting for $1.528 billion, or 11%, of this.|$|E

25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately).

25|$|Based on the {{projected}} capital costs, {{and the low}} cost of fuel and in-service maintenance, in 1994 power from CANDU was predicted to be well under 5 cents/kWh.

As Ontario Hydro received a regulated price averaging 6.3 cents/kWh for power in this period, the revenues from the other forms of generation were being used to fund the operating losses of the nuclear plants. The debt left over from the nuclear construction could not be included in the rate base until the reactors were declared in service, thereby exacerbating the <b>total</b> <b>capital</b> cost of construction with unpaid interest, at that time around $15 billion, and another $3.5 billion in debts throughout the system was held by a separate entity and repaid through a standing charge on electricity bills.|$|E
