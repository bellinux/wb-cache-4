5|$|In 1902, {{the famous}} French {{vaudeville}} singer and dancer, and the vedette of the Folies Bergère, Eugénie Fougère, who was performing at the Salone Margherita a café-chantant in Naples, contacted Alfano {{to get back}} her stolen jewelry. Within a few days, Alfano tracked the thieves and restored <b>the</b> <b>jewelry.</b> The case hit the news headlines and Alfano was arrested for complicity with the thieves but was absolved.|$|E
5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in <b>the</b> <b>jewelry.</b> Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E
50|$|Cleanliness {{does not}} affect <b>the</b> <b>jewelry's</b> market value, as jewelers {{routinely}} clean jewelry before offering it for sale. However, cleanliness might reflect (and/or affect) <b>the</b> <b>jewelry's</b> sentimental value.|$|R

50|$|Amaya was {{recognized}} by <b>the</b> Meycauayan <b>Jewelry</b> Industry Association, Inc., an organization composed of 135 jewellers in Meycauayan, Bulacan, {{for the promotion of}} the country’s rich jewelry-making heritage. Apart from Filipino customs and traditions, the series also features native costumes and <b>jewelries</b> patterned after <b>the</b> popular designs of the era. Most of <b>the</b> <b>jewelries</b> in <b>the</b> series were crafted by jewellers from Meycauayan, Bulacan.|$|R
5|$|Because of its durability, {{titanium}} {{has become}} more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness makes it {{a good choice for}} those with allergies or those who will be wearing <b>the</b> <b>jewelry</b> in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E
5|$|I-95 {{runs from}} north to south through Providence while I-195 connects the city to eastern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, {{including}} New Bedford, Massachusetts, and Cape Cod. I-295 encircles Providence while RI 146 provides a direct connection with Worcester, Massachusetts. The city commissioned and began a long-term project, the Iway, to move I-195 in 2007 not only for safety reasons, but also to free up land and to reunify <b>the</b> <b>Jewelry</b> District with Downcity Providence, which had been split from one another by the highway. The project was estimated to cost $610 million.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{copper alloys}} have been formulated, many with {{important}} uses. Brass is an alloy of copper and zinc. Bronze usually refers to copper-tin alloys, but {{can refer to}} any alloy of copper such as aluminium bronze. Copper {{is one of the}} most important constituents of silver and carat gold and carat solders used in <b>the</b> <b>jewelry</b> industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the resulting alloys. Some lead-free solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of copper and other metals.|$|E
50|$|But {{the real}} golden era for <b>the</b> costume <b>jewelry</b> began in <b>the</b> {{middle of the}} 20th century. The new middle class wanted beautiful, but {{affordable}} <b>jewelry.</b> <b>The</b> demand for <b>jewelry</b> of this type coincided with the machine-age and the industrial revolution. The revolution made the production of carefully executed replicas of admired heirloom pieces possible.|$|R

5|$|Rhodium finds use in {{jewelry and}} for decorations. It is {{electroplated}} on white gold and platinum {{to give it}} a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in <b>the</b> <b>jewelry</b> business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price. The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.|$|E
5|$|Ida Marcia Camelhor {{was born}} on 31 October 1882 in Kovno, Russia to Mary (née Dember) and Louis Camelhor (also noted as Lieb Kamelhorn). She was the only {{surviving}} child {{of a family of}} eight. Before her first birthday, her parents immigrated to New York and then when she was around ten years old, they moved to Providence, Rhode Island. She attended public grammar school and high school and, at sixteen years old, went to work as a bookkeeper for Archibald Silverman. Archibald, also an immigrant, had begun his career as a designer of costume jewelry. Together with his brother, Charles, he established the Silverman Brothers jewelry company in Providence in 1897. After two years of working in <b>the</b> <b>jewelry</b> business, Camelhor agreed to marry her boss; they wed in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Quarter of Delos {{contains}} <b>the</b> <b>Jewelry</b> Quarter, where older {{structures such as}} {{workshops and}} other archaeological remains dating to the 3rd century BC and early 2nd century BC have been discovered. By {{the second half of}} the 2nd century BC these were replaced by private homes built in the most characteristic fashion for Delos: a narrow, rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard, a vestibule service room in the front, and a larger, main room in the rear. The quarter of the House of the Masks is the only area of Delos without this archetypal house plan. Some houses of the Northern Quarter feature mosaic decorations with mythological scenes, including Lycurgus of Thrace and Ambrosia in an upper-story mosaic, as well as Athena and Hermes together with a seated woman in a main-room mosaic.|$|E
