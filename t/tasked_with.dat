40|$|Cloud {{computing}} {{is a new}} archetype {{that provides}} dynamic computing services to cloud users through the support of datacenters that employs the services of datacenter brokers which discover resources and assign them Virtually. The focus {{of this research is}} to efficiently optimize resource allocation in the cloud by exploiting the Max-Min scheduling algorithm and enhancing it to increase efficiency in terms of completion time (makespan). This is key to enhancing the performance of cloud scheduling and narrowing the performance gap between cloud service providers and cloud resources consumers/users. The current Max-Min algorithm selects <b>tasks</b> <b>with</b> maximum execution time on a faster available machine or resource that is capable of giving minimum completion time. The concern of this algorithm is to give priority to <b>tasks</b> <b>with</b> maximum execution time first before assigning those with the minimum execution time for the purpose of minimizing makespan. The drawback of this algorithm is that, the execution of <b>tasks</b> <b>with</b> maximum execution time first may increase the makespan, and leads to a delay in executing <b>tasks</b> <b>with</b> minimum execution time if the number of <b>tasks</b> <b>with</b> maximum execution time exceeds that of <b>tasks</b> <b>with</b> minimum execution time, hence the need to improve it to mitigate the delay in executing <b>tasks</b> <b>with</b> minimum execution time. CloudSim is used to compare the effectiveness of the improved Max-Min algorithm with the traditional one. The experimented results show that the improved algorithm is efficient and can produce better makespan than Max-Min and DataAware. Comment: 6 pages, 6 figures, Article publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the relationship between}} tasks {{that have been used}} in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to measure choices between smaller immediate and larger delayed rewards: real and hypothetical temporal discounting tasks, and single-choice paradigms. Methods: Participants were 55 undergraduate psychology students. Tasks included a real and hypothetical version of a temporal discounting (TD) <b>task</b> <b>with</b> choices between a large reward (10 cents) after delays up to 60 seconds, and smaller immediate rewards (2 - 8 cents); two versions of a hypothetical temporal discounting <b>task</b> <b>with</b> choices between a large reward ($ 100) after delays up to 120 months, and smaller immediate rewards ($ 1 -$ 95); a Choice Delay <b>Task</b> <b>with</b> choices between one point now and two points after 30 seconds (one point is worth five cents). Results: Correlation analyses showed that the real and the hypothetical TD <b>tasks</b> <b>with</b> 10 cents were very strongly associated. However, the hypothetical TD <b>tasks</b> <b>with</b> $ 100 did not correlate with either the real or the hypothetical TD <b>task</b> <b>with</b> 10 cents. Principal component analysis extracted two components: one for small amounts and short delays, and a second one for large rewards and long delays. Conclusions: Temporal reward discounting is not a uniform construct. Functional brain imaging research could shed more light on unique brain activation patterns associated with different forms of temporal reward discounting...|$|R
