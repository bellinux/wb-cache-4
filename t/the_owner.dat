5000|$|In {{commercial}} law, {{limited liability}} {{is a business}} form that shields its owners from certain types of liability and that amount a given owner will be liable for. A limited liability form separates <b>the</b> <b>owner(s)</b> from <b>the</b> business. This means that when a business is found liable in case, <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> are not themselves liable; rather, the business is. Thus, only the funds or property <b>the</b> <b>owner(s)</b> have invested into the business are subject to that liability. If, for example, a limited liability business goes bankrupt, then <b>the</b> <b>owner(s)</b> will not lose unrelated assets such as a personal residence (assuming they do not give personal guarantees). This is the standard model for larger businesses, in which a shareholder will only lose the amount invested (in the form of stock value decreasing). (For an explanation, see business entity.) There is an exception to this rule that allows a claimant to go after <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> of a limited liability business where <b>the</b> <b>owners</b> have engaged in conduct that justifies the claimant's recovery from <b>the</b> <b>owners.</b> This is known as [...] "piercing the veil." ...|$|R
