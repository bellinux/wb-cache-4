5|$|Her first magical mentor was the Irish occultist and Freemason Theodore Moriarty. She had befriended {{him while}} still {{involved}} in psychotherapy, believing {{that he could}} help one of her patients, {{a young man who}} had been fighting on the Western Front and claimed to be plagued by unexplained physical phenomena. Moriarty performed an exorcism, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> the victim of the soul of a deceased East European soldier which had latched onto him as a parasite. Fortune became an acolyte of Moriarty's Masonic-influenced lodge, which was based in Hammersmith, and joined his community of followers living at Gwen Stafford-Allen's home in Bishop's Stortford. Moriarty spent much time talking about the lost city of Atlantis, a topic that would also come to be embraced by Fortune. Fortune later fictionalised Moriarty as the character Dr. Taverner, who appeared in a number of short stories first published in 1922, later assembled in a collected volume as The Secrets of Dr. Taverner in 1926. Like Moriarty, Dr. Taverner was portrayed as carrying out exorcisms to protect humans from the attacks of etheric vampires.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{not certain}} {{if he should}} accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E

Dmitry and Marina fell in love; asking her father for her hand, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> promised it in return for granting the Mniszechs full rights to the Russian towns of Pskov, Novgorod, Smolensk, and Novhorod-Siverskyi upon his ascension.|$|E
25|$|He briefly {{worked for}} two railroads in eastern Pennsylvania before {{returning}} home to Norristown to assist his father {{in the real estate}} and stage line businesses.

They had six children, but three died in infancy.|$|E
25|$|Distinctive {{features}} on the male were a white scar on his forehead, a vaccination scar on his left shoulder and another on his left wrist. On his right foot, he had hammer toe deformities, {{which may have been}} due to wearing tight-fitting shoes or possibly other reasons. After the examination of his body was complete, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> buried in the Tooele City Cemetery, after the case remained unsolved.|$|E

25|$|Then on 24 December, Darlan {{was assassinated}} in mysterious circumstances. On the {{afternoon}} of 24 December 1942, the admiral drove to his offices at the Palais d'Été and was shot down {{at the door to}} his bureau by a young man of 20, Bonnier de la Chapelle, a monarchist. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> tried by court martial under Giraud's orders and executed on the 26th. With the strong backing of the Allies, especially Eisenhower, Giraud was elected to succeed Darlan.|$|E
25|$|According to updated {{reference}} works, {{the future}} Ion Buzdugan {{was born in}} 1887 in Brînzenii Noi (now in Telenești District, Moldova), the son of peasants Alexandru and Ecaterina Buzdâga, who also had two daughters. One 1936 entry claims that {{he was born in}} 1889 in Buzdugeni. Both villages were at the time included in the Russian Empire's Bessarabian Governorate, and <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> educated at a teachers' seminary in Bayramcha. He later studied agriculture, law and literature in Russian schools in Kamianets-Podilskyi and Moscow. He took a license to practice law from Moscow University.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} the Matei Basarab High School and taking his Baccalaureate, he enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, Historical Section. It was here that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> acquainted with his first mentors: writer-collector Alexandru Odobescu and {{archeologist}} Grigore Tocilescu, the latter of whom ensured Tzigara's employment as custodian for the National Museum of Antiquities. He was {{a critic of the}} museum's underdevelopment under Tocilescu's management, and wrote that the disorganized collection comprised an Egyptian mummy, copies of frescoes from the Cathedral Church in Curtea de Argeș, items from the Pietroasele Treasure, and works of Precolumbian art, alongside a scale model of the Eiffel Tower.|$|E

25|$|In March 1978, Gacy lured a 26-year-old named Jeffrey Rignall {{into his}} car. Upon {{entering}} the car, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> chloroformed and {{driven to the}} house on Summerdale, where he was raped, tortured with various instruments including lit candles and whips, and repeatedly chloroformed into unconsciousness. Rignall was then driven to Lincoln Park, where he was dumped, unconscious but alive. Eventually he managed to stagger to his girlfriend's apartment. Rignall was later informed the chloroform had permanently damaged his liver. Police were again informed of the assault, but did not investigate Gacy. Rignall was able to recall, through the chloroform haze of that night, Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, the Kennedy Expressway and particular side streets. He staked out the exit on the Expressway where {{he knew he had}} been driven until—in April—he saw Gacy's distinctive black Oldsmobile, which Rignall and his friends followed to 8213 West Summerdale. Police issued an arrest warrant, and Gacy was arrested on July 15. He was facing an impending trial for a battery charge for the Rignall incident when he was arrested in December for the murders.|$|E
500|$|After 30 days, on 27 July, {{the staff}} at Penetanguishene still deemed him unfit to stand trial, but by 27 August 1966 his state had {{improved}} enough for the doctors to allow his return to custody at Windsor. The doctors reported that he could now face the court—they said that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> now able {{to understand what the}} proceedings against him meant, and capable of working alongside a legal advisor. Because Lamb could not afford legal counsel, Justice Saul Nosanchuk was assigned by a local legal aid plan to advise him in the upcoming trial. Nosanchuk says that Lamb had [...] "no hesitation" [...] in signing a paper authorising the justice to represent him.|$|E
500|$|In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis, [...] on plant sexual reproduction. This {{attracted}} the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people. In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius' house to Rudbeck's to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions. Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort's system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of stamens and pistils. He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example, [...] and [...] He also produced a book on the plants grown in the Uppsala Botanical Garden, [...]|$|E

500|$|Not all the 25men who {{remained}} on Bounty were mutineers; Bligh's launch was overloaded, and some who {{stayed with the}} ship did so under duress. [...] "Never fear, lads, I'll do you justice if ever I reach England", Bligh is reported as saying. With regard to Heywood, however, Bligh was convinced that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> as guilty as Christian. Bligh's first detailed comments on the mutiny are {{in a letter to}} his wife Betsy, in which he names Heywood [...] ( [...] a mere boy not yet 16) [...] as [...] "one of the ringleaders", adding: [...] "I have now reason to curse the day I ever knew a Christian or a Heywood or indeed a Manks man. Bligh's later official account to the Admiralty lists Heywood with Christian, Edward Young and George Stewart as the mutiny's leaders, describing Heywood as a young man of abilities for whom he had felt a particular regard. To the Heywood family Bligh wrote: [...] "His baseness is beyond all description." ...|$|E
500|$|Stanford {{returned}} to opera in 1893, with an extensively revised and shortened version of The Veiled Prophet. It had its British premiere at Covent Garden in July. His friend Fuller Maitland was {{by this time}} the chief music critic of The Times, and the paper's review of the opera was laudatory. According to Fuller Maitland The Veiled Prophet was the best novelty of an opera season that had also included Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, Bizet's Djamileh and Mascagni's I Rantzau. Stanford's next opera was Shamus O'Brien (1896), a comic opera to a libretto by George H. Jessop. The conductor was the young Henry Wood, who recalled in his memoirs that the producer, Sir Augustus Harris, managed to quell the dictatorial composer and prevent him from interfering with the staging. Stanford attempted to give Wood lessons in conducting, but <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> unimpressed. The opera was successful, running for 82 consecutive performances. The work was given in German translation in Breslau in 1907; Thomas Beecham thought it [...] "a colourful, racy work", and revived it in his 1910 opéra comique season at His Majesty's Theatre, London.|$|E
500|$|As {{commander}} of the AWRS, Treloar worked enthusiastically and at times had to be ordered to take holidays. He told Bean that he was motivated [...] "to do something really worthwhile for Australia" [...] by bringing together the records covering Australia's role in the war. He actively pursued records and artefacts covering {{a wide range of}} the AIF's activities. While Bean was impressed by Treloar's achievements, he believed that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> pushing himself too hard and was in danger of a breakdown. Although they shared accommodations in London for a period in 1918, the two men were not close. Treloar was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) on 3June 1918 for [...] "services in connection with the war" [...] and was promoted to major in December 1918. While this promotion recognised his achievements as {{commander of}} the AWRS, it was mainly intended to improve his status when he attended meetings of the War Trophies Commission; the British representative on this commission was a major general. Treloar arranged for Clarissa Aldridge to travel to Britain in 1918, and they were married in London on 5November. The couple eventually had two daughters and two sons.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of July 24/25, 1261, Strategopoulos and his men {{approached}} the city walls and hid at a monastery near the Gate of the Spring. Strategopoulos sent a detachment of his men, who, led {{by some of the}} thelematarioi, {{made their way to the}} city through a secret passage. They attacked the walls from the inside, surprised the guards and opened the gate, allowing the Nicaean force entry into the city. [...] The Latins were taken completely unaware, and after a short struggle, the Nicaeans gained control of the land walls. As news of this spread across the city, the Latin inhabitants, from Emperor Baldwin II downwards, hurriedly rushed to the harbours of the Golden Horn, hoping to escape by ship. At the same time, Strategopoulos' men set fire to the Venetian buildings and warehouses along the coast to prevent them from landing there. Thanks to the timely arrival of the returning Venetian fleet, many of the Latins managed to evacuate to the Latin-held parts of Greece, but the city was lost for good. The recapture of Constantinople signalled the restoration of the Byzantine Empire, and on August 15, the day of the Dormition of the Theotokos, Emperor Michael entered the city in triumph and was crowned at the Hagia Sophia. The rights of John IV Laskaris were brushed aside, and <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> blinded and imprisoned.|$|E
500|$|Having {{left the}} conservatoire, Offenbach was {{free from the}} stern academicism of Cherubini's curriculum, but as the biographer James Harding writes, [...] "he was free, also, to starve." [...] He secured a few {{temporary}} jobs in theatre orchestras before gaining a permanent appointment in 1835 as a cellist at the Opéra-Comique. He was no more serious there {{than he had been}} at the conservatoire, and regularly had his pay docked for playing pranks during performances; on one occasion, he and the principal cellist played alternate notes of the printed score, and on another they sabotaged some of their colleagues' music stands to make them collapse in mid-performance. Nevertheless, his earnings from his orchestral work enabled him to take lessons with the celebrated cellist Louis-Pierre Norblin. He made a favourable impression on the composer and conductor Fromental Halévy, who gave him lessons in composition and orchestration and wrote to Isaac Offenbach in Cologne that <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{going to be a great}} composer. Some of Offenbach's early compositions were programmed by the fashionable conductor Louis Antoine Jullien. Offenbach and another young composer Friedrich von Flotow collaborated on a series of works for cello and piano. Although Offenbach's ambition was to compose for the stage, he could not gain an entrée to Parisian theatre at this point in his career; with Flotow's help, he built a reputation composing for and playing in the fashionable salons of Paris.|$|E
2500|$|Outside school, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> still introverted, and, Sandqvist notes, [...] "extremely shy, {{especially}} with girls." [...] Ciprian recalls Ciriviș's engrossing pick-up lines: he acted familiar to any {{young woman who}} caught his eye, assuring her that they had met once before, and, having stirred her curiosity, falsely recounting how they both used to kill flesh-flies for sport.|$|E
