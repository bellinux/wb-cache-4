40|$|Winegrape operations, {{especially}} at harvest, produce a {{high incidence of}} work-related musculoskeletal disorders, predominantly involving back injury. The Agricultural Ergonomics Research Center of the University of California initiated a study of vineyard operations and recruited four cooperating growers representing 191 permanent workers. The goal was to develop, field-test, and evaluate interventions to reduce ergonomics risk factors for WRMSD’s during winegrape harvest. We assessed pre- and post-intervention injury records and other indicators of musculoskeletal symptoms to monitor the impact of interventions on involved workers, and used biomechanical, metabolic, and postural analyses {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} various approaches for handling cut grapes during vineyard harvest. We introduced a smaller, lighter <b>tote</b> <b>bin</b> with improved handles, reducing the average full bin load from 25. 5 kg to 20. 9 kg. The proportion of workers reporting pain lasting more than a week dropped from 61 % to 26 %. Biomechanical and metabolic assessments indicated reduced risk for WRMSD’s. We are currently field-testing a conveyor system to reduce the height at which the bins are dumped. BACKGROUND...|$|E

This standard is commonly used in the food-processing industry. Compliant bins are often called euro <b>bins,</b> <b>tote</b> <b>bins,</b> or meat carts.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Weyerhaeuser's Paper Mill in Albany, Oregon {{has been}} {{experiencing}} frequent ring {{formation in the}} # 3 rotary lime kiln. Rings form when lime mud (CaCO₃) or product lime (CaO) particles adheres to {{the walls of the}} lime kiln and become resistant to the abrasive action of the sliding motion of product lime particles (Notidis, 1994). Ring formation has resulted in frequent shut downs to remove (blast) the rings and caused a significant loss of productivity and revenue to the company. A careful analysis of the production process in the mill revealed that concentration of sodium was high and that of sulfur low in the lime mud. The high sodium was due to the low sulfur input to the kiln resulting in high sodium to sulfur ratio. The use of natural gas as a fuel source in the kiln partly causes low sulfur levels in the mud. This study examines the effects of burning emulsified sulfur in the # 3 rotary lime kiln to reduce sodium enrichment in the solids, and examine its effect on kiln operation and SO₂ emissions from the # 3 rotary lime kiln. A four day trial of burning emulsified sulfur to reduce sodium concentration in the # 3 rotary lime kiln was planned. <b>Tote</b> <b>bins</b> of 70...|$|R
