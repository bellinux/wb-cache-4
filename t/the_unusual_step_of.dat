5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by former Denver Broncos head coach Dan Reeves, who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> lobbying for the job. After being rebuffed {{by a number of}} candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job.|$|E
5|$|In September 2001, Marburger became Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy under George W. Bush. Marburger was a noted Democrat, a {{fact that}} Nature {{magazine}} stated was relevant to {{the decision by the}} administration to take <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> withholding from Marburger the title of Assistant to the President that previous science advisors had been granted.|$|E
5|$|In the December 1934 – January 1935 {{issue of}} Hornig's fanzine, Fantasy Magazine, he took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> listing several stories {{that he had}} {{rejected}} as lacking novelty, but which had subsequently appeared in print in other magazines. The list includes several by successful writers of the day, such as Raymond Z. Gallun and Miles Breuer. The most prominent story named is Triplanetary by E. E. Smith, which appeared in Amazing.|$|E

25|$|Butler was {{represented}} by Patrick McGuinness and Ann Finnell, two attorneys from the Public defenders office. They supplied a photograph of Butler with bruises on his face, which they claimed {{was the result of}} the interrogation. The jury deliberated for less than an hour before finding Butler not guilty; one juror later cited the testimony about the interrogation as one of the key factors in their decision. State Attorney Shorstein and Jacksonville Sheriff Glover took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> apologizing to Butler and re-opening the case of two unrelated suspects. However, Michael Glover denied the allegations against him, and Shorstein said there was no evidence that Butler had been physically abused during the interrogation.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Parenti, {{critic of}} the {{national}} security state, attributed Wright's forced resignation to the critical questions he was raising in the late 1980s with regard to CIA covert actions in Nicaragua. [...] Wright had not only criticized Reagan's policy, but taken <b>the</b> extremely <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> entering into negotiations with the Nicaraguan government as speaker.|$|R
5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included {{the fact that he}} was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by Dan Reeves, the successful former {{head coach of the}} Denver Broncos who led the Broncos to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from the Broncos, Reeves took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> lobbying heavily for the job. Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and Reeves was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at the time because he felt he knew him better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5|$|As {{demands for}} a {{parliament}} grew, Charles took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> summoning a great council of peers. By the time it met, on 24 September at York, Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament. After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November, he asked them to consider how he could acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime. They recommended making peace. A cessation of arms, although not a final settlement, was negotiated in the humiliating Treaty of Ripon, signed in October 1640. The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £850 per day until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled, which {{would be required to}} raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces. Consequently, Charles summoned what later became known as the Long Parliament. Once again, Charles's supporters fared badly at the polls. Of the 493 members of the Commons returned in November, over 350 were opposed to the king.|$|E
50|$|Sadreddin Nizamettinovich Maksudov {{was born}} in 23 july 1878 in Taşsu, outside of Kazan, {{the son of a}} mullah, and the younger brother of Hadi Maksudi, the {{well-known}} Jadidist. After the traditional mektep and medreseh education, he took <b>the</b> (then) <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> entering <b>the</b> Russian Teachers' College in Kazan (for which he was much criticized by his community at the time), then studied law in Paris.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the offense}} in good shape, Walsh and the 49ers focused on {{overhauling}} {{the defense in}} 1981. Walsh took <b>the</b> highly <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright and Carlton Williamson and giving Dwight Hicks a prominent role. He also acquired veteran linebacker Jack [...] "Hacksaw" [...] Reynolds and veteran defensive lineman and sack specialist Fred Dean.|$|R
60|$|Having been {{urged to}} bring out a new edition of the volume first edited by me in 1880, and having willingly {{accepted}} the invitation to do so, it will naturally be expected that I should give some account of the circumstances which have led me to take <b>the</b> somewhat <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> reviving a book which has for twelve years been lying {{in a state of}} suspended animation.|$|R
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, {{at this moment in}} time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, {{following}} {{the revelation that}} the News of the World had paid private investigators to hack into the phones of Milly Dowler, {{as well as the}} families of murder victims and deceased servicemen, Miliband called for News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks to resign, urged David Cameron to establish a public, judge-led inquiry into the scandal, and announced that he would force a Commons vote on whether to block the News International bid for a controlling stake in BSkyB. He also called for the Press Complaints Commission to be abolished – a call later echoed by Cameron and Nick Clegg – and called into question Cameron's judgement in hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson to be his director of communications. Cameron later took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> saying that the government would back Miliband's motion that the BSkyB bid be dropped, and an hour before Miliband's motion was due to be debated, News International announced that it would withdraw the bid.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E
5000|$|In 1695, fifteen-year-old Ursula {{married the}} Polish Kronoberkaemmerer Prince Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski. At that time, the Lubomirski family ranked among Poland's most {{influential}} princely families. They maintained relations with Primate-Cardinal Michał Stefan Radziejowski, archbishop of Gniezno, who, {{after the death}} of the Polish king John III Sobieski, was chosen by the new king as his representative. Nevertheless, the Pope soon took <b>the</b> highly <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> dissolving this [...] "lucky little marriage".|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Perfecto took <b>the</b> highly <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> filing in his behalf a {{petition}} with the Supreme Court {{arguing that the}} salaries of judges and justices were exempted from income taxes by the Constitution. The case was decided in his favor after his death, though Justice Roman Ozaeta, in dissent, expressed that “it is indeed embarrassing that this case was initiated {{by a member of}} this Court upon which devolves the duty to decide it finally.” ...|$|R
50|$|As the {{authority}} had already adjudicated {{on the matter}} and confirmed the matter was not within its remit, <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> was taken <b>of</b> adding a notice to the ASAs online and telephone complaints system informing viewers that Jamster!-related complaints should be directed towards the broadcaster or the regulator, Ofcom.|$|R
5|$|For Kinkladze, {{the start}} of the 2001–02 season {{followed}} a similar pattern to the previous season, comprising a mixture of starts and substitute appearances. Jim Smith resigned from his managerial position at Derby on 7 October 2001, leaving Kinkladze, a Smith favourite, bitterly disappointed. The appointment of new manager Colin Todd signalled a change in the club's playing style. Todd did not favour flair players, and Kinkladze made only a single substitute appearance in Todd's first two months in charge. Frustrated by a lack of opportunities, Kinkladze took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> using his lawyer to arrange a meeting with Todd to discuss his exclusion from the first team. Todd reacted by telling Kinkladze he could leave the club if he was unhappy. According to Kinkladze's agent, Manchester City, as well as Spanish clubs Valencia, Mallorca and Málaga, were all interested in signing Kinkladze. However, Todd was sacked on 14 January 2002 with Derby second from bottom of the Premier League, and John Gregory was appointed as manager on 30 January 2002. Kinkladze stayed at the club, playing regular first team football in the remainder of the season, but Derby continued to struggle, and Kinkladze endured relegation {{for the third time in}} his career. The club, who were £35 million in debt, started an end-of-season clear-out to reduce their annual £17 million wage bill. Derby's actions included off-loading of some of the highest earners, and the manager informed Kinkladze that he had no future at the club. However, Kinkladze, whose contract ended in summer 2003, was reluctant to leave the club and turned down a move to Turkish champions Galatasaray.|$|E
25|$|Besides his {{friendship}} with Chung, Puffer spoke fluent Cree and took what was then <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> employing First Nations people.|$|E
25|$|Everton manager David Moyes took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> {{contacting}} the Professional Game Match Officials Board {{in order to}} counter these accusations. The board's general manager Keith Hackett agreed that Johnson was being treated harshly and had been denied several clear penalties.|$|E
5000|$|The {{production}} of the series received considerable coverage in the press {{at the time it}} was being made. After production had begun, the ABC took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> (and costly) <b>step</b> <b>of</b> scrapping several completed episodes, because it was felt that the mood was too 'dark'.|$|R
2500|$|Espada {{was elected}} to {{represent}} the 32nd District, in the Southeast Bronx, which includes the neighborhoods of Soundview, Hunts Point, Mott Haven and Parkchester, serving in office from 1993 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2002, with David Rosado holding office in the intervening years. In the 1996 primary, the Bronx Democratic Party took <b>the</b> highly <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> running a candidate against the incumbent Democratic Senator, and successfully challenged Espada's petitions in court. Espada ran on the Liberal Party line, and lost to David Rosado, 78% to 21% ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the 1918 merger, Home had 60,000 {{customers}} served from 16 dial offices. Sunset had 68,000 subscribers served from nine manual offices. Home's operations were sizable and the public felt Home provided better service than Sunset, so Pacific Telephone didn't convert the dial offices to manual as it had in the past. Instead, they took <b>the</b> highly <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> adding a dial and trunk lines to every manual switchboard position. In this way, former Sunset customers could reach the former Home subscribers via their central office operator.|$|R
25|$|When the BoI {{report was}} {{finalised}} in November 2004, the Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> releasing {{some of its}} content into the public domain. The families of the RMPs were briefed separately by {{the commander of the}} BoI and Mr Hoon addressed Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The House {{passed the}} {{suffrage}} amendment {{for the first}} time in January, 1918, but the Senate delayed its debate on the measure until September. President Wilson took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> appearing before the Senate to speak on the issue, asking for passage of the amendment as a war measure. The Senate, however, defeated the measure by two votes.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} new {{vehicles}} {{were added to the}} bus fleet in the late 1940s and 1950s, and in 1958 one-person operation was introduced. Trolleybus operation in Portsmouth ended in July 1963. From 1963 until the late 1970s PCT standardised on the double-deck Leyland Atlantean for new purchases, retaining much older vehicles for open-top services. In 1971 the company took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> purchasing twelve Atlanteans with single-deck bodywork.|$|E
5000|$|Espada {{was elected}} to {{represent}} the 32nd District, in the Southeast Bronx, which includes the neighborhoods of Soundview, Hunts Point, Mott Haven and Parkchester, serving in office from 1993 to 1996 and again from 2001 to 2002, with David Rosado holding office in the intervening years.

50|$|The {{case was}} procedurally unusual {{in that it}} was {{initiated}} in 2007, and it was unclear whether the statute of limitations had expired due to revision of the governing criminal statute in the interim. The trial court ruled against Seale on the issue, which was affirmed by an evenly divided appellate court. The appellate court then took <b>the</b> highly <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> seeking certification of the legal question to the Supreme Court of the United States, seeking guidance on whether the revisions retroactively changed the applicable limitations period. The Supreme Court dismissed the certification without comment.|$|R
5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} {{so early in the}} primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>steps</b> <b>of</b> scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, as well as from Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|R
25|$|In {{this cycle}} the DSCC was more {{successful}} at fundraising. As of June 30, 2008, {{data from the}} Federal Election Commission showed the NRSC with $24.6 million on hand, {{as compared with the}} DSCC's $43 million. The NRSC chair, Senator John Ensign, took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> chastising the Republican Senators who, like him, are not facing re-election, and who he thought should have done more to help raise money for their colleagues.|$|E
25|$|Elwes {{had a voice}} {{entirely in}} the English colouring, but with an unusual quality of sincerity and passion, and of {{considerable}} power. His diction and intonation were very secure, his delivery somewhat 'gentlemanly' but his phrasing long in conception and serving intense melodic inflections. His singing possessed a spiritual fervour deriving from the religious disposition of his parents, who had taken <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> converting to Roman Catholicism when he was five years old.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, {{after the}} road was repaved between Bullville and Pine Bush, DOT took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> posting a lower speed limit for {{northbound}} traffic as well as increased signage. The Crawford police chief said he expected the improved surface would nonetheless result in more speeding, at least initially. The town board has suggested to DOT that it install a light at the intersection with Ulsterville and Black Hawk roads {{just south of the}} high school, and reduce the road's grade into that intersection.|$|E
50|$|Both accused took pleas in bar {{of trial}} {{on the basis}} of {{prejudicial}} pre-trial publicity, and sought to raise devolution minutes. At a preliminary hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh between 28 and 30 July 2010, the trial judge Lord Bracadale, heard legal arguments on these matters. At the close of the hearing, the preliminary pleas were repelled and the devolution minutes refused. Due to the high profile nature of the case, Lord Bracadale took <b>the</b> somewhat <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> issuing a note, setting forth his reasons for repelling the preliminary pleas and detailing his directions given to the jury with respect to media publicity.|$|R
5000|$|In Colonial times, “The {{chair of}} moral {{philosophy}} stood above all other faculty positions in importance and prestige." [...] Selecting a moral philosophy was thus a fundamentally important consideration when founding a college. In 1752, at Franklin's urging, Johnson revised his philosophy textbook again {{to create a}} philosophy suitable for the proposed new-model colleges. Franklin took <b>the</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> (for him) <b>of</b> self-funding the domestic printing of Elementa Philosophica (1752).|$|R
5000|$|Operation Dark Heart by Anthony A. Shaffer, {{released}} in September 2010, includes {{memories of his}} time reporting to the 9/11 commission about Able Danger's findings. The 10,000 copies of the books have not been released yet. The DOD's Defense Intelligence Agency reviewers identified more than 200 passages suspected of containing classified information. [...] "Specifically, the DIA wanted references to a meeting between Lt. Col. Tony Shaffer, the book's author, and {{the executive director of}} the 9/11 Commission, Philip Zelikow, removed". DOD took <b>the</b> highly <b>unusual</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> purchasing all available copies of Shaffer's book at a cost of $47,000 and destroying them to deny the public the ability to read the book.|$|R
