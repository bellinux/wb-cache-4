5|$|As Alice's memory {{begins to}} fade, she daydreams {{of her mother}} and sister, who died in a car crash when she was a teenager. She memorizes words and sets a series of {{personal}} questions on her phone, which she answers every morning. She hides sleeping pills in her room, and records a video message instructing her future self to swallow the pills when she can no longer answer the questions. As her disease advances, she becomes unable to give focused lectures and loses her job. She becomes lost searching for <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>in</b> her own home and does not recognize Lydia after seeing her perform in a play.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, she calls a culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has to run to <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>in</b> pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E
5|$|Cliff (Bill Cosby) {{comes home}} from a long day at work and tries to take a nap. Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe) {{disturbs}} him to say that Rudy's (Keshia Knight Pulliam) goldfish, Lamont, has died, {{but she does not}} realize it yet. They have a hard time explaining to Rudy what has happened. Once they do, Rudy becomes depressed. Later that day, the older kids start making fun of Lamont's death, Theo saying they should hold a memorial service for the fish around the family toilet. When Cliff feels {{that the rest of the}} family is insensitive to Rudy's loss, he requires the entire family to participate in a memorial service for Lamont in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>in</b> proper funeral attire. Rudy loses interest in the funeral and leaves to watch television, ending the ceremony abruptly. She later returns to the bathroom and asks for privacy, not because she wants to say goodbye to Lamont as Cliff thinks, but because she needs to use the toilet.|$|E

[...] Venom singer Conrad [...] "Cronos" [...] Lant responded, saying [...] "Right here—right here in my mouth!" [...] Araya took it almost literally and urinated on his hair.

500|$|McMahon {{appeared}} on the November 1 episode of Raw in a pre-taped segment, where she dreams that Vince McMahon awoke from a coma after his doctor, played by actor and one-time WWE employee Freddie Prinze Jr., informed him that his wife Linda had invested millions in her campaign as she runs for senate. Vince's heart rate elevated {{more and more as}} Prinze informed him on what was [...] "wrong" [...] with WWE since he went into a coma. After beginning to feel better, Vince realizes that he has a serious case of [...] "the runs", in which he gets out of bed and walks to <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>in</b> which he is covered in campaign signs, that block his backside. McMahon suddenly wakes up from her dream and asks her husband, Triple H (off-screen and voice work only), if Vince was still in a coma, in which Triple H replies [...] "Yeah, he's in a coma. I'm pretty sure he's brain dead."; McMahon responds by saying [...] "thank God," [...] and then lays back down.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Wendy tells Stan {{that she}} smelled Ms. Ellen taking a [...] "smelly dump" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>in</b> {{an attempt to}} make him less {{attracted}} to her. In the original script, Wendy originally told Stan that she had a yeast infection, but Comedy Central censors made Parker and Stone change the line. Parker and Stone said although the network typically provides great leniency in permitting obscene jokes, they often object to lines about female hygiene problems. During a cafeteria scene, a boy visible at a lunch table in the background looks exactly like Craig Tucker, but the color of his hat has been changed to make him appear to be a different character. The idea of Ms. Ellen taking one of the children to dinner came from Parker's real-life experiences. At his school, the children were able to have lunch with the teacher and principal if they were awarded [...] "Student of the Week". Parker said he went on one of the lunches once and found the experience [...] "really, really creepy" [...] because he had the impression the teacher and principal were having a romantic affair.|$|E

500|$|In {{an overall}} {{positive}} {{review of the}} episode, Fred Topel of Hollywood News wrote that the opening scenes that addressed fan criticisms were a little too harsh on the show's fictional characters, having gone overboard {{to the point of}} offensiveness. He highlighted as a concern the [...] "downright racist" [...] scene ten minutes into the show between Rachel and Sunshine which he could have [...] "done without". Meghan Carlson of BuddyTV also described Rachel's behavior in the aforementioned scene as [...] "totally, patronizingly racist". Writing for The Stir, Brittany Drye asked [...] "Is Glee racist?", and cited several moments in [...] "Audition" [...] which could be perceived as racist. She found the scene with Rachel screaming at Sunshine in <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>in</b> broken English to be distasteful, and also highlighted the pairing of Tina and Mike (noting their shared surname, [...] "Chang") and the joke of Jacob assuming they are a couple because they are both Asian. However, Drye speculated that in attempting [...] "self-aware racism" [...] the show was intentionally trying to point out the inanity of racist beliefs, and concluded that Glees self-awareness in this matter was its saving grace.|$|E

40|$|This work {{deals with}} <b>the</b> form <b>bathrooms</b> have taken <b>in</b> time and aims at {{exploring}} whether {{these can be}} regarded as cultural significant, but also how the estate-owner‘s knowledge is embodied. The work is limited to <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>in</b> Sweden. <b>The</b> investigation has been performed through studies of articles about <b>bathrooms</b> <b>in</b> old interior-magazines, old books and physical studies of old <b>bathrooms.</b> Within <b>the</b> investigation, a survey and an interview have also been applied. The introduction chapter explains the notions that are used in the scope of the present work. The following chapter describes the development of <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> apartment blocks between the 1930 ’s and the 1970 ’s by actuating factors such as building codes and thorough investigations about <b>bathrooms.</b> Further, <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> époques are described through their special features. The investigation´s last chapter presents the contemporary situation based on the demands and difficulties. This part of the work is mainly performed with the results from the survey and interview with municipal second-hand center for used building materials, called Återbruket. The investigation shows that old bathrooms do have cultural significance that is bound to the material components from the respective period of time {{and the fact that the}} estate-owners knowledge about these is limited. The second-hand market for old bathrooms is actually growing stronger and according to Återbruket, old bathrooms are requested by the young generation. In the discussion and conclusion chapter, it is established that <b>the</b> old <b>bathrooms</b> are complex from the conservation point of view, and an immersed knowledge is required to make a cautious renovation possibleUppsats för avläggande av filosofie kandidatexamen i Kulturvård, Bebyggelseantikvariskt program 15 hp Institutionen för kulturvård Göteborgs universitet 2013 : 2...|$|R
