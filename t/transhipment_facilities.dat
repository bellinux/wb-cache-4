5|$|Construction of the Selby Canal {{began in}} 1775, {{and it was}} opened on 29 April 1778. The new cut at Castleford opened in spring 1775, while those at Knostrop and Hunslet were {{finished}} in 1779. Methley cut was completed, but Woodlesford was not, as the company bought the mill there instead. All locks were replaced, and the total cost was over £60,000, of which around £20,000 was for the Selby Canal. The navigation remained profitable, paying £9,000 in dividends in 1775, which had risen to £32,000 by 1791. Most traffic now used the Selby route, and the <b>transhipment</b> <b>facilities</b> at Airmyn were closed in 1779.|$|E

30|$|We {{encourage}} closing {{this gap}} because {{the integration of}} relevant transport logistics hubs will improve the assessment of policy measures regarding transport logistics. Due {{to the importance of}} transport logistics hubs the, at least, most relevant ones should be integrated in the models. Terminals of combined transport, rail and sea ports but also ports of inland waterways and especially <b>transhipments</b> <b>facilities</b> of freight forwarders should be integrated – also to credit their empirical relevance within transport processes.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the disciplined mobility and emotional geographies of “between-deck” passengers in Royal Dutch Lloyd's early Twentieth Century passenger shipping network. Specifically, it {{is concerned with}} {{the ways in which the}} network was established and with the efforts made to maintain it. It is found that such a disciplinary network furthers the firm's goal of shipping healthy and productive bodies for corporate profits and that <b>transhipment</b> <b>facility</b> Lloyd Hotel in Amsterdam was integral to the performance and maintenance of such a transnational disciplinary network. The key consequence of such disciplined mobility was the creation of an emotional passenger-migrant subject shaped in relation to the power of corporate, cultural and other authorities in maritime travel and migration. In identifying this historic network of disciplined mobility and its emotional subject, this paper seeks to reveal the emotional geographies relating to mobile subjectivities and the power relations associated with their historically significant travels. 23 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the pricing policy of transhipment route for India to move cargo through Bangladesh from Kolkata port to the capital city of Tripura i. e. Agartala. Initially, Bangladesh was hesitating to allow India to provide <b>transhipment</b> <b>facility</b> for the north eastern region but India reciprocate it in right direction by providing similar facility to Bangladesh to reach the Himalayan landlocked countries like Nepal and Bhutan, thereby, actively participate in moving towards an integrated transport network for this region as a whole. The future opening of Myanmar route further gives some relief to India. Most of the cargo originates from Kolkata (Port) and terminates at Guwahati and distributed to various destinations of north eastern states. We try to investigate the pricing policy of such transhipment route for India in terms of a Bertrand type model with non homogeneous type cargo movement where the unit price of cargo transhipment taken as a proxy for such transhipment route. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the privatization and transhipment success at Freeport Container Port (FCP), Bahamas and Port of Port-of-Spain, Trinidad and Tobago (PPS). The thesis links port development and growth to the divergent governance structures {{of these two}} ports that share similar geographic advantages. FCP {{is located at the}} north-eastern apex of the transhipment triangle and {{is an example of a}} wholly private port, which is owned and operated by Hutchison Port Holdings (HPH), a subsidiary of Hutchison Whampoa. HPH is in a unique situation where they also act as the local government and own large expanses of land and an airport. This unparalleled level of private self-determination has allowed HPH to develop FCP into a very successful <b>transhipment</b> <b>facility.</b> PPS, on the other hand, has been struggling while its competitors continue to gain despite its strategic position at the south-eastern apex of the "Caribbean Transhipment Triangle. " PPS, until recently, was owned and operated by Trinidad and Tobago's public port authority. Its restructuring program had lasted 13 years and did not meet the goals of the government. The traffic growth at PPS has paled in comparison to FCP, and the governance structures have played a key role in these differences.

50|$|The {{line between}} Berlin and Boizenburg was opened on 15 October 1846 {{and it was}} the first railway line in Mecklenburg. The {{connection}} to Hamburg was completed on 15 December 1846. Stations were opened along with the line in Mecklenburg in Grabow, Ludwigslust, Hagenow, Brahlstorf and Boizenburg. In the first years of operation on the line, Grabow was on the customs border between Mecklenburg and Prussia. The establishment of the North German Confederation in 1867 created a customs union and the controls were abolished. Navigation on the Elde was improved in the Grabow area in 1868. In response, a <b>transhipment</b> <b>facility</b> was established at the railway bridge in the southern part of the station precinct, where a crane transhipped goods between boats and rail wagons. However, demand remained low and the crane was dismantled in 1885. The area around the station was gradually developed in the second half of the 19th century. The Kießerdamm between the city and station was paved and an avenue of lime trees was built along it for pedestrians. A barrel factory was built at the station in 1858 and the district court and post office were built on Kießerdamm in the following decades. A residential area was established beyond the station in 1890. There had been aspirations in the first decades after the construction of the line for another line running from Dömitz via Grabow to Parchim and Waren (Müritz); instead the neighbouring Ludwigslust station developed as a railway junction from 1880. As a result, Grabow Station was left behind compared with Ludwigslust.|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of the 1991 Persian Gulf war, between mid-January and June 1991, the Persian Gulf was {{contaminated}} with an estimated 4 to 6 million barrels of crude oil, released directly into the Gulf from refinement <b>facilities,</b> <b>transhipment</b> terminals, and moored tankers along the coast of Kuwait, and precipitated from oil fire smoke plumes. To assess the environmental impact of the oil, an international team of marine scientists representing 14 nations was assembled {{under the auspices of the}} United Nations International Oceanic Commission and the Regional Organization for Protection of the Marine Environment to conduct detailed surveys of the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Gulf of Oman, including hydrographic, chemical, and biological measurements. To supplement the field surveys and to serve as an aid in data interpretation, astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis photographed water features and coastal habitats in the Persian Gulf during mission STS- 45 (24 March to 02 April 1992). The astronauts collected 111 hand-held, color photographs of the Gulf (72 70 -mm photographs and 39 5 -inch photographs) from an altitude of 296 km (160 n. mi.). The photographs reveal distributions in water turbidity associated with outflow from the Shatt-al-Arab and water circulation along the entire coast of Iran and the Strait of Hormuz, coastal wetlands and shallow-water habitats, and sticks appearing in the sunglint pattern, which appear to be oil...|$|R
50|$|A tramway was {{proposed}} in northerly direction to Boco Siding on the Emu Bay Railway, over {{a distance of}} 8 miles km. Originally planned to be laid with iron rails, it was eventually opened as a horse tram in 1902 with timber rails. The tramway could handle the transportation of the ore at reasonable cost, but as output from the mine increased, was unable to handle the traffic. A shorter route to the railway was surveyed, running {{on the north side}} of the Pieman River. The steel-railed steam tramway line was constructed by Dunkley Brothers, who were well known in Tasmania for their activities in the timber industry and was taken in service in 1909. It met the Emu Bay Railway at Farrell Siding, which was located on a continuous 1:40 grade as that railway dropped down to the Pieman River bridge. Therefore, complicated <b>transhipment</b> <b>facilities</b> needed to be erected.|$|E
5000|$|The CFBS {{operates}} {{its network}} with meter-gauge track, but dual-gauge track remains between the station Noyelles and Saint-Valery Port. <b>Transhipment</b> <b>facilities</b> for cargo still exist in Noyelles {{that are used}} in every Steam Festival.The various lines are single track, with passing loops in the station, allowing trains to cross.Except Noyelles station, equipped with a mechanical signaling system of the old SNCF type, there is little signalling on the line, and traffic safety is ensured by instructions.

30|$|These {{overall results}} are {{astonishing}} because transport logistics hubs – see, for instance, <b>transhipment</b> <b>facilities</b> of freight forwarders – bear a significant meaning in freight transport (see chapter 2). The absence of relevant hubs leads to less detailed modelling of, for example, commodity flows and, thus, transport processes. Less detail leads to less explanatory power and, therefore, to less sensitivity of models. This directly impacts {{the ability of}} models to estimate transport forecasts more precisely or to deal with different policy measures and, thus, to assess their effects on transport accurately.|$|E
40|$|Time series {{methods are}} used to study the {{dynamics}} of regional, export-wheat, railroad rates linking seven central US regions to Texas Gulf ports. Research focuses on the extent and nature of regional rate interactions to determine whether regional rail transportation rates are established independently, through interaction and/or dominated by several regional leaders. Analysis is carried out on 1988 - 1994 public waybill data for seven Business Economic Areas (BEA) located in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and Colorado: these regions originate {{virtually all of the}} eight million tons of hard red winter wheat annually shipped to Texas Gulf ports. Results show all rail transportation markets linked in varying degrees. Some regions are near-independent or highly exogenous regarding rate-setting, while others interact with and to rates established in other regions. Regions that are dominated by a single carrier tend to be more independent and insulated regarding rate-setting. Export rates in regions dominated by the Union Pacific (UP) generally account for a significant variation in the rates of other regions. Data show the UP to have been aggressive in providing incentives for country elevators to consolidate for purposes of making unit train shipments, thus their presumed influence on rates of other regions. As expected, export rates for regions with substantial storage and <b>transhipment</b> <b>facilities</b> are sensitive to export rates of regions which ship to the <b>transhipment</b> <b>facilities.</b> Finally, results suggest that rate-setting in a particular region is in part a function of the dominant railroad's management and its aggressiveness, an expected outcome in an oligopolistic market. ...|$|E
40|$|The Suez Canal plays {{a pivotal}} role in today’s global {{container}} shipping network, in particularly in accommodating vessels sailing on the important Asia–Europe trade lane. This paper analyses to what extent and for which trade lanes the Cape route could develop into a competitive alternative to the Suez route. The market potential of the Cape route is analysed using a distance analysis, a transit time analysis and a generalized cost analysis for a large set of O/D relations. We compare vessel interlining via the port of Algeciras with interlining via the new port of Ngqura in South Africa. The results show that the Cape route has the potential to serve {{as an alternative to the}} Suez route on 11 trade lanes. A scenario and sensitivity analysis reveals that interlining via a hub near the Cape is expected to become more competitive due to a combination of higher Suez Canal transit fees, better vessel economics, higher bunker costs, slow steaming practices and subject to a more competitive terminal pricing strategy of southern African <b>transhipment</b> <b>facilities.</b> The expected emergence of the Cape route should be seen as the embodiment of a promising development of south–south trade volumes between Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and South America...|$|E
