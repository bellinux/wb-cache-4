5|$|After Urus {{release and}} Uru Lives demise, Cyan {{announced}} that new content would be added via expansion packs. The first, Uru: To D'ni, added the never-released Uru Live online content, thus {{focusing on the}} past of the D'ni. Uru: <b>The</b> <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shell, extended the story of Uru {{in the present and}} added multiple never-before-seen Ages. Unlike the first expansion pack, Uru: <b>The</b> <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shell was not free, but was boxed and sold in stores. Uru, To Dni, and <b>The</b> <b>Path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Shell were also packaged together and sold as Uru: The Complete Chronicles.|$|E

Five homes and three barns were {{destroyed}} by the tornado and two people, 80-year-old Mrs. Mary Hibbs and an unknown woman, were killed; six additional people were injured. Orchards in <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tornado were completely destroyed and greenhouses were leveled. The severity of lightning during the storm caused many women to faint according to The New York Times.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons.

There, the trees would serve as a barrier between the road and the surrounding properties, masking the road from view and muffling the sounds of traffic. A Norman landscaping firm performed the work, which included thirty months of maintenance, for a total cost of $288.50 per tree ($544.19 in 2013 dollars).|$|E

5|$|Outside {{the walls}} {{a series of}} semicircular defense lines were {{constructed}} in <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese advance, most notably an outer one about sixteen kilometers (10 miles) {{from the city and}} an inner one directly outside the city known as the Fukuo Line, or multiple positions line. The Fukuo Line, a sprawling network of trenches, moats, barbed wire, mine fields, gun emplacements, and pillboxes, was to be the final defense line outside Nanking's city walls. There were also two key high points of land on the Fukuo Line, the peaks of Zijinshan to the northeast and the plateau of Yuhuatai to the south, where fortification was especially dense. In order to deny the Japanese invaders any shelter or supplies in this area, Tang adopted a strategy of scorched earth on December 7, ordering all homes and structures in <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese within one to two kilometers (1.2 miles) of the city to be incinerated, as well as all homes and structures near roadways within sixteen kilometers (10 miles) of the city.|$|E

In the feature race, he spun into <b>the</b> <b>path</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field exiting the first corner, and was struck head-on by Ho-Pin Tung, sustaining a fractured second lumbar vertebra in the process.

Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked. Incident management teams were also established {{to help people}} {{in the wake of the}} storm. Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake of the storm. In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses.|$|E

The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E

Likewise, Gellibrand held McCay in high regard. Gellibrand returned to the Western Front on 14 November 1917, taking over command of the 12th Infantry Brigade vice Brigadier General James Campbell Robertson, who was returning to Australia on leave. He soon placed his own distinctive stamp on his new command.
