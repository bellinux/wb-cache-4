25|$|Maqam Mahour, {{which is}} related to Maqam Rast, is applied when someone is angry and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of {{emotional}} instability. The only two parashiot to have this maqam applied is Toledot and Balak when the main characters, Esau and Balak respectively, are angered. This maqam is used in other instances according to the manuscripts of Hakham Moshe Ashear and Cantor Gabriel A. Shrem.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} are depicted neither as purely good or evil: for example, Rosie in [...] "The Super" [...] triumphs over the racist, abusive superintendent by stealing his money, having him framed for pedophilia, and driving him to suicide. [...] Confinement is a prominent theme; Eisner chooses perspectives {{through which the}} reader views the characters framed by doorways, window frames, or sheets of rain. [...] Frimme Hersh seeks freedom from oppressive Eastern European antisemitism; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of elation for characters in the final story as they find {{their way out of}} the tenement's, and the city's, confinement.|$|E

"A person {{traveling}} {{among the}} Southern people realizes that {{though they have}} been whipped by the North, yet <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of enmity existing in their bosoms, which only needs a little breeze to inflame their passions to deeds of carnage and strife." ...|$|E

2500|$|Attempting {{to achieve}} {{recognition}} of the [...] "Circassian genocide" [...] {{is also a very}} prominent movement among Circassians, though it is not necessarily purely nationalist. Another major movement, often tied into this, but more blatantly nationalistic, is the movement to recreate a [...] "historical Circassia", the core of Circassian nationalism, with its historical territories, and make Circassian one group on the census. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> among some Circassians that the notion that Kabardins, Adyghe, Cherkes and Shapsugs (all four are separate on the Russian census) are different nations is a Kremlin strategy designed to divide the Circassian nation. Many politicians even warn that if this is not removed, that [...] "dismemberment will ultimately lead to the death of the Circassian nation". Many Circassian nationalists (moderates, such as Cherkesov) do not advocate withdrawing from the Russian federation, holding instead that a unified Circassia still within Russia is good enough. Nonetheless, most assert that this unified Circassia within Russia should have one official language, Adyghe.|$|E

50|$|In a 1999 {{study of}} 167 adult Korean adoptees by The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, group {{discussions about the}} topic of {{how they felt about}} South Korea led to many feelings. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> anger about the {{negative}} way Koreans view adopted Koreans. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> concern over Korean orphans in South Korean orphanages, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of obligation to help the Korean orphans who remained in the South Korean orphanages. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of responsibility to change Koreans' views of domestic adoption, so that adopting an orphan in South Korea would not be something that Koreans in South Korea would be ashamed of doing.|$|R
60|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{of misery}} {{over all the}} house. The {{children}} breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were rather disconsolate, {{did not know what}} to do, what to play at.|$|R

60|$|The boats lay close together, rolling {{gently on}} the languid swell, while the men sat in relaxed attitudes and talked in low voices.

60|$|All {{the time}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{of sadness and}} warmth, and a certain {{tenderness}} in the house, whilst William and Lily were at home. But often he got irritable. She had brought, for an eight-days' stay, five dresses and six blouses.|$|R
60|$|They all {{understood}} {{him very}} well--the German, the Irishman, Medlicot's foreman, Medlicot himself, and even Jacko; and though, no doubt, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> within {{the hearts of}} the men that Harry Heathcote was imperious, still they respected him, and they believed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for this short {{enumeration}} of my strength, Blodget, since it gives me new assurance of my people's fidelity.

60|$|For {{an instant}} I hung in mid air. There {{is a strange}} {{sensation}} connected with an experience of that nature which is quite difficult to describe.

6000|$|... "I care {{nothing about}} their learning, Archibald; but 'tis a {{wonderful}} power that can create such worlds, and control {{them in their}} wanderings.

60|$|The Genoese {{frowned at}} the boldness with which Francis spoke, but at heart agreed in the sentiments he expressed; for among the Genoese officers, generally, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> that this brutal {{execution}} in cold blood <b>was</b> <b>an</b> impolitic, {{as well as a}} disgraceful deed.|$|R
2500|$|Marine Andrew Michael Lee {{later said}} {{he and the other}} British prisoners were treated well and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of respect between the two sides: [...] "They bore us no malice.

60|$|The first {{change of}} {{expression}} which relaxed the iron tensity of the housekeeper's face showed itself {{when she heard}} that reply.

60|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> still half-existing, but now half-conquered by {{the force}} of human nature, that a woman should be ashamed of her love till the husband's right to her compels her to {{acknowledge}} it.

6000|$|Yes! on a death-bed <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> {{which may}} make all things appear but as puns and equivocations.

This belongs to human nature as such, independently of associations and habits from any particular rank of life or mode of employment; and in this consist Shakspeare's vulgarisms, as in Macbeth's-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, for {{ten minutes}} we kept up that kind of {{restaurant}} repartee.

60|$|Three mornings {{later she}} was seated in the garden with a frame of fancy work. Sometimes she put it down. The weather was overcast, langourous, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of rain in the air. Chiltern came in through the gaffe, and looked at her.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> of delicacy--a backwoods {{etiquette}} which restrained {{them from}} following him to offer assistance; the court records, from which, mainly, this narrative is drawn, are silent as to {{anything but the}} fact.

6000|$|... "No, I don't," [...] {{answered}} Olive, [...] "except that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>feeling</b> in {{that direction}} {{in the case of}} Mr. Hemphill. I suppose Mrs. Easterfield has told you that when I was a schoolgirl I was deeply in love with him; and now, when I think of those old times, I believe it would not be impossible for those old sentiments to return.
