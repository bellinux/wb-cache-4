Object-oriented design firmly relies on abstract classes. They represent the key design decisions that structure a system in the large. An abstract class represents the interface to a whole <b>class</b> <b>tree.</b> This interface is often sufficient for clients to work with objects of the <b>class</b> <b>tree.</b> Only for selecting classes of the <b>class</b> <b>tree</b> and creating objects of them, concrete subclasses of the abstract class have to be named. If this is done by clients of the abstract class, they become dependent on the <b>class</b> <b>tree's</b> internal structure. Changes of class names and <b>class</b> <b>tree</b> structure force clients to be changed. Therefore, the <b>class</b> <b>tree</b> behind an abstract class should be hidden from all clients of that class. If a client's knowledge is restricted to the abstract class only, all dependencies on subclasses are cut. This has seve [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a model-based {{hierarchical}} clustering algorithm that automatically builds a regression <b>class</b> <b>tree</b> for the well-known speaker adaptation technique- Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR). When building a regression <b>class</b> <b>tree,</b> the mean vectors of the Gaussian {{components of the}} model set of a speaker independent CDHMM-based speech recognition system are collected as the input data for clustering. The proposed algorithm comprises two stages. First, the input data (i. e., all the Gaussian mean vectors of the CDHMMs) is iteratively partitioned by a divisive hierarchical clustering strategy, and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is applied {{to determine the number}} of clusters (i. e., the base classes of the regression <b>class</b> <b>tree).</b> Then, the regression <b>class</b> <b>tree</b> is built by iteratively merging these base clusters using an agglomerative hierarchical clustering strategy, which also uses BIC as the merging criterion. We evaluated the proposed regression <b>class</b> <b>tree</b> construction algorithm on a Mandarin Chinese continuous speech recognition task. Compared to the regression <b>class</b> <b>tree</b> implementation in HTK, the proposed algorithm is more effective in building the regression <b>class</b> <b>tree</b> and can determine the number of regression classes automatically...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three parts. In the first part we look at Hopf algebras. We classify pointed rank one Hopf algebras over fields of prime characteristic which are generated as algebras by the first term of the coradical filtration. These Hopf algebras were classified by Radford and Krop for fields of characteristic zero. We obtain three types of Hopf algebras presented by generators and relations. The third type is new and has not previously appeared in literature. The second part of this thesis deals with Auslander-Reiten theory of finitedimensional algebras over fields. We consider G -transitive algebras and develop necessary conditions {{for them to have}} Auslander-Reiten components with Euclidean <b>tree</b> <b>class.</b> Thereby a result in [F 3, 4. 6] is corrected and generalized. We apply these results to G -transitive blocks of the universal enveloping algebras of restricted p -Lie algebras. Finally we deduce a condition for a smash product of a local basic algebra Λ with a commutative semi-simple group algebra to have components with Euclidean <b>tree</b> <b>class,</b> in terms of the components of the Auslander-Reiten quiver of Λ. In the last part we introduce and analyze Auslander-Reiten components for the bounded derived category of a finite-dimensional algebra.
