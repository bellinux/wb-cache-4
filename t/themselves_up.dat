5|$|A year later, the Red Sox {{entered the}} final {{series of the}} season at Yankee Stadium needing only one win over the Yankees {{to advance to the}} World Series. The Red Sox found <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> by one game with two games left against the Yankees at Yankee Stadium. The Sox lost 5–3 {{on the last day of}} the season after falling 5–4 the {{previous}} day, resulting in the Yankees winning their 16th American League pennant.

5|$|One tourism {{activity}} {{unique to the}} Arctic North is iceberg watching. During the summer season of April to July, {{it is possible to}} watch icebergs moving down rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the icy water and amphibious animals often bring <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.|$|E
5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> at Poros {{and invited}} Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue {{negotiations}} over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and Euboea. The British opposed this plan. Thus {{it was left to}} the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E
5|$|The story, partly {{inspired}} by the life of Brubaker's uncle, is set in 1948 and stars Charlie Parish, a Hollywood screenwriter suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and fronting for his blacklisted best friend, Gil. When Charlie wakes from a blackout {{in the same room}} as a murdered starlet, he and Gil set out to bring her killer to justice.

5|$|To prevent Jewish {{violence}} from further escalating, Agrippa assembled the populace and delivered a tearful {{speech to the}} crowd in the company of his sister, but the Jews alienated their sympathies when the insurgents burned down their palaces. They fled the city to Galilee where they later gave <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> to the Romans. Meanwhile, Cestius Gallus moved into the region with the twelfth legion, but was unable to restore order and suffered defeat at the battle of Beth-Horon, forcing the Romans to retreat from Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Bluto and D-Day {{steal the}} answers to an {{upcoming}} test from the trash, not realizing that the Omegas have planted a fake set of answers for them to find. The Deltas fail the exam, and their grade-point averages fall so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter. To cheer <b>themselves</b> <b>up,</b> the Deltas organize a toga party and bring in Otis Day and the Knights to provide live music. Wormer's wife attends at Otter's invitation and has sex with him.

5|$|In 66, the Jews of the Judaea Province revolted {{against the}} Roman Empire. Cestius Gallus, the legate of Syria, {{was forced to}} retreat from Jerusalem and {{defeated}} {{at the battle of}} Beth-Horon. The pro-Roman king Agrippa II and his sister Berenice fled the city to the Galilee where they later gave <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> to the Romans. Nero appointed Vespasian to put down the rebellion, who was dispatched to the region at once with the fifth and tenth legions. He was later joined by Titus at Ptolemais, bringing with him the fifteenth legion. With a strength of 60,000 professional soldiers, the Romans quickly swept across the Galilee, and by 68 marched on Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Later in the advance, Maxwell learnt from an English-speaking {{prisoner}} that a {{group of}} Germans in the adjacent post wished to surrender, but were afraid to give <b>themselves</b> <b>up.</b> Accompanied by two privates and the prisoner—who was to act as an interpreter—Maxwell approached the post. The three Australians, however, were immediately surrounded by a group of twenty German soldiers and disarmed. They seemed set to become prisoners themselves, before an artillery barrage fell on the position. Taking advantage of the resulting confusion, Maxwell pulled out a concealed revolver and shot two of the Germans before escaping with his men under heavy rifle fire; one of the privates was subsequently wounded. Organising a party of men, he immediately attacked and captured the post.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, RhAR patrols in the Chaah, Labis, Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were stepped up to last between 10 and 18 days each, but {{contacts}} with the communist forces remained rare. The constant patrols gradually began to take their toll on the insurgents, and guerrillas began to give <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> increasingly frequently. A contributing factor here was Britain's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957, which dented the motivation of many fighters. Starting in October 1957, the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region. The ex-insurgents were supposed to lead the security forces to MNLA camps and resting places, but this strategy was not successful. The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex-MNLA men.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra protested against Pedrarias' {{aggression}} but judged his own forces {{insufficient to}} attack Pedrarias' men in Olancho. Pedrarias in turn sent messengers {{to demand that}} Saavedra and the town council of Trujillo submit to his rule. The Spanish Crown was now taking a direct interest in the chaotic state of affairs in Central America. It was taking efforts to place Crown officials as governors, and creating colonial organisations such as the audiencias to impose absolute government over territories claimed by Spain. In so doing, it ended the era of distinguished conquistadors setting <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> as overlords of territories they had conquered. On 30 August 1526, the Diego López de Salcedo was appointed by the Crown as governor of Honduras. He left Santo Domingo in early September, and the Audiencia ordered all rival claimants out of the colony.|$|E

5|$|The al-Banna family's {{commercial}} experience, and {{the money}} they had managed to take with them, meant they could set <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> in business again, Melman writes. Their orange groves, however, had gone, {{now part of the}} new state of Israel, which had declared its independence on 14 May 1948. The family moved to Nablus in the West Bank, then under Jordanian control. Abu Nidal graduated from high school there in 1955, and joined the Arab nationalist Ba'ath party. He began a degree course in engineering at Cairo University, but left without a degree after two years.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{continued}} to be an active military installation throughout the British period. It {{was the scene of}} a mutiny in 1807 when Albanian soldiers of the Froberg Regiment revolted and shut <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> in Fort Ricasoli. Despite attempts at negotiation they eventually blew up the main gunpowder magazine, causing extensive damage to the fort in the process. The mutiny was quashed by loyal troops, and some of the mutineers were condemned to death by court martial. The damaged parts of the fort were repaired, but were not rebuilt to their original design. A new magazine was built in 1829 to replace the one destroyed in the mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Later, Alan and Joanna are {{stopped by}} a {{policeman}} on suspicion of stealing the campervan. Joanna gets her peanut-butter sandwich and smears it in the policeman's face. Alan and Joanna have an argument about the minute odds of the policeman having a peanut allergy and going into anaphylaxis, while in the background this is actually happening. They then carry {{the body of the}} policeman into the van. Soon, having run out of food and petrol, Alan changes the engine to run on alcohol and fermented excrement. The plan is of no use however, as the van explodes. They soon reach the beach and Joanna gives Alan three options: Give <b>themselves</b> <b>up,</b> swim the Channel to Spain or commit suicide. As Alan is not keen on the Spanish, they choose the third option and they are last seen walking naked into the sea, presumably to their deaths - although the alternate ending shows them hanging on to a buoy sometime later.|$|E

Her attempt to {{eliminate}} him is thwarted when he starts to drown, alerting Jessica with his screams. Jessica and Jo rescue Kator and take {{him back to the}} house. While the two women clean <b>themselves</b> <b>up,</b> Kator kills and consumes Wally. Jessica tells Jo that she is no longer willing to be controlled and is leaving with Anders. Outraged, Jo knocks Jessica unconscious and runs into the woods to dig a grave for her. On waking, Jessica seduces Kator. As they start to have sex, Kator's predatory instincts are stirred, causing him to revert to his natural form and tear open Jessica's throat, killing her. Having returned to the house, Jo attempts to flee but falls into the open grave and presumably meets a similarly violent end.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{elevation}} as premier Heffron, {{following an}} approved motion from the 1958 state conference, reanimated the longstanding Labor policy {{to abolish the}} Legislative Council of New South Wales by announcing a statewide referendum on this question. Heffron had long supported this policy from his Langite days, seeing the council as an outdated bastion of conservative privilege, a position that was echoed by trade union official {{and member of the}} Legislative Council, Tom Dougherty, who had pushed through a rule at the 1952 state conference that banned MLCs from becoming members of the state party executive. However, Heffron's efforts found <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> against significant opposition, not only from the Liberal and Country parties but also within the Labor party itself. Indeed, when the 'Constitution Amendment (Legislative Council Abolition) Bill' came before the Legislative Council on 2 December 1959, the council resolved 33 votes to 25 to send it back to the Legislative Assembly on the grounds that such a bill should have originated in the council. This was passed with the support of seven Labor councillors crossing the floor (including Cyril Cahill, Anne Press and Donald Cochrane), who were all subsequently expelled from the party and formed the Independent Labor Group.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 25 July, {{information}} arrived at Arrah that a disturbance {{was to be expected}} in the district. Wake had been told by a railway engineer stationed nearby that the boats used to cross the Son River would be destroyed; when Wake was informed {{on the morning of the}} 26th that the mutineers were crossing the river, he realised that the boats had in fact not been destroyed as promised. Wake, who had no information about the number of mutinying sepoys and other forces approaching Arrah, noted that the local police force had disappeared and he decided not to abandon the town. Eighteen civilians and fifty members of the Bengal Military Police Battalion moved into Boyle's fortified building and bricked <b>themselves</b> <b>up</b> inside. The building had stores of food, drink and ammunition (with gunpowder and lead to make more if required), entrenching tools and weapons the men had brought with them. The supplies were thought to be sufficient for a few days and, since they expected the mutineers to be followed by pursuing forces, the men anticipated a brief siege of no more than 48 hours. Throughout the entire siege Wake kept a diary by writing on the walls of the building so there would be a record of events if the besieged party did not survive. On the morning of 27 July the mutineers, joined by Kunwar Singh and his forces, arrived in Arrah. They released the prisoners from the jail and, joined by its guards, looted the treasury of 85,000 rupees. The mutineers and rebels (including the prison guards) then surrounded the house with drums and bugles playing, arranged themselves into formation and charged. When the mutineers were within 100 yards the men inside opened fire on them, killing eighteen instantly and forcing the rest to stop their charge and take shelter behind the surrounding trees and buildings.|$|E
