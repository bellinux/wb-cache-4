5|$|A person named Shekhar {{approaches}} Shankar {{and through}} him, he informs Mallikharjun, the local Superintendent of police {{that he is}} the witness of the murder of environmentalist Prakash by Damodar. Damodar influences all the witnesses including Shekhar before Shankar could arrest him. He later comes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Raja Rao's son Bharath, the previous district collector committed suicide along with his wife, who was a friend of Prakash, because of defamation and personal attacks when Bharath tried to stop the power project.|$|E
5|$|Anne had {{explained}} before {{that she did}} not wish the public <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> her relationship with Sarah was failing, because any sign that Sarah was out of favour would have a damaging impact on the Duke of Marlborough's authority as Captain-General. Sarah was kept in all of her offices – purely for the sake of her husband's position as Captain-General of the army – and the tension between the two women lingered on until early in 1711. This year was to see the end of their relationship for good.|$|E
5|$|I {{have come}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I {{do not believe that the}} German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the great majority of German soldiers and officers.|$|E

She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has {{genuinely}} {{fallen in love with}} Krishna, he leaves, dejected.|$|E
5|$|The central {{discussion}} {{within the}} poem is {{on the nature of}} time and salvation. Eliot emphasises the need of the individual to focus on the present moment and <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there is a universal order. By understanding the nature of time and the order of the universe, mankind is able to recognise God and seek redemption. Many reviewers of Burnt Norton focused on the uniqueness and beauty of the poem. However, others complained that the poem does not reflect Eliot's earlier greatness and that the use of Christian themes harmed the poem.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, the {{development}} of Theory of Mind {{may play a role}} in emotional development. Theory of Mind is the ability <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the experience of knowledge and intention lies behind human actions such as facial expressions. Although it is reported that very young infants have different responses to humans than to non-human objects, Theory of Mind develops relatively gradually and possibly results from predictable interactions with adults. However, some ability of this kind must be in place before mutual communication through gaze or other gesture can occur, as it does by seven to nine months. Some neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, have been attributed to the absence of the mental functions that underlie Theory of Mind. It is possible that the congenital absence of this ability, or the lack of experiences with caregivers who communicate in a predictable fashion, could underlie {{the development}} of reactive attachment disorder.|$|E
5|$|His brother Manuel Silvestre Alberti {{signed the}} popular {{petition}} formulated on 25 May that aimed to draft {{the composition of}} the Primera Junta that would replace Cisneros in power. On that day Alberti moved to Azcuénaga's house and from it he observed the events in the plaza, along with many other patriots gathered there. He was there when he came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he was chosen {{as a member of the}} new Junta. The reasons of Alberti's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists, and Alberti in particular may have been elected to serve as chaplain of the government.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E

5|$|Meera (Ayesha Takia), {{a simple}} Rajasthani Hindu woman, has {{everything}} {{in her life}} in accordance with customs and traditions: her formative years, her recent marriage into a traditional Rajasthani family and her daily chores {{within the walls of}} her haveli. Coincidentally, her husband, Shankar, is in Saudi Arabia, his new workplace. Meera finds it tough without her husband but they manage to stay in touch. Shankar regularly sends his wages home to support his family that includes his father, Randhir Singh (Girish Karnad), mother, Gowri Singh (Prateeksha Lonkar), his paternal grandmother (Uttara Baokar) and Meera. One day, Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar. Time passes and when there are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from her husband, Meera gets worried. When frantic inquiries are made, she is devastated <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Shankar was killed in a freak accident that was allegedly caused by his Muslim roommate.|$|E
5|$|Next, Surya helps Laalu {{to become}} the Mayor of Mumbai by {{defeating}} Arun Ghokle, endorsed by Ghanapuleti Jai Dev, a powerful national politician who wants {{to become the}} new prime minister of India in the upcoming elections. Ghokle then reveals Jai Dev's illegal activities to Bhardwaj, after which he is killed by Jai Dev. After the meeting, Surya comes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Jai Dev is planning to kill Bhardwaj and Chitra. He reaches Chitra's house and saves her but fails to save Bhardwaj. Chitra is devastated and Surya reveals to her that he was an American-born Indian who lost his philanthropist NRI father and mother at an early age; they were cheated and killed by Jai Dev. This incident and the peoples' attitudes towards orphans while growing up made him hate that society.|$|E
5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves tried {{to break into the}} Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves {{had a change of heart}} and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E

5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. Its ultimate failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither group could ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power well enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> their policies might be crippling it; second, the American military leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.|$|E
5|$|Sathyamurthy (Sivakumar), a nineteen-year-old {{who lives}} with his uncle Murugan (V. S. Raghavan), is unable to retain any job due to his honest nature. He becomes acquainted with Gopal, with whose {{recommendation}} he becomes Raju's personal house servant. When Sathyamurthy displays his mother's photograph at his house to pray for her, it is revealed that Sathyamurthy {{is the son of}} Raju and Parvathi. Parvathi had survived the accident, was cared for by Murugan and died a few years after giving birth to Sathyamurthy without divulging the identity of Raju to Sathyamurthy and Murugan. Sathyamurthy improves his reading and writing skills with the help of Sundaram's daughter, Gowri (Bharathi Vishnuvardhan) and the two fall in love. When Raju learns of their love, he approves of their marriage. Gopal comes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Sathyamurthy is Raju's son, but dies of a sudden heart attack before revealing it.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionaries started {{negotiations}} with the Chinese government through James Dietrich, who held Sun Yat-sen's power of attorney, to buy a million rifles. However, the deal fell through when it was realised that the weapons offered were obsolete flintlocks and muzzle loaders. From China, Gupta went to Japan to try to procure arms and to enlist Japanese support for the Indian independence movement. However, he was forced into hiding within 48 hours when he came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese authorities planned to hand {{him over to the}} British.

5|$|The {{story begins}} where The Immortals of Meluha ended. Shiva, the fabled {{savior of the}} land of Meluha, rushes to save his wife Sati from the Naga, the {{supposed}} killer of Shiva's friend Brahaspati. The Naga escapes, leaving behind coins with strange engravings. After consulting with Sati's father Daksha and Dilipa, the king of Ayodhya, they come <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the coin belongs to King Chandraketu, the ruler {{of the land of}} Branga in eastern India. Shiva and Sati travel to Kashi, where a community of Brangas inhabit, in order to get more information on the Nagas. They are accompanied in their journey by Shiva's General Parvateshwar, his associates Nandi and Veerbhadra, Ayurvati the doctor, and Bhagirath and Anandamayi, the prince and princess of Ayodhya. At Kashi, Parvateshwar gets mortally injured while trying to pacify a riot at the Branga community. The Branga leader Divodas administers a medicine on Parvateshwar; it works and the General is healed, but Shiva comes to know from Ayurvati that it contains herbs which is only available at Panchavati, the capital of the Nagas. He consults with Divodas and comes <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Branga suffers from a mortal plague, which has led them to ally with the Nagas, in return for benefits. Shiva decides to travel to Branga but Divodas informs him that to reach there special ships need to be made, which would take about six months.|$|E
5|$|Uanna {{also looked}} after {{security}} at other bases {{that might be}} used by the 509th in an emergency, such as Iwo Jima. He supervised the loading of the Little Boy bomb into the Enola Gay, and during the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, {{he was in charge of}} a communications center on Iwo Jima that relayed messages back to Tinian. He was therefore one of the first people <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Hiroshima was the target, and that it had been attacked. After the subsequent unconditional surrender of Japan, he accompanied the Manhattan Project team sent to survey the damage, spending four weeks in Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Wanting readers <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{the stone}} mask and its powers {{would be what}} would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show the invisible; {{he came up with}} the idea of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E
