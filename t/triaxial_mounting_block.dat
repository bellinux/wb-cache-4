With {{the invention of the}} automobile, {{the need for}} the public <b>mounting</b> <b>block</b> vanished and they now are used exclusively by equestrians or retained as historic features at old inns, kirks, etc.|$|R

50|$|A <b>mounting</b> <b>block,</b> horse block, or in Scots a loupin'-on-stane is an {{assistance}} for mounting and dismounting a horse or cart, {{especially for the}} young, elderly or infirm. They were especially useful for women riding sidesaddle, allowing a horse to be mounted without a loss of modesty. They were frequently located outside churches or kirks {{for the use of}} parishioners attending services, etc. In Yorkshire some were built at the top of steep lanes, where the rider would remount after leading his horse up the slope.Mounting blocks today are primarily used by modern equestrians who are a) beginners b) people who have difficulty mounting (either a tall horse, a short person, or someone with some mobility impairments) and c) people who feel that use of a <b>mounting</b> <b>block</b> reduces strain on the spine of the horse, particularly at the withers. Modern <b>mounting</b> <b>blocks</b> are usually made of wood or of molded plastic.|$|R
