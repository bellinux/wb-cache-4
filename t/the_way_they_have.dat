25|$|Saudi Arabian {{police and}} {{immigration}} authorities routinely abuse {{people who are}} stopped or detained, especially workers from developing countries. Earlier in November 2013, the authorities received criticism for <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> planned and handled the crackdown on illegal workers. Saudi authorities – in some cases {{with the help of}} citizens – rounded up many of illegal workers and physically abused them.|$|E
25|$|In the Mark Millar penned Fantastic Four 566-569, Doom {{received}} a significant power upgrade. He was thrown {{back in time}} (perhaps about 50million years) by the Marquis of Death. Doom then fought through time and space {{to get back to}} the present to seek revenge on the Marquis of Death. Doom stated, as he killed the Marquis, he had rebuilt every molecule of his being and increased his power all to destroy the Marquis. In later issues, this seems to have been ignored, however, with writers treating Doctor Doom <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> always before in terms of power, the arc later retroactively being said to have been a dream had by Valeria Richards.|$|E
25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} review for PopMatters, Chris Conaton expressed disappointment in the album's predictability, noting, [...] "At this point it’s {{pretty clear that}} the band is comfortably ensconced in their lifestyle and content to just keep doing things <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been for years." [...] In a lukewarm review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek observed, [...] "there is something here for virtually every fan -- or detractor -- to grab hold of." [...] Sputnikmusic criticized Mangini's drum parts, describing them as [...] "bland", {{as well as the}} decision to include three ballads, but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review.|$|E
2500|$|The {{importance}} of the story lies in any case {{not so much in}} its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis - in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> come to view themselves - and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity. But, [...] "even if one comes {{to the conclusion that the}} chronicle based on verbal transmission is not more than a legend, it still remains without doubt an extremely informative document for Parsee historiography." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Entertainment Weekly {{listed the}} show at #19 in the [...] "25 Best Cult TV Shows from the Past 25Years", saying, [...] "Supernatural began with a pretty {{straightforward}} premise – hot guys kill spooky things – but it didn't stay that way for long. The characters have literally been to hell and back, and along <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> woven a complicated and compelling mythology filled with friends (angel Castiel), recurring foes (demon Crowley), and inside jokes (Wincest!). Supernatural has also, however, dedicated episodes to mocking the sillier aspects of its own existence, like its hypercritical fandom. This self-referential approach has rewarded longtime viewers and helped build a community so passionate, it's almost scary." [...] The show has a broad demographic base and is more popular in Russia than the US.|$|E

2500|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{been adopted}} into Japanese, a single kanji {{may be used}} to write one or more {{different}} words – or, in some cases, morphemes – and thus the same character may be pronounced in different ways. From {{the point of view of}} the reader, kanji are said to have one or more different [...] "readings". Although more than one reading may become activated in the brain, deciding which reading is appropriate depends on recognizing which word it represents, which can usually be determined from context, intended meaning, whether the character occurs as part of a compound word or an independent word, and sometimes location within the sentence. For example, [...] is usually read kyō, meaning [...] "today", but in formal writing is instead read konnichi, meaning [...] "nowadays"; this is understood from context. Nevertheless, some cases are ambiguous and require a furigana gloss, which are also used simply for difficult readings or to specify a non-standard reading.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Sanjan {{group are}} {{believed}} to have been the first permanent settlers, the precise date of their arrival is a matter of conjecture. All estimates are based on the Qissa, which is vague or contradictory with respect to some elapsed periods. Consequently, three possible dates – 936, 765 and 716 – have been proposed as the year of landing, and the disagreement has been the cause of [...] "many an intense battle ... amongst Parsis". Since dates are not specifically mentioned in Parsi texts prior to the 18th century, any date of arrival is perforce a matter of speculation. The importance of the Qissa lies in any case not so much in its reconstruction of events than in its depiction of the Parsis – in <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> come to view themselves – and in their relationship to the dominant culture. As such, the text plays a crucial role in shaping Parsi identity. But, [...] "even if one comes {{to the conclusion that the}} chronicle based on verbal transmission is not more than a legend, it still remains without doubt an extremely informative document for Parsee historiography." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 October 2014, it was {{announced}} that West would be leaving the show in a [...] "dramatic" [...] storyline. Dominic Treadwell-Collins, executive producer, said of West's departure, [...] "When you have an actor of Tim's calibre joining your cast, you treasure every day that you have him - and we knew from the start that Stan's stay {{with the rest of the}} Carter family would be a finite one. But what a stay - and as we draw towards Stan's exit from the show, the audience should get ready as one of Britain's finest actors pulls out all the stops and gives his King Lear..." [...] It was reported on 2 November 2014 that Babe Smith (Annette Badland) would grow suspicious of Stan's whereabouts and when she discovers the truth, order him to tell his family. Over a week later, it {{was announced}} that Stan would confirm he has terminal prostate cancer to his family after Babe hastily tells them at Lee's birthday meal. These scenes were praised by Prostate Cancer UK. On 20 December 2014, Dyer revealed on The Graham Norton Show that Stan would ask Mick to help him die in a new euthanasia storyline. Dyer said, [...] "I'm juggling about eight storylines at the moment. My old man is on his way out. My mother's got Alzheimer's - she's not my mother, my sister's actually my mum. My dad dying - he's not my dad, he's actually my grandad - he wants me to smother him." [...] The prostate cancer began taking its effect on Stan's health on 23 January 2015 when Stan collapses in mid-commotion. Digital Spy Sophie Dainty reported in January 2015 that the Carters would clash over Stan's request to be killed by his family as Tina agrees to helping him, but Mick firmly disagrees. Mick even informs the family of Stan's request and they strongly disagree. Stan's request was made following his collapse. West praised show bosses for handling Stan's cancer storyline <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> and their way of handling West's decision to leave the show, [...] "They very kindly said I could have some time out and they would send me to South Africa or prison. But I suggested something finite like death so they decided it would be good for me to have a disease of which I would know about and one where it could be arranged for me to die in six months' time." ...|$|E

60|$|They {{gained the}} beach; {{they reached the}} ship whose very {{presence}} had continued unsuspected. The breeze was fresh and they stood away at once.

The palefaces learn more than the red-skins. That is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> learned how to get our hunting-grounds. That is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> learned to build their villages on the spots where our fathers killed the deer. That is <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> learned how to come and tell us that we are not Indians, but Jews. I wish to learn. Though old, my mind craves to know more. That I may know more, I will ask this medicine- man questions, and my brothers can open their ears, and learn a little, too, by what he answers. Perhaps we shall believe that we are not red-skins, but pale-faces. Perhaps we shall believe that our true hunting-grounds are not near the great lakes of sweet water, but under the rising sun. Perhaps we shall wish to go home, and to leave these pleasant openings for the pale faces to put their cabins on them, as the small-pox that they have also given to us, puts its sores on our bodies. Brother--" [...] turning toward the missionary-- [...] "listen. You say we are no longer Indians, but Jews: is this true of ALL red men, or only of the tribes whose chiefs are HERE?" ...|$|E

6000|$|The Transvaal Boers {{have been}} very much praised up {{by members of the}} Government in England, and others who are anxious to advance their interests, as against English interests.
