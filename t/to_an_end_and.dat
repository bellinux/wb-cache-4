5|$|As the Celtic {{domination}} in {{this part}} of Europe was coming <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> the borders of the Roman Empire had gotten much closer, the Przeworsk culture people were being subjected to the Greco-Roman world's influence with a rapidly growing intensity.|$|E
5|$|In the 7th century CE Persia {{succumbed to}} the invading Arabs. With the death of Yazdegerd III, who was treacherously slain in 651 after being {{defeated}} in battle, the Sassanid line came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> the Zoroastrian faith, which had been the state religion {{for more than a}} thousand years, was deposed, and Islam took its place as the national religion of Persia.|$|E
5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee {{the right to a}} jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E

5|$|However he {{struggled}} with poor form during the 1950–51 season as his first marriage was coming <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> he came into increasing conflict with his teammates. He was angered when the club sold Jackie Sewell to Sheffield Wednesday in March 1951 – breaking Lawton's own transfer record in the process – as he felt the move showed a lack of ambition from the club's directors. He {{also found that the}} well paid job he was promised outside of football did not transpire. His tally of nine goals in 31 games in 1950–51 and 13 goals in 31 games in 1951–52 was disappointing, and he was made available for transfer.|$|E
5|$|James {{achieved}} {{more success}} in foreign policy. Never having been {{at war with}} Spain, he devoted his efforts to bringing the long Anglo–Spanish War <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> a peace treaty was signed {{between the two countries}} in August 1604, thanks to skilled diplomacy on the part of Robert Cecil and Henry Howard, now Earl of Northampton, which James celebrated by hosting a great banquet. Freedom of worship for Catholics in England, however, continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance towards them.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{returned}} to the First Division when he joined Leeds United in November 1958 for a £14,000 fee. Manager Bill Lambton had hoped that Revie's creativity would help the Peacocks to turn their poor form around, and appointed him as captain. Leeds avoided relegation in 1958–59, but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959–60 campaign with the division's worst defensive record. Revie recognised his playing days were coming <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> relinquished the captaincy to Freddie Goodwin.|$|E

5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> that his future films and production methods would be different. His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} 12 April 1945 {{and proceeded to}} plan, as the three infantry brigades of the 49th Division leapfrogged {{each other through the}} city. Within four days Arnhem was totally under Allied control, allowing the Canadians to advance further into the Netherlands. Less than two weeks after the battle a general truce brought major combat operations in the country <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> on 5 May the German commander in chief in the Netherlands surrendered to the Canadian Army. Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered, bringing the war in Europe to a close.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory at}} Ulm {{did not end}} the war, since a large Russian army under Kutuzov was still near Vienna. The Russians withdrew to the {{northeast}} to await reinforcements and to link up with surviving Austrian units. The French followed and captured Vienna on 12 November. On 2 December the decisive French victory at Austerlitz removed Austria from the war. The resulting Treaty of Pressburg in late December brought the Third Coalition <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> left Napoleonic France as the major power in Central Europe, leading to the War of the Fourth Coalition with Prussia and Russia the following year.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{exiting the}} city, the establishments become {{a pair of}} {{shopping}} plazas centered around the intersection with the northern terminus of NY364. Across the town line in Hopewell a quarter-mile to the east, a third plaza, anchored by Runnings, formerly a Walmart, dominates {{the northeast corner of}} CR10 and Eastern Boulevard. On the adjacent parcel is another plaza containing the current Walmart. At the entrance to the second plaza, US20 and NY5 intersect Lakeshore Drive, the former routing of US20 and NY5 to the south of the bypass. Past the junction, the divided highway comes <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and,</b> after another half-mile, narrows to two lanes.|$|E
5|$|Walpole {{directed}} domestic policy, {{and after}} the resignation of his brother-in-law Townshend in 1730 also controlled George's foreign policy. Historians generally believe that George played an honorific role in Britain, and closely followed the advice of Walpole and senior ministers who made the major decisions. Although the king was eager for war in Europe, his ministers were more cautious. The Anglo-Spanish War was brought <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> George unsuccessfully pressed Walpole to join the War of the Polish Succession {{on the side of}} the German states. In April 1733, Walpole withdrew an unpopular excise bill that had gathered strong opposition, including from within his own party. George lent support to Walpole by dismissing the bill's opponents from their court offices.|$|E
5|$|With {{the signing}} of the Armistice on 11 November, the {{fighting}} came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately. To that end, Kentuckian was acquired by the United States Navy on 16 December, and commissioned on 28 January 1919 with Lieutenant Commander Carrol E. Higgins, NAR, in command. Before she could begin returning troops, though, Kentuckian had to undergo conversion from a cargo and animal ship. Though sources do not indicate the specific modifications Kentuckian underwent, typical conversions for other ships included the installation of berths for troops, and adding greatly expanded cooking and toilet facilities to handle the large numbers of men aboard. Similar modifications on a fellow American-Hawaiian cargo ship, the two-years-younger , took three months, but it is not known how long Kentuckians refit took.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} king, royal family, and chief noblemen, {{the church was}} {{a major force in}} Northumbria. Churchmen were not only figures of spiritual authority, they were major landowners, who also {{controlled}} trade, centred at major churches and monasteries in a land without cities and towns. The bishopric of Lindisfarne was held by Cuthbert at Aldfrith's accession; Cuthbert was succeeded by the Irish-educated Eadberht, who would later be Abbot of Iona and bring the Easter controversy <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> then by Eadfrith, creator of the Lindisfarne Gospels. The bishops of Lindisfarne sometimes held the see of Hexham, but during Aldfrith's reign it was held by John of Beverley, a pupil and protégé of Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury. The bishopric of York was held by Bosa in 685. Wilfrid was given the see in 687, but removed in 691 with Bosa returning to York. The short-lived see at Abercorn, created in 681 for Bishop Trumwine, collapsed in the period after Ecgfrith's death and the first known Bishop of Whithorn was appointed in the reign of King Ceolwulf. Important monasteries existed at Whitby, where the known abbesses tended to be members of the Deiran royal family, at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow, where Bede was a monk, and at Ripon.|$|E
5|$|Between 1970 and 1975, Sihanouk took up {{residence}} in state guesthouses at Beijing and Pyongyang, courtesy of the Chinese and North Korean governments, respectively. In February 1973 Sihanouk traveled to Hanoi, where he started on a long journey with Khieu Samphan and other Khmer Rouge leaders. The convoy proceeded along the Ho Chi Minh trail and reached the Cambodian border at Stung Treng Province the following month. From there, they traveled across the provinces of Stung Treng, Preah Vihear, and Siem Reap. Throughout this entire leg of the journey, Sihanouk faced constant bombardment from American planes participating in Operation Freedom Deal. At Siem Reap, Sihanouk visited the temples of Angkor Wat, Banteay Srei, and Bayon. In August 1973 Sirik Matak wrote an open letter calling on Sihanouk to bring the Cambodian Civil War <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> suggesting the possibility of {{his return to the}} country. When the letter reached Sihanouk, he angrily rejected Sirik Matak's advances.|$|E
5|$|Croatian President Franjo Tuđman {{called on}} the public to bring the siege <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> the plea {{resulted}} in a large-scale protest against the JNA in Split, organised by the Croatian Trade Union Association in the Brodosplit Shipyard on 6 May 1991. On 7 May, 80 tanks and tracked vehicles and 23 wheeled vehicles of the JNA 10th Motorised Brigade left barracks in Mostar, only to be stopped by civilians ahead of Široki Brijeg, west of Mostar. The convoy remained in place for three days as the crowd demanded that the JNA lift the siege of Kijevo. The protest ended after Alija Izetbegović, the President of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited and addressed the protesters, assuring the crowd that the convoy was heading to Kupres rather than Kijevo. Tuđman and Cardinal Franjo Kuharić sent telegrams to the protesters supporting Izetbegović. The siege of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations a few days later, {{two weeks after the}} blockade had been imposed.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{month of}} {{performing}} in the International Wrestling Association, Cosme returned to AAA in a special event presented by the company, this time under the ring name of El Mesías. In September 2007, the company organized a unification tournament where all of the champions and first contenders participated. Over {{the course of the}} tournament, he won the GPCW Super-X Monster Championship and IWC World Heavyweight Championship, and on the tournament's finale, he became the first wrestler to win the AAA Mega Championship. While working in Mexico, Cosme signed a contract with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) where he debuted as Judas Mesias on September 13, 2007. In March 2008 his association with TNA came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> <b>and</b> he focused most of his time on AAA. In 2010 Cosme debuted for Puerto Rican World Wrestling Council, where he won the Universal Heavyweight Championship. He also wrestles in Lucha Underground under the ring name Mil Muertes.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Reed {{caught up}} with the Donners and went on ahead with one of his teamsters, Walter Herron. The two shared a horse, {{and they were able to}} cover 25–40 miles (40–64km) per day. The rest of the party rejoined the Donners, but their bad luck continued. Native Americans chased away all of Graves' horses, and another wagon was left behind. With grass in short supply, the cattle spread out more, which allowed the Paiutes to steal 18 more during one evening; and several mornings later, the Paiutes shot another 21. So far, the company had lost nearly 100 oxen and cattle, and their rations were almost {{completely}} depleted. One more stretch of desert lay ahead. The Eddys' oxen had been killed by Native Americans and they were forced to abandon their wagon. The family had eaten all their stores, but the other families refused to assist their children. The Eddys were forced to walk, carrying their children and miserable with thirst. Margret Reed and her children were also now without a wagon. But the desert soon came <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> the party found the Truckee River in beautiful lush country.|$|E
5|$|Milošević's term {{in office}} in Yugoslavia was coming <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end,</b> <b>and</b> the {{elections}} that came on September 24, 2000, were protested due to allegations of fraud and rigged elections. This all {{came to a head}} on October 5 in the so-called Bulldozer Revolution. Milošević resigned on October 7. The Democratic Opposition of Serbia won a majority in parliamentary elections that December. Milošević was taken into custody on April 1, 2001, and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on June 28 to face charges of war crimes and genocide. Clark was called to testify in a closed session of Milošević's trial in December 2003. He testified on issues ranging from the Srebrenica massacre to conversations Clark had had with Milošević during his career. Some anti-war activist groups also label Clark and Bill Clinton (along with several others) as war criminals for NATO's entire bombing campaign, saying the entire operation was in violation of the NATO charter.|$|E
