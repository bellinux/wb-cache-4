5|$|The Pembroke is {{the more}} popular breed of dog, with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{appearing}} on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. There are several physical {{differences between the two}} types according to the breed standards: the Cardigan is larger overall, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. With regards <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>health,</b> according to a 2004 survey, they both had similar lifespans, although kidney or urethral conditions are more likely in the Pembrokes. Furthermore, Pembroke Corgis {{were more likely to have}} eye problems than the Cardigan breed. Welsh Corgis have a strong association with Queen Elizabeth II, who has personally owned more than 30 dogs, either Pembrokes or Corgi/Dachshund crosses.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} prison cells {{are found in}} the Castellania. The cells close to the court rooms hosted new cases and also those {{awaiting}} execution. Several other cells are located {{at the rear of the}} building, and they are surrounded by a courtyard. These cells generally housed inmates who had to serve a short sentence of less than eight days, usually due to unpaid rent or accumulated debts. Other convicts were those who refused to bake bread in Valletta which were jailed for a roughly a week and those found guilty of stealing to eat which were imprisoned up to three months. In some cases, individuals were imprisoned for not observing religious norms, such as eating meat on prohibited days. Prisoners with longer sentences were usually sent to other prisons, usually the Gran Prigione, and if in physical capability were subject to be sent to the galleys. Medical physicians were requested to visit the inmates in the prison when needed for multiple reasons related <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> and examinations. There were attempts to re-criminalize gambling during the late magistracy of Pinto as such activity led to undesirable financial consequences to participants but the widespread practice was instead strictly regulated, on fears that if banned it may be of benefit to the underground community.|$|E
5|$|On a {{hard pitch}} in very cold weather, Small Heath had already conceded twice at Blackburn Rovers before Billy Ollis was injured {{midway through the}} first half and played no further part. The {{visitors}} put up a fight, but the numerical disavantage was too much for them and the final score of 9–1 remains the club's joint-record losing margin. With no competitive fixture scheduled for the next two weeks, the club undertook a tour. Their opening match, in Plymouth, was the first visit of a professional club to the south-west of England. The Home Park club had ambitions to bring professional league football to the region, and in front of a crowd of 4,000 their team performed well before conceding three second-half goals. Small Heath's tour ended with a 2–1 defeat at Manchester City, and they returned to a celebratory dinner in honour of the club's promotion to the First Division. The chairman presented medals to the players, congratulated them on their showing thus far, and proposed a toast <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>health,</b> in the hope that a full-strength team might be available by the next League match in ten days time.|$|E

25|$|In the wild, {{the diet}} of {{goldfish}} consists of crustaceans, insects, and various plant matter. Like most fish, they are opportunistic feeders {{and do not}} stop eating on their own accord. Overfeeding can be deleterious <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>health,</b> typically by blocking the intestines. This happens most often with selectively bred goldfish, which have a convoluted intestinal tract. When excess food is available, they produce more waste and faeces, partly due to incomplete protein digestion. Overfeeding can sometimes be diagnosed by observing faeces trailing from the fish's cloaca.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 about 5% {{of people}} (230 million) used an illicit substance.

In 2015 substance use disorders resulted in 307,400 deaths, up from 165,000 deaths in 1990. Of these, the highest numbers are from alcohol use disorders at 137,500, opioid use disorders at 122,100 deaths, amphetamine use disorders at 12,200 deaths, and cocaine use disorders at 11,100.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{concluded}} that {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC) such as benzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, toluene, and xylenes {{have to be considered}} priority pollutants with respect <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> effects. It has been pointed that in renovated or completely new buildings, the VOCs concentration levels are often several orders of magnitude higher. The main sources of acetaldehydes in homes include building materials, laminate, linoleum, wooden varnished, and cork/pine flooring. It is also found in plastic water-based and matt emulsion paints, in wood ceilings, and wooden, particle-board, plywood, pine wood, and chipboard furniture.|$|E
25|$|A study made by Takaki {{and colleagues}} (2006), {{focused on the}} gender {{differences}} with relationship to {{internal locus of control}} and self-efficacy in hemodialysis patients and their compliance. This study showed that females that had high internal locus of control were less compliant in regards <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> and medical advices compared to the men that participated in this study. Compliance is known to be the degree in which a person's behavior, in this case the patient, has a relationship with the medical advice. For example, a person that is compliant will correctly follow his/her doctor's advice.|$|E
25|$|They {{also argue}} that health locus of control is better at {{predicting}} health-related behavior if studied in conjunction with health value (the value people attach <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>health),</b> suggesting that health value is an important moderator variable in the health locus of control relationship. For example, Weiss and Larsen (1990) found an increased relationship between internal health locus of control and health when health value was assessed. Despite the importance Norman and Bennett attach to specific measures of locus of control, there are general textbooks on personality which cite studies linking {{internal locus of control}} with improved physical health, mental health and quality of life in people with diverse conditions: HIV, migraines, diabetes, kidney disease and epilepsy.|$|E

25|$|Studying {{earthquakes}} {{has shown}} to be a difficult task when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are difficult because of the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results, leading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare an individual's mental health status <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>health</b> status previous to the trauma because they must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly by the individual's current state of distress. The displacement of large numbers of citizens following a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted {{that the people who are}} displaced experience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression are often lower than they would have been had the displaced citizens been available to collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being displaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes, studies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over represented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population as a whole.|$|E
