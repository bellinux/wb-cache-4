5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, {{those involved in}} <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers {{are involved in the}} milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E
5|$|Mainstream Christianity has {{typically}} {{rejected the}} ideas of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age.</b> Most published criticism of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's fundamentalist wing. In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> became a major concern of evangelical Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups. During that decade, evangelical writers such as Constance Cumbey, Dave Hunt, Gary North, and Douglas Groothuis published books criticising <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> from their Christian perspective; {{a number of them}} have been characterised as propagating conspiracy theories regarding the origin and purpose of the movement. The most successful such publication however was Frank E. Peretti's 1986 novel This Present Darkness, which sold over a million copies; it depicted <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> as being in league with feminism and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.|$|E

40|$|<b>New</b> <b>aging</b> {{theories}} {{have been developed}} to establish the safe life span of airborne critical structural components such as B- 52 B aircraft pylon hooks for carrying air-launch drop-test vehicles. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>aging</b> theories use <b>the</b> equivalent-constant-amplitude loading spectrum to represent the actual random loading spectrum with the same damaging effect. The crack growth due to random loading cycling of the first flight is calculated using the half-cycle theory, and then extrapolated to all the crack growths of the subsequent flights. The predictions of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>aging</b> theories (finite difference aging theory and closed-form aging theory) are compared with the classical flight-test life theory and the previously developed Ko first- and Ko second-order <b>aging</b> theories. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>aging</b> theories predict <b>the</b> number of safe flights as considerably lower than that predicted by the classical aging theory, and slightly lower than those predicted by the Ko first- and Ko second-order aging theories due to the inclusion of all the higher order terms...|$|R
50|$|Hinduism-inspired {{elements}} in Theosophy were also inherited by the spin-off movements of Ariosophy and Anthroposophy and ultimately contributed to <b>the</b> renewed <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> boom of <b>the</b> 1960s to 1980s, <b>the</b> term <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> itself deriving from Blavatsky's 1888 The Secret Doctrine.|$|R
5|$|There {{are other}} Christian {{groups that have}} adopted a more {{positive}} view of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age,</b> among them <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> Catholics, Christaquarians, and Christians Awakening to a New Awareness, all of which believe that New Age ideas can enhance a person's Christian faith.|$|E
5|$|As {{a form of}} Western esotericism, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> has antecedents {{that stretch}} back to {{southern}} Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age of Enlightenment in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed {{in response to the}} development of scientific rationality. This new esoteric trend is termed occultism by scholars, and it was this occultism which would be a key factor {{in the development of the}} worldview from which <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> emerged.|$|E

5|$|There is no ethical {{cohesion}} within <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> phenomenon, although Hanegraaff {{argued that}} the central ethical tenet of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> is to cultivate one's own divine potential. Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic good and evil, negative events that happen are interpreted not {{as the result of}} evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.|$|E

5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> milieu.|$|E

5|$|Next, <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) and Kane faced The Shield (Dean Ambrose, Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns).
