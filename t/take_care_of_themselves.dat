The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "one of the most disturbing episodes, as Bart and Lisa are dragged into the Flanders' sinister lifestyle."

The authors added: [...] "It's astonishing that anything this radical made it on to prime time television. The final moments are perhaps the most moving in the entire series, a wonderful affirmation of everything the series, and the Simpson family, are about." [...] Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, thought the episode was [...] "fantastic" [...] and he called it one of his favorites.

2500|$|... "Any {{hypothesis}} {{explaining the}} evolution of slavery in Polyergus must account both for the origin of group raiding with brood capture, and for non-independent colony foundation by queens". Topoff gives an adequate hypothesis to {{the evolution of}} Polyergus by integrating three processes: queen takeover, olfactory imprinting, and territorial fighting. Here are his main points. A free-living ancestor of Polyergus, that is a scavenger, would band together with others for intraspecific contest. Occasionally a queen would invade colonies of Formica. Initially the queen would drive off the Formica queen and workers and appropriated the Formica pupae (he gives as example the queens of Formica wheeleri that do this now). The killing of the Formica queen and adoption by the workers would evolve from this. His previous work (which was presented earlier) shows what would have evolved for adaptation to occur: [...] "(1) sharp mandibles for killing the Formica queen, (2) a pheromone that reduces aggression from resident workers, (3) a tendency to hold onto the dead Formica queen long enough to absorb her odors...". The next step would be olfactory imprinting between the two species, a consequence of living one’s life from start to finish in the presence of both species. Polyergus’ ancestor then forages and encounters a colony of the same species. Again, they recruit nestmates to a territorial raid. In a brilliant insight, Topoff suggest this trait explains the raiding behavior. The Polyergus worker, raised by Formica as conspecifics, [...] "identifies individual of Formica as belonging to its own species, another territorial raid is incited. Thus from the standpoint of Polyergus... slave raids are equivalent to territorial raids". The captured brood is imprinted as well and they become workers in the original nest. As time went on [...] "Our ancestral Polyergus could easily slide in the direction of facultative parasitism". Eventually, Polyergus ancestors lost the ability to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> and become the inquiline Polyergus we see today.|$|E
