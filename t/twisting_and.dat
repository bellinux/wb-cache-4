5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused <b>twisting</b> <b>and</b> distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{expression}} of transcription factors <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia tissues and their relationship with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation. Methods: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia tissues (n= 67) and normal cervical tissues (n= 85) were collected, and the contents of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail as well as epithelialmesenchymal transition-related molecules and proliferation-related molecules in the tissues were detected. Results: <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail contents in CIN cervical tissues were lower than those in normal cervical tissues; Twist, Snail, PI 3 K, Akt, STAT 3, Vimentin, N-cadherin, Prdx 4, EZH 2 and STOML- 2 contents in CIN cervical tissues were higher than those in normal cervical tissues, and E-cadherin content was significantly lower than that in normal cervical tissues; E-cadherin content in CIN tissues with high expression of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail was significantly lower than that in CIN tissues with low expression of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail, and Vimentin, N-cadherin, Prdx 4, EZH 2 and STOML- 2 contents were higher than those in CIN tissues with low expression of <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail. Conclusions: Transcription factors <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail expression increase and downstream signaling pathway function is enhanced in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia tissues; <b>Twist</b> <b>and</b> Snail can regulate epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell proliferation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 {{expression}} in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and assesses {{the association of}} their expression with clinicopathological indicators. HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 protein expression in 129 PTCs, 61 nodular hyperplasia, and 118 normal thyroid tissue specimens was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The protein expression levels of these three molecules were upregulated in PTCs. High protein expression of HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (LNM) (P< 0. 001). Furthermore, HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 protein expression was correlated with one another. Concomitant high expression of these molecules had stronger correlation with LNM than did each alone (P= 0. 032 for HIF- 2 α/TWIST, P< 0. 001 for HIF- 2 α/CXCR 4, P= 0. 018 for TWIST/CXCR 4, and P< 0. 001 for HIF- 2 α/TWIST/CXCR 4). Additionally, HIF- 2 α, <b>TWIST,</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 mRNA expression were assessed in 30 [*]PTCs, 10 nodular hyperplasia, and 10 normal thyroid tissue specimens using real-time RT-PCR. <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 mRNA expression levels were up-regulated in PTCs, and high mRNA expression of <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> CXCR 4 was significantly correlated with LNM (P= 0. 005 and P= 0. 010, resp.).

5|$|Although Metzger {{had been}} trying to pitch a movie based on the life of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer for many years, the impetus for the movie came from Joseph Goebbels' desire to make an antisemitic {{response}} to Mendes' philo-semitic film adaptation of Lion Feuchtwanger's 1925 novel Jud Süß. Because Mendes' movie was so sympathetic to the subject, the scriptwriters shifted their model to Wilhelm Hauff's 1827 novella. However, even after Harlan rewrote the original script, the result was not antisemitic enough to suit Goebbels' propaganda needs so he personally intervened in the editing process to the point of dropping some scenes and rewriting others including making a substantial change to the film's ending to show Süß as humbled rather than defiant. Thus, the message of the film was diametrically opposed to the intent of Feuchtwanger's novel. At the same time, however, the film evokes Feuchtwanger’s texts, <b>twisting</b> <b>and</b> reversing the core of the Jewish writer’s work. Although inspired by the historical details of Süß's life, the novel, novella, and film only loosely correspond to the historical sources available at the Landesarchiv Baden-Württemberg.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{his usual}} tactic, the British crew {{approached}} {{from behind and}} below. Suddenly the Heinkel lurched into a tight left-hand turn allowing the gunners to fire a broad-side. The bomber disappeared into the mist. Cunningham asked GCI for help. They tracked the Heinkel flying north near Shaftesbury. Engaging again the German pilot managed {{to turn into a}} head-on position and dive past almost upside down. He continually evaded Cunningham by turning in underneath him at near-impossible angles. Cunningham and Rawnsley came to understand they were not dealing with a novice. Soon a turning match began and then the German attempted to escape by <b>twisting</b> <b>and</b> diving. Cunningham forced him down to 900 feet but Rawnsley and GCI lost contact when the ground clutter hid the Heinkel's signal. Cunningham returned to base. News soon came through the He 111 had crashed onto the slopes on Cranborne Chase. Apparently, the Heinkel had broken through the clouds at only a hundred feet and dived vertically into the ground near the isolated village of Alvediston at 17:05. Intelligence later determined that the machine was a He 111H-6, Werknummer 4627, code 6N+FR, from 7./KGr 100. The bomber disintegrated upon impact. The pilot, Staffelkapitän ("squadron leader") Hauptmann Siegried Langer was killed along with his crew; Oberfeldwebel G. Schmidt, Feldwebel D. Hoffmann, P. Gaidies and Gefreiter W. Worring. It was a unique victory for Cunningham. He had not fired his guns in the 150-minute chase.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the immunoexpression of <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt proteins in oral leukoplakia (OL) and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), correlating their expressions with the histological features of the lesions. Study design: Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on 10 normal oral epithelium, 30 OL and 20 OSCC formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Immunoperoxidase reactions for <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt proteins were applied on the specimens and the positivity of the reactions was calculated for 1000 epithelial cells. Results: Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post tests revealed a significant difference in <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt immunoexpression among normal oral mucosa, OL and OSCC. In addition, a significant positive correlation was found between <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt expressions according to the Pearson's correlation test. Conclusions: The results obtained in the current study suggest that <b>TWIST</b> <b>and</b> p-Akt may participate of the multi-step process of oral carcinogenesis since its early stages. © Medicina Oral S.

40|$|The {{specific}} aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility, reproducibility and maturational changes of LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion variables by real-time 3 D speckle-tracking echocardiography (RT 3 DSTE) in children. A prospective study was conducted in 347 consecutive healthy subjects (181 males/ 156 females, mean age 7. 12 ± 5. 3 years, and range from birth to 18 -years) using RT 3 D echocardiography (3 DE). The LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion measurements were made off-line using TomTec software. Manual landmark selection and endocardial border editing were performed in 3 planes (apical " 2 "-, " 4 "-, and " 3 "- chamber views) and semi-automated tracking yielded LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion measurements. LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion analysis by RT 3 DSTE were feasible in 307 out of 347 subjects (88. 5 %). There was no correlation between rotation or <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> age, height, weight, BSA or heart rate, respectively. However, there was statistically significant, but very modest correlation between LV torsion and age (R 2 = 0. 036, P< 0. 001). The normal ranges were defined for rotation <b>and</b> <b>twist</b> in this cohort, and for torsion for each age group. The intra-observer and inter-observer variabilities for apical <b>and</b> basal rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion ranged from 7. 3 % ± 3. 8 % to 12. 3 % ± 8. 8 % and from 8. 8 % ± 4. 6 % to 15. 7 % ± 10. 1 %, respectively. We conclude that analysis of LV rotation, <b>twist</b> <b>and</b> torsion by this new RT 3 D STE is feasible and reproducible in pediatric population. There is no maturational change in rotation <b>and</b> <b>twist,</b> but torsion decreases with age in this cohort. Further refinement is warranted to validate the utility of this new methodology in more sensitive and quantitative evaluation of congenital and acquired heart diseases in children...|$|R

25|$|It is {{important}} to remember that unlike, for example, Roman roads, these medieval routes were not essentially physical entities—thin strips of land with physical boundaries; rather they were rights of way, sometimes with legal and traditional status.
