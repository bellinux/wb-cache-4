5|$|In November 1792 James Reynolds and his {{associate}} Jacob Clingman {{were arrested}} for counterfeiting and speculating in veteran back wages. Clingman was released on bail and relayed information to James Monroe that Reynolds had evidence that would incriminate Hamilton. Monroe consulted with Congressmen Muhlenberg and Venable on what actions to take and <b>the</b> <b>Congressmen</b> confronted Hamilton on December 15, 1792. Hamilton refuted the suspicions of speculation by exposing his affair with Maria and producing as evidence the letters by both Reynoldses, proving that his payments to James Reynolds related to blackmail over his adultery, and not to treasury misconduct. The trio were to keep the documents privately with the utmost confidence.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1923, {{during a}} {{procession}} by local Congress volunteers in Nagpur commemorating the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the Swaraj flag with the spinning wheel, designed by Pingali Venkayya, was hoisted. This event {{resulted in a}} confrontation between <b>the</b> <b>Congressmen</b> and the police, after which five people were imprisoned. Over a hundred other protesters continued the flag procession after a meeting. Subsequently, {{on the first of}} May, Jamnalal Bajaj, the secretary of the Nagpur Congress Committee, started the Flag Satyagraha, gaining national attention and marking a significant point in the flag movement. The satyagraha, promoted nationally by the Congress, started creating cracks within the organisation in which the Gandhians were highly enthused while the other group, the Swarajists, called it inconsequential.|$|E

He said that Weldon made it clear he didn't want word leaked to the Pentagon, to intelligence officials, or to Democratic congressmen.|$|E
25|$|At its passage, the Act was {{politically}} controversial, with many Democrats breaking with Clinton to oppose it. Of the opposition, {{six members of}} Congress, including Republican Mark Hatfield, sued to prevent use of the line-item veto. They were granted summary judgment by the U.S. District Court, but the Supreme Court held that <b>the</b> <b>Congressmen</b> lacked standing {{because they could not}} show any particularized harm, and dismissed their suit in Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997). Within the next two months, Clinton began using the line-item veto, prompting several entities to file suit in a second attempt to have the Act declared unconstitutional.|$|E

Agency Director Joe Clancy apologized to Chaffetz and said that disciplinary action would be taken against those responsible.|$|E

500|$|On March 3, 1873, President Grant {{signed a}} law that {{increased}} the president's salary from $25,000 a year to $50,000 a year. The law raised salaries of members of both houses of the United States Congress from $5,000 to $7,500.

Ever." [...] Congressman John Boehner, whose Eighth District was {{to the west of the}} Second, endorsed McEwen on June 7. Boehner was a freshman in McEwen's final term.

500|$|After the House {{received}} the Senate-passed bill, it {{was referred to}} the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on January 30, with the chairman, Indiana Representative Albert H. Vestal, presiding. He introduced into the record a letter from Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon, opposing the measure. [...] Mellon noted that many commemorative issues had failed to sell out, leaving coins in the Mint or returning them for melting. Mellon felt that the public was being confused as surplus commemoratives entered circulation. The Treasury had sent three officials, Mint Director Robert J. Grant, Assistant Director Mary M. O'Reilly and Garrard B. Winston, the assistant to the Undersecretary of the Treasury. O'Reilly, {{who had been with}} the Treasury longer than the other two, addressed the committee, warning that there were six coinage bills before Congress, and that the Mint had struck nine commemoratives in the past five years.

[...] John Adams learned many years later that his name was {{on a list of}} people specifically excluded from any pardon offers the Howes might make. [...] Congress published the committee's report without comment. [...] Because Lord Howe did not also publish an account of the meeting, the meeting's outcome was perceived by many as a sign of British weakness; however, many Loyalists and some British observers suspected the Congressional report misrepresented the meeting. [...] One British commentator wrote of the meeting, [...] "They met, they talked, they parted. [...] And now nothing remains but to fight it out." [...] Lord Howe reported the failure of the conference to his brother, and they then made preparations to continue the campaign for New York City. [...] Four days after the conference, British troops landed on Manhattan and occupied New York City.|$|E
500|$|When Andrew Johnson {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} after President Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, Senators Sumner and Wilson both hoped Johnson {{would support the}} policies of the Republican Party, since Johnson, a Democrat, had been elected with Lincoln on a pro-Union ticket. After the Civil War ended with a Union Victory in May 1865, the defeated former Confederacy was ruined. [...] It had been devastated economically, politically, and much of its infrastructure had been destroyed during the war. The opportunity was ripe for Congress and Johnson to work together on terms for Southern restoration and reconstruction. Instead, Johnson launched his own reconstruction policy, which was seen as more lenient to former Confederates, and excluded African American citizenship. [...] When Congress opened the session which began in December 1865, Johnson's policy included a demand for admission of Southern Senators and Representatives, nearly all Democrats, including many former Confederates. [...] Congress, still in Republican hands, responded by refusing to allow the Southern Senators and Representatives to take their seats, beginning a rift between Republicans in Congress and the President. Wilson favored allowing only persons who had been loyal to the United States to serve in positions of political power in the former Confederacy, and believed that Congress, not the President, had the power to reconstruct the southern states. As a result, Wilson joined forces with <b>the</b> <b>Congressmen</b> and Senators known as Radical Republicans, those most strongly opposed to Johnson.|$|E
500|$|The {{newspaper}} {{has been}} accused from time-to-time of forcing public figures out of the closet. This policy of 'outing' individuals surfaced in 1996 during {{the debate over the}} Defense of Marriage Act, when the Blade and The Advocate were going to out Congressmen Jim Kolbe and Mark Foley. Neither publication did out either politician, and both publications later denied ever intending to out <b>the</b> <b>Congressmen.</b> In recent years, these accusations have resurfaced as Kevin Naff, current editor of the Blade, has accused the Washington Post of 'straight-washing' stories about LGBT individuals. Naff wrote that [...] "When someone is described as 'flamboyant,' 'eccentric' or 'a lifelong bachelor,' we know whatâ€™s being implied... Readers of the Washington Post had better hone their gaydar skills, because in story after story, the newsgathering behemoth either ignores questions of sexual orientation or employs endless winks and nods to convey what would be better spelled out." [...] When asked why identifying and outing of individuals by publications like the Blade, staff writer Greg Marzullo wrote [...] "Why do [...] insist on mentioning someone's sexual orientation at all? Because we're a queer paper." [...] As reported in the Washington Post, former editor Chris Crain summarized the Blades editorial reasoning for the 'outings' by stating that [...] "It is 2004, not 1954, and sexual orientation in and of itself is no longer a 'private fact' beyond the pale of inquiry." [...] The Blade, he wrote, [...] "would investigate and report about whether influential Hill aides are gay if facts about their sexual orientation raise highly newsworthy questions of hypocrisy in the stands taken by anti-gay members of Congress for whom they work." [...] A former staff writer of the Washington Blade has noted objections to this perceived campaign to label individuals by their sexual orientations and has used a blog to register these objections.|$|E

500|$|The United Fruit Company {{responded with}} {{intensive}} lobbying {{of members of}} the United States government, leading many US congressmen and senators to criticize the Guatemalan government for not protecting the interests of the company. The Guatemalan government responded by saying that the company was the main obstacle to progress in the country. American historians observed that [...] "To the Guatemalans it appeared that their country was being mercilessly exploited [...] by foreign interests which took huge profits without making any contributions to the nation's welfare." [...] In 1953, [...] of uncultivated land was expropriated by the government, which offered the company compensation at the rate of 2.99 US dollars to the acre, twice what the company had paid when it bought the property. More expropriation occurred soon after, bringing the total to over the government offered compensation to the company at {{the rate at which the}} UFC had valued its own property for tax purposes. This resulted in further lobbying in Washington, particularly through Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, who had close ties to the company. The company had begun a public relations campaign to discredit the Guatemalan government; it hired public relations expert Edward Bernays, who ran a concerted effort to portray the company as the victim of the Guatemalan government for several years. The company stepped up its efforts after Dwight Eisenhower had been elected in 1952. These included commissioning a research study on Guatemala from a firm known to be hawkish, which produced a 235-page report that was highly critical of the Guatemalan government. Historians have stated that the report was full of [...] "exaggerations, scurrilous descriptions and bizarre historical theories." [...] The report nonetheless had a significant impact on <b>the</b> <b>Congressmen</b> that it was sent to. Overall, the company spent over a half-million dollars to influence both lawmakers and members of the public in the US that the Guatemalan government needed to be overthrown.|$|E
