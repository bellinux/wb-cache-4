5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of <b>the</b> <b>Colonies</b> were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward <b>the</b> <b>Colonies,</b> then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.|$|E
5|$|From 1870 until 1901, {{each of the}} six colonial governments was {{responsible}} for their own defence. <b>The</b> <b>colonies</b> had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890, and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs, the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia. To do this, they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces. Initially these were militias in support of British regulars, but when military support for <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> ended in 1870, <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> assumed their own defence responsibilities. The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia, paid citizen soldiers, and a small permanent component. They were mainly infantry, cavalry and mounted infantry, and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline. Even after significant reforms in the 1870s—including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units—they remained too small and unbalanced to be considered armies in the modern sense. By 1885, the forces numbered 21,000 men. Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century, with <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> raising contingents to serve in Sudan, South Africa and China.|$|E

5|$|In May 1773, the British Parliament {{passed the}} Tea Act, a tax law {{to help the}} {{struggling}} East India Company, one of Great Britain's most important commercial institutions. Britons could buy smuggled Dutch tea more cheaply than the East India Company's tea because of the heavy taxes imposed on tea imported into Great Britain, and so the company amassed a huge surplus of tea {{that it could not}} sell. The British government's solution to the problem was to sell the surplus in <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> The Tea Act permitted the East India Company to export tea directly to <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> for the first time, bypassing most of the merchants who had previously acted as middlemen. This measure was a threat to the American colonial economy because it granted the Tea Company a significant cost advantage over local tea merchants and even local tea smugglers, driving them out of business. The act also reduced the taxes on tea paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on tea imported in <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charlestown were selected to receive the company's tea for resale. In late 1773, seven ships were sent to <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> carrying East India Company tea, including four bound for Boston.|$|E
5|$|Many colonists, however, had {{developed}} a different conception of the empire. <b>The</b> <b>colonies</b> were not directly represented in Parliament, and colonists argued that Parliament {{had no right to}} levy taxes upon them. This tax dispute {{was part of a larger}} divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> The orthodox British view, dating from the Glorious Revolution of 1688, was that Parliament was the supreme authority throughout the empire, and so, by definition, anything that Parliament did was constitutional. In <b>the</b> <b>colonies,</b> however, the idea {{had developed}} that the British Constitution recognized certain fundamental rights that no government could violate, not even Parliament. After the Townshend Acts, some essayists even began to question whether Parliament had any legitimate jurisdiction in <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> at all. Anticipating the arrangement of the British Commonwealth, by 1774 American writers such as Samuel Adams, James Wilson, and Thomas Jefferson were arguing that Parliament was the legislature of Great Britain only, and that <b>the</b> <b>colonies,</b> which had their own legislatures, were connected to the rest of the empire only through their allegiance to the Crown.|$|E

5|$|Samuel Adams {{emerged as}} an {{important}} public figure in Boston soon after the British Empire's victory in the French and Indian War (1754–1763). The British Parliament found itself deep in debt and looking for new sources of revenue, and they sought to directly tax <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> of British America for the first time. This tax dispute {{was part of a}} larger divergence between British and American interpretations of the British Constitution and the extent of Parliament's authority in <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Colony</b> of British Columbia was a British Crown Colony that {{resulted}} from the amalgamation of <b>the</b> two former <b>colonies,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Colony</b> of Vancouver Island and <b>the</b> mainland <b>Colony</b> of British Columbia. <b>The</b> two former <b>colonies</b> were united in 1866, and <b>the</b> united <b>colony</b> existed until its incorporation into the Canadian Confederation in 1871.|$|R

5|$|As the American colonies went to war, {{they needed}} soldiers, supplies, {{and lots of}} them. Soldiers needed uniforms and, as all {{shipping}} into <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> had ceased, wool became an integral commodity to the war effort.

5|$|Boston, {{the capital}} of the Province of Massachusetts Bay and an {{important}} shipping town, was a major center of resistance to unpopular acts of taxation by the British Parliament in the 1760s. In 1768, the Townshend Acts were placed upon the colonists, by which a variety of common items that were manufactured in Britain and exported to <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> were subjected to import tariffs. Colonists objected that the Townshend Acts were a violation of the natural, charter, and constitutional rights of British subjects in <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> The Massachusetts House of Representatives began a campaign against the Townshend Acts by sending a petition to King George III asking for the repeal of the Townshend Revenue Act. The House also sent {{what became known as the}} Massachusetts Circular Letter to other colonial assemblies, asking them to join the resistance movement, and called for a boycott of merchants importing the affected goods.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-eighteenth century, {{there was}} a growing need for well-trained Lutheran clergy in <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> With the goal of {{creating}} closer union between the preachers, elders, and deacons of the area congregations, a conference was proposed.|$|E
5|$|Despite a {{reputation}} of colonial inferiority, many of the locally raised units were highly organised, disciplined, professional, and well trained. During this period, defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery, based on garrisoned coastal forts. However, by the 1890s, improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards—who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces—to the belief that <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> could be defended by the rapid mobilisation of brigades of infantry. As a consequence {{he called for a}} restructure of defences, and defensive agreements to be made between <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b> Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be federated and for professional units—obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific—to replace the volunteer forces. These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant, Major General Edward Hutton, however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria stifled the proposal. These reforms remaining unresolved however, and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of <b>the</b> <b>colonies.</b>|$|E
