25|$|The {{portrait}} of Aline was painted in tempera on linen, as {{were those of}} the two girls. It has a height of 40cm and a width 32.5cm. Below the painted cloth, scraps of linen pressed onto the mummy's face were used to provide an even surface, so that the portrait is nearly flat. Some of the portraits were painted before {{the death of their}} subject, but in Aline's case, where it is actually painted {{on the end of the}} mummy wrapping, it appears to have been produced after death, perhaps based on a previously prepared portrait. As is common for mummy portraits, the painting produces the impression of three-dimensional depth, a relatively recent feature in Egyptian art and due to Graeco-Roman influences. Frontal depictions of human faces had also been unusual throughout most of the history of Egyptian art. The wavy hairstyle with a central parting is painted simply, but carefully. The small ringlets above the forehead are striking. The face appears full, but not fat. It conveys the impression that <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> belonged to the middle or upper levels of Egyptian society, had led a good life. Her simple jewellery is carefully painted. The depiction of the necklace made of gilded plaster, added to the portrait. Aline wears a white tunica or chiton, thin lilac bands (clavus) run across her shoulder. The colours are warm. The sad, wistful gaze is typical of mummy portraits. Altogether, it is a masterful {{portrait of}} a middle-aged woman.|$|E
500|$|The episode further {{develops}} {{the relationship between}} Bree and Chuck, which is complicated by her involvement in the cover-up. [...] "Bree’s dilemma {{is the fact that}} she’s falling for a cop and trying to cover up this crime that she was sort of the ringleader on," [...] Daily explained. [...] "So her thing is instead of balancing work and pleasure, it’s balancing crime and pleasure." [...] Cross stated, [...] "I think we’ll figure out if that’s really a big love for her or if she’s able to let it go." [...] Jonathan Cake, who appeared as Chuck in four episodes during the seventh season, was promoted to series regular with this episode. On the relationship between Bree and Chuck, Cake stated: [...] "As a detective, he's sort of drawn to <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> seems both quite proper and conservative and yet can't seem to stop herself from being drawn into these sort of crazy, lurid scenarios. There's a sort of wild streak in Bree somewhere that he thinks is really interesting." [...] To prepare for the role, Cake watched key episodes of the series focusing on Bree's previous relationships.|$|E
2500|$|The chapter from Answered Prayers, [...] "La Côte Basque" [...] {{begins with}} Jonesy, the main {{character}} said {{to be based on}} a mixture of Truman Capote himself and the serial killer victim Herbert Clutter (on whom In Cold Blood was based), meets up with a Lady Ina Coolbirth on a New York City street. <b>This</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> is described as [...] "an American married to a British chemicals tycoon and a lot of woman in every way", is widely rumoured to be based on New York socialite Slim Keith. Lady Ina Coolbirth invites Jonesy to lunch at La Côte Basque. A gossipy tale of New York's elite ensues.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>this,</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> aren't called {{in for a}} Pap test are sometimes required to pay a $5 fee if they request one. This can be a significant barrier to requesting a test, considering an average prisoner's wage is around 7 to 13 cents per hour.|$|R

50|$|A study {{conducted}} in 2010 {{indicated that the}} majority of girls in a Cape Town township correlated thinness with disease - in particular, HIV/AIDS. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> are slender or experience weight loss also face discrimination. This form of stigma affects women living in townships most severely because rates of malnourishment are higher in townships than in other parts of South Africa.|$|R
2500|$|Archibald Hunter, a young Englishman, {{is passing}} his leisure time near Cruden Bay {{in the small}} Scottish village of Whinnyfold when he has {{a vision of a}} couple walking past him, {{carrying}} a tiny coffin. Archibald also notices a strange old woman watching him. Later, he finds out that his vision has come true, and a child in town has died. Archibald encounters the bizarre old woman again on the seashore; <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> introduces herself as Gormala MacNeil, knows that Archibald saw something out of the ordinary. She proceeds to explain that she has [...] "Second Sight"—a sort of psychic ability for premonition that comes and goes at random—and that she can tell that Archibald, too, is a Seer. Fluctuating between skepticism and uneasiness over his newfound abilities, Archibald listens to Gormala's insights and sees one of his visions fulfilled at Lammas-tide, when he and Gormala witness Lauchlane Macleod, a local fisherman, wreck his boat on a chain of sharp rocks known as the Skares. Archibald sees a procession of dead spirits emerge from the water near the Skares and make its way up the cliffs.|$|E
2500|$|Despite Ridge and Taylor's remarriage, Brooke {{continues}} her {{attempts at}} winning Ridge back. Stephanie encourages Taylor to see Brooke's intent, with Tylo observing: [...] "It was so obvious {{she was going}} after Ridge. How can you explain away that she always kept ending up in the elevator in her bra and underwear over and over again? Stephanie’s whole mission was to get Taylor to smell the coffee and [...] that not everybody has as altruistic an agenda as she does." [...] Ridge and Taylor's twins, Stephanie ("Steffy") and Phoebe, are born in 1999. During the pregnancy Taylor experiences tuberculosis after interacting {{with a man who}} has it. Her pregnancy becomes high risk and she refuses treatment to protect the babies. Tylo said that this was [...] "a great way to bring awareness about the disease and the threat it poses to pregnant women". When Taylor dies in 2002, supervising producer Rhonda Friedman noted that Ridge refuses to accept the [...] "horrible reality", saying: [...] "He begs Taylor to come back to him. He just doesn't want to let go of <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> he has loved for so many years, someone he say himself growing old with." [...] Devin Owens of Soap Opera Digest called Taylor Ridge's soulmate. Taylor's [...] "ghost" [...] visits Ridge in 2004 and encourages him to be with Brooke. Following Taylor's return to the show, her marriage to Ridge fell apart in 2006 and they divorce. They have since reunited on several occasions but he continues going back to Brooke, despite Taylor's efforts to thwart this from happening. Daytime Confidential's Jamey Giddens noted that Steffy and Thomas [...] "grew up watching their daddy basically climb out of their mom's bed and right into the sack with Rick (Jacob Young) and Hope's (Kimberly Matula) mom, over and over again." ...|$|E

5000|$|The second anointing is {{performed}} only on married couples. A few writers {{have argued that}} because of <b>this,</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> receive the second anointing, {{in which they are}} anointed queens and priestesses, are ordained to the [...] "fulness of the priesthood" [...] {{in the same manner as}} their husbands. These scholars suggest that Smith may have considered these women to have, in fact, received the power of the priesthood, though not necessarily a specific priesthood office.|$|R

50|$|One of the RRHA {{policies}} he disputed {{was clearly}} intended {{to enforce a}} particular moral code. Specifically, RRHA would not allow single female parents habitation in public housing. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were single and became pregnant felt pressure to either have an abortion and lose the child or lose their home. Holt's persistence overturned this policy and was an indication he was {{ahead of his time}} in terms of championing the right of a single parent female to control her reproductive rights and her sexuality without fear of losing her right to housing.|$|R
