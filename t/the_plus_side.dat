25|$|U.S. analyst Ashley J. Tellis {{argues that}} the Indo-US nuclear deal is {{attractive}} to India because it gives it access to far more options on its civil nuclear programme than would otherwise be the case, primarily by ending its isolation from the international nuclear community. These options include access to latest technologies, access to higher unit output reactors which are more economical, access to global finance for building reactors, ability to export its indigenous small reactor size PHWRs, better information flow for its research community, etc. Finally, the deal also gives India two options that are relatively independent from the three-stage programme, {{at least in terms}} of their dependencies on success or failure. The first option is that, India can opt to stay with the first stage reactors as long as the global supply of uranium lasts. <b>The</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side</b> of this is that it covers any risk from short term delays or failures in implementing the three-stage programme. On the negative side, this is an option that is antithetical to the underlying objective of energy independence through the exploitation of thorium.|$|E
500|$|On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> the C5's {{handling}} characteristics were praised by reviewers. The Guardian called it [...] "very easy to master {{once you have}} {{become familiar with the}} under-thigh handlebar steering and the semi-recumbent driving position with feet on bicycle-type pedals." [...] The Daily Mirror described the arrangement as [...] "surprisingly easy" [...] to master, although it cautioned that [...] "on full speed and on full lock it's very easy to tip it onto two wheels." [...] The Daily Express motoring correspondent wrote that he found the C5 [...] "stable, comfortable and easy to handle".|$|E
500|$|Conversion {{became a}} series of compromises and mixed blessings which would not have arisen had they been [...] "specifically {{designed}} carriers" [...] from the outset. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> the ships would have better anti-torpedo protection, larger magazines for aircraft bombs and, with the after elevator [...] higher than otherwise, more room for aircraft landings. On the minus side, a converted battlecruiser would be [...] slower than a specifically designed carrier, have 16 percent less hangar space, less emergency fuel and, with [...] "narrower lines" [...] aft, not as wide a runway for which to aim. Costs were similar. A brand-new aircraft carrier was estimated at $27.1 million. Conversion of a Lexington class was $22.4 million, not counting the $6.7 million already sunk into them. Added together, the figure rose to $28.1 million.|$|E

500|$|Abra {{returned}} {{yet again}} to Holby in episode [...] "The Human Jungle". [...] Initially, Kyla was furious with him, and resisted {{his attempts to}} win her backblaming him {{for the death of}} her ex-husband, which occurred in his absence and resulted in her son being taken into foster care. [...] However, Abra persisted, and was able to convince her to resume their relationship, and move in with him. Ayola said of the relationship at the time: [...] "It's love! Well, she loves him but I think he loves moving around the world more. He's a drifter. I wouldn't put any money on a happy ending for them. He's such a rolling stone and she's so emotionally wrong that I don't think it's going to work. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> I think this pair probably have a fantastic sex life and a great time down the pub." ...|$|E
500|$|On 4 May, Benfica played Alverca at home, {{where they}} lost 0–2, {{and in the}} writing of João Querido Manhã for Record, the fans [...] "burst into protests at the end, after they lost {{patience}} with the errors, passivity and lack of talent of the whole team.". On 13 May, Benfica went to Adelino Ribeiro Novo to face Gil Vicente. The game ended in a 3–0 defeat – their tenth loss within the league, matching their previous record in the 1996–97 season. As a result, the club was overtaken by Belenenses in the league table. A week later, Benfica played host to Salgueiros in Da Luz. A final score of 1–1 saved Benfica from a record fourth straight loss, and gave the Porto-based side their first point all season against a top 7 team. Benfica played the last game of the season against Desportivo de Aves on the road. At one point in the game, the team was losing three-nil, but managed to equalize and finish with a four-all draw. Toni stated that [...] "Everyone did not do their best to avoid that a historic club slipped into a position that is not accustomed." [...] Benfica finished in a record-breaking sixth place after the 34-game season with a tally of 15 wins, 9 draws and 10 losses that, together, summed up to 54 points. They were ninth-lowest league-wide in goals conceded – 44 in all. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> they were fifth best in the league at goal-scoring, with a total of 54 goals. Van Hooijdonk was the second most productive player in the Primeira Liga with 19 goals.|$|E

5000|$|Fudge uses {{customized}} [...] "Fudge dice" [...] {{which have}} {{an equal number of}} plus, minus and blank sides. A number of these dice are rolled, usually four at a time ("4dF" [...] in Fudge dice notation), and for every <b>plus</b> <b>side</b> that comes up the result of using the Trait is considered one step higher (e.g. from Fair to Good) and for every minus side that comes up the result is considered one step lower. The goal is to match or surpass the difficulty level, also on the adjective scale, of the test. Thus, a Good attribute is considered to be Great if the player were to roll two <b>plus</b> <b>sides,</b> one minus side, and one blank—the minus side cancels out one of <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>sides</b> and <b>the</b> remaining <b>plus</b> <b>side</b> raises <b>the</b> result by one step. The same Good attribute would be considered Poor if you were to roll three minus sides and one blank. The same dice roll can be achieved with six-sided dice, treating a 1 or 2 as −, a 3-4 as [...] and a 5-6 as +.|$|R

Seats in these areas were popularly known as [...] "the baseball section." [...] In 2007, some extra rows (normally used only for football) were retained for baseball, in the area behind home plate. The sight lines were also very good in the right field corner area, which faced the infield and was closer to the action than the left field corner.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the first}} American {{battleship}} {{to be built}} in two decades, North Carolina was given the latest in shipbuilding technology. Her propulsion was divided into four main spaces, each with two boilers and one steam turbine per propeller shaft. This resulted in fewer openings in watertight bulkheads and minimized the area requiring protection by additional armor plate. Her propulsion systems (boilers/turbines/shafts/propellers) suffered numerous teething troubles which were reflected in long post-commissioning defect correction period which lasted April–December 1941. Her sister [...] suffered equally, and neither ship was ever able to achieve their designed deep load speed of 28 knots. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side</b> however, she was also one of just 14 ships to receive the early RCA CXAM-1 radar, and a strong (for the day) light anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews. According to Rob Theakston from AllMusic, [...] "On ne change pas is without {{no doubt a}} companion piece to 1999's All the Way... A Decade of Song. Dion amassed quite a back catalog of the French-language hits ranging from dance-pop-friendly numbers to her familiar ground of passionate, melodramatic ballads.

2500|$|In June 2011, iFixit {{dismantled}} a Samsung Series 5 {{and concluded}} that it was essentially an improved Cr-48. They rated it as 6/10 for repairability, predominantly because the case has to be opened to change the battery and because the RAM chip is soldered to the motherboard. iFixit noted that the [...] "mostly-plastic construction" [...] felt [...] "a little cheap". On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side</b> they stated that the screen was easy to remove {{and most of the}} components, including the solid-state drive would be easy to replace. iFixit's Kyle Wiens wrote that the Series 5 [...] "fixes the major shortfalls of the Cr-48 and adds the polish necessary to strike lust into the heart of a broad consumer base: sleek looks, 8+ hours of battery life, and optimized performance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rehearsals for {{the live}} {{section of the}} episode started on 21 July 2012 and full dress rehearsals on 22 July, though there was some {{tentative}} rehearsal time before that when they were also busy filming other episodes. Fenwick said of his rehearsals, [...] "Summer arrives {{just in time for}} me to complete my 24th circuit of Albert Square and I'm sweltering. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> I'm starting to see abs, have buns of steel and the show is looking good too!" [...] He explained that he was inspired by Usain Bolt, saying, [...] "I watched a documentary on him [...] and he's inspired me to torch bear. Obviously I won't be going [...] near as fast him!" [...] He had to check the route for potholes beforehand, as well as making sure he knew his lines, and said he was looking forward to it being over. He practiced the route at least 100 times, using washing line rope instead of the flame, and had cut down on alcohol to prepare. He was worried about sustaining an injury during rehearsals and about carrying the torch during the live broadcast, as he may have dropped it or it could have gone out. He stated that he, as an actor, was feeling more nervous than his character.|$|E
2500|$|For various reasons, {{it was not}} {{possible}} to run a historically accurate recreation of how the race would have gone in 1949. Instead, according to Graeme Bunker, the race was [...] "done just for fun and entertainment". A major restriction was Tornado's maximum speed limit of , set as a condition of its current main line certification (although the A1 Trust was planning to have Tornado certified to a higher speed over time). The 'Flyers' of the 1950s would have gone on to speeds of [...] and beyond. A further difficulty was due to water troughs having been removed from the rail network, meaning it was {{not possible}} to achieve the post-war steam timings of six and a half hours. According to Steam Railway magazine, if Tornado had been able to use troughs, the train would have won the race easily. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side</b> for the car and bike, they had the speed advantage of not having to travel through towns and villages exactly as the old Great North Road would have, but instead benefitted from the use of modern bypasses, and the faster A1(M) sections of the A1, where it has been upgraded to motorway standards. However, speed restrictions outside of built-up areas were only introduced in Britain in 1965, so in 1949, neither the car nor motorbike would have been subject to any speed restrictions for most of the journey.|$|E

2500|$|The Army of the Potomac had {{significant}} changes in general officer assignments because of its battle losses. Meade's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, was wounded on July 3 and was replaced on July 8 by Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys; Brig. Gen. Henry Price replaced Humphreys in command of his old division of the III Corps. Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, killed on July 1, was replaced by Maj. Gen. John Newton of the VI Corps. Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock of the II Corps, wounded on July 3, was replaced by Brig. Gen. William Hays. Maj. Gen. William H. French, who had temporarily commanded the garrison at Harpers Ferry {{for most of the}} campaign, replaced the wounded Daniel Sickles in command of the III Corps on July 7. In addition to the battle losses, Meade's army was plagued by a condition that persisted during the war, the departure of men and regiments whose enlistments had expired, which took effect {{even in the midst of}} an active campaign. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side,</b> however, Meade had available temporary, although inexperienced, reinforcements of about 10,000 men who had been with General French at Maryland Heights, which were incorporated into the I Corps and III Corps. The net effect of expiring enlistments and reinforcements added about 6,000 men to the Army of the Potomac. Including the forces around Harpers Ferry, Maryland Heights, and the South Mountain passes, by July 14 between 11,000 and 12,000 men had been added the army, although Meade had extreme doubts about the combat effectiveness of these troops. In addition to the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch of the Department of the Susquehanna had 7,600 men at Waynesboro, 11,000 at Chambersburg, and 6,700 at Mercersburg. These were [...] "emergency troops" [...] that were hastily raised during Lee's march into Pennsylvania and were subject to Meade's orders. In addition, a force of about 6,000 from the newly created Department of West Virginia under Brig. Gen. Benjamin Franklin Kelley sat astride the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at Grafton, and New Creek, to prevent Confederate forces from retreating west, as well as later assisting in the pursuit of Lee toward Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|The MCC tour party left Western Australia for South Australia {{with several}} concerns. Their 16-man squad {{had been reduced}} by knee {{injuries}} to captain Peter May and batsman Willie Watson. On <b>the</b> <b>plus</b> <b>side</b> Tom Graveney, Colin Cowdrey and Peter May all made centuries and Brian Statham, Peter Loader, Jim Laker, and Tony Lock had taken wickets. South Australia were not a strong team at this time and none of their players were certain of a Test place. Vice-captain Colin Cowdrey captained the MCC in place of May, but lost the toss to Colin Pinch who chose to bat. Les Favell (19) and Gavin Stevens (38) knocked up 43 runs in 52 minutes against Frank Tyson bowling downwind with Fred Trueman at fast-medium pace at the other end. Tyson was taken off and when Trueman was given the wind he bowled Favell. He was joined by Jim Laker (5/31) who amazed Clarrie Grimmett by getting the ball {{to turn on the}} first day, the great Australian leg-spinner {{had never been able to}} do this until the third day at the Adelaide Oval, and Tony Lock (0/40) was brought on. After lunch Tyson dismissed John Lill (34) and Johnny Martin for a duck, the last six wickets fell for 26 runs and South Australia were out for 165. Fast bowler John Drennan had injured himself batting, but opened the bowling at medium pace without any luck. Peter Richardson held the team together with 88 and added 102 with Tom Graveney (41), but the left-arm wrist spinner Johnny Martin was brought on for his state debut having moved west from New South Wales. Like Arthur Mailey he [...] "bowled like a millionaire" [...] and worked his way through the MCC batting with old-fashioned bowling figures of 7/110. Trueman hit the [...] "Chinamen" [...] for 4212446 in his eleven-minute 23 before he was caught and the innings ended on 245, a lead of only 80. With the wind behind him again Tyson beat Stevens with pace to catch him leg before, but the South Australians were [...] "Lakered and Locked" [...] as the Surrey spinners took 5/70 and 4/65, only Martin with two sixes in his 37 made a fight of it and they were out for 194 on the third day. Needing 115 to win Richardson (40) and Milton (63 not out) opened with 100 for the first wicket and the tourists won by 9 wickets that evening in extra time to give the players the fourth day off.|$|E
