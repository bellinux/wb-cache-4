5|$|Ascending the {{staircase}} are bronze railings with mahogany banisters. The railings {{are decorated with}} the swastika symbol which, whilst mostly associated with Nazi Germany, has been traced {{back as far as}} the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Asia. The stairway's newel posts, on the landing between the second and third floors, are a pair of bronze ram's heads, identical newel posts grace <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> as well. The second floor landing offers a view of the stained glass windows, all original, which were fully restored during the 1980s renovation. Elevator access is also located on the second floor landing, the elevator was a 1950s addition to the courthouse. Originally, to access the third floor, the only option was one of two staircases. Both staircases rose from the second floor landing to the third floor, one staircase was located to either side of the stairwell leading to the landing. When the elevator was installed {{the staircase}} on the left-hand side of the landing was removed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E

25|$|After Ryan {{was sentenced}} to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow {{prisoner}} Peter John Walker (who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery). When Ryan was informed {{that his wife was}} seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided to go along with him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia. At around 2:07pm on Sunday, 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker put the escape plan into effect. As prison officers were taking turns attending a staff Christmas party in the officers' mess hall, Ryan and Walker scaled a five-metre prison wall with the aid of two wooden benches, a hook and blankets. Running {{along the top of the}} wall to a prison watch tower, they overpowered prison warder Helmut Lange and took his M1 carbine rifle. Ryan threatened Lange and demanded he pull the lever to open the prison tower gate. Lange, however, deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan, Walker and Lange then proceeded down the steps to the tower gate, but it would not open. At <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> was the night officers' lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange's back and marched him back up the stairs so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park. To the escapees' dismay there were only two cars in the car park and one had a flat tyre.|$|E

After a night of merriment, a joke is played on the Naidaijin by making him believe that a present he had {{received}} is directly from the Empress; thus requiring an open return. Murasaki Shikibu goes on to describe how noble and dignified Norimichi looked on that day and how his nurse was overwhelmed by his appearance. In a sacred dance performed at night, the mediocre performance of one dancer who had been [...] "very handsome last year" [...] reminded Murasaki Shikibu [...] "of the fleeting life of us all". The illustration associated with this scene shows the Imperial Messenger, Fujiwara no Norimichi, his head decorated with wisteria branches {{on the top of a}} staircase of a shrine building.

500|$|The {{landlord}} of The Plumbers Arms {{described how}} Lady Lucan had entered his bar covered [...] "head to toe in blood" [...] before {{she fell into}} [...] "a state of shock". He claimed that she shouted [...] "Help me, help me, I've just escaped from being murdered" [...] and [...] "My children, my children, he's murdered my nanny". Pathologist Keith Simpson outlined his post-mortem examination, concluding that death was caused by [...] "blunt head injuries" [...] and [...] "inhalation of blood". He confirmed that the lead pipe found at the scene was most likely responsible for Rivett's injuries; some, to the left eye and mouth, he thought {{more likely to have}} been caused by punches from a clenched fist. The last person to confirm seeing Lucan alive, Susan Maxwell-Scott, told the court that the earl looked [...] "dishevelled", and his hair [...] "a little ruffled". His trousers had a damp patch on the right hip. Lucan had told her that he was walking, or passing by the house when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man. He let himself in but slipped in a pool of blood at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> He told Maxwell-Scott that the attacker ran off, and that Veronica was [...] "very hysterical" [...] and accused him of having hired a hitman to kill her.|$|E

2500|$|The cave's {{entrance}} {{appears as}} a large hole in the ground. [...] At its mouth, the entrance trail drops suddenly over a jumble of volcanic rocks. [...] This area {{is known as the}} Collapsed Corridor. [...] It is the result of ground water freezing in rock cracks in the ceiling. [...] Loosened rocks eventually fall. [...] Over the centuries, the fallen rocks have accumulated into a large boulder pile. [...] Since freezing temperatures occurs only near the mouth of the cave, most rock-falls are in this area.

The Regimental Museum occupies the original drawing room suite. Below the library was the billiard room, accessible {{from the bottom of}} the staircase, through the red door on the right. The 1867 block has warm air grilles in the skirting boards, and the heating was probably provided by a boiler. [...] However there is a legend that hot air was ducted from the Haley Mill nearby. On the floors of the marble gallery and the chapel lobby are encaustic tiles by Maw & Co. of Staffordshire.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 May 2013, it was {{reported}} that the House had been [...] "completely redesigned". On 23 May 2013, it was confirmed that the house would be 'Eco' in design. The series was expected to show the objective of self-sufficiency and recycling throughout and this was represented throughout the house. Inside the house, as housemates entered, they were greeted by a huge wall containing recycled life-sized doors. Behind one of the doors was the Diary Room; a housemate could call to talk to Big Brother in this room from <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Inside the Diary Room was a metallic based chair, layered in slim red padding. Outside of the Diary Room, there was a sweeping staircase leading down to an eco-living room with producers desperate to make the housemates experience 'hell in a hell house'. The living room contained different coloured sofas and chairs and a plasma television. Beside the living room, there was a circular style kitchen for housemates to use. The housemates could store their food items and utensils obtained from the adjacent store room in a purpose-built cow. There was a round table for housemates to sit at and eat together at. Beside the living room, there was a small toilet, and the bedroom. The bedroom was colourful in design this year, and introduced a bike which powered the hair dryers and hair straighteners when active. Both the bedroom and the living area led out into the garden. This series, the garden had a barred prison for any housemates that misbehaved, as well as a treehouse for housemates to get cosy in and it included the returning vegetable patch which was last seen in Big Brother 4. Housemates had to shower outside; with one housemate having to spin a wheel that powered the only shower. The traditional mangle also made its return to the house. House pictures were officially unveiled in the Daily Star on 10 June 2013.|$|E
