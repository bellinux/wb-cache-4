5|$|The Minister Herald (Dahonglu 大鴻臚) {{was also}} known as the Grand Herald; he was also called the Director of Guests (Dianke 典客) between 202 BC and 144 BC and Prefect Grand Usher (Daxingling 大行令) between 144 BC and 104 BC. He was the chief {{official}} in charge of receiving honored guests, such as nobles and foreign ambassadors, at the imperial court. Alongside the Minister of the Imperial Clan, his ministry oversaw the inheritance of titles and fiefs by condoling on behalf of the emperor at kings' funerals and memorializing the posthumous names of kings and marquises. The Minister Herald's office received <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> from the commanderies and kingdoms when they arrived in the capital {{at the beginning of the}} year, before passing them on to the Excellencies. His subordinates acted as seating guides and ushers for officials, nobles, and foreign delegates at imperial ceremonies and sacrifices. One of his subordinates maintained living quarters for officials in the commanderies and kingdoms who were traveling to the capital. While the Minister Herald had always conducted the formal reception of foreign envoys and enlisted the aid of interpreters, his powers in matters of foreign affairs were expanded further when the post of Director of Dependent States was abolished in 28 BC. However, by Eastern Han his duties involving the affairs of Dependent States were transferred to local administrations along the borders.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{diversity in}} Australian public sector organisations, <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> have been promoted {{as an appropriate}} tool to discharge the accountability of all government agencies. Further, <b>annual</b> <b>reporting</b> competitions have been promoted {{as a means of}} ensuring the quality of those <b>annual</b> <b>reports.</b> <b>The</b> limited prior research which addresses these positions ignores the possibility {{that there may be a}} variation in the value of both <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> and <b>the</b> competition depending on the type of public sector organization.

25|$|The various benzodiazepines {{differ in}} their {{toxicity}} since they produce varying levels of sedation in overdose. A 1993 British study of deaths during the 1980s found flurazepam and temazepam more frequently involved in drug-related deaths, causing more deaths per million prescriptions than other benzodiazepines. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal toxicity index of any benzodiazepine (15.0), followed by temazepam (11.9), versus benzodiazepines overall (5.9), taken with or without alcohol. An Australian (1995) study found oxazepam less toxic and less sedative, and temazepam more toxic and more sedative, than most benzodiazepines in overdose. An Australian study (2004) of overdose admissions between 1987 and 2002 found alprazolam, {{which happens to be}} the most prescribed benzodiazepine in the U.S. by a large margin, to be more toxic than diazepam and other benzodiazepines. They also cited a review of <b>the</b> <b>Annual</b> <b>Reports</b> of the American Association of Poison Control Centers National Data Collection System, which showed alprazolam was involved in 34 fatal deliberate self-poisonings over 10 years (1992–2001), compared with 30 fatal deliberate self-poisonings involving diazepam. In a New Zealand study (2003) of 200 deaths, Zopiclone, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, had similar overdose potential as benzodiazepines.|$|E

ENVIRONMENTAL DISCLOSURE BY AUSTRALIAN COMPANIES: WHAT IS HAPPENING OUTSIDE <b>THE</b> <b>ANNUAL</b> <b>REPORT?</b> <b>The</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> has developed {{as one of}} the most common places to find environmental reporting, however, as is pointed out by many authors, there is no evidence that <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> is used because it is the most appropriate medium or finds the relevant audiences for this type of material. This study therefore investigates a variety of other reporting media produced by Australian companies. A major implication of the findings is that except for the use of separate environmental reports or the company web site, little use is made of any other form of <b>reporting</b> media outside <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report.</b> <b>The</b> findings also suggest, however, that as the use of separate environmental reports increases, the predominance of disclosure in <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report</b> for environmental disclosure may diminish (although social disclosures may remain in <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>report),</b> indicating a need for change in the direction of environmental disclosure research...|$|R

25|$|The Hong Kong AIDS Foundation is a {{registered}} charitable institution which depends on funding and donations. According to <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> of year 2002–2005, the Foundation received funding mainly from the AIDS Trust Fund, donations and income from the seed fund. The greatest contribution in terms of monetary value comes from the seed fund, in which the capital donation came from the Hong Kong SAR Government and The Hong Kong Jockey Club. The Foundation has a continued annual trend of current expenses exceeding current income and therefore relies on the income brought by the seed fund as well as investments which contributes to surpluses {{at the end of}} March throughout the years. The top three donors were AIDS Trust Fund (愛滋病信託基金委員會), Maryknoll China Service and Levi Strauss & Co.in the year 2004–2005. Also, the Foundation is exempted from Hong Kong profits tax as it is {{a registered}} charitable institution. The fund is mainly spent on various projects and activities, library development, education and publicity programs and other administrative costs like salaries for full-time staff. The percentage of expenses spent on staff and allowances has remained high throughout the years – 69% of the total amount of expenditure was allocated under the category of staff and allowances in the year 2005.

In 1874, Cope was employed with the Wheeler survey, {{a group of}} surveys led by George Montague Wheeler that mapped parts of the United States west of the 100th meridian. The survey traveled through New Mexico, whose Puerco formations, {{he wrote to his}} father, provided [...] "the most important find in geology I have ever made". The New Mexico bluffs contained millions of years of formation and subsequent deformation, and were in an area which had not been visited by Leidy or Marsh. Being part of the survey had other advantages; Cope was able to draw on fort commissaries and defray publishing costs. While there was no salary, his findings would be published in <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> the surveys printed. Cope brought Annie and Julia along on one such survey, and rented a house for them at Fort Bridger, but he spent more of his own money on these survey trips than he would have liked.|$|E

500|$|In Upper Canada, he {{returned}} to a community that had begun to question his leadership. [...] William and Lawrence Herchmer led a group within the community that opposed Jones' influence, claiming it was turning the Mississaugas of the Credit Mission into [...] "Brown Englishmen". [...] The brothers, while Christians, objected to the harsh discipline imposed on the young, the use of voting rather than consensus to govern {{and the loss of}} Indian lifestyle and culture. [...] By 1840, the settlement was very strained; pressure from white settlers, scarcity of wood and the uncertainty of whether the band had claims to the land they occupied forced the band council to begin considering relocation. [...] 1840 also saw the Methodist church split into two factions, Canadian Methodists and British Wesleyans. [...] Various Indian bands aligned with either church, and competition hampered missionary work. [...] Of Jones' friends within the church, only Egerton Ryerson remained in the Canadian conference. [...] With the background of these conflicts in the Credit Settlement, it became increasingly difficult for Jones to travel. [...] Jones influence with the provincial government remained small. [...] Although the Mississaugas of the Credit had been promised title deeds, Jones' meeting with Lieutenant Governor George Arthur failed to produce them. [...] Indian Agent Samuel Jarvis, appointed in 1837, ignored the Mississaugas, failing to issue them <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> on their trust funds and failing to respond to letters. [...] The strain of these community splits, combined with Jones' responsibilities as a father after the birth of his first son, Charles Augustus (Wahweyaakuhmegoo (Waawiyekamigoo, [...] "The Round World")) in April 1839, prevented Jones from undertaking many [...] tours. [...] As Eliza had previously had two miscarriages and two stillbirths, the couple took great care in raising Charles.|$|E

6000|$|But the {{managers}} will {{not and should}} not be satisfied with these limits to the municipal power. If they are deprived of the protection of the Lord Chamberlain's licence, {{and at the same time}} efficiently protected against every attempt at censorship by the licensing authority, the enemies of the theatre will resort to the ordinary law, and try to get from the prejudices of a jury what they are debarred from getting from the prejudices of a County Council or City Corporation. Moral Reform Societies, [...] "Purity" [...] Societies, Vigilance Societies, exist in England and America for the purpose of enforcing the existing laws against obscenity, blasphemy, Sabbath-breaking, the debauchery of children, prostitution and so forth. The paid officials of these societies, in their anxiety to produce plenty of evidence of their activity in <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>reports</b> which go out to the subscribers, do not always discriminate between an obscene postcard and an artistic one, or to put it more exactly, between a naked figure and an indecent one. They often combine a narrow but terribly sincere sectarian bigotry with a complete ignorance of art and history. Even when they have some culture, their livelihood is at the mercy of subscribers and committee men who have none. If these officials had any power of distinguishing between art and blackguardism, between morality and virtue, between immorality and vice, between conscientious heresy and mere baseness of mind and foulness of mouth, they might be trusted by theatrical managers not to abuse the powers of the common informer. As it is, it has been found necessary, in order to enable good music to be performed on Sunday, to take away these powers in that particular, and vest them solely in the Attorney-General. This disqualification of the common informer should be extended to the initiation of all proceedings of a censorial character against theatres. Few people are aware of the monstrous laws against blasphemy which still disgrace our statute book. If any serious attempt were made to carry them out, prison accommodation would have to be provided for almost every educated person in the country, beginning with the Archbishop of Canterbury. Until some government with courage and character enough to repeal them comes into power, it is not too much to ask that such infamous powers of oppression should be kept in responsible hands and not left at the disposal of every bigot ignorant enough to be unaware of the social dangers of persecution. Besides, the common informer is not always a sincere bigot, who believes he is performing an action of signal merit in silencing and ruining a heretic. He is unfortunately just as often a blackmailer, who has studied his powers as a common informer in order that he may extort money for refraining from exercising them. If the manager is to be responsible he should be made responsible to a responsible functionary. To be responsible to every fanatical ignoramus who chooses to prosecute him for exhibiting a cast of the Hermes of Praxiteles in his vestibule, or giving a performance of Measure for Measure, is mere slavery. It is made bearable at present by the protection of the Lord Chamberlain's certificate. But when that is no longer available, the common informer must be disarmed if the manager is to enjoy security.|$|E
