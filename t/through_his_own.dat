5|$|After unsuccessfully {{shopping}} {{the album}} to record companies, Chesnutt released it {{himself on his}} website in September 2002 before releasing it on September 24 <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> label Ready, Set, Go!. The album charted for one week on the Billboard 200 and had sold 25,000 copies by March 30, 2003, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The Headphone Masterpiece was well received by music critics, who found it musically adventurous, albeit indulgent.|$|E

5|$|In 1914, Petrie {{launched}} the academic journal Ancient Egypt, published <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), {{which was based}} at UCL. Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as de facto editor much of the time. She also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the {{political}} climate in Italy (under Mussolini) became unacceptable to Escher. He {{had no interest in}} politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.|$|E
5|$|Modern mythographers {{have seen}} the story of Orion {{as a way to}} access local folk tales and cultic {{practices}} directly without the interference of ancient high culture; several of them have explained Orion, each <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> interpretation of Greek prehistory and of how Greek mythology represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.|$|E
60|$|They {{drove in}} silence to Porchester Square. The Baron {{led the way}} <b>through</b> into <b>his</b> <b>own</b> private sanctum, {{and closed the door}} carefully. Cigars, cigarettes, whiskey and soda, and liqueurs were upon the sideboard.|$|R
2500|$|In 1747 Peter Studebaker built a road <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>owned</b> {{properties}} {{known as}} Broadfording Wagon Road. The road he built carried heavy traffic to Bakers Lookout's wagon and forging services that were instrumental {{to expand the}} west. The Maryland Historical Trust WA-I-306 writes 04/03/2001, that this road was [...] "One of Washington County's earliest thoroughfares, Broadfording (Wagon) Road was already in existence in 1747." [...] The wagon transportation industry boomed. On the property, Broadfording Wagon Road built in 1740 by Peter Studebaker, went directly through the property to allow access from the home to the factory and to the mill.|$|R

5|$|The {{album was}} {{created as a}} ploy by Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, to self-release an Elvis Presley album <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> label, Boxcar Records. As it would not consist of content that contractually belonged to RCA Records, Parker was {{theoretically}} able to retain the profits from the album. Having Fun with Elvis on Stage was first distributed at Elvis Presley concerts, but RCA would later package and distribute it.|$|E
5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his unique position in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> publicly proven merits.|$|E
5000|$|Eazy-Duz-It is {{the solo}} debut album of rapper and N.W.A member Eazy-E, {{released}} on September 13, 1988, <b>through</b> both <b>his</b> <b>own</b> label Ruthless Records {{as well as}} Priority Records. The production by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella was deemed dense and funky by critic Jason Birchmeier.|$|R
50|$|Javier Hernandez (born April 23, 1966) is an American artist, {{comic book}} creator, and radio host from Whittier, California. Perhaps {{best known for}} {{creating}} the popular series, El Muerto: The Aztec Zombie, {{the majority of his}} works are published <b>through</b> <b>his</b> privately <b>owned</b> imprint, Los Comex.|$|R
50|$|He was a style {{historic}} architect, {{also called}} an eclectic architect. After finishing his studies, {{he worked at}} the Superintendent-chamber, which was a predecessor to the Swedish Fastighetsverket. <b>Through</b> <b>his</b> state <b>owned</b> work employer he got the opportunity to draw, create and be the architect of about 40 barracks facilities for the armed forces around Sweden between 1891 and 1922.

5|$|Virgin, {{whom the}} {{messenger}} salutes in angelic speech, {{you were born}} without stain: I ask that you implore him – who, born from the conception of celestial seed holds the mysterious command as triunal deity – to forgive me my sins, that he may deign to grant longlasting joys <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> eternity and to look upon me with {{the sight of his}} holy vision.|$|E
5|$|As the {{commander}} of the Permanent Municipal Guard Corps, Luís Alves brought order to the streets of Rio de Janeiro, <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> skill and through partnership with the city's chief of police, Eusébio de Queirós. Luís Alves was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel on 12 September 1837. Eusébio de Queirós {{was a member of the}} Partido Regressista (Reactionary Party), which had come to power that year. Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, one of the leading Reactionaries and a government minister, attempted to attract Luís Alves to his party.|$|E
5|$|Eugenio Espejo was an autodidact, and {{he claimed}} with pride {{that he never}} left any book in his hands unread, and if he did, he would {{make up for it}} by observing nature. However, his desire to read {{everything}} indiscriminately sometimes led him to hasty judgments, which appear in his manuscripts. <b>Through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> written work, it can be inferred that Espejo considered education as the main means for popular development. He understood that reading was basic {{in the formation of the}} self, and his conscience drove him to critiques of the establishment, based on observation and in the application of the law of his time.|$|E

5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts {{to go through the}} Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E
5|$|War {{memorials}} {{became a}} common sight in British towns and cities following the First World War (1914–1918). Almost one million men from Britain {{were killed in the}} conflict, and monuments were erected in virtually every settlement in the country. The memorial raised in Spalding, a town in southern Lincolnshire in eastern England, was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, who had previously established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy clients. From 1917 onwards, Lutyens dedicated much of his time to the memorialisation of the war dead, first advising the Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) and later designing war memorials both for the commission and <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> practice. Spalding was one of his first war memorial commissions.|$|E
5|$|Cubitt was {{originally}} a carpenter and, like Denison senior, had acquired his wealth <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> business acumen, {{building up a}} successful company and business empire. At the time he purchased Denbies, Cubitt was nearing completion of the work on Osborne House for Queen Victoria and Prince Albert on the Isle of Wight. Cubitt wanted a mansion of his own to emulate that of the neighbouring Georgian country house of Deepdene owned by the affluent Hope family of bankers {{and at that time}} in the possession of Henry Thomas Hope, a patron of the arts. For the practical purpose of continuing to reside in the existing house while building took place, the new mansion was constructed on a site slightly to the southwest of its predecessor, which was demolished once the new mansion was completed in 1854.|$|E
5000|$|June, 1971: Schneider {{started a}} plan to acquire new {{telephone}} equipment from PTT, market it as [...] "refurbished," [...] and sell it <b>through</b> CSE, <b>his</b> <b>own</b> company.

5|$|Gossip {{was born}} in New York City on December 6, 1841, to George Hatfeild Gossip, an Englishman, and his wife Mary Ellen Dingley Gossip, of New York. When he was sixteen months old, his mother died; about two years later, {{he and his father}} moved to England. His aunt, Mrs. Reaston Rodes, raised him, {{apparently}} with little involvement by his father. Gossip grew up at Barlborough Hall, Derbyshire (the Rodes family seat) and at Hatfield, in Yorkshire. Both the Gossip and Rodes families are listed in Burke's Landed Gentry. He was educated at Windermere College, Westmorland, and won a scholarship to Oxford University, but was unable to attend as his father, uncle, and aunts lost a lawsuit that ruined them financially. As a result, Gossip had to support himself <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> labors.|$|E
5|$|Lad: A Dog was {{published}} by Dutton in April 1919, {{a year after the}} real-life Lad's death. Terhune continued receiving royalties for the novel up <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> death. His wife, Anice Terhune, ceased receiving the royalties after she surrendered the rights to them, along with those of Bruce and His Dog in exchange for E.P. Dutton agreeing to publish and perpetually print her work Across the Line, a supposed set of conversations she had with her late husband. With this agreement, Dutton became sole owners of the copyright to Lad: A Dog. Macrae later decided that the agreement was not completely fair to Anice and modified it to provide her a payment of $100 a month {{for the rest of her}} life, likely exceeding the profits they earned on the novels as the years passed.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than the}} typical anarchist interpretation, others have {{analysed}} the character as a Marxist (opposite to Batman's capitalist), arguing that anarchism requires the rejection of all authority in favor of uncontrolled freedom. The Joker rejects most authority, but retains his own, using his actions to coerce and consolidate power in himself and convert the masses to his own way of thinking, while eliminating any that oppose him. In The Killing Joke, the Joker is an abused member of the underclass who is driven insane by failings of the social system. The Joker rejects material needs, and his first appearance in Batman #1 sees him perpetrate crimes against Gotham's wealthiest men and the judge who had sent him to prison. Batman is wealthy, yet the Joker is able to triumph <b>through</b> <b>his</b> <b>own</b> innovations.|$|E
5000|$|He was nicknamed by his Torino {{teammates}} [...] "due metri e settanta" [...] (2.7 meters) {{because he}} had difficulty sweeping <b>through</b> balls inside <b>his</b> <b>own</b> area; those he swept often did not exceed three meters.|$|R
50|$|Experiencing a Spain {{ranging from}} the utterly squalid to the utterly beautiful, Lee creates a story which evocatively captures the spirit and {{atmosphere}} of the towns and countryside he passes <b>through</b> in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> distinctive semi-poetic style. He is warmly welcomed by the Spaniards he meets and enjoys a generous hospitality even from the poorest villagers he encounters along the way.|$|R
50|$|During {{the bombing}} of the Second World War, his house and studio were destroyed. In 1947 he {{returned}} to his home region of Baden, and established the Karl Albiker Foundation, <b>through</b> which, <b>his</b> <b>own</b> works and those of his private art collection, including more than 80 works by Karl Hofer, were passed into the possession of the Museum of the City of Ettlingen.|$|R
