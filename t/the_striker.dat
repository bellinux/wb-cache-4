5|$|An almost injury-free season helped Shearer {{improve on}} his {{previous}} year's tally in the 1998–99 season, <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> converting 14goals in 30 league games and replacing Rob Lee as Newcastle captain, but Newcastle finished 13th again, with Ruud Gullit having replaced Kenny Dalglish {{just after the}} season got underway.

5|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} against Bayern Munich in the {{knockout}} stages.

50|$|Back on the field, {{under coach}} John Kosmina, <b>the</b> <b>Strikers</b> {{justified}} <b>the</b> efforts {{of those who}} fought for {{their place in the}} national competition by finishing fourth and qualifying for the NSL finals against all the expectations of those south of the border.

5|$|Despite making {{just one}} goalless {{appearance}} as England failed to progress past the Euro 1992 group stages, Shearer was soon subject to an English transfer record-breaking £3.6million bid from Blackburn Rovers.

5|$|Kane's {{style of}} play has been {{compared}} to that of former Tottenham forward Jürgen Klinsmann, a comparison Kane called flattering in February 2015. In March 2015, Football Association chairman Greg Dyke named Kane as the benchmark for clubs producing young English players. Shearer said that month that the three best strikers playing in the league were Kane, Diego Costa and Sergio Agüero.

5|$|McLean's favoured {{position}} is {{as a central}} midfielder, but he can also play as a left midfielder. He {{has said that he}} favours playing in the centre because he can get more of the ball and influence play more than when he is on the left. He is a naturally attacking player and when playing in the centre he makes runs to and beyond <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> which adds an extra dimension to his team's play.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's league {{campaign}} {{started on}} 9 August 1997, with an away fixture at Leeds United. The match {{ended in a}} 1–1 draw; Ian Wright scored his first goal of the season, before a mix up in defence meant Leeds striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink equalised for the home team. Two days later, at home to Coventry City, Wright scored both goals in Arsenal's 2–0 win, leaving <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> one goal away from equalling Cliff Bastin's club goalscoring record. Two goals from Dennis Bergkamp and a debut goal by midfielder Marc Overmars, the following week helped Arsenal to win at Southampton. In spite of Bergkamp scoring a hat-trick against Leicester City, Arsenal drew the match 3–3, having conceded a third in the sixth minute of stoppage time. A further draw at home to rivals Tottenham Hotpsur, for whom defender Sol Campbell particularly impressed, meant Arsenal ended August in fifth position.|$|E
5|$|As 1997 {{turned to}} 1998, an {{inspirational}} performance from Giggs helped a modest United side labour for a hard-earned three points and still maintain {{their desire for}} a fifth title in six seasons. A trip to the Dell to play Southampton – where United were undone last season repeated itself, this time by a solitary Kevin Davies goal in the third minute. The Saints pulled off a valiant performance, most notably from goalkeeper Paul Jones, who denied Solskjær from scoring right at {{the death of the}} second half. Things went from bad to worse in January as Tony Cottee popped in to stun Old Trafford and score the winner for Leicester in what proved a wretched season for <b>the</b> <b>striker.</b> This was the Foxes first win in the league since November and United's first home defeat of the season and fifth altogether.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 <b>the</b> Goulburn <b>Strikers</b> {{finished}} <b>the</b> league {{season in}} third place and were eliminated in <b>the</b> semi-finals. <b>The</b> <b>Strikers</b> {{were not to be}} denied however in 2014 when under the leadership of Coach Robin Caulfield <b>the</b> <b>Strikers</b> finished second in the league only to go on to win the Grand final.|$|R

5|$|Kahn was {{initially}} {{called for the}} German national team as a late back-up for the 1994 FIFA World Cup; however {{he made his first}} international appearance on 23 June 1995 in a 2–1 victory against Switzerland, two months after recovering from his cruciate ligament injury. Along with Oliver Reck, Kahn was a reserve keeper of the squad, which won the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship in England. He spent the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France on the bench, and it was not until Andreas Köpke announced his retirement {{at the end of the}} tournament that Kahn became the starting goalkeeper. Two years after the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship, in which defending champions Germany made an embarrassing exit in the group stage, Kahn received the squad's captaincy, succeeding <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> Oliver Bierhoff.|$|E

Steve Yates pulled a goal back for Tranmere after half-time, but in the 52nd minute Steven Gerrard headed-in a cross to restore Liverpool's two-goal advantage. A mistake by Robbie Fowler gifted substitute Wayne Allison the chance to score, but <b>the</b> <b>striker</b> made amends as he converted a penalty kick in the 81st minute.
