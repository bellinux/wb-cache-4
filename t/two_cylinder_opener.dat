40|$|This {{experimental}} study is about suppression of flow-induced vibration with flexible sheet {{and characteristics of}} flow-induced vibration of elastically supported <b>two</b> circular <b>cylinders</b> in side-by-side arrangement. In particular, the characteristics of flow-induced vibration of the <b>two</b> <b>cylinders</b> are investigated with changing flow speed at each spacing ratio L/D (L: space between <b>two</b> <b>cylinders,</b> D : diameter of cylinder). Flow patterns around the vibrating <b>two</b> <b>cylinders</b> are also investigated by flow visualization with reproducing the state of elastically supported vibration accurately in forced vibration apparatus. It is clarified that characteristics of flow-induced vibration of <b>two</b> <b>cylinders</b> are changed with switching flow passing through the <b>two</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The method to suppress the flow-induced vibration of a single cylinder by attaching flexible sheet(21) is also tested for <b>two</b> <b>cylinders</b> side-by-side arrangement. As a result, suppression effect by attaching the flexible sheet on the <b>two</b> circular <b>cylinders</b> in side-by-side arrangement is confirmed...|$|R
