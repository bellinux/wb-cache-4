50|$|Schön's {{field of}} {{research}} was condensed matter physics and nanotechnology. He received his PhD from the University of Konstanz in 1997. In late 1997 {{he was hired by}} Bell Labs, located in New Jersey, United States. There, he worked on electronics in which conventional semiconducting elements (such as silicon) were replaced by crystalline organic materials. Specific organic materials can conduct electrical currents, and in a field-effect transistor (a refined implementation of the <b>transistor</b> <b>effect,</b> which was pioneered in 1947 in the same laboratory) the conductance can be switched on or off, a basic function in the field of electronics. Schön, however, claimed spectacular on/off behavior, far beyond anything achieved thus far with organic materials. His measurements in most cases confirmed various theoretical predictions, for example that the organic materials could be made to display superconductivity or be used in lasers. The findings were published in prominent scientific publications, including the journals Science and Nature, and gained worldwide attention. However, no research group anywhere in the world succeeded in reproducing the results claimed by Schön.|$|E
