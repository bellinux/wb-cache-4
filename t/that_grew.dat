5|$|One {{section of}} the M11 {{extension}} was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead. Residents had believed that this would save their green, and a 250-year-old sweet chestnut tree <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> upon it, but {{because this was a}} cut and cover tunnel, this required the tree to be cut down.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> {{to become}} Banagher, originated at a ford {{on the east}} bank of the River Shannon. The river banks and surrounding countryside were flood-free all year round. Travellers intending to cross the Shannon converged on this point along tracks which were the forerunners of the modern roads, and a community grew at this crossing point.|$|E
50|$|A {{corticolous}} lichen is a lichen <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on bark. This is {{contrasted with}} a lignicolous lichen <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on wood <b>that</b> {{has had the}} bark stripped from it, and saxicolous lichens <b>that</b> <b>grow</b> on rock.|$|R
50|$|A lignocolous lichen is a lichen <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on wood <b>that</b> has {{the bark}} {{stripped}} from it. This {{is to be}} compared to a corticolous lichen <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on bark, and saxicolous lichens <b>that</b> <b>grow</b> on rock.|$|R

5|$|After World War I, {{the rivalry}} calmed, and Gothenburg {{supporters}} {{became known as}} friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called Göteborgstågen, the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to Borås to see IFK play Elfsborg. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg and disturbing a wartime blackout exercise.|$|E
5|$|After the kickoff, Florida State went three-and-out and punted back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies {{began their}} second {{possession}} of the quarter at their 39-yard line and started the drive with five consecutive running plays, advancing 28 yards in the process. Tech then switched to its passing offense, throwing four consecutive passes. Three were complete, and the final one, a 21-yard toss from Taylor to Wilson, ended with the running back carrying {{the ball into the}} end zone. The score capped a nine-play, 61-yard drive <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> the Hokies' advantage to 18 points, 35–17.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the rise}} of slavery {{was due to the}} {{increasing}} rise of crops being produced and traded, more specifically {{the rise of}} the plantation economy The rise of the plantations was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.|$|E

5000|$|Lithophytes are plants <b>that</b> <b>grow</b> in or on rocks. Those <b>that</b> <b>grow</b> on {{rocks are}} {{also known as}} epipetric or epilithic plants. Lithophytes <b>that</b> <b>grow</b> on land feed off {{nutrients}} from rain water and nearby decaying plants, including their own dead tissue. [...] grow in fissures in rocks where soil or organic matter has accumulated.|$|R
5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> on ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E
5|$|In mythology, {{birds were}} {{sometimes}} monsters, like the Roc and the Māori's Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, {{the first to}} come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality. Its task was to shake the seeds of all the plants out of the tree.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th {{or early}} 7th century a natural {{disaster}} caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried {{the surface of the}} site under a deep layer of silt, completely changing the landscape. Only those buildings that stood above the mud continued in use, including group A, saved by its hilltop location. The earthen platform on the valley floor also continued in use, at least those parts of it that stood above the silt, {{and it was one of}} the site's smaller complexes <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> to become the new centre of Quiriguá, as represented by the monuments visible to this day.|$|E
50|$|A crustose lichen <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on rock {{is called}} a saxicolous lichen. Crustose lichens <b>that</b> <b>grow</b> on the rock are epilithic, and those <b>that</b> <b>grow</b> {{immersed}} inside rock, growing between the crystals with only their fruiting bodies exposed to the air, are called endolithic lichens. A crustose lichen <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on bark {{is called a}} corticolous lichen. A lichen <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on wood from which the bark has been stripped is called a lignicolous lichen. Lichens <b>that</b> <b>grow</b> immersed inside plant tissues are called endophloidic lichens or endophloidal lichens. Lichens that use leaves as substrates, whether the leaf {{is still on the}} tree or on the ground, are called epiphyllous or foliicolous. A terricolous lichen grows on the soil as a substrate. Many squamulous lichens are terricolous. Umbillicate lichens are foliose lichens that are attached to the substrate at only one point. A vagrant lichen is not attached to a substrate at all, and lives its life being blown around by the wind.|$|R
5000|$|In botany, shoots {{consist of}} stems {{including}} their appendages, {{the leaves and}} lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds. [...] The new growth from seed germination <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> upward is a shoot where leaves will develop. In the spring, perennial plant shoots are the new growth <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> from the ground in herbaceous plants or the new stem or flower growth <b>that</b> <b>grows</b> on woody plants.|$|R

5|$|In west Serbia's {{region of}} Rađevina, {{centered}} on the town of Krupanj, the badnjak prepared for each household is cut into three logs, {{the most important of}} which is the dozemak—the log that comes from the part of the trunk <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> nearest to the ground. In Resava, Levač, Temnić, and Jadar of Serbia, as well as in Ozren and Romanija of Bosnia, the badnjak is cut into three logs associated respectively with the men, the women, and the children.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of various}} provinces of today's Poland, Christianity's spread was slowest in Pomerania, where it gained a {{significant}} following only around the 12th century. Initially, the clergy {{came from the}} Western Christian European countries; native Polish clergy took three or four generations to emerge, and were supported by the monasteries and friars <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> increasingly common in the 12th century. By the 13th century Roman Catholicism had become the dominant religion throughout Poland.|$|E
5|$|Senegal's {{independence}} was declared on August 20, 1960, {{and after the}} dissolution of the short-lived Mali Federation, Casamance saw the arrival of officials coming from the north. Although many of them were Wolofs and Muslims, they did not know the Jola country and its traditions. The periods of drought that ravaged the Sahel in the 1970s forced peanut farmers to move to regions where rice was all <b>that</b> <b>grew.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{acquisition}} of S.G. Warburg & Co., a leading British investment banking firm, in 1995 {{for the price}} of US$1.4billion signified a major push into investment banking. S.G. Warburg & Co. had established a reputation as a daring merchant bank <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> {{to be one of the}} most respected investment banks in London. However, a Warburg expansion into the U.S. had turned out flawed and costly, and talks in 1994 with Morgan Stanley about a merger had collapsed. SBC merged the firm with its own existing investment banking unit to create SBC Warburg.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{opened in}} 1921 and spurred {{a new wave}} of {{development}} in South Jacksonville. New subdivisions were platted in Oklahoma and Villa Alexandria, including South Shores, Alexandria Place, River Oaks, and the original San Marco development, while the old Red Bank plantation became South Riverside and Colonial Manor. The 1857 the Red Bank Plantation House became a residence in the Colonial Manor neighborhood <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> around it; it is Jacksonville's second oldest residential building still in use. The bridge triggered economic development in South Jacksonville as well, though it greatly reduced the ferry business, which disappeared entirely within twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien {{at first}} {{intended}} The Lord of the Rings to be a children's tale {{in the style}} of The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more serious in the writing. Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit, it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> up after the success of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E

5|$|Trade {{was a key}} {{component}} of Maya society, and {{in the development of the}} Maya civilization. The cities <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history. The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt. In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing slave trade with wider Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 17th century {{large numbers}} of Huguenot weavers arrived in the East End, {{settling}} to service an industry <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> up around the new estate at Spitalfields, where master weavers were based. They brought with them a tradition of 'reading clubs', where books were read, often in public houses. The authorities were suspicious of immigrants meeting and in some ways they were right to be as these grew into workers' associations and political organisations. Towards the middle of the 18th century the silk industry fell into a decline – partly due to the introduction of printed calico cloth – and riots ensued. These 'Spitalfield Riots' of 1769 were actually centred to the east and were put down with considerable force, culminating in two men being hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house at Bethnal Green. One was John Doyle (an Irish weaver), the other John Valline (of Huguenot descent).|$|E
