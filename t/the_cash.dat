40|$|The thesis investigates {{construction}} project cash flows. It {{is divided into}} two main components. The first investigates <b>the</b> cumulative gross <b>cash</b> flow profiles (S curves), and the second examines <b>the</b> cumulative net <b>cash</b> flow profiles. <b>The</b> gross <b>cash</b> flow model can be used by either construction industry clients or contractors, whereas <b>the</b> net <b>cash</b> flow model concerns the contractor. Interest in {{construction project}} cash flows resulted from changed economic pressures in the 1970 s. A rise in inflation was associated with increased client attention to his gross <b>cash</b> flows to <b>the</b> contractor, and similarly higher interest rates had the effect that contractors became concerned with their net cash flows. An examination of <b>the</b> gross <b>cash</b> flow literature found that most models were aimed at discovering generally applicable ideal curves. A similar situation existed within <b>the</b> net <b>cash</b> flow literature. It was argued that the averaging approach is unsuitable for construction project cash flow research, and consequently an approach which concentrates on the individual project was pursued. A gross cash flow model was developed using logistic transformation regression procedures. This yielded excellent results for post-hoc analysis of individual project data. Furthermore <b>the</b> gross <b>cash</b> flow model was found to be suitable for the generation of a construction project net cash flow model, which was similarly oriented towards the post-hoc analysis of single projects. A measure of deviation was used which enabled the identification of projects for which <b>the</b> gross <b>cash</b> flow model was a poor fit. This same procedure was used to exclude projects from <b>the</b> net <b>cash</b> flow analysis. <b>The</b> results from <b>the</b> gross <b>cash</b> flow model analysis indicate that projects do vary considerably from one to another, and this supports the contention made that an individual approach to this research is necessary. <b>The</b> net <b>cash</b> flow model yields an excellent trend line for net cash flow on a project, and thus provides an excellent means for senior management to judge the quality of management employed on a projectRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R

5|$|After the trial, Boone {{returned}} to North Carolina {{to bring his}} family back to Kentucky. In the autumn of 1779, a large party of emigrants came with him, including (according to tradition) the family of Abraham Lincoln's grandfather. Rather than remain in Boonesborough, Boone founded the nearby settlement of Boone's Station. He began earning money at this time by locating good land for other settlers. Transylvania land claims had been invalidated after Virginia created Kentucky County, so settlers needed to file new land claims with Virginia. In 1780, Boone collected about $20,000 in cash from various settlers and traveled to Williamsburg to purchase their land warrants. While he was sleeping in a tavern during the trip, <b>the</b> <b>cash</b> was stolen from his room.
