5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a high intensity fire.|$|E
5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex ratio}} of male to female dragonflies varies both {{temporally}} and spatially. Adult dragonflies {{have a high}} male-biased ratio at breeding habitats. The male-bias ratio has contributed partially to the females using different habitats to avoid male harassment. As seen in Hine's emerald dragonfly (Somatochlora hineana), male populations use wetland habitats, while females use dry meadows and marginal breeding habitats, only migrating to the wetlands to lay their eggs or to find mating partners. Unwanted mating is energetically costly for females because it affects {{the amount of time}} <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to spend foraging.|$|E

5|$|Many procellariids {{undertake}} long annual migrations in the non-breeding season. Southern {{species of}} shearwater {{such as the}} sooty shearwater and short-tailed shearwater, breeding on islands off Australia, New Zealand and Chile, undertake transequatorial migrations of millions of birds up to the waters off Alaska and back each year during the austral winter. Manx shearwaters from the North Atlantic also undertake transequatorial migrations from Western Europe and North America to the waters off Brazil in the South Atlantic. The mechanisms of navigation are poorly understood, but displacement experiments where individuals were removed from colonies and flown to far-flung release sites have shown <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to home in on their colonies with remarkable precision. A Manx shearwater released in Boston returned to its colony in Skomer, Wales within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 kilometres (3,200mi).|$|E
5|$|Nonmetals have {{structures}} {{in which each}} atom usually forms (8−N) bonds with (8−N) nearest neighbours, where N {{is the number of}} valence electrons. Each atom is thereby able to complete its valence shell and attain a stable noble gas configuration. Exceptions to the (8−N) rule occur with hydrogen (which only needs one bond to complete its valence shell), carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Atoms of the latter three elements are sufficiently small such <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to form alternative (more stable) bonding structures, with fewer nearest neighbours. Thus, carbon is able to form its layered graphite structure, and nitrogen and oxygen are able to form diatomic molecules having triple and double bonds, respectively. The larger size of the remaining non-noble nonmetals weakens their capacity to form multiple bonds and they instead form two or more single bonds to two or more different atoms. Sulfur, for example, forms an eight-membered molecule in which the atoms are arranged in a ring, with each atom forming two single bonds to different atoms.|$|E

25|$|Nasutitermes corniger {{exhibits}} {{a large amount}} of aggression to rival conspecific colonies. This implies that there is a method of kin recognition among N. corniger that allow it to distinguish between its colony and the next. While specific studies have not been done in N. corniger, similar species in Microcerotermes and many other termites show <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to detect scent on each other.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{advantages}} of DNA vaccines is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) without the inherent risk associated with live vaccines. CTL responses can be raised against immunodominant and immunorecessive CTL epitopes, as well as subdominant CTL epitopes, in a manner that appears to mimic natural infection. This may prove to be a useful tool in assessing CTL epitopes and their role in providing immunity.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferential}} view of TOTs {{claims that}} TOTs arise from {{clues about the}} target that the rememberer can piece together.

These views disregard the presence of the target word in memory as having an effect on creating tip of the tongue states.|$|E

25|$|Education is {{also another}} {{way in which}} the {{citizens}} will benefit. As a country becomes richer, it is able to build more schools and better fund the schools already built. This was seen in Russia after the October Revolution. A better educated public leads to a more efficient workforce, and can also lead the country to technological breakthroughs in industry and manufacturing. These countries will also experience much less severe famine now <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to trade successfully on a global scale.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{males with}} {{previous}} sexual experience will modify their courtship dance {{when attempting to}} mate with new females — the experienced males spend less time courting and therefore have lower mating latencies, meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to reproduce more quickly. This decreased mating latency leads to a greater mating efficiency for experienced males over naïve males. This modification also appears to have obvious evolutionary advantages, as increased mating efficiency is extremely important {{in the eyes of}} natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Often {{private equity}} fund {{managers}} will employ the services of external fundraising teams known as placement agents {{in order to raise}} capital for their vehicles. The use of placement agents has grown over the past few years, with 40% of funds closed in 2006 employing their services, according to Preqin ltd. Placement agents will approach potential investors on behalf of the fund manager, and will typically take a fee of around 1% of the commitments <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>able</b> to garner.|$|E
