5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E

In May, at least one state delegate urged the General Assembly to call itself into special session.|$|E

5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} his refusal <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, after Germany's capitulation, many Armenians in {{both the}} Republic, {{including}} Armenian Communist Party First Secretary Grigor Harutyunyan (Arutyunov), and the diaspora lobbied Stalin <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> issue of taking back the provinces of Kars, Iğdır, and Ardahan, which Armenia had lost to Turkey in the Treaty of Kars. In September, 1945, the Soviet Union announced that it would annul the Soviet-Turkish treaty of friendship that was signed in 1925. Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Vyacheslav Molotov presented the claims put forth by the Armenians to the other Allied heads.|$|E
5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for inshore operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E

5|$|Opponents {{of capital}} {{punishment}} gathered at the Utah State Capitol to hold a rally during the final appeals. The protest was attended by Gardner's family, and was organized by Utahans for Alternatives to the Death Penalty. The protest also included the support of Brian King of the Utah House of Representatives, who pledged to urge the legislature <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> use of the capital punishment. The family of murder victim Michael Burdell had also appealed on Gardner's behalf, stating that Burdell was a pacifist who would have opposed the death penalty.|$|E

5|$|A second death, {{less than}} a week later, forced {{authorities}} <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> cause of Nickell's death. On June 11, Susan Snow, a 40-year-old Auburn bank manager, took two Extra-Strength Excedrin capsules for an early-morning headache. Snow's husband, Paul Webking, took two capsules from the same bottle for his arthritis and left the house for work. At 6:30 am, the Snows' fifteen-year-old daughter found Susan Snow collapsed on the floor of her bathroom, unresponsive and with a faint pulse. Paramedics were called and transported Snow to Harborview Medical Center, but she died later that day without regaining consciousness.|$|E

5|$|Although the Potsdam Conference {{was mainly}} {{concerned}} with European affairs, {{the war against}} Japan was also discussed in detail. Truman learned of the successful Trinity test early in the conference and shared this information with the British delegation. The successful test caused the American delegation <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> necessity and wisdom of Soviet participation, for which the U.S. had lobbied hard at the Tehran and Yalta Conferences. High on the United States' list of priorities was shortening the war and reducing American casualties—Soviet intervention seemed likely to do both, but {{at the cost of}} possibly allowing the Soviets to capture territory beyond that which had been promised to them at Tehran and Yalta, and causing a postwar division of Japan similar to that which had occurred in Germany.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided to continue and came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, Griffin {{was invited}} to address {{a meeting at the}} University of Bath by {{politics}} student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as an attempt by the party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April, at {{the start}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) landed at what later became known as Anzac Cove.

The commanders believed there would be no requirement or opportunities for mounted troops on the peninsula. However, heavy casualties, and the lack of any other reinforcements, forced them <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> decision, and the mounted troops were later dispatched to Gallipoli to serve in a dismounted role.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. They contend that a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> bypass.|$|E

5|$|The {{case was}} appealed and {{heard by the}} Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the {{herbicides}} contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were {{not intended to be}} used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied certiorari and refused <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> ruling of the Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Mask of the Lunar Eclipse came to series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi {{when he first}} saw the Wii hardware.

The gameplay concept was making the player literally feel the fear evoked in the game. The addition of further developers to the project enabled the team <b>to</b> <b>reconsider</b> <b>the</b> standard formula, although it proved to be a chaotic experience. As with previous games, the theme songs were sung by Tsuki Amano.

5|$|Upon Ivan's death, he was {{succeeded by}} his simple-minded son Feodor. Unlike his father, Feodor had no enthusiasm in {{maintaining}} exclusive trading rights with England.

Elizabeth sent a new ambassador, Dr. Giles Fletcher, to demand from the regent Boris Godunov that he convince the Tsar <b>to</b> <b>reconsider.</b> <b>The</b> negotiations failed, due to Fletcher addressing Feodor {{with two of his}} titles omitted.
