5|$|The leafcutter bee Lithurgus apicalis {{has been}} {{observed}} <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> the flowers.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have kept}} honey bee colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|In this way, {{the bucket}} orchid passes its pollen from flower to flower. This {{mechanism}} is almost {{but not quite}} species specific, as {{it is possible for}} a few closely related bees <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> any given species of orchid, as long as the bees are similar in size and are attracted by the same compounds.|$|E
50|$|Many bee flies, {{and some}} Tabanidae and Nemestrinidae are {{particularly}} adapted <b>to</b> <b>pollinating</b> fynbos and Karoo plants with narrow, deep corolla tubes, such as Lapeirousia species. Part of the adaptation {{takes the form}} of remarkably long probosces.|$|R
50|$|In {{all species}} the stamens blossom first, and the stigmas unfold later (protandry). Halothamnus subaphyllus was proved <b>to</b> be <b>pollinated</b> by insects (entomophily). There are no {{observations}} {{for the other}} species, but they are considered <b>to</b> be <b>pollinated</b> by insects, too.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} visible under {{ultraviolet}} light {{and it is}} believed that this makes them attractive <b>to</b> <b>pollinating</b> insects. They do not show a traditional bull's-eye pattern to guide the insect but the ultraviolet reflectance of the petals is very high.|$|R
5|$|Researchers are {{concerned}} that trucking colonies around the country <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> crops, where they intermingle with other bees from all over, helps spread viruses and mites among colonies. Additionally, such continuous movement and re-settlement is considered by some a strain and disruption for the entire hive, possibly rendering it less resistant {{to all sorts of}} systemic disorder.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia nigrocincta, {{commonly}} known as the jumper ant or jumping jack, is an ant of the genus Myrmecia. The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump several inches, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> certain flowers.|$|E
5|$|P. imperialis {{crossed the}} waters between Australia and New Zealand some time between 1960 and 1972, and {{seedlings}} {{of the previously}} infertile trees of F. rubiginosa began appearing in brick and stone walls, and on other trees, particularly in parks and gardens around Auckland. They have been recorded {{as far south as}} Napier. P. imperialis has been transported to Hawaii, California and Israel, where it has been observed <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> its host.|$|E
50|$|The typical {{blooming}} {{period is}} late spring (May) {{and early summer}} (June or early July). The small white-to-pinkish flowers occur in large, compact, spherical heads Marshallia are very attractive <b>to</b> <b>pollinating</b> insects, including butterflies and various beetles, such as flower chafers of the genus Euphoria.|$|R
5000|$|Passerina is a {{generally}} insignificant genus, seldom noticed by the non-botanist. The attractive ericoid habit and fuss-free growth {{make it a}} useful subject in informal fynbos gardens. Being wind-pollinated, the plants generally are not of much importance <b>to</b> <b>pollinating</b> organisms such as bees and birds.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} {{believed}} <b>to</b> be <b>pollinated</b> by birds.|$|R
5|$|Beetle-pollinated {{flowers are}} usually large, greenish or off-white in color, and heavily scented. Scents may be spicy, fruity, or similar to {{decaying}} organic material. Beetles {{were most likely}} the first insects <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> flowers. Most beetle-pollinated flowers are flattened or dish-shaped, with pollen easily accessible, although they may include traps to keep the beetle longer. The plants' ovaries are usually well protected from the biting mouthparts of their pollinators. The beetle families that habitually pollinate flowers are the Buprestidae, Cantharidae, Carambycidae, Cleridae, Dermestidae, Lycidae, Melyridae, Mordellidae, Nitidulidae and Scarabeidae. Beetles may be particularly important {{in some parts of}} the world such as semiarid areas of southern Africa and southern California and the montane grasslands of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When {{red clover}} was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury Acclimatization Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Losses had {{remained}} stable since the 1990s at 17â€“20% per year attributable {{to a variety}} of factors, such as mites, diseases, and management stress. The first report of CCD was in mid-November 2006 by a Pennsylvania beekeeper overwintering in Florida. By February 2007, large commercial migratory beekeepers wintering in California, Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas had reported heavy losses associated with CCD. Their reports of losses varied widely, ranging from 30% to 90% of their bee colonies; in some cases, beekeepers reported losses of nearly all of their colonies with surviving colonies so weakened that they might no longer be able <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> or produce honey.|$|E
50|$|Fruit is a syconium {{and trees}} may be either female or hermaphrodite. Hermaphrodite trees are {{functionally}} male. The tree is known <b>to</b> <b>pollinated</b> by the wasp Kradibia gestroi, where the female lays eggs in female trees with only short-styles. Besides sexual reproduction, the tree may grow with vegetative means propagated by seed and cuttings.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} presumed <b>to</b> be <b>pollinated</b> by either birds or bees.|$|R
50|$|The {{flowers are}} thought <b>to</b> be <b>pollinated</b> by native bees and flies.|$|R
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is particularly important}} for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion. In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion. Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> their crop. Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are {{important}} pollinators of both crops and wildflowers. Because bumblebees do not overwinter the entire colony, {{they do not}} stockpile honey, and therefore are not useful as honey producers. Bumblebees are increasingly cultured for agricultural use as pollinators, among other reasons because they can pollinate plants such as tomato in greenhouses by buzz pollination whereas other pollinators cannot. Commercial production began in 1987, when Roland De Jonghe founded the Biobest company; in 1988 they produced enough nests <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> 40 hectares of tomatoes. The industry grew quickly, starting with other companies in the Netherlands. Bumblebee nests, mainly of buff-tailed bumblebees, are produced in at least 30 factories around the world; over a million nests are grown annually in Europe; Turkey is a major producer.|$|E
5|$|In {{regions of}} the Old World where they are indigenous, honeybees (Apis mellifera) {{are among the most}} {{important}} pollinators, vital to sustain natural habitats there in addition to their value for human societies (to sustain food resources). Where honeybee populations decline, there is also a decline in plant populations. In agriculture, some plants are completely dependent on honeybees <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> them to produce fruit, while other plants are only dependent on honeybees to enhance their capacity to produce better and healthier fruits. Honeybees also help plants to reduce time between flowering and fruit set, which reduces risk from harmful factors such as pests, diseases, chemicals, weather, etc. Specialist plants that require honeybees will be at more risk if honeybees decline, whereas generalist plants that use other animals as pollinators (or wind pollinating or self-pollinating) will suffer less because they have other sources of pollination.|$|E
50|$|Many {{species are}} found in alpine or sub-alpine meadows where snow is common. Flowers usually are borne terminally, are zygomorphic, and have a lower petal shaped like a lip. The most common flower colours are purple, blue-white, and violet. Some species have yellow {{markings}} on the lower petal {{to act as a}} guide <b>to</b> <b>pollinating</b> insects.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Rhizanthella gardneri is {{the only}} orchid known <b>to</b> be <b>pollinated</b> by termites.|$|R
50|$|Tailed spider orchid {{is thought}} <b>to</b> be <b>pollinated</b> by the thynnid wasp, Lophocheilus villosus.|$|R
25|$|The {{plants are}} {{sensitive}} to frost. For flowering, Capsicum is a non-photoperiod-sensitive crop. The flowers can self-pollinate. However, at extremely high temperature, , pollen loses viability, and flowers are much less likely <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> successfully.|$|E
25|$|The Frankston Spider Orchid (Caladenia robinsonii) is a {{rare species}} of orchid that is endemic to the Frankston area. It {{produces}} a 4cm red and creamy-yellow flower, with five sepals, that exudes a scent which mimics the pheromones of the Thynnid wasp female {{in order to attract}} males <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> it. It is a threatened species.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the plants}} require a male plant <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> a female plant for the female plant to produce fruit (dioecious). For a good yield of fruit, one male vine for every three to eight female vines is required. Other {{varieties}} can self pollinate, but they produce a greater and more reliable yield when pollinated by male kiwifruit vines.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> the <b>pollinating</b> wasp species, {{most of the}} Ficus species also host nonpollinating wasp species (Kjellberg et al. [2005]). These wasps oviposit {{from the}} outside of the figs. The number of nonpollinating wasps (NPFW) species varies greatly between Ficus species (KerdelhuÃ© et al. [2000]). Their feeding regimes also vary: Some NPFW species gall the ovules similarly <b>to</b> the <b>pollinating</b> species, and some are parasitoids (Compton and van Noort [1992]).|$|R
50|$|Scilloideae {{reproduce}} both sexually and asexually. The showy {{flowers of}} {{many species of}} the subfamily are pollinated by {{a wide range of}} insects including bees, wasps, flies and moths, as well as birds. Both nectar and pollen act as incentives <b>to</b> <b>pollinating</b> species. Vegetative reproduction may be by bulbils or by seeds through apomixis. The dispersal of seeds may occur by water, wind, or by ants attracted by elaiosomes.|$|R
50|$|A 1980 {{field study}} at Cheyne Beach showed it <b>to</b> be <b>pollinated</b> by the New Holland honeyeater and white-cheeked honeyeater.|$|R
25|$|Sarracenia do not self-pollinate and {{therefore}} require hand pollination or access to natural pollinators such as bees. Sarracenia pollen remains potent {{for several weeks}} when refrigerated, and so is stored by cultivators and used <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> later-flowering species. Given that all Sarracenia hybrids are fertile and will hybridize further, this characteristic allows cultivators to produce a limitless number of variants through hybridization.|$|E
25|$|In {{agriculture}} and horticulture pollination management, a good pollenizer is {{a plant that}} provides compatible, viable and plentiful pollen and blooms {{at the same time}} as the plant that is to be pollinated or has pollen that can be stored and used when needed <b>to</b> <b>pollinate</b> the desired flowers. Hybridization is effective pollination between flowers of different species, or between different breeding lines or populations. see also Heterosis.|$|E
25|$|Kiwifruit is {{notoriously}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>pollinate,</b> because {{the flowers are}} not very attractive to bees. Some producers blow collected pollen over the female flowers. Generally, the most successful approach, though, is saturation pollination, where the bee populations are made so large (by placing hives in the orchards at a concentration of about 8 hives per hectare) that bees are forced to use this flower because of intense competition for all flowers within flight distance. This is also increased by using varieties specifically developed for pollination.|$|E
50|$|Each flower {{eventually}} {{produces a}} large quantity of small seeds. Their scent is strongest at night, <b>to</b> attract <b>pollinating</b> moths.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the whole}} Iridaceae family, {{the members of}} the {{subfamily}} have the typical sword-shaped leaves. The rootstock is usually a corm. The blooms which sometimes have scent are collected in inflorescence and contain six tepals. The nectar is produced mostly in the base of the bloom from the glands of the ovary, which is where the flower forms a tube-like end. In some species there is no such end and the plant only provides pollen <b>to</b> <b>pollinating</b> insects.|$|R
50|$|Downingia yina is a distinctive, {{colorful}} wildflower {{known by}} the common name cascade calicoflower. It bears small, easily recognizable flowers up to 1 centimeter in width. Each flower has three fused lower petals which are blue or violet with a central spot which is white with a yellow center. This pattern is attractive <b>to</b> <b>pollinating</b> insects and helps them navigate to the flower's center. The two upper blue petals may fold together to face each other, or stick straight out.|$|R
