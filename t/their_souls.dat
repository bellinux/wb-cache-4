5|$|The first {{church on}} {{this site was}} built in Saxon times, as the Port of Bristol first began. In medieval times, St. Mary Redcliffe, sitting on a red cliff above the River Avon, was a sign to seafarers, who would pray in it at their departure, and give thanks there upon their return. The church was built and beautified by Bristol's wealthy merchants, who paid to have masses sung for <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> and {{many of whom are}} commemorated there.|$|E
5|$|After Applewhite's release, he {{traveled}} to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers {{that they would be}} visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of <b>their</b> <b>souls,</b> which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian eschatology, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.|$|E

Arikado arrives to help Soma defeat the monsters, after which Soma absorbs <b>their</b> <b>souls.</b> Celia retreats, proclaiming that she will destroy Soma. Soma expresses disbelief at the return of his powers, but Arikado reveals that his powers were never lost, only dormant. He informs Soma that Celia {{is the head of}} a cult that seeks the resurrection of the dark lord. He leaves, instructing Soma not to pursue Celia.|$|E

When former associates of Yoh {{and his friends}} begin appearing in the Great Spirit, it is revealed that the Great Spirit granted Hao's wish for someone to bring back his mother's spirit. With Anna's help, Hao's mother is brought to the Great Spirit. Hao's mother tells him that, {{in order to be}} saved, he must forgive the humans for murdering her. Hao decides to postpone his plan to eradicate humans and to observe how Yoh and his friends will change the world.|$|E
5|$|After the CIA clears them, {{they return}} to England to attend the wedding of Baxter's eldest daughter. Rick reveals he sold Alvo's villa and signed the others' name without permission. Although the others {{initially}} resent Rick for this, the four become wealthy as a result. Two months later {{they return to}} Cape Town to visit Quinn's villa, where Baxter and Carmen reunite. Meanwhile, a wheelchair-bound Dominic tracks the four down and arrives with his gang, with all members wearing Blair masks. After initially evading the gang, Baxter accidentally kills Carmen, mistaking her for an assassin. The four drive to one of Rick's contacts at a beach, only to be surrounded and executed by the gang upon arrival. In a state of Limbo, <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> leave the beach. Baxter spots one of the assassins, who removes the Blair mask to reveal a sinister version of himself. Their car drives past an unfinished interchange, and it plunges, where the four would meet their end.|$|E

5|$|Dana discovers Em {{was killed}} by Lester Majak, an aging local celebrity. Majak was a {{physical}} trainer who was convinced his fitness regime would extend his life. When he began to notice his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an imbalance that resulted in Revival Day. The imbalance is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> as well.|$|E

A glow appears in the sky, and Zurga rushes in to report that the fishermen's camp is ablaze. As the men hurry away to save their homes, Zurga frees Leila and Nadir. He returns the necklace to Leila, and reveals {{that he is the}} man she saved when she was a child. He recognises now that his love for her is in vain, and tells her and Nadir to flee. As the couple depart, singing of the life of love that awaits them, Zurga is left alone, to await the fishermen's return ("!").|$|E
5|$|Prophet Elijah {{was also}} {{regarded}} as a protector from the ale. As soon as he spotted an ala consuming the fertility of fields, he would summon dragons and harness them to his flying chariot. They then together attacked the demon, shooting fiery arrows at her. Instead of the dragons, the prophet could summon dragon men. They would then fall asleep, and <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> would rush to the thundering clouds to assist the prophet against the ale. A legend {{in the region of}} Leskovac has it that fighting the ale was originated by Prophet Elijah, when he, accompanied by a dragon boy, killed twelve of these demons. In the popular tradition of Slavic peoples, Prophet Elijah is a Christian replacement of the pagan Slavic thunder god Perun.|$|E

5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E
5|$|The game then jumps {{five years}} forward. Nier {{and the others}} are trying to find the parts to a key that they believe will help them locate the Shadowlord and Grimoire Noir. After {{defeating}} five Shades and assembling the key, the team go to defeat the Shadowlord. There, Devola and Popola, characters who have been guiding Nier on his quest, appear to try to stop them. They explain that over 1300 years prior, humanity faced extinction due to an incurable disease. In an attempt to survive, they separated <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> from their bodies using Grimoire Noir and Weiss. They created clones resistant to the disease, Replicants, and intended to recombine the souls, or Gestalts, with the Replicant bodies once it had died out; Devola and Popola were androids set to oversee the project. Over time, the Replicants had begun to form their own identities; while the Gestalts, or Shades, had grown aggressive to them.|$|E
5|$|The group {{received}} {{an influx of}} funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to {{their faith in the}} narrative that he constructed.|$|E

5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Soul Reaver is the vampire-turned-wraith Raziel, whom Kain casts to {{death at the}} {{beginning}} of the game. Although Kain is the protagonist of the previous game, , he is the primary antagonist and final boss of Soul Reaver. The Elder God resurrects and assists Raziel, explains the game's controls, and describes previous events in the story. Ariel, who preceded Kain as the guardian of the Pillar of Balance, appears as a spirit and offers Raziel advice on occasion. During his quest, Raziel meets his brothers—Melchiah, Zephon, Rahab and Dumah—who serve as the game's bosses. Each has developed different powers that Raziel partially gains by killing them and devouring <b>their</b> <b>souls.</b> A fifth brother, Turel, was omitted due to time constraints on development.|$|E
5|$|Drakengard 2 {{takes place}} in an unnamed land nearly two decades after the events of Drakengard: {{originally}} said to take place after the game's first ending, it was later retconned so it took place in an isolated timeline following events similar to Drakengard. In the original game, two powers, the Empire and the Union, {{were engaged in a}} religious war over the Seals, magical bindings tied to a chosen Goddess of the Seal that kept dark entities known as the Watchers from appearing in the mortal world and destroying humanity. Caught up in the conflict were Caim and Angelus, a human and a dragon who had made a pact (a magical ritual that linked <b>their</b> <b>souls),</b> and fought to try to keep both the Seals and the Goddess safe. Though they ultimately failed, Angelus became the new seal, averting the end of the world. Eighteen years later, the Seals are protected by the Knights of the Seal, who eventually grow to become a dominating force in the land.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{later in the}} game that the true villain is Ganon, King of Darkness. He has stolen a powerful trident {{and used it to}} take control of parts of Hyrule. He then stole the dark mirror and used it to create Shadow Link and then sent him to kidnap the shrine maidens and trick Link into releasing Vaati. In order to gain as much power as possible and build up his army, Ganon wants {{to take control of the}} shrine maidens' power as well as abducting people and sending them into the Dark World where they would become part of his army. Vaati unknowingly furthered his plans by creating monsters to add to his army. It {{is revealed}} that the Knights of Hyrule were murdered by Ganon and <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> were trapped in the World of Darkness where they became creatures of Darkness. The four Links eventually save the shrine maidens, retrieve the Dark Mirror, destroy Shadow Link and Vaati, and face Ganon in a final battle. Trying to stop him from plunging the world into chaos, the four Links use the Power of the Maidens of Shrines, Including Zelda, to defeat Ganon, penetrating him.|$|E

5|$|Soul Reaver {{takes place}} within the fictional world of Nosgoth, where {{the health of the}} land is tied to the nine Pillars of Nosgoth, and each pillar in turn is {{represented}} by a guardian. Before the events of Soul Reaver, the guardians became corrupt, and, after Kain killed eight of them, he discovered he was the final one. Refusing to sacrifice himself to restore the Pillars, he doomed Nosgoth to eternal decay and proceeded to raise his vampire lieutenants, including Raziel, to besiege the land. By the time of Soul Reavers introduction, the vampires are now the land's dominant species and apex predators, the humans have been decimated, and the vampire tribes have each claimed a region of Nosgoth and turned their attention to internal matters. Unknown to the vampires, beneath Nosgoth lurks The Elder God, an ancient and powerful entity. The Elder God controls the Wheel of Fate, a cycle of reincarnation of souls that circle the Wheel in a loop of predestination; however, because vampires are immortal, <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> do not spin with the Wheel, causing the land to decay as the Wheel stalls. By the time that Raziel is revived centuries after the game's opening cinematic, Nosgoth is on the brink of collapse, little more than a wasteland wracked with cataclysms and earthquakes.|$|E
5|$|The party {{continues}} {{to travel to}} the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> into robots. The group discovers a device that contains the alien, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who is revealed to have been helping Giygas all along. After defeating him in a fight, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, who pray for the children's safety. The prayers manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness — human emotions — and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence. In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.|$|E
5|$|The Drakengard games {{take place}} in a dark fantasy version of Medieval Europe called Midgard. Humans appear to be the {{predominant}} species, although races such as dragons, fairies and elves are shown to exist. The setting, mythos and landscape borrow extensively from the lore of Northern Europe. The world is overseen by a group of unnamed gods who have yet to make a personal appearance. The gods are served by beings known as the Watchers, entities created to destroy humanity because they are considered a failure. The Watchers are kept from entering the world with the seals, which act to keep the world in balance: should the seals be destroyed, the Watchers would enter the world and destroy humanity. At the core of the seals is the Goddess of the Seal, a mortal virgin female chosen and branded with the final seal: if all the seals are destroyed, all that stands between the Watchers and the world is the death of the Goddess herself. A core element of the Drakengard universe is the ability for humans and beasts to form a Pact, a magical bond which links <b>their</b> <b>souls</b> and grants the human partner great power at the cost of some physical ability or personal trait (their voice, singing abilities, etc.). Pacts are normally entered into by beasts so they can feed off negative emotions, but sometimes they will enter a pact for other reasons. A recurring element across the series is the representation of magic using the Celestial Alphabet, with a common letter arrangement representing the human gene.|$|E
