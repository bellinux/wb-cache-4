5|$|Kagame {{began his}} primary {{education}} in a school near <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camp,</b> where he and other Rwandan refugees learned English and began to integrate into Ugandan culture. At the age of nine {{he moved to the}} respected Rwengoro Primary School, around 16 kilometres (10 mi) away, graduating with the best grades in the district. He subsequently attended Ntare School, one of the best schools in Uganda. It is also the alma mater of future Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni. The death of Kagame's father in the early 1970s, and the departure of Rwigyema to an unknown location, led to a decline in his academic performance and an increased tendency to fight those who belittled the Rwandan population. He was eventually suspended from Ntare and completed his studies without distinction at Old Kampala Secondary School.|$|E

Dina Matar, then 14, from <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camp</b> of Dheisheh, recalls that one was told to watch the street, and then join in stone-throwing. At the same time, leaflets did circulate asserting that every child 'must carry the stone and throw it at the occupier'. School children in the Jenin Refugee Camp created a game where Jews used guns and Palestinians threw stones, with the latter always winning.|$|E

Eventually the rebel LTTE ordered the authorities to close <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camp</b> and ordered all the civilians {{to move into the}} nearby jungles. Most refuges thus left the University and became dispersed throughout the surrounding jungle. Many were caught up in the aerial attacks by the Sri Lankan Air force on purported rebel targets. Surviving refugees from the jungles eventually trickled back into their villages.|$|E

Seel was still in Poland on 8 May 1945 when the Armistice was declared. In Odessa, as he {{was put in charge}} of order in <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camp</b> he was in, he contracted malaria. At this time he was also advised to change his name to Celle and hide {{the fact that he was}} Alsatian by saying he was from Belfort.|$|E

Shinnok then enters the Jinsei and corrupts it, transforming himself into a powerful demon in the process.|$|E
25|$|The Polisario Front {{is led by}} a Secretary General. The first Secretary General was Brahim Gali, {{replaced}} in 1974 by El-Ouali at the II Congress of the Polisario Front, followed by Mahfoud Ali Beiba as Interim Secretary General upon his death. In 1976, Mohamed Abdelaziz was elected at the III Congress of the Polisario, and has held the post ever since. The Secretary General is elected by the General Popular Congress (GPC), regularly convened every four years. The GPC is composed of delegates from the Popular Congresses of the refugee camps in Tindouf, which are held biannually in each camp, and of delegates from the women's organization (UNMS), youth organization (UJSARIO), workers' organization (UGTSARIO) and military delegates from the SPLA (see below). All residents of the camps have {{a vote in the}} Popular Congresses, and participate in the administrative work in the camp through base-level 11-person cells, which form the smallest unit of <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camp</b> political structure. These typically care for distribution of food, water and schooling in their area, joining in higher-level organs (encompassing several camp quarters) to cooperate and establish distribution chains. There is no formal membership of Polisario; instead, anyone who participates in its work or lives in the refugee camps is considered a member.|$|E

500|$|For Alter {{and other}} critics, the {{structural}} support and {{impetus for the}} contemporary references rests upon the visual nature of the film's exposition, occurring {{in the form of}} imagery as opposed to conventional dialogue.

[...] Other popular images appear, such as a sign over <b>the</b> <b>refugee</b> <b>camp</b> reading [...] "Homeland Security".
