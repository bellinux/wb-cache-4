40|$|A Health Management Information System (HMIS) is {{important}} for a country’s capacity to Monitor health, and for evaluating and improving the delivery of health-care services and programs. Many developing countries struggle with data quality problems in their HMIS systems resulting in incomplete, inaccurate and untimely information. As a result, the systems do not provide a good basis for knowledge-based decisionmaking on health. The newly developed DHIS 2 quality tool is a contribution to a practical approach for improvement of HMIS data quality. By using the quality tool, potential errors in the data are identified. This knowledge {{can be used to}} take appropriate action for improving data quality. In many cases, this will be to either edit the data or to improve the data collection system. Implementing modern statistical methods and technology, like the DHIS 2 quality tool, are important factors in achieving good quality in data/statistics. This is a manual for basic use of the DHIS 2 quality tool. The manual is aimed at explaining the possibilities of the quality tool, but also to be an input to capacity building and workshops. The data quality tool does not only display potential data errors, but also contributes to improved understanding of the data quality. The manual is a meant as a practical guide to use the DHIS 2 quality tool. Actual screenshots from DHIS 2 and a realistic test data set are used to explain and visualize (which is available on the DHIS 2 <b>training</b> <b>server).</b> The DHIS 2 Data Quality Tool requires an initial configuration for much of the functionality, and this initial setup {{is the best way to}} get started...|$|E
40|$|In a 1996 CQ article, Lynn {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} restaurant managers could increase their servers’ tips, and thereby reduce turnover, by <b>training</b> the <b>servers</b> to engage {{in one or more}} of seven tip enhancing behaviors. Since then, the list of tip enhancing behaviors has expanded and a manual was produced to help managers <b>train</b> their <b>servers</b> in the use of these techniques. However, empirical support for the effectiveness of these behaviors rests on only a few studies that typically involve only one or two servers at a single restaurant. More research is needed to see if these small scale demonstrations generalize to a larger, more heterogeneous sample of servers and restaurants. This study addresses that need with an internet survey of over a thousand restaurant servers from across the United States. Results indicate that servers who engage in the behaviors more frequently report larger tips relative those of co-workers. These findings support the effectiveness of the behaviors at increasing tips for a variety of different servers working at many different restaurants. Thus, restaurant managers are encouraged to <b>train</b> their <b>servers</b> to engage in these behaviors...|$|R

The blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) of the pseudopatrons was measured after they left the bar.

40|$|The {{field of}} alcohol <b>server</b> {{awareness}} and <b>training</b> has grown {{dramatically in the}} past several years and the idea of <b>training</b> <b>servers</b> to reduce alcohol problems has become a central fixture in the current alcohol policy debate. The San Mateo County, California Server Information Program (SIP) is a community-based prevention strategy designed to decrease alcohol problems, especially the problem of drinking and driving. The program began with a free awareness training offered to all on-sale alcohol beverage licensees in the county in 1984. Recruitment procedures were implemented the following year and operators who agreed to be trained were offered a 6 -hour training module which focused on legal and administrative concerns, alcohol problem statistics, alcohol physiology, motivation to drink, assertiveness training, signs of intoxication, pacing food and drink, prevention policy and management backup, and cutting off service. The SIP also provides funds to local police jurisdictions to mount decoy operations. Program evaluation is currently underway. Collaborative efforts such as the SIP provide an important tool to reduce the societal level of alcohol problems.

40|$|The recent rise in alcohol-impaired {{automobile}} crashes, injuries, and fatalities after a dip {{in those}} rates {{over the past few}} years reminds us how intractable this problem is. School-based education and mass media programs, intensified law enforcement, and court-ordered treatment programs have no doubt changed the normative climate regarding drinking and driving, and yet something about the phenomenon limits the effectiveness of these attempts to change individual attitudes and behavior. Recognizing that people’s ability to alter their habits depends greatly on situational influences, prevention specialists have turned their attention to reducing the risk of alcohol-impaired driving through modification of the drinking environment itself. Alter-ing those contexts can, in conjunction with the educational approaches, reduce risk to a far greater degree than would either strategy alone.
