5000|$|At {{the urging}} of the {{downtown}} business community, Spokane Transit built a transit center in 1995 to replace the historic Howard and Riverside hub which required that buses park along many downtown streets for passengers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>transfers.</b> Not only was this uncomfortable for passengers, who were forced to wait for buses in the weather, but it also made the streetside businesses less accessible to customers. The bus center, known as [...] "The Plaza" [...] was constructed as an indoor urban park {{at a cost of}} approximately $20 million including property acquisition costs. With its high, daylight ceiling, imported Italian tile, and cougar statues leaping over a waterfall between the up- and down- escalators, it generated great controversy.|$|E

A rather ingeniously placed, at grade, inbound to {{outbound}} turning loop was built in the Cleveland Circle-Reservoir yard.

This routing has not always been utilized during disruptions; a bus shuttle from Reservoir to Kenmore or Fenway has been used on several occasions.|$|E
