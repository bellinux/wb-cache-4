5|$|The {{content of}} water or other solvent {{molecules}} changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into micelles or vesicles. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.|$|E

25|$|The ball can bounce at {{different}} distances from the batsman, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> {{length of the}} delivery. It can range from a bouncer (often bouncing {{as high as the}} batsman's head) to a yorker (landing at his feet).|$|E
50|$|From 1991 {{to early}} 1995 Mercedes offered a limited {{production}} sport {{version of the}} W124 sedan, created and assembled with help from Porsche. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> 500 E (E 500 after 1993).|$|R
