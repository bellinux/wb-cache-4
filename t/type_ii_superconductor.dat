Indeed, it was well known since Abrikosov [1] that above Hc 1 the magnetic field penetrates under the form a vortex, made of a filament of radius ξ (the coherence length) surrounded by supercurrent screening the external field running over a radius λ (the penetration length). Because of the repulsion between vortices due to supercurrents (see Fig. 1), the naive idea is that vortex will form a perfect triangular crystal (the Abrikosov lattice). This {{has led to the}} phase diagram shown in Fig. 1, that has been the cornerstone of our understanding of all <b>type</b> <b>II</b> <b>superconductors</b> {{for more than three decades}} [2, 3].

Independently of this, from 1991 to 1993 Ning Li and Douglas Torr {{published a}} number of articles about gravitational effects in superconductors. One finding they derived is the source of gravitomagnetic flux in a <b>type</b> <b>II</b> <b>superconductor</b> material is due to spin alignment of the lattice ions. Quoting from their third paper: [...] "It is shown that the coherent alignment of lattice ion spins will generate a detectable gravitomagnetic field, and {{in the presence of a}} time-dependent applied magnetic vector potential field, a detectable gravitoelectric field." [...] The claimed size of the generated force has been disputed by some but defended by others. In 1997 Li published a paper attempting to replicate Podkletnov's results and showed the effect was very small, if it existed at all. Li is reported to have left the University of Alabama in 1999 to found the company AC Gravity LLC. AC Gravity was awarded a U.S. DOD grant for $448,970 in 2001 to continue anti-gravity research.
