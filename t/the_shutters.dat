5|$|The altarpiece was {{commissioned}} in 1443 for the Hospices de Beaune by Nicolas Rolin, Chancellor of the Duchy of Burgundy, {{and his wife}} Guigone de Salins, who is buried {{in front of the}} altarpiece's original location in the hospice. It is one of van der Weyden's most ambitious works, equal to his Prado Deposition and lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald. It remains in the hospice today, although not in its original position. It is in poor condition and was moved in the 20th century to shield it from sunlight and better protect it from the almost 300,000 visitors it receives annually. It has suffered from extensive paint loss, the wearing and darkening of its colours, and an accumulation of dirt. In addition, a heavy layer of over-paint was applied during restoration. The two painted sides of the outer panels have been separated so both can be shown simultaneously; traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> would have been opened only on selected Sundays or church holidays.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} {{walls of the}} throne hall are painted with a lotus bud design arranged in a geometric pattern. Within the lotus buds are seated praying deities, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal shape section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This reinforces the impression {{of being in a}} heavenly abode. The interior panel of the door and window shutters depicted standing deities facing each other holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allow further spaces between <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> and the wall to be decorated, these are decorated with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.|$|E
5|$|The work clearly {{distinguishes between}} {{figures of the}} divine, earthly and hellish realms. Perhaps {{following}} Jan van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece, the polyptych wings form an inverted T-shape. When <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> are closed the panels resemble an upside-down cross, a form common in 15th-century carved retables: an elevated central panel allowed additional space for a narrative scene, to depict a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels, an innovation seen in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. This shape echoes typical configuration of Gothic churches, where the naves often extended past the aisles into the apse or choir. The imagery of the outer panels {{is set in the}} earthly realm with the donors, and saints painted in grisaille to imitate sculpture.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} Soviet-era rangefinders, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed {{selector}} rotates when <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is released, {{and should not}} be changed until after <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> has been cocked. If <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed is changed without cocking <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> first, <b>the</b> setting pin can be broken when the film is advanced.|$|R
50|$|The 5/A2/A2e has two dials {{to control}} exposure, one over <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> button {{and one on}} the back of the camera. The dial above <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> button will adjust <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed in shutter {{priority}} Tv/Time value mode, but in aperture priority Av/Aperture value mode this same dial will adjust the lens aperture. In full manual mode, the dial above <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> reverts to adjusting <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed, and <b>the</b> back dial controls the aperture.|$|R
50|$|When using most Zorki cameras, <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed {{should only}} be set after <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> has been cocked. Setting <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed before <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is cocked can {{permanently}} damage the camera. This especially affects all Zorki cameras with slow shutter speeds under 1/30 of a second, in particular the Zorki-3 and Zorki-4.|$|R
25|$|The 1990s saw {{continued}} {{development in}} Santa Monica. The Promenade caught on. Colorado Place, Water Garden, and other nearby office developments {{on the east}} side of town attracted MGM, Sony, Symantec, and other corporations. <b>The</b> <b>Shutters</b> Hotel was the first of several new hotels built between the pier and Pico Boulevard. One of them, the Loews, is on the site of the long forgotten Arcadia Hotel. The Casa Del Mar returned to its former glory as a luxury hotel in 1999 after a reported $60 million renovation by the owners of <b>the</b> <b>Shutters</b> Hotel. Even the comparatively dowdy Miramar Hotel found new prominence with the many visits of President Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|Patent Sails, {{invented in}} 1819 by William Cubitt, combine <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> of the Spring Sail with the {{automatic}} adjustment of the Roller Reefing Sail. Single Patents have shutters on the trailing {{side of the}} sail, Double Patents have shutters {{on both sides of}} the sail for its whole length.|$|E
25|$|In 1844 or 1845, {{after her}} return to the Cutts–Madison House, arsonists put lit matches into <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> {{in the rear of}} the house, and Dolley Madison had to be wakened and saved from death by a servant. The fire was quickly put out, and the damage to the {{building}} not extensive (Mrs. Madison returned to her bedroom the same night).|$|E
50|$|A {{strap hinge}} with a zero offset and an angle pintle matched to the {{thickness}} of <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> will serve in every case. <b>The</b> <b>shutter</b> {{is removed from the}} face of the casing by {{the thickness of}} <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> plus <b>the</b> diameter of the pintle pin. That leaves <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> with a little breathing room and clears the corner of the casing - it's a nice angle between <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and house. <b>The</b> question of security - lifting <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> and hinges from their pintles is resolved by installing the top pintle in the inverted position.|$|R

25|$|The altarpiece {{consists}} of five paintings– a central inner panel and two double-sided wings. Those {{on the reverse}} of wings are visible when <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> are closed, and show the hospital donors flanked by their patron saints. The interior has a central panel with the enthroned Virgin and Child flanked by saints; the left wing features episodes {{from the life of}} John the Baptist with emphasis on his beheading; the right wing shows the apocalypse as recorded by John the Evangelist, pictured writing on the island of Patmos.|$|E
25|$|They have {{plunged into}} their {{dangerous}} experiment {{without regard for}} the consequences... I understand that the 'rebels' {{want to go on}} holding races by police permit and under police protection; and when this is withdrawn they are apparently content to put up <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> and go out of business as promoters.... If we voluntarily place road-racing under police control, we sign its death warrant.... If we are to race on the road, for heaven's sake let us do it as free citizens, and not by permission of the police.|$|E
25|$|Externally, the FA-1/FB-1 {{could be}} {{distinguished}} from the FA-2/FB-2 (FPA-2/FPB-2) by {{the position of the}} radiator shutters – the FA-1/FB-1's shutters were {{at the far end of}} the carbody, whereas on the FA-2/FB-2 they were further forward, the design having been modified to allow the installation of a steam generator behind the radiator. The FPA-4/FPB-4 were visually different due to the additional radiator space that was positioned below <b>the</b> <b>shutters.</b> These Canadian variants were intended and used for high-speed passenger service, and remained in use into the 1990s on Via Rail Canada.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> sticky <b>shutter</b> problem {{relates to}} a rubber washer which is {{involved}} in the operation of <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> With age and atmospheric conditions, it tends to deteriorate and become sticky, so that it impedes the operation of <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> Frequent use can delay the stickiness from 'glueing up' <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> but once started, the only long-term remedy is to have <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> repaired, when <b>the</b> rubber washer is replaced, and so another 10 years or more can be enjoyed with the camera working correctly. A good short term solution is to lightly clean <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> diaphragm with a cotton ball and lighter fluid.|$|R

25|$|Higher wind {{pressures}} {{increased the}} speaking volume of theatre organ pipes, {{and they were}} placed in chambers, usually high in the auditorium. The fronts of these chambers were covered {{with a set of}} swell shades which opened and closed like venetian blinds. When closed, the sound of the organ was reduced to a whisper. With a foot pedal, the organist could gradually open <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> to produce louder and louder sounds from the same pipes. Although this type of swell chamber was not new, theatre organ developments permitted a much broader dynamic range than ever before.|$|E
25|$|Completed {{at a cost}} of £7.5 million, {{the theatre}} opened as the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in January 2014. Designed by Jon Greenfield, in {{collaboration}} with Allies and Morrison, it is an oak structure built inside the building's brick shell. The thrust stage is surmounted by a musicians' gallery, and the theatre has an ornately painted ceiling. The seating capacity is 340, with benches in a pit and two horse-shoe galleries, placing the audience close to the actors. Shutters around the first gallery admit artificial daylight. When <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> are closed, lighting is provided by beeswax candles mounted in sconces, as well as on six height-adjustable chandeliers and even held by the actors.|$|E
25|$|The altarpiece {{measures}} 375 x 260cm when <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> are closed. The upper panels contain lunettes showing prophets and Sibyls {{looking down}} on the annunciation; the lower tier shows the donors on the far left and right panels flanked by saints. The exterior panels are executed with relative sparseness in comparison to the often fantastical colour and abundance of the interior scenes. Their settings are earthly, pared down and relatively simple. Yet there is the same striking use of illusionism which also characterises the inner panels; {{this is especially true of}} the faux stone grisaille statues of the saints. Lighting is used to great effect to create the impression of depth; van Eyck handles the fall of light and casting of shadow to make the viewer feel as if the pictorial space is influenced or lit by light entering from the chapel in which he stands.|$|E
40|$|A thermal-powered reciprocating-force motor {{includes}} a shutter switchable between a first position that passes solar energy {{and a second}} position that blocks solar energy. A shape memory alloy (SMA) actuator is coupled to <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> to control switching thereof between <b>the</b> <b>shutter's</b> first and second position. The actuator is positioned with respect to <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> such that (1) solar energy impinges on the SMA when <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is in its first position so that the SMA experiences contraction in length until <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is switched to its second position, and (2) solar energy is impeded from impingement on the SMA when <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is in its second position so that the SMA experiences extension in length. Elastic members coupled to the actuator apply a force to the SMA that aids in its extension in length until <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is switched to its first position...|$|R
50|$|AI Servo AF {{was used}} for moving objects. The lens would {{continuously}} refocus on the object in {{the centre of the}} viewfinder whilst <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> release button was pressed half-way. Once <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> release button was fully pressed, the exposure was calculated then <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> released.|$|R
50|$|Lenses are {{fitted to}} a lens board by placing <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> {{assembly}} through <b>the</b> {{front of the}} board and securing <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> assembly by threading a locknut to rear of <b>the</b> <b>shutter.</b> A front lens element will thread onto <b>the</b> mounted <b>shutter</b> and if necessary, a second lens element will thread onto the rear of <b>the</b> mounted <b>shutter.</b> This procedure can be accomplished by a camera technician, or by an end-user with the appropriate tools.|$|R
25|$|During the Battle of Germantown on October 4, 1777, the American {{first wave}} {{encountered}} 100–120 {{men of the}} British 40th Regiment of Foot shut up in the Benjamin Chew House and flowed around the obstacle. When the reserves arrived, Knox convinced Washington that the place must be captured. Two cannons of Proctor's Artillery plus two captured British 6-pounders were already firing at the building. Staff officer Timothy Pickering suggested that the guns {{be brought to bear}} {{on the front of the}} building, so this was done. The front doors were quickly blown open and <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> splintered but unknown to the gunners the front of the house was constructed of stone two feet thick, impervious to light cannons. For two hours, the guns blasted the masonry with round shot or fired canister at the second story, but all American infantry attacks were repulsed with heavy losses.|$|E
25|$|It {{worked by}} wind until 11 October 1928. <b>The</b> <b>shutters</b> {{were removed from}} the sails in 1934 and stored in the mill. The mill was bought at auction in 1937 by Mr Kenney, a mill enthusiast. The fantail was blown off in the 1940s, {{damaging}} the cap. A lease on the mill was granted to East Suffolk County Council in 1950. The council aimed to preserve an example of each main type of windmill. The derelict mill was restored from 1952 by Thomas Smithdale and Sons, the Acle, Norfolk millwrights for East Suffolk County Council. The work, costing £4,000 was completed in 1954. It was part funded by the Pilgrim Trust. The wrought iron gallery round the cap was replaced with a wooden one. A new cap and fantail was built. The fantail was damaged in a gale in December 1966 and in 1973 a new stock and sail were fitted. In the late 1970s, further restoration work was carried out by Millwrights International Ltd. A new cap was craned onto the mill in 1982 and new sails were fitted in 1984.|$|E
25|$|The {{rectangular}} {{windows on}} the south, east, north wing of the east wall, the west wall, and all walls in the north wing are similar. They consist of two rectangular, facing guillotine sashed windows covered by heavy wooden shutters painted dark green and fixed with wrought iron H or H-L hinges. <b>The</b> <b>shutters</b> are not of colonial origin. The east façade had two window openings: a large rectangular one that is 9 feet wide and 8’ 2” high with 16 over 16 glass panes and a circular window above it with an inner section in quarters and an outer section in eighths. The circular window, in particular, is of uncertain authenticity as it is claimed that until restorations in 1930 it contained not the present type of window but either plastered over stone and rubble or a millstone. All of the other windows have 12 over 12 glass panes. The single south window is 7’ 2” wide and 8 feet high white the north wing has two smaller windows on its east and west walls and another on its north face. The frames for all the windows are flat with painted wood. The wooden, bottom sill projects slightly from the frame. All have brick sills with ovolo cast bricks marking them.|$|E

The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is to provide shielding when the neutron beam is not required.|$|R

25|$|Art historians {{generally}} {{agree that}} the overall structure was designed by Hubert {{in the early to}} mid 1420s, and that the panels were painted by his younger brother Jan between 1430 and 1432. One of the most renowned and important paintings in art history, generations of art historians have attempted to attribute specific passage to either brother, however no convincing separation has been established. The altarpiece was commissioned by the merchant and Ghent mayor Jodocus Vijd and his wife Lysbette {{as part of a larger}} project for the Saint Bavo Cathedral chapel. The altarpiece's installation was officially celebrated on 6 May 1432. It was much later moved for security reasons to the principal cathedral chapel, where it remains. While indebted to the International Gothic as well as Byzantine and Romanic traditions, the altarpiece represented a huge advancement in art, in which the idealisation of the medieval tradition gave way to an exacting observation of nature and human representation. A now lost inscription on the frame stated that Hubert van Eyck maior quo nemo repertus (greater than anyone) started the altarpiece, but that Jan van Eyck—calling himself arte secundus (second best in the art)—completed it in 1432. The original, very ornate carved outer frame and surround, presumably harmonizing with the painted tracery, was destroyed during the Reformation; it may have included clockwork mechanisms for moving <b>the</b> <b>shutters</b> and even playing music.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, {{the birthplace}} of the Renaissance, there is much fine work of the 16th century. A very {{important}} school of design was promoted by Raphael, whose patterns were used or adapted by a large number of craftsmen. <b>The</b> <b>shutters</b> of Raphaels Stanze in the Vatican, and the choir stalls in the church of St Pietro de Cassinesi at Perugia, are among the most beautiful examples of this style of carving. The work is in slight relief, and carved in walnut with those graceful patterns which Raphael developed out of the newly discovered remains of ancient Roman wall painting from the palace of Nero and other places. In the Victoria and Albert Museum are many examples of Italian work: the door from a convent near Parma, with its three prominent masks and heavy gadroon moulds; a picture frame with a charming acanthus border and, egg and tongue moulds on either side; and various marriage chests in walnut covered with very elaborate schemes of carving. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Spanish, or for that matter South of France work, from Italian, so much alike is the character. The Spaniards yield to none in good workmanship. Some Spanish panels of typical Italian design are in the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as cabinets of the purest Renaissance order. There is a wonderful Portuguese coffer (17th century) in this section. The top is deeply carved in little compartments with scenes from the life of Our Lord.|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat. Webber decided to hire Desplat after hearing a score he had composed for a Jacques Audiard film. Webber explained, [...] "He {{had a sense of}} restraint and a sense of lyricism that I liked. I remember the first time I saw the cue where Griet opens <b>the</b> <b>shutters.</b> He was really describing what the light was doing, articulating that in a musical sphere." [...] Desplat was then known primarily for scoring films in his native language.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>shutter</b> of <b>the</b> camera can be {{released}} in several ways, {{depending on the type}} of camera and complexity of the rig electronics, if used. Shutter release mechanisms include using a radio controlled servo to press <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> release button, using an infrared signal or wired connection to instruct the camera to release <b>the</b> <b>shutter,</b> or by using the camera's inbuilt intervalometer. Ideally the camera is allowed to reach its final altitude before <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> is released to avoid taking photos during launch.|$|R
50|$|The cameras however, {{still have}} a number of quirks that no simple {{servicing}} will remove. The most notable quirk is that <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed on some of the original Kiev 88 cameras should only be changed after cocking <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> (spring-loading <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> mechanism and advancing the film). Changing <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed on an un-cocked camera will damage the timing mechanism, so it is recommended that Kiev users get into the habit of always cocking <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> after taking a photo. This is not a problem with the Kiev 60 and Kiev 88CM variants. There are also mixed reports that <b>the</b> <b>shutter</b> speed dial should be turned only clock-wise, never anti-clock-wise. This is certainly known to be an issue with cameras modified by Hartblei to add a mirror lock-up (MLU) feature. Other cameras {{may or may not have}} this problem.|$|R
