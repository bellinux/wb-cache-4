5|$|However, the {{presence}} of a post-Constantinian editor, as originally postulated by Theodore Mommsen, still has notable support, most recently articulated by Daniel Den Hengst, who suggests that the editor was the author of {{the second half of the}} History, operating under the pseudonyms of Pollio and Vopiscus. Further, that this editor not only wrote the secondary lives in the first half, but he was also responsible for the insertions into the primary lives in that series.

5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was followed closely by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{elements}} of the novel that the author found most poignant was that of class division and how there is a subset of people who have access to a world of power and wealth <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> majority will never experience, of which Gibson cited Brown and his evidently routine use of a private jet as an example. The author felt {{that at the time of}} writing, such social chasms were widening, and drew parallels to the Victorian era as well as to the world of his breakthrough novel Neuromancer (1984) in which there is no middle class, only the super-rich and a predominantly criminal underclass.|$|E

Non-commissioned officers of the cavalry wore either regular clothes from home or a variety of different types of uniforms. yellow was the prescribed branch of service color, but surviving uniforms show beyond a doubt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> majority of cavalrymen who used any branch of service color, used buff as yellow cloth was virtually non existent in the Confederacy.|$|E

Du Bois discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> majority of black American soldiers were relegated to menial labor as stevedores and laborers. Some units were armed, and one in particular, the 92nd Division (the Buffalo soldiers), engaged in combat. Du Bois discovered widespread racism in the Army, {{and concluded that the}} Army command discouraged African Americans from joining the Army, discredited the accomplishments of black soldiers, and promoted bigotry.|$|E

5|$|Conventional {{sequencing}} {{begins with}} a culture of identical cells {{as a source of}} DNA. However, early metagenomic studies revealed that there are probably large groups of microorganisms in many environments that cannot be cultured and thus cannot be sequenced. These early studies focused on 16S ribosomal RNA sequences which are relatively short, often conserved within a species, and generally different between species. Many 16S rRNA sequences have been found which do not belong to any known cultured species, indicating that there are numerous non-isolated organisms. These surveys of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes taken directly from the environment revealed that cultivation based methods find less than 1% of the bacterial and archaeal species in a sample. Much of the interest in metagenomics comes from these discoveries that showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> majority of microorganisms had previously gone unnoticed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to determine the exact number of properties destroyed during and after Operation Storm, since a large number of houses had already sustained damage {{since the beginning of the}} war. Human Rights Watch (HRW) estimates that more than 5,000 homes were destroyed during and after the battle. Out of the 122 Serbian Orthodox churches in the area, one was destroyed and 17 were damaged, but most of the damage to the churches occurred prior to the Serb retreat. HRW also reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> majority of the abuses during Operation Storm were committed by Croatian forces. These abuses, which continued on a large scale for months afterward, included summary executions of elderly and infirm Serbs who remained behind and the wholesale burning and destruction of Serb villages and property. In the months following Operation Storm, at least 150 Serb civilians were summarily executed and another 110 persons forcibly disappeared. One such example is the Varivode massacre, in which nine Serb civilians were killed.|$|E
5|$|Phan was {{transferred}} to the Huế court {{as a member of the}} censorate, a watchdog body that monitored the work of the mandarinate. He earned the ire of many of his colleagues, but the trust of the emperor, by revealing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> majority of the court mandarins were making a mockery of a royal edict to engage in regular rifle practice. Tự Đức later dispatched Phan on an inspection trip to northern Vietnam. His report led to the ousting of many officials who were deemed corrupt or incompetent, including the viceroy of the northern region. He rose to become the Ngu Su, or Imperial Censor, a position which allowed him to criticise other high officials and even the emperor for misconduct. Phan openly criticised Tôn Thất Thuyết, the foremost mandarin of the court, believing him to be rash and dishonest. Aside from his work in rooting out corruption, Phan also compiled a historical geography of Vietnam, which was published in 1883.|$|E

5|$|Some authors like Boog and Lewin opine {{that while}} Creveld's {{statistics}} regarding the losses of supplies are not wrong and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> distances {{were a big}} problem, {{the failure of the}} seaborne supply lines was still a deciding factor because operationally effective supplies often failed to arrive at decisive moments of the campaigns. Douglas Austin points out that the overall port capacity at Tobruk and Benghazi was actually sufficient and that the recently published Enigma intercepts show that it was the bulk losses at sea (and not unloading or getting the supplies to forward areas) that had the greater impact on Rommel's decisions {{as well as those of}} other German commanders, like Kesselring. Levine dismisses poor port capacity and lack of transport vehicles as the Afrika Korps' crucial weaknesses, citing evidences gathered on British intelligence by Hinsley and Bennett. Others point out Rommel's dependence on captured resources as compensation for the unstable supply lines and unfulfilled promises (by 1942, 85% of his transport were captured vehicles). Butler opines that the myth of Rommel's bad logistical management is the result of rumours started by Halder.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> {{majority of these}} were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for transient phenomena occurring {{at the same place}} on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same event, these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Shedden wrote a paper {{putting the}} case for the Singapore {{strategy}} as a means of defending Australia. He argued that since Australia was also an island nation, it followed that it would also be vulnerable to a naval blockade. If Australia could be defeated without an invasion, the defence of Australia had to be a naval one. Colonel John Lavarack, who had attended the Imperial Defence College class of 1928 with Shedden, disagreed. Lavarack responded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> coastline of Australia would make a naval blockade very difficult, and its considerable internal resources meant that it could resist economic pressure. When Richmond attacked the Labor Party's position in an article in British Army Quarterly in 1933, Lavarack wrote a rebuttal. In 1936, the leader of the opposition John Curtin read an article by Wynter in the House of Representatives. Wynter's outspoken criticism of the Singapore strategy led to his transfer to a junior post. Soon after the outbreak of war with Germany on 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies appointed a British officer, Lieutenant General Ernest Squires, to replace Lavarack as Chief of the General Staff. Within months, the Chief of the Air Staff was replaced with a British officer as well.|$|E
