The usage of centralized software-based controllers simplifies {{operation and management}} and enables innovation in the control plane through network programmability. Besides, a controller may be operated via third-party applications using the so-called northbound application programming interfaces (APIs). In this paper, we report our preliminary work on {{the interaction between the}} northbound interface of the open-source industry-supported OpenDaylight controller and our <b>Net</b> 2 <b>Plan</b> tool. <b>Net</b> 2 <b>Plan</b> is an open-source network planning tool that is able to execute user-made algorithms.

40|$|International audienceService {{robotics}} {{in public}} spaces with HRI constraints provide several {{challenges to the}} robot. In particular, humans may have an unpredictable behavior, may be distracted by the environment and may lack commitment to shared tasks. Such issues require novel decision-making abilities capable of ensuring joint intention and a robust execution of policies. We describe a novel method for ensuring cooperation between human and robot. First, we present a flexible and hierarchical framework based on POMDPs. Second, we introduce a set of cooperative states within the state-space of the POMDP. Third, for ensuring an efficient scalability, the framework partitions the overall task into independent planning modules. Lastly, for a robust execution of the POMDP policies we use Petri <b>Net</b> <b>Plans,</b> which have already been used to execute MDP policies. To this end, we describe how to convert a POMDP policy into an executable Petri <b>Net</b> <b>Plan.</b> We implement our approach and develop experiments on simulation and on a real robot in an escorting task where the robot guides a customer to the desired place in a public space...|$|R

40|$|Background: International network-carriers {{span the}} globe by linking {{airports}} on all five continents. At {{the core of}} those networks are hub-airports that serve as the centers for (inter-) national in- and outbound traffic flows. From a business model point of view, the major international carriers are so-called network-carriers, for their core concept is based on transfer-oriented hub-and-spoke-systems. In order to maximize revenue streams of network-carriers, changes in strategic slot allocation and strategic <b>net</b> <b>planning</b> are becoming increasingly relevant. 	The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of various elements of the management of strategic coopetition among partners within international airline alliances on the revenues obtained by individual partners. 	Methods: the problems related to the optimization of strategic slot allocation and strategic <b>net</b> <b>planning</b> {{from the point of}} view of the individual profit shared and added net contribution margins were discussed. 	Results and conclusions: Two extreme scenarios may be projected. The first one is that partners within a given alliance system may start to increase merger and acquisition activities. Thereby scale effects may be utilized. The other one is, when rivalry becomes too dominant over time, some partners may (have to) exit alliance systems. Thereby "atomic" subsystems may be on the rebound. Strategic coopetition management is aimed to keep leading international network carriers "on track" in the field of alliance management of that nature...|$|R
40|$|Summary. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{representation}} framework based on Petri Nets for describing robot and multi-robot behaviors. The Petri <b>Net</b> <b>Plan</b> (PNP) formalism allows for high level description of complex action interactions that are necessary in programming cognitive robots: non-instantaneous actions, sensing and conditional actions, action failures, concurrent actions, interrupts, action synchronization in a multi-agent context. We show how this framework is capable of describing effective plans for robotic agents which inhabit a dynamic, partially observable and unpredictable environment. The proposed framework has been implemented and successfully deployed on actual robotic teams in different application scenarios. ...|$|R
