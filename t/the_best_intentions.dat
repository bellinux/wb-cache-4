He is also slighted by Rudin when the latter comes to inform him of his mutual love with Natasha (with <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>intentions).</b> He is generally shown as a pleasant, if not very intellectual person, and is good friends with Lezhnev.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the orchestral concerts, Bache gave an annual series of solo recitals on Liszt's birthday, 22 October, between 1872 and 1887. In October 1879, Bache gave his first all-Liszt recital. At some of these recitals, the two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works were given. The two-piano version of Mazeppa was presented in October 1876, {{two months before the}} orchestral version was played at the Crystal Palace and four months before Bache presented it at his own orchestral concert. The Monthly Musical Record felt [...] "There was ... good reason in introducing [...] as a duet, with a view to familiarizing hearers with it beforehand", and the Musical Standard found that presenting the two-piano arrangement was [...] "an immense help to those who wished to form a correct judgment on it at its first orchestral performance ... as it is impossible, with even <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>intentions,</b> to estimate correctly the larger works of Liszt after only one hearing." ...|$|E

Timbaland's bhangra beats are featured at the start {{and the end of}} the song. Madonna and Timberlake's vocal range spans two octaves, from F3 to Bb5. The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work. Instead it was her question to herself: [...] "Do I understand this opinion that I've adopted or this Zeitgeist that I've allowed myself to be swept up in? Because you could have <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>intentions</b> but not have enough information and make huge mistakes." [...] Regarding the line [...] "Sometimes I feel what I need is a you intervention", Madonna explained, [...] "eah, meaning, sometimes I think you need to save me." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{writer for}} Disney.com observed, [...] "The creepiness of this song {{lies in the}} fact that the very untrustworthy Mother Gothel is {{positioning}} herself as a helpful figure to Rapunzel." [...] Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed wrote that the song, its purpose having been summarized by Curt Holman of Creative Loafing as [...] "simply to manipulate Rapunzel into staying at home," [...] "perfectly disguises Mother Gothel's true motives." [...] According to Simon Miraudo of Quickflix, Gothel craftily uses the song to guilt trip Rapunzel [...] "into staying in the tower ... frightened into imagining the horrors that lay outside her door." [...] In her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) the Art of Adapting Fairy Tales, author Conny Eisfeld observed that [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] emphasizes Gothel's [...] "status of superiority", in spite of the fact that [...] "her existence solely depend on Rapunzel." [...] Bitch identified Gothel as an abusive mother, writing, [...] "she is manipulative, dishonest, and dedicated to undermining her daughter's independence. This is shown consistently through all her appearances in the film, but comes out clearly very early indeed, with the song 'Mother Knows Best'. Critics have often identified the sequence as one of the film's darkest and edgiest moments. Acknowledging the song's [...] "extremely dark undertone", Anthony Falco of Film Class Junkies wrote, [...] "This song rues in the fact that a child is impressionable; Rapunzel believes that Mother Gothel has <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>intentions,</b> but obviously, the evil witch is using the princess for her own gains. Falco continued, [...] "The audience knows what Gothel wants with Rapunzel, but the fact that we are unable to protect the naïve princess results in further hatred for the witch." [...] Falco also concluded that Gothel's [...] "sinister reprise at the end of Tangled allows for these horrifying undertones to emerge, which makes 'Mother Knows Best' one of the most sinister villain songs in the Disney library." [...] Similarly, Elissa Smith of Paper Droids wrote that while the audience is fully aware of Gothel's evil intentions, Rapunzel is denied [...] "the outsider's point of view." [...] Glen Chapman of Den of Geek wrote that the scene [...] "strikes a balance between melodic and narrative sophistication, as well as being equal parts sweet and sinister." [...] Gothel later reprises the song [...] "in indelible fashion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cato Uticensis (95–46). His mother's {{brother was}} the {{reformer}} Livius Drusus. His father's grandfather was the famous censor, Cato the Elder (234–149). Here, Cato (also called 'the Younger') {{was a rare}} man among the aristocracy, [...] "a man of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>intentions</b> and of rare devotedness", yet Quixotic and cheerless. Although honourable, steadfast, earnest, and strongly attached [...] "to country and to its hereditary constitution" [...] he possessed little practical understanding. Cato, [...] "dull in intellect and sensuously as well as morally destitute of passion", might have made [...] "a tolerable state accountant." [...] Walking [...] "in the sinful capital as a model citizen and mirror of virtue" [...] he would 'scold' those out of line. His ancestor Cato the Elder worked as a farmer, his anger had made him an orator; wielder of plough and sword, in politics [...] "his narrow, but original and sound common sense ordinarily {{hit the nail on}} the head." [...] The younger Cato, however, inspired by the example of his great-grandfather, made a [...] "strange caricature" [...] of him. Formal and philosophical, a follower of the Stoa, the younger Cato would speak in [...] "scholastic wisdom" [...] and appeared as [...] "this cloud-walker in the realm of abstract morals." [...] Yet like his ancestor, he began [...] "to travel on foot instead of riding, to take no interest, to decline badges of distinction as a soldier", and like the legendary king Romulus to appear shirtless. In [...] "an utterly wretched and cowardly age his courage and his negative virtues told powerfully with the multitude." [...] As [...] "the only conservative of note who possessed if not talent and insight, at any rate integrity and courage... he soon became the champion of the Optimate party." [...] He never missed a senate meeting, and [...] "as long as he lived he checked the details of the public budget." [...] Yet unfortunately in politics he simply lacked common sense. Cato's tactics seemed to consist of nothing more than [...] "setting his face against every one who deviated" [...] from the traditional catechism of the aristocracy, which of course worked as much against the Optimates as for them. By his character and his actions this [...] "Don Quixote of the aristocracy" [...] proved the exhaustion of senate politics.|$|E
