5|$|In {{the next}} episode, Mahone and Michael {{are the only}} ones left on the team. Linc and Sara are captured, and Self is in the hospital. Mahone and Michael decide it is <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the Company down and save everyone; they decide to go after Lincoln first. They set up a trap for Christina, but the police arrive; one of Christina's guards is killed in an {{explosion}} set up by Michael and meant for Christina. Later Michael gives Scylla to Mahone without the hard drive and has him save Lincoln, while Michael goes after Sara. Mahone has a bomb in Scylla which is large enough to kill Christina and her man, Downey. Christina has Mahone put in the same room Lincoln is in, moving Lincoln {{to the other side of}} the room. When the bomb fails to detonate and Christina realizes there is something wrong with Scylla, she calls on Mahone to check the device and threatens to kill him if he cannot activate it. He sets it manually. After a struggle with Christina and Downey, Mahone runs to the room where Lincoln is; the bomb detonates, killing Downey, but Christina survives. Michael and Sara come to pick up Lincoln and Mahone and head to another location, where Scylla's hard drive is. The remaining team then heads to a hospital for supplies to treat Lincoln's gunshot wound. Sara and Mahone go into the hospital, and Mahone is arrested by Federal agents. He is later freed and exonerated when Michael delivers Scylla to Kellerman. In the series' epilogue (set four years later), Mahone, Lincoln, Sucre, Michael's child and Sara visit Michael’s grave at a beach.|$|E

The court did not allow the province any grace <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> its laws {{in line with the}} ruling, making Ontario the first jurisdiction in North America to recognize same-sex marriage. The first same-sex couple married after the decision were Michael Leshner and Michael Stark. Consequently, the city of Toronto announced that the city clerk would begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples.

25|$|Plumer {{planned to}} capture Gheluvelt Plateau in four steps at six day intervals, for <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> forward {{artillery}} and supplies, a faster tempo of operations than that envisaged by Gough before 31 July. Each {{step was to}} have even more limited geographical objectives, with infantry units attacking on narrower fronts in greater depth. The practice of attacking the first objective with two battalions and the following objectives with a battalion each was reversed, {{in view of the}} greater density of German defences the further the attack penetrated; double the medium and heavy artillery was available than for on 31 July. Reorganisation in this manner had been recommended in a report of 25 August, by the Fifth Army General Officer Commanding RA (GOCRA) Major-General H. Uniacke. The evolution in organisation and method was to ensure that more infantry were on tactically advantageous ground, having had time to consolidate and regain contact with their artillery before German counter-attacks.|$|E

As much as he loves Sophia, Aubrey {{is ready to go}} to sea again. Stephen Maturin comes to call, and soon after Aubrey's orders are delivered from the port Admiral. He is given command of the 38-gun frigate HMS Boadicea. At Plymouth, he picks up orders and Mr R T Farquhar, a political gentleman. He is to sail to the station at Cape Town where the ships of a convoy will meet. Not long away from home, they meet with the French ship Hébé which is escorting a captured merchant ship. The Boadicea captures both ships. He sends the prizes to Gibraltar. The timely capture allows the ship to send letters home, gain a French cook and the Hébé's English prisoners, able seamen. The long journey in the Atlantic gives Aubrey <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the crew of the Boadicea up to his standards of efficiency in gunnery, and gives Maturin and Farquhar time to develop strategies.|$|E
25|$|The 24th Battalion defended a {{position}} near Elasson. The road out of Elasson forked into two branches {{and ran for}} three miles across a level plain. The eastern branch then climbed abruptly over a steep ridge. The western branch made a wider loop to Tyrnavos that was suitable for armoured vehicles. As a result of this, B Company was detached under command of the 25th Battalion for its defence. The other companies made positions on the east road with C Company on the right, D Company on the centre and A Company on the left on a ridge overlooking the plain of Elasson. The ridge was rocky, which meant that trenches could not be dug and the troops could only build rock walls. Three sections of the Carrier Platoon were detached on 17 April to Tyrnavos to protect a troop of 25 pdr guns. On 18 April, German tanks attacked. The remaining Bren Gun Carriers were on the plain, but were withdrawn to the rear under fire from both Australian and German batteries. After the carriers were in the rear, the east road was blown. However, the explosives had practically {{no effect on the}} road, but there was no <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> up more explosives, so the road was left in that state. At dusk, 40 German tanks and 20 troop carrying lorries came out of Elasson and advanced along the east road. They were shelled by Australian artillery, dispersing the lorries. The tanks stopped at the road crater as the battalion withdrew down the road at night to Nea Anchialos on the Gulf of Volos. The third platoon of D Company engaged the tanks without much success with a Boys anti-tank rifle in the dark. Facing German air attacks, the battalion foot marched and then motor marched to {{a position}} slightly south of Molos.|$|E
