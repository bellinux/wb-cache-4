5|$|Niche uses {{of heavy}} metals with high atomic numbers occur in {{diagnostic}} imaging, electron microscopy, and nuclear science. In diagnostic imaging, heavy metals such as cobalt or tungsten {{make up the}} anode materials found in x-ray <b>tubes.</b> <b>In</b> electron microscopy, heavy metals such as lead, gold, palladium, platinum, or uranium are used to make conductive coatings and to introduce electron density into biological specimens by staining, negative staining, or vacuum deposition. In nuclear science, nuclei of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, or zinc are sometimes fired at other heavy metal targets to produce superheavy elements; heavy metals are also employed as spallation targets {{for the production of}} neutrons or radioisotopes such as astatine (using lead, bismuth, thorium, or uranium in the latter case).|$|E

5|$|Panther {{was built}} in Britain by the Armstrong {{shipyard}} in Elswick. Her keel was laid down on 29 October 1884, and her completed hull was launched on 13 June 1885. She was completed on 31 December 1885. On 15 January 1886, the ship's first commander arrived to take the ship to Pola, which she reached on 12 February. Upon arrival, she was taken into the shipyard to have her armament installed, including her torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>in</b> 1887. After this work was completed in 1887, Panther entered service with the fleet, where she served as a flotilla leader for torpedo boats. This included a period of service with the main fleet from 6 May to 5 June in 1886.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{armed with a}} main battery of four /35 caliber guns guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The {{secondary}} battery consisted of fourteen /40 caliber Mark IV guns, which were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried sixteen 6-pounder guns mounted in casemates {{along the side of}} the hull and six 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, Wisconsin carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>in</b> deck mounted torpedo launchers.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy {{in the late}} 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight tubed vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right, rather than simply serving as a permanent centering for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta <b>tubes</b> <b>in</b> a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but required only minimal centering and formwork. The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo <b>tubes.</b> <b>In</b> 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' radar suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 radar and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 radar set was installed. The latter was a search radar for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter radar. Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox radar warning receivers. Leipzig did not receive her FuMO 24/25 radar set until 1943; this was to be the last modification for Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the virtual}} {{intelligence}} {{is kept in}} lockdown in another research station, Archers tells Shepard that he/she needs to manually override security from two other facilities {{to gain access to}} it and shut it down. Once the station where the virtual intelligence is contained has been unlocked, Shepards proceeds to the main server room. Shepard eventually accesses a terminal to cut all access to the outside world, but in the process the virus infects Shepard's cybernetic implants. Shepard awakens in a virtual reality, and heads to the central core room, where he finds that Archer had experimented on David in an attempt to control the geth. Shepard manages to defeat the virtual intelligence as it attempts to establish an upload link to the Normandy. Afterwards, David is shown in the core tied up to <b>tubes</b> <b>in</b> his arms and mouth, begging for help. Archer comes and argues for Shepard to keep the experiment going. Shepard is then given the option to either take David to a specialized academy or leave him at the station with his brother.|$|E
5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum <b>tubes</b> <b>in</b> the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E

5|$|The design main {{armament}} for the Type 1936A (Mob) class was, {{like the}} Type 1936A class {{on which it}} was based, five 15 cm (5.9in) TbtsK C/36 naval guns, with one twin turret forward and three single mounts aft. Development of the twin turret was slow however, and Z31 (like all the Type 1936A class), was completed with an additional single 15cm gun replacing the unavailable twin turret, giving {{a total of four}} 15cm guns. The forward gun was replaced by the intended twin turret in 1944, but the twin turret was replaced by a single 10.5 cm (4.1in) SK L/45 naval gun after the twin turret was wrecked in battle in January 1945. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of 2 twin 3.7 cm SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns (later replaced by automatic Flak M42 guns) and nine 20 mm cannon in one quadruple and five single mounts. A second quadruple 20mm mount was fitted forward of the ship's bridge in 1943, replacing one of the single mounts, while additional 3.7cm were fitted in 1945, giving a final anti-aircraft armament in German service of fourteen 3.7cm and twelve 20mm guns. Eight 533mm (21in) torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>in</b> two quadruple mounts were fitted, and up to 60 mines could be carried.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} ordered from Yarrow Shipbuilders at Scotstoun on 30 October 1935 under the 1935 Naval Programme. The ship was laid down on 12 February 1936 and {{launched}} on 11 February 1937 {{as the second}} Royal Navy warship to carry the name. Ivanhoe was completed on 24 August 1937 and cost £259,371 excluding items supplied by Admiralty such as guns and communications equipment. She {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning and participated in training exercises with the French Navy in December through January 1938. The ship was forced to leave these exercises prematurely as she had problems with the <b>tubes</b> <b>in</b> her superheaters. These were replaced at Malta from 15 January–19 March. Afterwards, Ivanhoe was transferred to Gibraltar where she patrolled Spanish waters enforcing the policies of the Non-Intervention Committee {{until the end of the}} war. She was in Cartagena in February–March 1939 to protect British citizens and interests as foreigners, Republican troops and their supporters evacuated the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} also armed with {{submerged}} torpedo <b>tubes</b> <b>in</b> their hulls. Derfflinger {{was equipped with}} four 50cm tubes; the later ships were armed with more powerful 60cm weapons. The tubes were arranged with one in the bow, one in the stern, and two on the broadside. Derfflingers 50cm torpedoes were the G7 type, 7.02m (276in) long and armed with a 195kg (430lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedo had a range of 4,000m (4,370yd) when set at a speed of 37knots, and up to 9,300m (10,170yd) at 27 knots. The 60cm torpedoes were the H8 type, which were 8m long and carried a 210kg (463lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedoes had a range of 6,000m (6,550yd) when set at a speed of 36knots; at a reduced speed of 30knots, the range increased significantly to 14,000m (15,310yd).|$|E
