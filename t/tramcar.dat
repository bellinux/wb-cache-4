5|$|A horse tramway {{was built}} in 1880 by Wigan Corporation and leased to a {{succession}} of private companies to operate services to Pemberton, Aspull and towards Standish. Steam tram operation was introduced quickly, but the network always struggled to pay its way and just {{after the start of}} the 20th century Wigan Corporation gradually bought the operating leases and converted the network to electric <b>tramcar</b> operation. However, the network was saddled with a mix of 'standard' gauge and 'narrow' gauge lines, reducing efficiency and increasing costs, and the last of the Wigan Corporation Tramways were closed in 1931 to be replaced by buses which had begun as 'feeder' services to the trams but which had shown themselves to be faster and more flexible. Trolleybuses were operated on a single route from Wigan to Martland Mill from 1925 to 1931.|$|E
5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A <b>tramcar</b> that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on rounding the bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it. Minor injuries were sustained by some of the passengers, though none were serious.|$|E
25|$|On 30 August 1880 a Midland Railway dray horse {{ran away}} down Low Pavement and {{collided}} with a <b>tramcar.</b> The dray horse charged between the <b>tramcar</b> and the <b>tramcar</b> horses and the <b>tramcar</b> was thrown off the line. The driver and single passenger who {{were standing on the}} front of the tram had a lucky escape.|$|E
50|$|The trailer fleet {{constructed}} {{to match the}} <b>tramcars</b> {{is made up of}} Types c3 and c4 for the E1 <b>tramcars,</b> and Type c5 for E2 <b>tramcars.</b> On the less frequented lines, <b>tramcars</b> also operate without trailers.|$|R
50|$|In 1943 a large project, never realised, was designed. This project {{planned to}} build large tunnels in {{the centre of}} Marseille. The busiest lines would join into two tunnels.In 1949 a further {{modernisation}} occurred. The first articulated <b>tramcars</b> was designed and built (Algiers tramway possessed articulated SATRAMO <b>tramcars).</b> These were created by joining two older <b>tramcars.</b> These <b>tramcars</b> remained unique until 1985 when Nantes tramway opened.|$|R
50|$|Today the Nizhny Novgorod tram network employs around 5,000 {{people and}} 387 <b>tramcars</b> across {{a network of}} {{approximately}} 198 km. In order to help the system's financial position almost all the <b>tramcars</b> carry advertising. To keep costs down, employees paint advertisements on the <b>tramcars</b> by hand.|$|R
25|$|A {{recurring}} {{problem was}} {{the inability of the}} tramcars to avoid obstructions. On 28 July 1883 a hansom cab driver, Mark Thompson, was summoned to court for obstructing the progress of a <b>tramcar.</b> He was sitting in his hansom on Albert Street waiting for a fare when the <b>tramcar</b> approached. He refused to move over to allow the <b>tramcar</b> to pass and a large crowd gathered which completely blocked the street. He was fined 10s.|$|E
25|$|After {{the closing}} of the Colwick Road and the London Road tramways, the <b>tramcar</b> fleet was reduced to 40 cars.|$|E
25|$|To {{celebrate}} the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary on 22 July a decorated and illuminated <b>tramcar</b> was run.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tramcars</b> are {{powered by}} 600 V {{overhead}} wire with electricity {{transmitted to the}} <b>tramcars</b> by pantograph and a few vintage trams by trolley pole.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tram line}} is {{operated}} by İzmir Metro. The line {{is served by}} 17 <b>tramcars</b> produced by Hyundai Rotem plant in Adapazarı. The double-ended 32 m-long five-module <b>tramcars</b> are each 43.1 t heavy. They have 48 seating capacity, and can carry up to 285 passengers each. Service speed is 24 km/h, [...] and top speed is 70 km/h. The <b>tramcars</b> run on standard track gauge at 1435 mm. The electrification system of the <b>tramcars</b> is 750V DC. The line has a communications-based train control (CBTC) signalling system.|$|R
2500|$|... 1945: After {{three years}} and eight months of Japanese Occupation, all 109 <b>tramcars</b> still remained, but only 15 were operational. By October 1945, 40 <b>tramcars</b> were back in service.|$|R
25|$|The 1904 Chesterfield <b>tramcar</b> No.7 {{survived a}} depot fire which {{destroyed}} many other trams and also {{used as a}} house. The museum found the tram and restored it.|$|E
25|$|Josiah Dann, a <b>tramcar</b> conductor, {{was summoned}} on 2 August 1883 for having carried 28 {{passengers}} {{when the car}} was only licensed for 24. The officer noticed the <b>tramcar</b> in Carrington Street drawn by one horse and counted the passengers. When the car reached the ascent at the Canal Bridge, the horse had to stop {{and some of the}} passengers got out. The conductor pleaded guilty but in mitigation said that the passengers were all going to the Nottinghamshire v. Gloucestershire cricket match at Trent Bridge. He was fined 20s.|$|E
25|$|Southampton 45 was {{the very}} first <b>tramcar</b> to be {{preserved}} by the Tramway Museum Society, purchased for just £10 in 1949, after the closing ceremony of the Southampton Corporation.|$|E
50|$|The {{fleet of}} <b>tramcars</b> was {{insufficient}} {{to provide an}} effective service during the winter season and additional <b>tramcars</b> were rented from other networks (Fontainebleau, Troyes, Poitiers, Pau and Avignon).|$|R
50|$|The company {{expanded}} the tram fleet as services increased in popularity. By 1912, there were 102 <b>tramcars</b> in service. Shortly before closure, {{the number of}} <b>tramcars</b> had reached 131.|$|R
5000|$|... 1945: After {{three years}} and eight months of Japanese Occupation, all 109 <b>tramcars</b> still remained, but only 15 were operational. By October 1945, 40 <b>tramcars</b> were back in service.|$|R
25|$|The SYTM owns Sheffield Corporation <b>tramcar</b> 460. The <b>tramcar</b> {{was built}} by Cravens in Darnall, Sheffield and {{was part of a}} batch of fifty cars, all {{numbered}} between 451 and 500. The car was equipped with upholstered seats in April 1939 and survived the Blitz on Sheffield in December 1940. She was withdrawn in February 1950 and stored at Tinsley Tram Sheds until 1951, the car was dismantled at Tinsley with the lower and upper saloon bodies being disposed of separately. The lower saloon of No 460 fetched £25 and was used on a farm in Lincolnshire.|$|E
25|$|The Tramways Committee met {{nearly every}} two weeks and the minutes record a {{constant}} stream of accidents and claims on the committee for damages too numerous to list here. There are complaints by shopkeepers against <b>tramcar</b> drivers who let their horses and cars stand outside the shop. There are records of payments to <b>tramcar</b> drivers who acted bravely in restraining horses which were startled and bolted. Despite the imminent introduction of electric cars, the horse tram rails still required maintenance, and the minute book records that the track outside the Mechanics Institute was replaced at the end of 1897.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tramcar</b> had {{two small}} oil lamps fitted into the {{bulkheads}} and inside {{it was so}} dark at night that the conductor had to use a portable lamp clipped to his belt. The tram’s upper deck had back to back ‘knifeboard' seating running {{the length of the}} vehicle and whilst the passengers were protected from smoke and soot by the roof, the sides were open from the modesty rails upwards. The <b>tramcar</b> had a coloured signal light outside and a cord running the length of the saloon, connected with a gong on the engine, for signalling purposes.|$|E
50|$|Passenger <b>tramcars</b> are {{equipped}} with bow-type current collectors, which are suitable for operation on the existing catenary. It is planned to equip <b>tramcars</b> with modified pantographs adapted to work in local conditions.|$|R
50|$|This {{class of}} <b>tramcars,</b> a {{variation}} of the Tramway Français Standard, exists in two types, <b>tramcars</b> introduced in 1991 and those in 1998. The first class was introduced between 1991 and 1992 {{at the time of the}} line extension to Hôpital Nord. They are numbered 901 to 915 and have a seating capacity of 43. In 1998, more <b>tramcars</b> were introduced with only minor differences, numbered 916 to 935.|$|R
50|$|Nevertheless, for {{the extra}} length of line four more city <b>tramcars</b> with the numbers 32-35 were purchased. As matters turned out, {{this would be the}} city's last {{significant}} purchase of new <b>tramcars</b> for fifty years.|$|R
25|$|In 1929, a P-class tram {{crashed into}} a barber's shop {{on the corner of}} Quay and Ultimo Roads near Central Station. Almost half of the <b>tramcar</b> ended up in the shop.|$|E
25|$|Leeds 180 {{was built}} in 1931 by Brush Electrical Machines, and is often {{referred}} to as either a Horsfield or Showboat <b>tramcar</b> (the latter due to the extraordinary amount of lighting on the tram).|$|E
25|$|Nantes {{compressed}} air <b>tramcar</b> 22, later renumbered 18 and dating from 1879, still exists {{and is the}} only surviving {{compressed air}} tram in the world. It is part of the collection at the AMTUIR museum in Paris, but was in Nantes in 1992.|$|E
5000|$|Ten two-axle {{electric}} <b>tramcars</b> {{were purchased}} from the Graz railcar company {{to operate the}} new network, and these came into service with the fleet numbers 36-42 for the <b>tramcars</b> serving the city line and 43-45 for the three <b>tramcars</b> operating the [...] "Saggen" [...] branch shuttle service. Passenger numbers increased rapidly and several small unpowered carriages {{were taken from the}} (still at this stage steam powered) [...] "L.B.I.H.i.T" [...] railway, to be used in combination with the new <b>tramcars</b> for the city tram services. The [...] "L.B.I.H.i.T" [...] service between Innsbruck and Hall in Tirol (Solbad Hall) could not easily spare these cars, and in 1906 the company acquired four new unpowered-trailer <b>tramcars.</b> Additionally, two open-ended [...] "summer" [...] cars were transferred from another local one-meter mountain railway and adapted for use with the trams. These were already kitted-out with electric lighting and electric heating.|$|R
50|$|Reckenzaun {{worked on}} {{electric}} <b>tramcars</b> and electric boats. He {{is probably best}} known for applying worm gear drive to <b>tramcars.</b> This was not a great success on full-size vehicles but was later very widely used on electrically powered model railway locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The company fleet grew {{to around}} 40 <b>tramcars.</b> Initial {{vehicles}} {{were obtained from}} the Starbuck Car and Wagon Company but from 1883 the company turned to a local manufacturer, R & J Shinnie of Union Row, Aberdeen, who provided subsequent <b>tramcars.</b>|$|R
25|$|A branch was {{promoted}} by the Joint Committee to Govan, from Ibrox. It opened to goods traffic on 1 May 1868 and to passengers on 2 December 1868. As an inner-suburban line, it was vulnerable to <b>tramcar</b> competition, and the passenger service was withdrawn on 9 May 1921.|$|E
25|$|The {{work was}} {{completed}} in 1979 and the Heaton Park Tramway was officially opened on 28 March 1980. The tramway currently has an operating fleet of 3 electric trams and one horse tram. One of these, <b>tramcar,</b> No 765, was {{to be seen in}} the museum at Crich in Derbyshire, before moving to Heaton Park.|$|E
25|$|Following the Zeppelin raid on Nottingham, {{a form of}} {{blackout}} blind {{was fitted}} to the cars, while revised Board of Trade regulations in June necessitated the fitting of side lifeguards. A further six <b>tramcar</b> bodies were ordered at this time from the United Electric Car Company Limited as replacements, followed by six more in October.|$|E
5000|$|In Shanghai {{there were}} three tram systems - two {{operated}} by the colonial powers of Britain and France and one by a Chinese company. The British system opened in 1908 and was {{the largest of the}} three. It had 7 lines and ran 216 <b>tramcars.</b> The French system opened the same year and its 3 lines ran 60 <b>tramcars.</b> The Chinese system opened in 1913 and operated 52 <b>tramcars</b> over 4 lines of some 23.5 km in length.|$|R
5000|$|... 29 {{electric}} Postel-Vinay <b>tramcars</b> (1896), {{transformed in}} 1922 and renumbered 1 to 9. They were open-ended and painted in yellow and white. the <b>tramcars</b> were staffed by two men, a wattman, who drove the trams, and a ticket inspector, {{who was in}} charge of collecting fares, the trolley pole and point levers. The <b>tramcars</b> were modernised after World War I and their open ends closed as well as the replacing of the two motors by one more powerful.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1904, eight short open tram trailer cars {{were added to the}} fleet. They rapidly came to enjoy great popularity. Unexpectedly, damage to the chassis frame {{occurred}} on two of the motor <b>tramcars</b> used to haul the open trailers, which operated mostly on line I. The damage was obviously caused by the Demerbe rails used on that line, and the SSB was forced to replace the two <b>tramcars</b> much earlier than planned. At the end of 1905 came the first six axle enclosed tram trailer. Between 1906 and 1914, 29 two-axle motor <b>tramcars</b> were commissioned in a number of separate deliveries. These new <b>tramcars</b> were stronger than their predecessors and were also no longer asymmetrical.|$|R
