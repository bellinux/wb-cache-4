5|$|The 1926 coup was a {{major event}} in interwar Lithuania; the {{dictatorship}} would go on for 14years. In 1935, the Smetona government outlawed the activities of all other political parties. The coup continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> issue for Lithuanians, since the Soviet Union {{would go on to}} describe its subsequent occupation of Lithuania as a liberation from fascism. Encyclopædia Britannica, however, describes the regime as authoritarian and nationalistic rather than fascist. The coup's apologists have described it as a corrective to an extreme form of parliamentarianism, justifiable in light of Lithuania's political immaturity.|$|E
5|$|Madsen's {{first year}} as {{chairman}} of the club proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> year for Malmö FF as they were relegated from Allsvenskan for the first time, leaving the top flight {{for the first time since}} the club's demotion in 1934, ending a run of 63 consecutive seasons in the first division. Madsen and the club's director of sports, Hasse Borg, initiated a programme for Malmö FF to regain its place in the top league, and the club was promoted back to Allsvenskan in 2000, after one season in Superettan. Nineteen-year-old Zlatan Ibrahimović emerged as the club's leading goalscorer, scoring 12 goals in 26 games. Ibrahimović was sold to Ajax in 2001 for 86.2million SEK (approximately €10.2million); as of 2012, this is the highest transfer fee paid to a Swedish football club.|$|E

5|$|The Year of the Sex Olympics proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> {{production}} {{when the}} 'Clean-Up TV' campaigner Mary Whitehouse of the National Viewers and Listeners Association obtained {{a copy of}} the script and attempted to block the production. Her objections were overruled by Hugh Greene. Location filming for the outdoor scenes set on the island that appears in The Live Life Show took place on the Isle of Man between 8 and 10 May 1968. A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist. Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May, covering the elements that would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the Sportsex, Artsex and Foodshow programmes as well as the audience reaction shots. The scene where Kin Hodder falls to his death was also shot at Ealing. Following rehearsals, the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June. Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production, {{and by the end of}} the recording session the final ten minutes of the play remained untaped, leading to a remount on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes.|$|E
5|$|On 13 April 1941, Hitler issued Directive No. 27, {{including}} his occupation policy for Greece. He finalized jurisdiction in the Balkans with Directive No. 31 issued on 9 June. Mainland Greece was divided between Germany, Italy and Bulgaria, with Italy occupying {{the bulk of}} the country (see map opposite). German forces occupied the strategically more important areas of Athens, Thessaloniki, Central Macedonia and several Aegean islands, including most of Crete. They also occupied Florina, which was claimed by both Italy and Bulgaria. Bulgaria, which had not participated in the invasion of Greece, occupied most of Thrace {{on the same day that}} Tsolakoglou offered his surrender. The goal was to gain an Aegean Sea outlet in Western Thrace and Eastern Macedonia. The Bulgarians occupied territory between the Struma river and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of the Evros River. Italian troops started occupying the Ionian and Aegean islands on 28 April. On 2 June, they occupied the Peloponnese; on 8 June, Thessaly; and on 12 June, most of Attica. The occupation of Greece—during which civilians suffered terrible hardships, many dying from privation and hunger—proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> and costly task. Several resistance groups launched guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces and set up espionage networks.|$|E

25|$|In September 1944, Tempest units, {{based at}} forward airfields in England, {{supported}} Operation Market Garden, the airborne attempt to seize a bridgehead over the Rhine. On 21 September 1944, as the V-1 threat had receded, the Tempest squadrons were redeployed to the 2nd TAF, effectively trading places with the Mustang III squadrons of 122 Wing, which {{became part of}} the ADGB units deployed on bomber escort duties. 122 Wing now consisted of 3 Sqn., 56 Sqn., 80 Sqn., 274 Sqn. (to March 1945), and 486(NZ)Sqn. From 1 October 1944 122 Wing was based at B.80 Volkel Air Base near Uden, in the Netherlands.

In the last week of Top 16 playing at home Žalgiris beat Real Madrid for only the third loss of the season for Spanish champions at that time. Justin Dentmon scored 36 points in that game – the most by Žalgiris player in modern EuroLeague. Dentmon also made 74 three-pointers during the season – a EuroLeague record since 2000.|$|E
25|$|St Ives is an {{historic}} fishing port in west Cornwall {{and offers a}} sheltered harbour for ships in the open waters of the Western Approaches. On 24 December 1838 the schooner Rival was trying to enter the harbour in a gale but came to grief on one of its piers; despite lacking proper rescue boats and equipment five people were saved after much courage and effort by the people ashore. A meeting was held and {{it was decided that}} a proper lifeboat should be built for the town. Francis Adams, a local man, had recently won a prize from the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society for designing a double-ended, self-righting lifeboat and he was commissioned to now build one. The Hope entered service in 1840, assisting the Mary Ann of Poole during a storm on 7 April. Hope had fallen out of use by 1860 so the following year the RNLI opened a new lifeboat station at Porthgwidden beach. It proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> site to launch from and so in 1867 it was closed. It has since been used as a store.|$|E

25|$|Studying {{earthquakes}} {{has shown}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> task when considering all the limitations created by natural disasters. Clinical interviews are {{difficult because of}} the widespread damage to infrastructure and roads, which leads to reliance on self-report. Self-report can introduce bias to results, leading to skewed data. Researchers are unable to reliably compare an individual's mental health status to their health status previous to the trauma because they must rely on retrospective self-report. Retrospective self-report is affected greatly by the individual's current state of distress. The displacement {{of large numbers of}} citizens following a trauma poses as a problem for researchers of natural disasters. It is predicted {{that the people who are}} displaced experience the worst of the damage, and therefore the reported levels of PTSD and depression are often lower than they would have been had the displaced citizens been available to collect data from. Because large number of citizens are being displaced, it is difficult to find a representative sample population. For example, after the Christchurch earthquakes, studies reported that older educated females of European New Zealand descent were over represented in their sample population, which isn't accurate of the Christchurch population as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Casting {{the lead}} roles of Duck, You Sucker! proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> process. The role of John Mallory {{was written for}} Jason Robards, who had played Cheyenne in Once Upon a Time in the West. However, the studio wanted a bigger name for his character. Clint Eastwood was then {{approached}} by Leone for the role, but he saw it as just a different take of the same character he had already played in the Dollars Trilogy, and he also wanted to end his association with the Italian film industry. As a result, he declined the offer and starred in Hang 'Em High instead. George Lazenby was then approached to play John, but he declined. A young Malcolm McDowell, then mostly known for his performance in if...., was considered for both John and Nolan, John’s Irish friend, but Leone eventually settled on James Coburn to play John. Coburn had previously been considered for other Leone projects, including A Fistful of Dollars and Once Upon a Time in the West. He had also previously been considered for a role in another United Artists-financed Zapata Western, Sergio Corbucci's The Mercenary, but Franco Nero was later cast in what was originally his role.|$|E
25|$|The Hutu {{militants in}} the camps were very aware that the camps {{provided}} both protection and resources for their military activities. They thus {{had an interest in}} keeping the camps where they were, in effect making the refugees semi-hostages. Rumors of Tutsi retributions and an impending second genocide also convinced many Hutu refugees that they should not return. The obvious candidate to impose order was the Zairean government of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. However, Zaire was a large and weak state, which did not have firm control of the eastern regions that were {{on the opposite side of}} the country from the capital. It has also been noted that Uganda and Zaire had unfriendly relations. Mobutu would not have been pleased by the emergence of a Rwandan government that was allied with Uganda and may have hoped that the Hutu militants could rid him of the new government of Paul Kagame. Documents belonging to Hutu fighters show that Mobutu allowed the militants to ship large amounts of arms into the country. The only other option with international credibility was a multilateral intervention led by the UN, but it quickly became clear that few nations were interested in what seemed certain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> and bloody operation in a remote African region.|$|E
50|$|A {{key event}} in the {{development}} of Kingswood was the construction of the Ennerdale Link Bridges over the River Hull in 1997. Work on the link began in the early 1990s, with the crossing originally planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> tunnel, <b>difficult</b> ground conditions forced a change of plan in 1994, resulting in the construction of two bridges.

Villaret seems <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> and overbearing man, and eventually alienated his Order.
