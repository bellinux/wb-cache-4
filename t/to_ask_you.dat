2500|$|In Russia, Savchenko {{is portrayed}} {{extremely}} negatively in the media; according to BBC News [...] "Crude, {{and at times}} sexist, innuendo is used to demonise Ms Savchenko". The Russian daily Komsomolskaya Pravda said that Savchenko {{is known as a}} [...] "killing machine in a skirt", and Tvoy Den called her [...] "Satan's daughter". Russian social media, however, tends to be more nuanced towards her with several anti-Kremlin users mocking perceived oddities in the Russian authorities' version of events, in particular their claim that she entered the country as a refugee. In March 2016, Russian composer Vladimir Nazarov wrote in an open letter to Putin saying that [...] "not even in my worst nightmare could I have imagined that I would have <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> not to kill a woman." [...] In March 2016, Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny stated about Savchenko's trial, [...] "However you look at it, this doesn't benefit Russia". Navalny said that whoever planned to make Savchenko [...] "a trophy prisoner" [...] had miscalculated. He described the trial as such an [...] "obvious stitch-up" [...] you could [...] "see the threads".|$|E
