5000|$|Sprout traces {{its origins}} to the PBS Kids network (referred to as PBS Kids Channel in press materials), which {{launched}} on September 6, 1999 coinciding with PBS Kids' rebrand that day. The PBS Kids feed was available on digital {{cable and satellite}} television, and was also offered to PBS member stations for use on a [...] "cablecast" [...] service (a cable-only local channel provided by the member station) or for use on the member station's over-the-air analog channel to provide {{a portion of the}} daytime PBS Kids programming on the station. Participating stations were required to pay an annual fee of $1,000 to use the feed. At launch, 32 PBS member stations had signed up to use the service. The channel was created, in part, to compete against Nick Jr. and its sister network Noggin (which now shares its name with the Nick Jr. block). Because the cable rights to the Children's <b>Television</b> Workshop's <b>program</b> <b>library</b> were owned by Noggin (which CTW owned a 50% interest in at the time), the channel did not broadcast any CTW programming, including Sesame Street, a long staple of PBS' children's programming lineup. The CTW-produced Dragon Tales, which premiered on the same day as the launch of the PBS Kids Channel, was the only exception to this.|$|R

5000|$|International {{cultivation}} analysis {{attempts to}} answer {{the question of whether the}} medium or the system is the message. Gerbner et al. found that countries where the <b>television</b> <b>programs</b> were less repetitive and homogeneous than the United States produced less predictable and consistent results. The variety of television content is also an important factor. Increased diversity and balance within <b>television</b> channels or <b>programs</b> leads viewers to report similar preferences. Further, importing <b>television</b> <b>programs</b> internationally can elicit variable responses depending on the cultural context and the type of <b>television</b> <b>program.</b> For example, exposure of US <b>television</b> <b>programs</b> to Korean females resulted in liberal perspective of gender roles and family. However, in the Korean male <b>television</b> viewers, US <b>programs</b> brought out increased hostility and protection of Korean culture. Another study showed that Australian students who watched US <b>television</b> <b>programs</b> (especially adventure and crime shows) were more likely to view Australia as dangerous; however, they didn't transfer this danger to America, even though they were watching US <b>television</b> <b>programs.</b> A study conducted by Minnebo and Eggermont in 2007 found that heavy television viewers, over the age of 30, in Belgium [...] "were more likely to believe that most young people are substance users." ...|$|R
