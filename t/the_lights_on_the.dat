5|$|As part of Luminosity, several {{enhancements}} to {{the midway}} and rides were made. A new LED lighting package, {{similar to the}} park's WindSeeker, was installed on Millennium Force, Power Tower and the Giant Wheel. Towers with LED graphics and a new sound and light system were installed along the main midway from the front gate to Corkscrew. Gobo patterns are projected from the towers onto the midway and buildings. More than one million lights, including <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage, rides and buildings were added. Chauvet Professional supplied 700 lights for Luminosity. They also added 36 wash lights {{to the base of}} Millennium Force and 16 lights to the base and top of Power Tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{crown of}} the South Tower {{contains}} {{a band of}} 25 LED floodlights that remain lit all night. Each LED light consumes little energy and has a lifetime of 40,000 hours. These lights are used to signal the weather, just like <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> John Hancock Tower in Boston. The crown glows red if warmer weather is in the forecast. A blue crown signifies that cold weather is expected soon. Green {{means that there is}} at least a 50 percent chance of rain. Amber indicates that the weather will remain unchanged. This is the San Francisco Bay Area's first weather beacon. The crown began lighting up on December 8, 2008.|$|E

25|$|The Great Hall was {{a room of}} some size, 80ft long by 22ft wide. The {{floor of}} the room was Hopton Wood stone, and it had a {{panelled}} wagon roofed ceiling. The wall were panelled to 10ft high in old oak, and above the panelling hung 17th century tapestries. On the south wall were several traceried windows, consisting of two tiers of four very narrow lights. The upper lights were trefoil headed having such massive framework that the central shaft is equal in width to <b>the</b> <b>lights.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> west wall was a stone mullioned leaded light window some 20ft in height.|$|E

25|$|After {{receiving}} this information, Captain Horve {{had several}} personal telephone conversation with Rear admiral Carsten Tank-Nielsen, the Commander of the 2nd Naval District, {{who told him}} that he had ordered the navy's ships in Bergen to open fire at any and all foreign warships that might try to force their way into that port. The rear admiral gave him permission to use his own judgement in the coming hours. The conversation left Horve in no doubt that war was coming and he therefore ordered his ship to be made ready for war, guards to be posted, all leaves to be cancelled and <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship and in the harbour area to be blacked out.|$|E
25|$|The {{spouting}} flames {{from the}} Flame Barge {{are reduced to}} a low sputter, and the Earth Globe appears and moves towards {{the center of the}} lagoon accompanied with water effects emanating from the fountain barges. As the Earth cools, it changes from hot white to red to blue. Images appear on the Globe of countries, famous landmarks, objects, and people. The exterior buildings of the countries around the lagoon are illuminated followed by laser lights, spot lights, and more fireworks in the center lagoon. Since the buildings of the Morocco Pavilion are replicas of buildings that have great religious significance, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pavilion do not light up during IllumiNations. In order to keep symmetry, the Norway Pavilion does not light up either. The scene includes high-launch fireworks.|$|E
25|$|PATH {{operates}} 24hours a day, {{seven days}} a week. During weekday hours, PATH operates four train services, using three terminals in New Jersey and two in Manhattan. Each line is represented by a unique color, which also corresponds {{to the color of}} <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> front of the trains. The Journal Square – 33rd Street (via Hoboken) service is the only line represented by two colors (orange and blue), since it is a late-night hours combination of the Journal Square – 33rd Street and Hoboken – 33rd Street services. During peak hours, trains operate every four to eight minutes on each service. Every PATH station except Newark and Harrison is served by a train every two to three minutes, for a peak-hour service of 20 to 30 trains per hour.|$|E

25|$|As the {{students}} debated what to do, Hou Dejian negotiated for safe passage {{out of the}} Square with the army. At 3:30am, {{at the suggestion of}} two doctors in the Red Cross camp, Hou Dejian and Zhuo rode in an ambulance to the northeast corner of the Square and spoke with Ji Xinguo, the political commissar of the 336th Regiment, who relayed the request to command headquarters, which agreed to grant safe passage for {{the students}} to the southeast. At 4:00 am, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Square abruptly shut, signalling the end of the army's patience. To break the students' spirits, Company No. 5 of the 2nd Bridgade, 334th Regiment knocked down the Goddess of Democracy statue {{at the north end of}} the Square. At 4:30 am, the lights relit as the soldiers moved into action.|$|E
25|$|The National Christmas Tree again {{remained}} largely unlit in 1980. President Carter's five-year-old grandson, Jason, {{switched on the}} tree. The tree had been completely decorated with large balls and lights, but {{at a meeting in}} early December 1980 the families of the American hostages asked that the tree remain unlit. <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tree shone for 417 seconds, one second for every day that the hostages had been captive. The lights were then turned off, leaving only the star atop the tree shining. When the hostages were released on January 20, 1981, the tree was redecorated. It was relit for the returning hostages on January 27. 1980 was also the first year that the Pageant of Peace organizers were required by the National Park Service to hold an open meeting to solicit input from the public. Once again, a separate small tree honored of American prisoners of war.|$|E
25|$|At 04:30 on 3 September, {{approximately}} an {{hour before}} first light, LCAs carrying British 5th Division and Canadian 1st Division troops of the 13th Corps, Eighth Army, touched down after crossing the Strait of Messina into Calabria. This was a shore to shore landing craft operation with the assault forces embarking at Mili Marina, south of Messina, and travelling an average of 12,000 yards to their assault beaches. The LCAs and LCMs that comprised the initial assault wave were joined by DUKWs and LCI(L)s in later waves. The flotillas were led in by Motor Launches, and guided by directional tracer from Bofors guns along with four vertical searchlight beams to allow coxswains to keep their bearings. Still, navigation proved difficult. The rapid and irregular currents, whirlpools, and winds of the Messina Strait hampered navigation. Though the night was starlit, with no moon, the prodigious artillery barrage accompanying the assault contained {{a high number of}} smoke rounds (500). The navigation lights of the guiding Motor Launches, which LCA coxswains were to follow, became lost among <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opposing shore.|$|E

25|$|The Roman force {{stationed}} at the pass, with no Fabius to restrain them, deserted their posts {{at the head of}} the pass to attack what they thought was the main Carthaginian army trying to outflank their position and escape across the saddle. As soon as the Romans left their position, Hannibal's main army left camp, with the African infantry leading, the cavalry, the baggage train and the cattle herds marching in line after them, and Celts and Iberian infantry guarding the rear. The Carthaginian army moved through the pass unmolested, as Fabius did not challenge them. The Roman force attacking the saddle was bewildered when they confronted <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> saddle. The cattle ran amok, breaking their lines, the Carthaginian spearmen ambushed them, and a wild melee ensued. As dawn broke to make matters clear, a group of Iberian infantry was seen scaling the saddle walls to join the ongoing pandemonium on the saddle. The Iberians, being experts in mountain warfare, engaged the now scattered Roman soldiers and killed over 1,000 of their number, and managed to rescue the Carthaginian camp followers, the spearmen guard and some of the cattle well before the main Roman army could intervene.|$|E
25|$|Before 2011, a cab's {{availability}} {{was indicated}} by <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} car. When no lights were lit, the cab would be occupied by passengers. When just the center light showing the medallion number was lit, the cab would be empty and available. When the OFF and DUTY inscriptions {{to either side of}} the medallion number were lit, with the medallion number off, the cab would be off duty and not accepting passengers. However, when the OFF and DUTY inscriptions were lit and the medallion number was still lit, the cab would be off duty but the driver could choose to pick up passengers heading {{in the same direction as}} the driver. In fall 2011, the TLC announced a plan to replace the three-light system with a simple indicator as to whether the taxi is available. In 2012, the TLC simplified the light system further, with a lit roof light indicating that the taxi is available and an unlit light indicating that the taxi is not available, regardless of whether it has passengers or is simply off duty. It also started fining drivers $100 for picking up passengers without the light on, except for if the driver is picking up their last passenger of their shift.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{security}} concerns about an assassination attempts, President Ronald Reagan lit the National Christmas Tree via remote control from the East Room of the White House in 1981, 1982, and 1983. Supporters of the Equal Rights Amendment and increased {{aid for the}} poor protested at the event. <b>The</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 1981 tree suffered from faulty wiring, {{and could not be}} lit on the final night of the event (January 1, 1982). 1981 also marked the beginning of a number of changes to the Pageant of Peace. The petting zoo was canceled due to cost concerns, {{but for the first time}} each state or territory donated the ornaments to be used on their tree lining the Pathway of Peace. A request to honor Vietnam War veterans during the ceremony was turned down to keep the focus on Christmas. A new contractor, Westport Marketing Group, was also hired to manage the tree lighting ceremony. Westport changed the ceremony so that fewer guests sat on stage. This made room for more performers. Westport also suggested that more national celebrities be invited to perform as well to turn the event into a national (rather than local) event and boost the appeal to a national audience. Westport suggested even more radical reductions in the number of guests and field seating as well as elimination of the Yule log in 1982. There was also discussion of moving the entire event into the White House, but these suggestions were not acted on.|$|E

500|$|Sinatra {{died with}} his wife at his side at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on May 14, 1998, aged 82, after a heart attack. Sinatra had ill health {{during the last few}} years of his life, and was {{frequently}} hospitalized for heart and breathing problems, high blood pressure, pneumonia and bladder cancer. He was further diagnosed as having dementia. He had made no public appearances following a heart attack in February 1997. Sinatra's wife encouraged him to [...] "fight" [...] while attempts were made to stabilize him, and his final words were, [...] "I'm losing." [...] Sinatra's daughter, Tina, later wrote that she and her sister, Nancy, had not been notified of their father's final hospitalization, and it was her belief that [...] "the omission was deliberate. Barbara would be the grieving widow alone at her husband's side." [...] The night after Sinatra's death, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Empire State Building in New York City were turned blue, the lights at the Las Vegas Strip were dimmed in his honor, and the casinos stopped spinning for a minute.|$|E
500|$|One {{week after}} the {{official}} opening of the ride at Cedar Point, attraction reviewer Brian Krosnick of Theme Park Tourist submitted an online review {{saying that it was}} [...] "truly breathtaking". The review applauded [...] "the inclusion of on-ride audio and such an exemplary lighting package", commenting that it was [...] "more than anyone expected or could've asked for". Krosnick pointed out that, because of the location of the ride beside Lake Erie and the hot summers, <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ride attract massive [...] "clouds" [...] of bugs. He felt the ride cycle might be too short for the type of ride, particularly the time spent at the top. On July 13, 2011, Nick Sim, also from Theme Park Tourist, reviewed the ride at Kings Island and made similar remarks. Los Angeles Times blogger Brady MacDonald complimented the [...] "impressive nighttime spectacular from anywhere in the park". He reported having thoroughly enjoyed the ride at Knott's Berry Farm and said that he would ride it every time he visited the park. Tom Sherer of the Sandusky Register praised Cedar Point's WindSeeker for having one of the best views of the park and commented that it [...] "isn't as extreme as a lot of people fear, unless you’re afraid of heights." [...] He criticized the name WindSeeker, pointing out that the ride closes in high winds. Another reviewer called the view from Knott's Berry Farm's version [...] "simply breathtaking" [...] and urged readers to [...] "get a ride on it as soon as you can". The same reviewer, however, also criticized the choice of music, suggesting that the park should have used [...] "themes from more 'southwestern' films" [...] to fit with the overall theme of the Fiesta Village area. Members of the general public have also applauded the addition.|$|E
500|$|Some {{effects were}} {{achieved}} {{in ways that}} are not immediately obvious. In one scene, a supernatural force pushes against the parlor door and bends it inward repeatedly. Though the door appears to some viewers to have been made of latex, it was in fact made of laminated wood (with a strong crew member pushing a piece of timber hard against the door). Two physical effects were used to make the spiral staircase in the library appear frightening. In one scene, the camera appears to ascend the staircase at a rapid rate. However, the point of view is backward, looking down the staircase, as the camera used the staircase's handrail as a dolly track, being lowered slowly by means of a wire. When the sequence was run in reverse at high speed, the effect was frightening. In another scene, the staircase appears to become unstable and give way as Luke Sanderson ascends it. Later, Eleanor goes up the staircase in a trance-like state. She is rescued by Dr. Markway, even as the staircase seems ready to collapse. The collapsing staircase effect was designed by a metalworker at the Borehamwood studios. The effect was created by tying portions of the steps and railing to a cable that ran inside the staircase's central pole. When the cable was slackened, these elements moved freely. [...] When tightened, the staircase appeared solid and stable. The effect was so disturbing to the cast that Robert Wise had to ascend the staircase while it was shaking in order to prove it was safe. Other effects also relied on simple cinema tricks. Early in the film, the audience sees Abigail Crain lying in bed, aging from a young child to an old woman. A camera was fixed over the bed, and four different actresses (each a different age) posed in the bed beneath the camera. Dissolves were used to show the aging process. In another scene, the characters come across a [...] "cold spot" [...] in the haunted mansion. To show the physical effect on the characters, the makeup department applied special makeup to the characters that appeared invisible in normal light. To show the effect of cold on the skin, filters were gradually drawn over <b>the</b> <b>lights</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set, revealing the [...] "cold effect" [...] makeup.|$|E
