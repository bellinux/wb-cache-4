5|$|Pacification, {{to quell}} a {{potential}} civil war after a disputed election, <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> the opponents through political concessions. Five such sejms were held (in 1598, 1673, 1698, 1699 and 1735).|$|E
5|$|The Mongol Empire {{first arrived}} at the {{doorstep}} of the Pagan Empire in 1252 by invading the Dali Kingdom {{in its attempt to}} outflank Song China. The Mongol armies captured the capital, Dali, on 7 January 1253, and went on <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> much of the kingdom by 1257.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} encourages Siva's {{friends to}} ask him to stand for the student-union presidency, but he wants them to nominate Naresh (one of the group) instead. Ganesh's attempts <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> Siva fail, and Bhavani learns about him. He considers Siva a potential replacement for J. D., whose weakness annoys him.|$|E
50|$|From the U.S. perspective, the Strategic Hamlet Program was the {{consensus}} approach <b>to</b> <b>pacifying</b> the countryside. There was a sense, however, {{that this was}} simply not {{a high priority for}} Diệm, who considered his power base to be in the cities. The Communists, willing to fill a vacuum, became more and more active in rural areas where the GVN was invisible, irrelevant, or actively a hindrance.|$|R

5|$|By {{this time}} the federal Juan Manuel de Rosas had begun <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> the civil war started by Lavalle and earned San Martín's admiration. They began to {{exchange}} friendly letters. The Belgian Revolution and the cholera epidemic of 1831 made San Martín leave Brussels and move to Paris, where both San Martín and his daughter became ill. They were helped by Mariano Balcarce. Mariano married Mercedes, {{and they had a}} daughter, María Mercedes.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous {{resistance}} was stubborn, and Montejo {{did not complete}} the conquest of western and central Honduras until 1539. Once he had established Spanish control there, he headed east <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> the Olancho valley. Although the conquest {{of the west and}} centre of the territory was difficult, and the natives were well organised, resistance in the east took much longer to put down, and rebellions there lasted throughout the colonial period.|$|E
5|$|Phil Leotardo and his henchmen beat Benny Fazio {{while trying}} to acquire the {{whereabouts}} of Tony B.; Phil also threatens to have Christopher taken out if Tony B.'s whereabouts are not disclosed soon. To avoid any more of his guys getting hurt and <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> New York, Tony tracks Tony B. to their Uncle Pat's farm and shoots him. Phil, however, is furious {{that he did not}} get the opportunity to do it himself. Tony and Johnny meet at Johnny's house in a reconciliatory manner, but Johnny is arrested by Federal agents, while Tony escapes.|$|E

5|$|Shaiva scriptures narrate {{that god}} Shiva assumed the Avatar (incarnation) of Sharabha <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> Narasimha - the fierce man-lion avatar of Vishnu worshipped by Vaishnava sect. This form is {{popularly known as}} Sharabeshwara ("Lord Sharabha") or Sharabeshwaramurti. The Vaishnavas refute the {{portrayal}} of Narasimha as being destroyed by Shiva-Sharabha and regard Sharabha as a name of Vishnu. Another tale narrates that Vishnu assumed {{the form of the}} ferocious Gandaberunda bird-animal to combat Sharabha. In Buddhism, Sharabha appears in Jataka Tales as a previous birth of the Buddha.|$|E
5|$|The alleged {{death of}} Moreno González was {{considered}} one of the most significant government victories since the start of the drug war in 2006. La Familia Michoacana was the focus of the government because their stronghold, Michoacán state, is approximately four hours away from the country's capital, Mexico City. In addition, Michoacán is the homestate of former President Felipe Calderón, who made it a top priority <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> it.|$|E
5|$|These speculations {{cannot be}} proven without doubt {{but as a}} governor, Odaenathus {{would have been the}} highest {{authority}} in the province and above any legionary commander and provincial officials; this would make him the commander of the Roman forces in the province. Whatever the case may be, starting from 258, Odaenathus strengthened his position and extended his political influence in the region. By 260, Odaenathus held the rank, credibility and power <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> the Roman east following the Battle of Edessa.|$|E
60|$|Romayne was not <b>to</b> be <b>pacified</b> in that way. His {{anger was}} trebly {{intensified}} by the long-continued strain on his nerves {{of the effort}} to control himself.|$|R
6000|$|Monday {{afternoon}} brought Mr. Prosser, who was closeted with Harold, while Eustace and I devoted our faculties <b>to</b> <b>pacifying</b> Dora {{under her}} exclusion, and preventing her from climbing {{up to the}} window-sill to gaze into the library from without. She scorned submission to either of us, so Eustace kept guard by lying on the grass below, and I coaxed her by gathering primroses, sowing seeds, and using all inducements I could think of, but my resources were nearly exhausted when Harold's head appeared at the window, and he called, [...] "Eustace! Lucy! here!" ...|$|R

5|$|A {{prime example}} of Roman loss in battle was the Battle of Teutoburg Forest in AD 9, where three entire legions led by Publius Quinctilius Varus were {{destroyed}} by Arminius, leader of the Cherusci, an apparent Roman ally. Augustus retaliated by dispatching Tiberius and Drusus to the Rhineland <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> it, which had some success although the battle of AD 9 brought the end to Roman expansion into Germany. Roman general Germanicus took advantage of a Cherusci civil war between Arminius and Segestes; they defeated Arminius, who fled that battle but was killed later in 21 due to treachery.|$|E
5|$|Against Irataba's advice, in 1858 Mohave warriors {{attacked}} the first emigrant wagon train to use Beale's Wagon Road through Mohave country. As a result, the U.S. War Department sent a detachment under Colonel William Hoffman <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> the tribe. Following {{a series of}} confrontations known as the Mohave War, Hoffman succeeded in dominating the natives, and demanded that they allow the passage of settlers through their territory. To ensure compliance, Fort Mohave was constructed {{near the site of}} the battle in April 1859. Hoffman also imprisoned several Mohave leaders. Having been an advocate for friendly relations with the whites, Irataba became the nation's Aha macave yaltanack, an elected, as opposed to hereditary, leader.|$|E
5|$|As Palmyra gained {{importance}} to French efforts <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> the Syrian Desert, a base {{was constructed in}} the village near the Temple of Bel in 1921. In 1929 the general director of antiquities in Syria, Henri Arnold Seyrig, began excavating the ruins and convinced the villagers {{to move to a}} new, French-built village next to the site. The relocation was completed in 1932; ancient Palmyra was ready for excavation as its villagers settled into the new village of Tadmur. During World War II, the Mandate came under the authority of Vichy France, who gave permission to Nazi Germany to use the airfield at Palmyra; forces of Free France, backed by British forces, invaded Syria in June 1941, and on 3 July 1941, the British took control over the city {{in the aftermath of a}} battle.|$|E
50|$|The {{only way}} to carry out such changes without social {{upheaval}} would be to acquire at least some support from the opposition side. The government accepted the idea {{that some kind of}} a deal with the opposition would be necessary, and repeatedly attempted to find common ground throughout the 1980s. However, at this point the communists generally still believed that they should retain the reins of power for the near future, and only allowed the opposition limited, advisory participation in the running of the country. They believed that this would be essential <b>to</b> <b>pacifying</b> the Soviet Union, which they felt was not yet ready to accept a non-Communist Poland.|$|R
5000|$|The Nihon shoki account {{has other}} discrepancies. The beach where the gods stuck the [...] "ten-fist sword" [...] is here called [...] "Itasa". The chief god of Izumo (Ōkuninushi) is {{called by the}} name of Ōanamuchi. The wrestling match with Takeminakata is missing. In the end, Ōanamuchi/Ōkuninushi gave sign of his obeisance by {{presenting}} the broad spear he used <b>to</b> <b>pacified</b> the land with. Jumping to a later passage (after digressing on other matters), the Nihon shoki retells Takemikazuchi and Futsunushi's landing on the beach, this time stating that Ōanamuchi verbally expressed resistance to relinquish his rule, until the heavenly gods promised him palatial residence to recompense his abdication.|$|R
60|$|But the {{jewellers}} {{were not}} so easily <b>to</b> be <b>pacified.</b> Bohmer, {{at the end of}} his patience, definitely refused to grant the postponement or to receive the thirty thousand livres other than as on account of the instalment due.|$|R
5|$|Castles {{served a}} range of purposes, the most {{important}} of which were military, administrative, and domestic. As well as defensive structures, castles were also offensive tools which {{could be used as a}} base of operations in enemy territory. Castles were established by Norman invaders of England for both defensive purposes and <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> the country's inhabitants. As William the Conqueror advanced through England, he fortified key positions to secure the land he had taken. Between 1066 and 1087, he established 36castles such as Warwick Castle, which he used to guard against rebellion in the English Midlands.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower 3 is a {{survival}} horror game played from a fixed third-person camera perspective in which players control 14-year-old school girl Alyssa Hamilton. Clock Tower 3 {{is the first}} game in the series to incorporate direct control over the protagonist, {{as opposed to the}} point-and-click gameplay used in the previous games. To progress through the game, the player must find items to unlock new areas, solve puzzles, and flee and hide from enemies ("Subordinates"). Eventually, each Subordinate must be defeated in battle. Throughout each level, the player also encounters the spirits of innocent people slain by the Subordinates. These spirits will attack Alyssa if she approaches them. In order <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> them, an item of sentimental value must be found and returned to the spirit's corpse.|$|E
5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5000|$|The bans lack {{of success}} was {{recognized}} {{by the end of}} the 19th century, and in 1904, under the official pretext that the minorities within the Russian Empire needed <b>to</b> be <b>pacified</b> after the Russo-Japanese War, the ban on Lithuanian-language publications was lifted.|$|R
5|$|Pandora– An {{animated}} {{creation of}} Hephaestus who became like a {{daughter to the}} god, and was neither living nor dead. Pandora was imprisoned in the labyrinth by Zeus when he was infected by the fear released from Pandora's Box. Kratos rescued Pandora after he learned {{that she was the}} key <b>to</b> <b>pacifying</b> the Flame of Olympus that surrounded Pandora's Box. Kratos reluctantly allowed Pandora to sacrifice herself to open the Box and mourned her death, as Pandora reminded him of his deceased child Calliope. Pandora reappeared in Kratos' psyche and helped him find the power of hope locked deep inside himself, which allowed him to overcome and kill Zeus. The character was voiced by Natalie Lander in God of War III.|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} with the rather violent and unstable period between {{the collapse of the}} Roman Empire and the rise of Plantagenet monarchy, the earliest phase of England’s market economy coincided with a remarkable attenuation of brutal interpersonal violence. While, for some, this diminution of aggression is indicative of a ‘civilizing process’, this paper sets out to advance our theorization of the shift from physically violent <b>to</b> <b>pacified</b> socioeconomic competition in England and Western Europe between the late fourteenth century and the mid-twentieth century. In this pursuit we draw upon the more critical theory of the ‘pseudo-pacification process’ to explain how physical violence was sublimated and harnessed to drive the nascent market economy, which established and reproduced an economically productive condition of pseudo-pacified ‘orderly disorder’...|$|R
5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Parvati (called Gauri here) is {{described}} as having suspected Shiva of infidelity when she saw her own reflection in the crystal-like breast of Shiva. A conjugal dispute erupted but was quickly resolved, after which Parvati wished to stay eternally with Shiva in his body. The divine couple was thereafter fused as Ardhanarishvara. Another tale from North India also talks about Parvati's jealousy. Another woman, the river Ganga – often depicted flowing out of Shiva's locks – sat on his head, while Parvati (as Gauri) sat on his lap. <b>To</b> <b>pacify</b> Gauri, Shiva united with her as Ardhanarishvara.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. To make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1775, the British had imposed {{taxes and}} import duties on the American colonies, {{to which the}} {{inhabitants}} objected since they lacked British Parliamentary representation. In response to the Boston Tea Party and other acts of protest, 4,000 British troops {{under the command of}} General Thomas Gage were sent to occupy Boston and <b>to</b> <b>pacify</b> the restive Province of Massachusetts Bay. Parliament authorized Gage, among other actions, to disband the local provincial government (led by John Hancock and Samuel Adams). It was reformed into the Provincial Congress, and continued to meet. The Provincial Congress called for the organization of local militias and coordinated the accumulation of weapons and other military supplies. Under the terms of the Boston Port Act, Gage closed the Boston port, which caused much unemployment and discontent.|$|E

5|$|God of War III {{was first}} {{released}} in North America on March 16, 2010, for the PlayStation 3. Reigniting the Great War, Kratos is soon {{abandoned by the}} Titans, who were only using him to exact their own revenge. Helped by the spirit of Athena who was elevated {{to a new level}} of understanding, she instructs him to seek the Flame of Olympus in order to defeat Zeus. Kratos engages the gods and the Titans in an epic series of battles across the Underworld and Olympus and learns that Pandora's Box is within the Flame. He discovers that Pandora herself is the key <b>to</b> <b>pacifying</b> the Flame and allowing him to open the Box. After finally killing Zeus, he refuses to help Athena assume the role of new patron of mankind and disappears.|$|R
