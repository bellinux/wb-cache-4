40|$|The {{crew members}} on the last seven Apollo flights {{observed}} light flashes that are tentatively attributed to cosmic ray nuclei (atomic number {{equal to or greater}} than 6) penetrating the head and eyes of the observers.

The <b>translunar</b> <b>coast</b> photograph extends from the Mediterranean Sea to Antarctica. This {{was the first time the}} Apollo trajectory made it possible to photograph the south polar ice cap, despite the Southern Hemisphere being heavily covered in clouds. In addition to the Arabian Peninsula and Madagascar, almost the entire coastline of Africa is clearly visible. The Asian mainland is on the horizon.|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} {{experiments}} called the Apollo 17 heat flow and convection (HFC) experiments was conducted, aboard the Apollo 17 spacecraft while in <b>translunar</b> <b>coast</b> {{on the way}} to the moon. These experiments together with the HFC experiments flown on Apollo 14 demonstrated and provided data on two types of low-g natural convection: cellular, surface tension-driven convection and convection in confined fluids caused by spacecraft and astronaut movements. Observed convection onset times show that surface tension-driven convection occurs at lower temperature gradients in low-g than in one-g environments. Data on heat flow in confined fluids show that spacecraft and astronaut movements can cause significant degrees of convection...|$|R
40|$|The Apollo 16 mission {{provided}} {{the opportunity to}} obtain additional data on the characteristics and frequency of the light flashes and also {{provided the}} first opportunity to obtain a direct physical record of incident cosmic ray particles with the Apollo light flash moving emulsion detector (ALFMED). The ALFMED is an electromechanical device that is worn on the head like a helmet and supports cosmic radiation-sensitive emulsions around {{the head of the}} test subject. Two light flash observation sessions were conducted during the mission: one during <b>translunar</b> <b>coast</b> and the second during transearth coast. Characteristics of the light flashes observed and reported by the Apollo crew members were generally similar to those reported on previous missions. Analyses of the ALFMED emulsion plates are proceeding as scheduled, although results are not yet available. The ALFMED results should provide conclusive evidence establishing the correlation, if any, between the incident cosmic ray particles and the perception of light flashes as reported by Apollo crew members...|$|R

40|$|The first crewed mission, Exploration Mission 2 (EM- 2), for the MPCV Orion {{spacecraft}} {{is scheduled}} for August 2021, and its current mission is to orbit the Moon in a highly elliptical lunar orbit for 3 days. A 21 -year scan was performed to identify feasible missions that satisfy the propulsive capabilities of the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) and MPCV Service Module (SM). The mission is divided into 4 phases: (1) a lunar free return trajectory, (2) a hybrid maneuver, during the <b>translunar</b> <b>coast,</b> to lower the approach perilune altitude to 100 km, (3) lunar orbit insertion into a 100 x 10, 000 km orbit, and (4) lunar orbit loiter and Earth return to a splashdown {{off the coast of}} Southern California. Trajectory data was collected for all feasible missions and converted to information that influence different subsystems including propulsion, power, thermal, communications, and mission operations. The complete 21 -year scan data shows seasonal effects that are due to the Earth-Moon geometry and the initial Earth parking orbit. The data and information is also useful to identify mission opportunities around the current planned launch date for EM- 2...|$|R

25|$|Following {{the first}} {{launch of the}} Falcon 9 v1.1 in September 2013, which {{experienced}} a post-mission second-stage engine restart failure, the second-stage igniter propellant lines were insulated to better support in-space restart following long <b>coast</b> <b>phases</b> for orbital trajectory maneuvers.

50|$|The {{fourth stage}} {{is powered by}} twin engines burning {{monomethylhydrazine}} (MMH) and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON). Each engine generates 7.4 kN thrust and is gimbaled (±3°) to provide pitch, yaw & roll control during powered flight. <b>Coast</b> <b>phase</b> attitude control is provided by RCS. The stage carries 2,500 kg of propellant in the PSLV and PSLV-XL and 2,100 kg in the PSLV-CA.|$|R
40|$|Future re-ignitable {{cryogenic}} upper stages per-form long ballistic <b>coasting</b> <b>phases</b> in Earth orbit. During those <b>coasting</b> <b>phases,</b> {{the tanks}} {{are loaded with}} liquid propellants and propellant sloshing occurs due to external disturbances or attitude change maneuvers. The sloshing pro-pellant motion induces reaction forces and tor-ques acting on the space vehicle structure, e. g. rocket upper stages. To keep the upper stage at the desired target attitude, the guidance, naviga-tion, and control (GNC) algorithm commands thruster firings to counter disturbances, some of which come from the fluid forces. At Airbus DS, the Final Phase Simulator FiPS® aims at simu-lating the coupling between fluid mechanics, GNC, and rigid body dynamics. The force pre-dictions of the FiPS® software were validated by linear lateral water sloshing experiments with an accuracy of 8 % for forces. Furthermore, active sloshing damping by closed-loop control was demonstrated within the FiPS simulation envi-ronment and currently preparations are on-going to validate {{the control of the}} sloshing with the watertank mounted on a Hexapod...|$|R

50|$|Attitude {{control was}} {{provided}} by J-2 engine gimballing during powered flight and by the two APS modules during coast. The APS modules each contained four thrusters providing 150 pounds of thrust (three for roll, pitch, and yaw; one for ullage) and were fueled by a hypergolic mixture of dinitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine. They were used for three-axis control during <b>coast</b> <b>phases,</b> roll control during J-2 firings, and ullage for the second ignition of the J-2 engine and deorbit into the moon.|$|R

30|$|Mainly {{two factors}} {{contribute}} to fuel savings and CO 2 -reduction of the hybrid DMU. The first contributor is the additional power of the electric drive which leads to increased tractive effort. Therefore the hybrid DMU accelerates faster which results in longer <b>coast</b> <b>phases</b> where the diesel engine is switched off. This effect is apparent when comparing simulation setups 1, 2 and 3 or 6, 7 and 8. The sooner the hybrid DMU starts coasting, the lower is the resulting fuel consumption compared to the conventional DMU.|$|R
