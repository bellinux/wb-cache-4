40|$|Dynamics of Yamamoto-type poly(p-phenylene) [PPP] was {{investigated}} by differential scanning calorimetry(DSC) and proton solid-state NMR relaxation spectroscopy. The DSC chart shows the baseline jump without latent heat at 295 K, which {{is due to}} <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> transition of <b>the</b> polymer. From the variable temperature proton longitudinal relaxation time(T 1) measurements, relatively short T 1 is observed over the wide temperatures range from 250 K (closed to Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman temperature) to 360 K, inferred the existence of cooperative critical slowing down associated withthe <b>glass</b> transition. <b>The</b> frequency dependence of proton longitudinal relaxation time at 295 K shows R 1 ~ w^- 0. 5 dependence, {{which is due to}} the one-dimensional diffusion-like motion of the backbone conformational modulation. The frequency dependence is held at least up to 360 K. From these experiments, we were able to observe <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> <b>glass</b> transition of <b>the</b> backbone of PPP, of which critical dynamics has a universality class of the three-dimensional XY model.

His head suddenly appeared not babyish but weighty, and you noted his heavy, blunt nose, his straight mouth and thick, long upper lip, his chin overfleshy but strong; with respect you beheld him put on the rest of his uniform as a Solid Citizen.|$|R
5000|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, {{reports that the}} film {{received}} positive reviews by 21% of the 84 surveyed critics. The average rating was 4.2 out of 10, and the consensus is: [...] "Due to obvious plot <b>twists</b> and foreshadowing, <b>The</b> <b>Glass</b> House fails to thrill. By the end, it degenerates into ludicrousness." [...] Roger Ebert rated the film 2 out of 4 stars and criticized the film's script. [...] Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott called it unintentionally funny. [...] Robert Koehler of Variety also called the film unintentionally funny and questioned why so many talented actors signed on to a poor script. [...] Edward Guthmann, of the San Francisco Chronicle, criticized the film's violence and {{the timing of the}} release, which coincided with the September 11 attacks (in fact, for many critics it was the first film they saw after returning to work).

40|$|The {{transfer}} of organic materials from a polyolefin-based film onto glass was studied using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Polyolefin films {{were brought in}} contact with glass and then removed either by peeling or <b>twisting.</b> <b>The</b> polyolefin films include minor additives, the {{transfer of}} which was followed by analysis of <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> side of <b>the</b> interface. In this study, we consider the effects of two different treatments in relation with the migration of the organic additives to <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> ToF-SIMS images are obtained over a large area using macrorastering. These images, and also spectra recorded in discrete areas, show the presence of organics from polyolefin films and, hence, transfer of minor organic components to <b>the</b> <b>glass.</b> Comparison of imaging data between the two different treatments confirms that not only do additives migrate to the surface but also segregate with clear patterns on <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> surface {{as a result of}} one particular treatment. Principle component analysis (PCA) was also carried out on all data and the results obtained show good agreement with the imaging results (ion-selected images). ToF-SIMS and PCA results show that samples produced with treatment 1 exhibit a more organic-like surface on <b>the</b> <b>glass</b> side than samples obtained with treatment 2 which exhibit a more glass-like surface.
