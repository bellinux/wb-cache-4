500|$|Collingwood {{had died}} in 1781 and the only witness of the {{massacre}} to appear at Westminster Hall was passenger Robert Stubbs, although a written affidavit by first mate James Kelsall was made available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers.</b> Stubbs claimed that there was [...] "an absolute Necessity for throwing over the Negroes", because the crew feared all the slaves would die {{if they did not}} throw some into the sea. The insurers argued that Collingwood had made [...] "a Blunder and Mistake" [...] in sailing beyond Jamaica and that the slaves had been killed so their owners could claim compensation. They alleged that Collingwood did this because he did not want his first voyage as a slave ship captain to be unprofitable.|$|E
500|$|The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering was {{published}} in 2000. Here, Finkelstein argues that Elie Wiesel and others exploit {{the memory of the}} Holocaust as an [...] "ideological weapon." [...] The purpose, writes Finkelstein, is to enable the State of Israel, [...] "one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, [...] cast itself as a victim state;" [...] that is, to provide Israel [...] "immunity to criticism." [...] He alleges what he calls a [...] "double shakedown" [...] by [...] "a repellent gang of plutocrats, hoodlums and hucksters" [...] seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from Germany and Switzerland, moneys which then go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> and institutional actors involved in procuring them, rather than actual Holocaust survivors.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the death}} of three detainees, camp {{authorities}} seized prisoners' papers. Described as a security measure, it was claimed that instructions for tying a hangman's noose had been found written on stationery issued <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> who met with detainees to discuss their habeas corpus requests. The Department of Justice acknowledged in court that [...] "privileged attorney-client communications" [...] had been seized. Hicks's lawyer questioned whether Hicks could {{have been part of}} a suicide plot, since he had spent the preceding four months in solitary confinement in {{a different part of the}} camp, and expressed concern that attorney-client confidentiality, [...] "the last legal right that was being respected", had been violated.|$|E

In September 1969, they set up a Trial Research Group, which included law professors, medical researchers (including Masazumi Harada), sociologists and even the housewife and poet Michiko Ishimure to provide useful material <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> to improve their legal arguments. In fact, their report, Corporate Responsibility for Minamata Disease: Chisso's Illegal Acts, published in August 1970, formed the basis of the ultimately successful lawsuit.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Scharf comments: “Chief Justice Clayton {{was profoundly}} {{versed in the}} {{principles}} of the law. He had a marvelous skill in perceiving the vital points of a case, largely due to his almost intuitive grasp of fundamental principles. He was prompt in deciding the merits of an issue and felicitous in the precision with which he formulated facts and conclusions. His words were few but masterly in force and point. Judge Clayton was eminently impartial in his judicial capacity. Neither distinction of the person nor relationships swayed his judgments. With respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> at the Bar, he made no difference in the administration of rules between the eminent John M. Clayton and his own son who was a practitioner at the same bar. He meted out to all the same even-handed justice, and required of all the same respectful regard for the law and for decorum.” ...|$|E

[...] In Sudan he was arrested but never charged. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Lawyers</b> Weekly, [...] "documents reveal that Sudanese officials arrested him at Canada’s request". [...] The People's Commission on Immigration and Security Measures claims that Mr. Abdelrazik was [...] "repeatedly beaten and tortured" [...] in Sudanese custody. In an affidavit this year, he admits to telling his interrogators [...] "what they wanted to hear", {{whether or not it was}} true. [...] He was released in July 2004, having been detained since the previous September. [...] His family bought him an airline ticket to Montreal but the airlines refused to transport him because his name had been place on the US no-fly list. Sudan then forced him to live in a police owned and monitored house. In September, his wife in Montreal divorced him, and the following month Abdelrazik married a Sudanese woman, with whom he had a child the following year. On October 10, 2004, Sudan offered Canada to fly him on a private aircraft if the countries shared the cost. Canada informed Sudan that it would not share the costs or provide an escort. On July 26, 2005, Sudan's Minister of Justice issued Mr. Abdelrazik with a formal document exonerating him. We [...] "did not find any evidence'" [...] linking him to terrorism or crime or al-Qaeda".
