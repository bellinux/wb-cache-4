5|$|The bells {{that draw}} the knights to the Grail {{ceremony}} at Monsalvat in acts 1 and 3 have often proved problematic to stage. For the earlier performances of Parsifal in Bayreuth, Wagner had the Parsifal bell, a piano frame with four strings, constructed {{as a substitute}} for church bells. For the first performances, the bells were combined with <b>tam-tam</b> and gongs. However, the bell was used with the tuba, four tam-tams tuned to the pitch of the four chime notes and another <b>tam-tam</b> on which a roll is executed by using a drumstick. In modern-day performances, the Parsifal bell has been replaced with tubular bells or synthesizers to produce the desired notes. The thunder machine is used in the moment of the destruction of Klingsor's castle.|$|E

5|$|Bonshō have {{occasionally}} {{been used}} as musical instruments in modern compositions. The recorded sound of temple bells was used in Mayuzumi Toshiro's piece Olympic Campanology, used to open the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. A temple bell is also used in performances of Jacob Druckman's piece Lamia, {{in which it is}} rung while placed on top of a kettledrum. Modern composers for percussion have sometimes used the temple bell to replace the now common sound of the orchestral <b>tam-tam.</b>|$|E

25|$|The accompaniment becomes {{gradually}} {{thicker and}} louder until the whole orchestra is {{playing at the}} very end. Just before the end (rehearsal number 18 in the score), there is a sudden change of key to E major, though C major is reestablished after just eight bars. Six bars from the end, the bass drum, cymbals and <b>tam-tam</b> make their first entry, and the trombones play raucous glissandi while the whole orchestra beats out the rhythm that has been played on the snare drum {{from the very first}} bar. Finally, the work descends from a dissonant D-flat chord to a C major chord.|$|E

25|$|The music {{score was}} {{composed}} by Bernard Herrmann in August 1951, and {{was his first}} score after he moved from New York to Hollywood. Herrmann chose unusual instrumentation for the film: violin, cello, and bass (all three electric), two theremin electronic instruments (played by Dr. Samuel Hoffman and Paul Shure), two Hammond organs, a large studio electric organ, three vibraphones, two glockenspiels, marimba, <b>tam-tam,</b> two bass drums, three sets of timpani, two pianos, celesta, two harps, one horn, three trumpets, three trombones, and four tubas. Herrmann's notable advances in film scoring included Unison organs, tubas, piano, and bass drum, staggered tritone movement, and glissando in theremins, as well as exploitation of the dissonance between D and E-flat and experimentation with unusual overdubbing and tape-reversal techniques. By using the theremin Herrmann made one of music's first forays into electronic music, one year before Karlheinz Stockhausen and three years before Edgard Varèse, something that was overlooked by the classical elite.|$|E

500|$|During his {{lifetime}} it was above all {{as a master}} of orchestration that Ravel was famous. He minutely studied the ability of each orchestral instrument to determine its potential, putting its individual colour and timbre to maximum use. The critic Alexis Roland-Manuel wrote, [...] "In reality he is, with Stravinsky, the one {{man in the world}} who best knows the weight of a trombone-note, the harmonics of a 'cello or a pp <b>tam-tam</b> in the relationships of one orchestral group to another." ...|$|E

500|$|Copland's third symphony was {{composed}} between 1944 and September 1946, and was premiered by Serge Koussevitzky conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra on October 18, 1946.

50|$|Spending Sundays in Mount Royal Park {{has been}} popular since {{the park was}} inaugurated in 1876, and the nature and design of Fletcher's Field has always made it a popular spot for picnics and sunbathers.

Moreover, the location of the <b>Tam-Tams</b> isn't too far from where Montreal's first permanent exposition hall, the Crystal Palace, was located.
