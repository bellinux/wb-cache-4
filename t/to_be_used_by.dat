5|$|Bond {{receives}} a spear gun-armed underwater jet pack scuba (allowing the frogman to manoeuvre faster than other frogmen). Designed by Jordan Klein, green dye was meant <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> Bond as a smoke screen to escape pursuers. Instead Ricou Browning, the film's underwater director, {{used it to}} make Bond's arrival more dramatic.|$|E

5|$|Disrupting the attacker's {{perception}} of the target's motion was the main intended purpose of dazzle camouflage as used on ships in the First World War, though its effectiveness is disputed. This type of dazzle does not appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> animals.|$|E

5|$|Smoke screens have {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> attackers and defenders {{as a means}} of sowing confusion and hiding movements. During naval battles in the 18–19th centuries, shots were sometimes fired early so a defensive screen was erected before the ships converged, to spoil the aim of the enemy.|$|E
5|$|The M2A {{was sold}} on <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> various private racers in the United Kingdom before being {{destroyed}} by fire in 1969.

5|$|After the war, Texas {{returned}} to peacetime duty, interrupted by several refits. She became the station ship in Charleston, South Carolina, by 1908 and was renamed San Marcos in 1911 {{to allow her}} name <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> a new battleship. She became a target ship that same year and was sunk in shallow water in Chesapeake Bay. She {{was used as a}} gunnery target through World War II and was finally demolished in 1959 because her remains were considered a navigational hazard.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} plan had been to demolish the old fortifications of Rethymno and move the inhabitants into the Fortezza, it {{was too small to}} house the entire city. The walls along the landward approach to the city were left intact, and the Fortezza became a citadel housing the Venetian administration of the city. It was only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> the inhabitants of the city {{in the case of an}} Ottoman invasion. Over the years, a number of modifications were made to the fortress. Nonetheless, it was never truly secure as it lacked a ditch and outworks, and the ramparts were rather low.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} two-track connection, tracks ST-1 and ST-2, {{is planned}} between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call for it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> regular service, but instead {{to be used for}} non-revenue moves, and to provide a connection to the Jamaica Yard maintenance depot. The connection would allow for trains to run from the Financial District to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Super-Express Bypass was built.|$|E

5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> different types of Fc receptors, expressed on {{different parts of the}} immune system.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of heavy rainfall in Worcestershire in July 2007 the M5 motorway was blocked, leaving many stranded cars on the road. The operations manager of the service station, Quintin Speers provided {{a key role in}} helping those stranded, opening up areas of the main building <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> those stuck on the motorway. Quintin Speers also helped drivers by pushing cars to safety and distributing blankets to those in need.|$|E
5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, sleet locomotives, pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars. Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast motor cars are used to haul ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War of the 1640s, Henry, {{a younger}} {{son in the}} Hastings family, became a Royalist {{commander}} in the Midlands. He based {{himself out of the}} castle until he was forced to surrender it after a long siege. A fresh rebellion occurred in 1648, leading Parliament to slight the castle in order to prevent it being used militarily: the two towers were badly damaged with gunpowder and undermining. Parts of the remaining castle were turned into a new house and continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> members of the Hastings family for many years, although they moved their main residence to Donington Hall.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{something}} unexpected happened: a roadblock {{on the road}} that had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> the brigade had to be dismantled. Zero hour was once more modified and set at midnight. At last, the troops fought battle between 2 am and 5 am but with no benefit of cover. The attackers were rapidly discovered, depriving the Israelis of the surprise effect. The battle started at 4am. The Israeli forces were submitted to a strong fire. The artillery tried to intervene but felt rapidly out of ammunition or was not within range to provide a counter-battery fire.|$|E
5|$|Engadine was {{purchased}} in February 1915 by the Admiralty {{and she was}} modified by Cunard at Liverpool from 10 February to 23 March 1915 with a permanent, four-aircraft, hangar in the rear superstructure {{and a pair of}} cranes were mounted {{at the rear of the}} hangar to hoist the seaplanes in and out of the water. Four quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns, each with 130 rounds, and two Vickers QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns, each with 65 rounds, were fitted for self-defence. She also carried a pigeon loft that housed carrier pigeons <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>by</b> her aircraft if their wireless was broken.|$|E
