5|$|The {{following}} season a {{new ground}} {{was built for}} Hull City {{across the road from}} the cricket ground. Still under the managership of Ambrose Langley, Hull continued to finish consistently in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table. They came close to promotion in the 1909–10 season, recording what would be their highest finish until they matched it in 2008. Hull finished third, level on points with second placed Oldham Athletic, missing promotion on goal average by 0.29 of a goal. Hull regularly finished in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table before the First World War, but after the war the team finished in the bottom half in seven seasons out of eleven, culminating in relegation to the Third Division North in 1930.|$|E

5|$|Having {{finished}} in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2011–12 Scottish Premier League, Hearts {{were involved in the}} battle to qualify for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League competition. A victory against St Johnstone in their penultimate league match lifted Hearts into fifth place, a qualifying position. Hearts then rested some players for their final league match, a 5–0 defeat by Celtic. Entering the week before the cup final, Hearts had concerns about the fitness of striker Craig Beattie, who was unable to train due to a hamstring injury.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 season, West Ham {{remained}} reasonably consistently in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> league table, with Fredrik Ljungberg in the team, {{despite a}} slew of injuries; new signing Craig Bellamy missed most of the campaign, while Kieron Dyer was out from August 2007. The last game of the season, at the Boleyn Ground, saw West Ham draw 2–2 against Aston Villa, ensuring a tenth-place finish three points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It was a five-place improvement on the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation.|$|E
5|$|Napoli {{entered the}} Serie A era under the {{management}} of William Garbutt. During Garbutt's six-year stint, the club would be dramatically transformed, frequently finishing in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> table. This included two third-place finishes during the 1932–33 and 1933–34 seasons, with added notables such as Antonio Vojak, Arnaldo Sentimenti and Carlo Buscaglia. However, in the {{years leading up to}} World War II, Napoli went into decline, only surviving relegation in 1939–40 by goal average.|$|E

Joanne Carter represented Australia in 1998 & 2006. She had placed 12th in 2002 and apart from Liu is the only Australian to have placed in the <b>top</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field.
