500|$|Clinton gave {{testimony}} to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions {{in response to}} the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning {{about whether or not the}} administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, Senator." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican {{associated}} with the Tea Party movement, questioned her repeatedly on a different aspect, whether Ambassador to the UN Rice had misled the public after the attacks. This line drew the fieriest response from Clinton, who with voice raised and fists shaking, responded, [...] "With all due respect, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys {{out for a walk}} one night decided they'd go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and {{do everything we can to}} prevent it from ever happening again, senator." [...] Other Republicans also attacked Clinton, with Representative Jeff Duncan accusing her of [...] "national security malpractice" [...] and Senator Rand Paul saying that the president should have dismissed her from her job for having failed to read security-related cables coming into the State Department (she had said there are over a million cables that come into the department and they are all formally addressed to her). Senator John McCain said that while [...] "It's wonderful to see you in good health and as combative as ever", he was unsatisfied with her answers.|$|E
2500|$|Khazaria {{developed}} a Dual kingship governance structure,clan, identified with Obadiyah, compelled the Qağanal clan to convert, an event which putatively caused the Qabar revolt. Golden comments: [...] "There {{is nothing but}} conjecture to connect it with the reforms of Obadiyah, the further evolution of Khazar Judaism or the Qabars... <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> do not know when, precisely, the Khazar system of dual kingship emerged. It could not have come ex nihilo. It was not present {{in the early stages}} of Khazar history. Given the Old Türk traditions of the Khazar state... and the overall institutional conservation of steppe society, one must exercise great caution here. Clear evidence for it is relatively late (the latter part of the ninth century perhaps and more probably the tenth century)- although it was probably present by the first third of the ninth century. Iranian influences via the Ors guard of the Qağans may have also been a factor" [...] typical among Turkic nomads, consisting of a shad/bäk and a qağan. The emergence of this system may be deeply entwined with the conversion to Judaism. According to Arabic sources, the lesser king was called îšâ and the greater king Khazar xâqân; the former managed and commanded the military, while the greater king's role was primarily sacral, less concerned with daily affairs. The greater king was recruited from the Khazar house of notables (ahl bait ma'rûfīn) and, in an initiation ritual, was nearly strangled until he declared the number of years he wished to reign, on the expiration of which he would be killed by the nobles. The deputy ruler would enter the presence of the reclusive greater king only with great ceremony, approaching him barefoot to prostrate himself in the dust and then light a piece of wood as a purifying fire, while waiting humbly and calmly to be summoned. Particularly elaborate rituals accompanied a royal burial. At one period, travellers had to dismount, bow before the ruler's tomb, and then walk away on foot. Subsequently, the charismatic sovereign's burial place was hidden from view, with a palatial structure ('Paradise') constructed and then hidden under rerouted river water to avoid disturbance by evil spirits and later generations. Such a royal burial ground (qoruq) is typical of inner Asian peoples. Both the îšâ and the xâqân converted to Judaism sometime in the 8th century, while the rest, according to the Persian traveller Ahmad ibn Rustah, probably followed the old Tūrkic religion.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shows what}} a rush our life is," [...] I philosophized, with the {{implication}} that Hasketh and I had been old friends, and I ought to have noticed that I had not met him {{during the time of}} his absence. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> <b>we</b> had never come so near intimacy as when we exchanged confidences concerning the severity of Tedham's sentence in coming out of the court-room together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly. It {{will be in}} {{tomorrow}} morning's papers. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> decided to ask Dr. McTeague to resume his charge." ...|$|R
60|$|John. Is not {{flying to}} save our lives a lawful occasion? And do they not all know that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> true? <b>We</b> cannot <b>be</b> said to dissemble.|$|R
60|$|We wouldn't like it {{talked about}} at home, but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> {{got a bit}} out of breath.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Bingham, I am {{sure that}} you will forgive this scene. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> all slept badly last night, {{and it has not}} {{improved}} our tempers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, H.," [...] said I, [...] "this is not slow. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> {{are going}} ahead. I call this travelling--never was so {{comfortable}} in my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|Amabel {{thought this}} so dogged and provoking, {{that she was}} out of patience; but Guy only laughed, and said, 'Rather so, {{considering}} that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was</b> that <b>we</b> never thought of it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must think," [...] he said, laughing, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> over-particular; but <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> value Clementina rather highly, and <b>we</b> wish to <b>be</b> {{sure that}} your hospitable offer will be for her real good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very queer and eccentric--quite a bear,' was {{the next}} thing they heard; whereat Captain Audley nodded and smiled to Felix. After the general turmoil caused by the change of courses had subsided, that {{penetrating}} voice was heard again. 'Yes, we came home sooner than <b>we</b> had intended. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was,</b> <b>we</b> found that old Mr. Underwood was being beset by some of those relations. You remember? Oh, yes; they have sunk very low--got into trade, absolutely got into trade! One of them a mere common singing-boy. Mr. Underwood is getting aged--quite past- --and {{we did not know}} what advantage might be taken of him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Britt {{looked at}} Morton. [...] "That's the curious thing, isn't it? People are interested. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> all {{secretly}} hope the ghost-story {{may turn out}} to be true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes; and {{not exactly}} that, either. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> {{have all been}} a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Might {{it not be}} advisable, sir,' said Mr Rugg, more coaxingly yet, 'now to make, at {{last and}} after all, a trifling {{concession}} to public opinion? We all do it {{in one way or}} another. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> must do it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I!" [...] Beatrice answered, {{opening her}} eyes. [...] "I have no wishes in <b>the</b> matter. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> poor, and let lodgings--that {{is what it}} comes to. If {{you think they will}} suit you, you are quite right to take them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes. Think of {{all that}} he has had to bear! Well, Mr. Belton, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not so well off as <b>we</b> used to <b>be,</b> and are obliged to live in a very quiet way. You will not mind that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "MY DEAREST FRIENDS," [...] it ran, [...] "Gabriel and I have grieved {{to think}} how {{concerned}} you must be at having neither heard from nor seen us. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> compelled {{to remain in the}} house. And this compulsion is not physical but moral.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And him, too. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> {{have got}} to swallow it all. I was sure that he had married that woman, {{and then of course}} I wanted to get Hester away from him. Now I believe that he never married her, and {{therefore}} we must make the best of him as Hester's husband.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] said Rose, [...] "I {{gave out}} entirely, and came away {{only an hour}} after you did. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> country girls can't stand this sort of thing. I had such a terrible headache, and felt so tired and exhausted, that I got Mr. Endicott to bring me away before the 'German.'" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{went for}} our dinner to the White Hart, the very inn which Shakspeare celebrates in his Merry Wives, {{and had a}} most overflowing, merry time of it. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> had not seen each other {{for so long that}} to be in each other's company for a whole day was quite a stimulant.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here <b>we</b> <b>are,</b> father!" [...] cried a bright, sturdy youth, as he {{ushered in}} his followers. [...] "Of course Elsie has {{prepared}} you for our sudden invasion. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> got up the match {{on the spur}} of the moment, because I found that Ian had a holiday." ...|$|R
60|$|We dress far too heavily. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> that <b>we</b> would <b>be</b> a much {{healthier}} {{people if}} we wore less clothing. Ladies especially wrap themselves up too much, {{with the result}} that their blood does not circulate freely. Coats, ulsters, and other wraps, cause far more colds than they prevent.|$|R
40|$|Posted by Paul Cheshire, SERC and LSE The Guardian {{reports that}} Justine Greening agrees with proponents of Boris Island that Heathrow {{is in the}} wrong place – “if you were {{starting}} from scratch”. But <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not starting from scratch, and this has fundamentally important implications for decisions on airport policy...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bessie," [...] {{said her}} husband, [...] "I {{told you this}} morning that you were amiable as well as bright and beautiful; I now wish to add that you are sensible. I'm awfully ashamed of being gone so long. But <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>we</b> had a little accident. Our sleigh broke down out in the country, {{and we had to}} walk back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But that don't butter no toast {{for my wife}} an' me," [...] he objected. [...] "An' that's what I've been tryin' to get {{the hang}} of, an' now I got it. You talk about theory an' fact. Ten cents higher than top price is a theory to Saxon an' me. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> ain't got no eggs, no {{chickens}}, an' no land for the chickens to run an' lay eggs on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> {{have not}} been {{successful}} of late; no chances have come in our way, and two of our best men have taken their departure--one to gold-digging in California, {{the other to the}} happy hunting grounds of the Redskin, or elsewhere. Luck, in short, seems to have forsaken us. Pious folk," [...] he added, with something of a sneer, [...] "would say, no doubt, that God had forsaken us." ...|$|E
30|$|In {{connection}} with <b>the</b> preceding <b>facts,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{now in a}} position to formulate a localization of Proposition  3 in the following form.|$|R
25|$|Here, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> {{relying on}} sensory evidence, rather than direct experience, is {{conveyed}} by {{our use of}} the word look or seem.|$|R
50|$|The popular {{misconception}} {{was that}} it was a chauvinistic tune, which was anything but <b>the</b> case. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>was,</b> <b>we</b> came from a very strait-laced, conservative, laid-back country, and all of a sudden, there <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in Chicago, Detroit, New York - all these horrendously large places with their big city problems. After that one particularly grinding tour, it was just a real treat to go home and see the girls we had grown up with. Also, the war was going on, and that <b>was</b> terribly unpopular. <b>We</b> didn't have a draft system in Canada, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> grateful for that. A lot of people called it anti-American, but it wasn't really. We weren't anti-anything. John Lennon once said that the meanings of all songs come after they are recorded. Someone else has to interpret them.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> are deplorably in want of {{information}} {{on the subject of the}} Greeks, and in particular their literature; nor is there any probability of our being better acquainted, till our intercourse becomes more intimate, or their independence confirmed. The relations of passing travellers are as little to be depended on as the invectives of angry factors; but till something more can be attained, we must be content with the little to be acquired from similar sources.[240] ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> are all, and always, asleep, {{through our}} lives; {{and it is}} only by {{pinching}} ourselves very hard that we ever come to see, or understand, anything. At least, it is not always we who pinch ourselves; sometimes other people pinch us; which I suppose is very good of them,--or other things, which I suppose is very proper of them. But it is a sad life; made up chiefly of naps and pinches.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you SO much. It is {{a matter}} of my own and Mulledwiney's. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>we</b> have had a PERSONAL difficulty." [...] He paused, glanced around him, and {{continued}} in a low, agitated voice: [...] "Yesterday I came upon him as he was sitting leaning against the barrack wall. In a spirit of playfulness--mere playfulness, I assure you, sir--I poked him lightly in the shoulder with my stick, saying 'Boo!' He turned--and I shall never forget the look he gave me." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> as <b>we</b> {{have since}} <b>been</b> {{informed}} {{by one of}} the parties, it was a mischievous pleasure with some of the partners and clerks, who were young men, to play upon the suspicious temper and splenetic humors of the captain. To this we may ascribe many of their whimsical pranks and absurd propositions, and, above all, their mysterious colloquies in Gaelic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mafuta," [...] replied Tom with a smile, [...] "you're a happy man? <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> that <b>we</b> civilised people lead {{artificial}} lives, {{to a large}} extent, and, therefore, {{require a}} change sometimes to recruit our energies--that is, to put us right again, whereas {{you and your friends}} live in a natural way, and therefore don't require putting right. D'you understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why; he's my cousin,--or rather, my wife's. But <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> Mr. Harding, <b>we</b> {{must get}} hold of the dean as soon as possible; and I'm going to send a gentleman after him." ...|$|R
