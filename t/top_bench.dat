Up to now, E. coli expression system has been widely used as a host to produce rhIGF- 1 with high yields. Batch cultures as non-continuous fermentations were carried out to overproduce rhIGF-I in E. coli. The major objective of this study is over- production of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) through a developed process by recruiting effective factors in order to achieve the most recombinant protein. In this study we investigated the effect of culture medium, induction temperature and amount of inducer on cell growth and IGF- 1 production. Taguchi design of experiments (DOE) method was used as the statistical method. Analysis of experimental data showed that maximum production of rhIGF-I was occurred in 32 y culture medium at 32 °C and 0. 05 Mm IPTG.

40|$|This study {{presents}} recently {{collected data}} examining the organic petrology, palynology, mineralogy and geochemistry of the Gray Hawk coal bed. From the Early Pennsylvanian, Langsettian substage, Gray Hawk coal has been mined near {{the western edge}} of the eastern Kentucky portion of the Central Appalachian coalfield. While the coal is thin, rarely more than 0. 5 -m thick, it has a low-ash yield and a low-S content, making it an important local resource. The Gray Hawk coal palynology is dominated by Lycospora spp., and contains a diverse spectrum of small lycopods, tree ferns, small ferns, calamites, and gymnosperms. The maceral assemblages show an abundance of collotelinite, telinite, vitrodetrinite, fusinite, and semifusinite. Fecal pellet-derived macrinite, albeit with more compaction than is typically seen in younger coals, was observed in the Gray Hawk coal. The minerals in the coal are dominated by clay minerals (e. g., kaolinite, mixed-layer illite/smectite, illite), and to a lesser extent, pyrite, quartz, and iron III hydroxyl-sulfate, along with traces of chlorite, and in some cases, jarosite, szomolnokite, anatase, and calcite. The clay minerals are of authigenic and detrital origins. The occurrence of anatase as cell-fillings also indicates an authigenic origin. With the exception of Ge and As, which are slightly enriched in the coals, the concentrations of other trace elements are either close to or much lower than the averages for world hard coals. Arsenic and Hg are also enriched in the <b>top</b> <b>bench</b> of the coal and probably occur in pyrite. The elemental associations (e. g., Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2, Cr/Th-Sc/Th) indicate a sediment-source region with intermediate and felsic compositions. Rare metals, including Ga, rare earth elements and Ge, are highly enriched in the coal ashes, and the Gray Hawk coals have a great potential for industrial use of these metals. The rare earth elements in the samples are weakly fractionated or are characterized by heavy-REE enrichment, indicating an input of natural waters or probably epithermal solutions...|$|E
40|$|O reconhecido potencial econômico das Spondias (como o umbuzeiro) e o crescente interesse dos mercados internacionais em razão da demanda de frutos com sabores exóticos utilizados no preparo de sucos, doces e sorvetes têm despertado o interesse de pesquisadores e produtores por essa fruteira. Os objetivos do trabalho foram avaliar o desenvolvimento de mudas de umbuzeiro e indicar a melhor idade da muda e do garfo para a realização da enxertia. A semeadura foi realizada em canteiros de madeira de 1, 5 m de largurax 10, 0 m de comprimento x 0, 15 m de altura, contendo areia lavada, sendo as sementes colocadas juntas e alinhadas em fileiras espaçadas de 5, 0 cm uma da outra. Avaliou-se a altura da muda a partir do colo da planta, do número de folhas, do diâmetro do caule a 5, 10 e 15 cm do colo, da matéria fresca e seca da parte aérea e das raízes no dia do transplante e após 60, 120, 180 e 240 dias após o transplantio. Avaliou-se também a sobrevivência das mudas com 180 dias após o transplantio, por meio da enxertia, pelo método de garfagem em fenda cheia ao topo com {{material}} propagativo (garfos) de umbuzeiros de várias procedências e idades. O delineamento utilizado foi o inteiramente casualizado, e as repetições foram compostas por seis plantas por parcela. Conclui-se que, a partir de seis meses depois da repicagem, as mudas do umbuzeiro podem ser enxertadas pelo método de garfagem em fenda cheia ao topo. Houve uma sobrevivência de 80 % das mudas enxertadas, estando estas prontas para o plantio em campo depois de dois meses após a enxertia. O índice de pegamento diminuiu de forma gradual ao serem usados garfos oriundos de plantas com idade acima de seis anos. The economic {{importance of}} Spondias umbuzeiro has been increased in international market {{due to its}} exotic flavor {{and the ability to}} be used in juices, ice creams and other food preparation. For this reason, the knowledge of many aspects of this species is has been investigated by many researchers and also attracted the farmers interest. The aim of this research was to evaluate the development of umbu seedlings and to indicate the best stage of the seedling and also the more appropriate stage of the fork for grafting. Seeds were sown in wood beds with 1. 5 m wide 10. 0 m long 0. 15 m high, washed sand, and placed together and aligned in rows spaced 5. 0 cm apart. The following characteristics were evaluated: seedling size, leaves number, stem diameter at 5, 10 and 15 cm from the soil, canopy and root fresh weight in the transplant date and also after 60, 120, 180 and 240 days after transplanting. The grafting technique studied consisted in a <b>top</b> <b>bench</b> grafting with seedlings from different origins and development stages. The efficiency of grafting technique was evaluated after 180 days after transplanting by observing the surviving plants. The experiments were carried out in a completely casualized design and the replicates made up of six plants per plot. It was concluded that from six months after transplanting the umbuzeiro seedlings can be grafted by using top cleft grafting. The efficiency of grafting technique reached 80 % of all genotypes tested. The same results were observed considering plants after two months when the plants were already planting in a definitive place. The survival index decreased gradually when forks from plants older than six years were used...|$|E
