5|$|The {{division}} {{arrived in}} the European Theater of Operations in early February, coming {{under the command of}} the First Allied Airborne Army, and Major General Chapman was informed that there was a possibility that the division would be required to conduct airborne operations during the closing stages of the Battle of the Bulge. However, the campaign in the Ardennes ended before the division could be transported there. The next chance for the 13th to participate in an airborne operation, and <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> combat, was in March 1945 when the Allies had penetrated into Germany itself and reached the River Rhine. A few weeks before the division was to participate in a combat jump over the Rhine it was reorganized, after a conference by the War Department had decided that a more efficient composition for an airborne division was two Parachute Infantry Regiments and only a single Glider Infantry Regiment. Subsequently, the 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment, a veteran unit that had served in Italy, Southern France and the Ardennes, joined the division in early March, and the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment was combined into the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment that remained as the division's sole glider-based element. The 517th had recently fought during the Ardennes campaign, and had received a Presidential Unit Citation for its actions.|$|E

This was the first team that African Americans contributed as members of the Alabama varsity squad, with John Mitchell being the first <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> playing time. 1971 also marked the first season the Crimson Tide utilized the wishbone offense that Alabama became noted for throughout the remainder of Bryant's tenure as head coach at Alabama.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction {{of the sun and}} moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the crescent.|$|E

25|$|Easterly {{believes}} that aid goals should be small. In his opinion, {{one of the}} main failings of aid {{lies in the fact that}} we create large, utopian lists of things we hope to accomplish, without the means <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> them to fruition. Rather than establish a utopian vision for a particular country, Easterly insists that we shift our focus to the most basic needs and improvements. If we feed, clothe, vaccinate, build infrastructure, and support markets, the macroscopic results will follow.|$|E
25|$|Until then, all {{results from}} the solar radio-spectrographs had been {{inferred}} from studying the Sun by looking at its spectrum with only very limited angular resolution. Wild wanted <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> what these phenomena looked like on the Sun, actually get a moving picture of them. The frequency range that {{we were interested in}} was around about the metre wavelengths. To get the resolution roughly equivalent to that of the human eye at these long wavelengths required an aperture some three kilometres in diameter. So I devised a method of synthesising a three kilometre aperture with 96 antennas in a ring.|$|E

500|$|Thulium was so {{rare that}} none of the early workers had enough of it to purify {{sufficiently}} <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the green color; they had to be content with spectroscopically observing the strengthening of the two characteristic absorption bands, as erbium was progressively removed. [...] The first researcher to obtain nearly pure thulium was Charles James, a British expatriate working on a large scale at New Hampshire College in Durham. In 1911 he reported his results, having used his discovered method of bromate fractional crystallization to do the purification. [...] He famously needed 15,000 purification operations to establish that the material was homogeneous.|$|E
500|$|Antonia Coffman, a {{spokeswoman}} for The Simpsons, told The Charlotte Observer that [...] "the Lowe's incident didn't inspire the scene" [...] and that the episode {{was not meant to}} offend anyone. After WCCB had gotten the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the episode they decided that they would air it, realizing that the original commercial was misleading and that they did not think the episode was making fun of the incident. In the episode, the viewers can see that Lenny tries {{to get the attention of}} the cheerleaders by raising his hand so that they aim a T-shirt with the cannon at him. However, he is hit by a car tire instead. Unlike what the commercial implied, Lenny is not killed and is soon back in his seat. WCCB told the Associated Press that their interpretation of the scene was that someone threw the tire to Lenny because he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not actually come from a car crash on the track. Despite this, the affiliate announced that they would start the broadcast of the episode with a message warning viewers of the scene anyway.|$|E
2500|$|The largest building, the Isabelle R. Martin House, {{is perhaps}} most {{remarkable}} for its two stone veneered sections framing a central pavilion-like center of transparent glass walls, allowing visitors <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> through the building itself to the lake beyond, revolutionary for a 1926 design. [...] It also features spacious cantilevered balconies, expansive terraces, and “ribbons” of windows that allow the experience of nature from within and through the house.

50|$|The {{police also}} {{investigated}} reports from local aboriginals that Martin had murdered an aboriginal teenager who {{he had had}} an altercation with. Sometime after the boy’s suspicious disappearance, a group of aboriginal people were bathing in a deep water hole near Salt Creek. They found the boy’s body in a bag, weighted down by a large stone. This incident occurred sometime in late 1859 or early 1860, but the police were unable to find any witnesses who would admit <b>to</b> having <b>actually</b> <b>seen</b> the body, only people {{who claimed to have}} heard the story from others.|$|R
5000|$|The fictional {{origin of}} the story is {{sometimes}} forgotten or ignored even in modern publications. For instance, Daniel Cohen in his Encyclopedia of Ghosts (1994) presents the story as an actual report of a supernatural phenomenon, confounding Austin with his fictional first-person narrator: [...] "A complete version of this story is said to come in a letter from a man named William Austin, who claimed <b>to</b> have <b>actually</b> <b>seen</b> and spoken with the ghost.

2500|$|Evans officially {{began working}} on American Bibliography - his lifelong goal - in 1901 and {{compiled}} it over a course of years through 1934. [...] Originally, Evans stored his notecards in corset boxes with the dates contained within written on the illustration's waistline. Publication took a few hiatuses during WWII in between volumes, but eventually, all desired volumes were published, including some that were published posthumously by outsiders eager to continue Evans' work, particularly Roger Bristol. The first volume was published by Evans himself and covered the span of 1639-1740. [...] All succeeding volumes were published on borrowed money for both publication purposes and travel purposes, as Evans preferred to travel around the United States in order <b>to</b> <b>actually</b> <b>see</b> the books he was including in his work, though when he wasn’t able to travel, {{he was known to}} include “ghost” titles, as well as skip publications altogether due to the amount of space, and therefore money, they would take up in his printed book.

Karl warns him off of trying the ritual for a man's obsession with the occult could lead to danger.|$|R
5000|$|Michelis' {{work also}} {{may be said to}} present us with the {{definitive}} Russian language edition of the complete restored text. The question remains {{as to whether or not}} the alleged original French language edition of the late nineteenth century ever existed. Michelis shows that the [...] "French original" [...] is an extremely shadowy and mysterious document; its existence is supposed by almost everyone, and some claim it is still extant, but very few claim <b>to</b> have <b>actually</b> <b>seen</b> it. Carlo Ginzburg, while acknowledging this, points to extensive circumstantial evidence that there were individuals in France who may have wished to produce such a document and had Joly's source text.|$|R
