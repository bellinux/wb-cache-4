5|$|Day {{continued}} {{to take on}} challenging and difficult projects. He had already printed the first English book of church music in 1560. In 1567, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned Day to print a collection of writings attributed to the tenth-century Aelfric of Eynsham. For this work, Day, known for his fine and varied fonts, had the first-ever font of Anglo-Saxon type cut. The cost was borne by Parker, perhaps Day's most important patron. The font may have been designed by François Guyot, a French <b>type-founder</b> known to have worked for Day and lived in his household. Day used the same font to print Lambarde's Archaionomia (a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws) in 1568. In 1570, he printed Billingsley and Dee's English Euclid, which included folding and movable diagrams—one of the first printed books ever to do so. In the same year, he printed Ascham's Scholemaster.|$|E

Late in his life, Johnson, along with other leading <b>type-founders</b> of Philadelphia successfully petitioned Congress to modify copyright law to extend protection to letter-cutters, engravers, and originators of designs. In 1886, the Type Founders Association of the United States chose the dimensions of the Johnson Pica, named after Lawrence Johnson, as the official standard for the pica.|$|R

The Steeles were a prosperous Lancaster family; William, his father, and his brothers all served with distinction in the American Revolution.

Lydia Bailey’s mother, Elizabeth Steele, was herself born a Bailey, the sister of the prominent Revolutionary-era printers, Jacob and Francis Bailey.

5000|$|In 1844, the Johnson Type Foundry {{published}} the first extensive specimen book in an octavo volume of about four hundred pages. This specimen book far exceeded any others {{of that time}} in quality and extent, having [...] "no superior {{in the world of}} typography". Specimen books showed the numerous varieties of types made in a foundry, but the originality of the type and presentation in the Johnson Foundry book attracted the attention of printers everywhere, and other foundries soon followed suit by increasing the size of their publications. In 1849, the Johnson Foundry issued the first quarto specimen book ever published. In this edition, the letters and type, for the first time, were presented in full words and phrases increasing the appeal of the presentation. This innovation was soon adopted by many of the <b>type-founders</b> in the United States. The firm continued to produce new and unique specimen books well after Johnson's death. In 1855, L. Johnson & Company began the Typographic Advertiser, the first printer's paper devoted to printing and typography in the United States, and a means to show new productions of the Johnson Foundry.|$|R
2500|$|In 1827, a Greek scholar Julian Hibbert {{printed with}} his own {{experimental}} uncial Greek types, remarking that the types of Giambattista Bodoni's Callimachus were [...] "ornamented (or rather disfigured) by additions of what [...] believe <b>type-founders</b> call syrifs or cerefs". The printer Thomas Curson Hansard referred to them as [...] "ceriphs" [...] in 1825. The oldest citations in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) are 1830 for serif and 1841 for sans serif. The OED speculates that serif was a back-formation from sanserif. [...] Webster's Third New International Dictionary traces serif to the Dutch noun schreef, meaning [...] "line, stroke of the pen", related to the verb schrappen, [...] "to delete, strike through". Schreef now also means [...] "serif" [...] in Dutch. (The relation between [...] "schreef" [...] and [...] "schrappen" [...] is documented by Van Veen and Van der Sijs in Etymologisch Woordenboek (Van Dale, 1997). Yet, [...] "schreef" [...] literally is past-tense of [...] "schrijven" [...] (to write). In her Chronologisch Woordenboek (Veen, 2001), Van der Sijs lists words by first known publication in the language area that is The Netherlands today. Van der Sijs: schrijven, 1100; schreef, 1350; schrappen, 1406. I.e. [...] "schreef" [...] is from [...] "schrijven" [...] (to write), not from [...] "schrappen" [...] (to scratch, eliminate by strike-through).) ...|$|R

50|$|There is some {{confusion}} about Jacquard’s early work history. British economist Sir John Bowring met Jacquard, who told Bowring {{that at one}} time he had been a maker of straw hats. Eymard claimed that before becoming involved in the weaving of silk, Jacquard was a <b>type-founder</b> (a maker of printers’ type), a soldier, a bleacher (blanchisseur) of straw hats, and a lime burner (a maker of lime for mortar). Barlow claims that before marrying, Jacquard had worked for a bookbinder, a <b>type-founder,</b> and a maker of cutlery. After marrying, Jacquard tried cutlery making, type-founding, and weaving. However, Barlow does not cite any sources for that information. Ballot stated that Jacquard initially helped his father operate his loom, but the work proved too arduous, so Jacquard was placed first with a bookbinder and then with a maker of printers' type.|$|E

5000|$|Ernst Frederic Detterer (1888, Lake Mills, Wisconsin [...] - [...] 1947, Chicago) was an American calligrapher, teacher, and typographer. He {{studied at}} Moravian College and the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art {{where he took}} classes in {{lettering}} taught by Edward Johnston. From 1912 - 21 he taught wood-cut art, calligraphy and typography at Chicago Normal School. From 1921 - 31 he taught the history of printing at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The design department of the Ludlow Typograph Company commissioned him to design a Venetian type-face (i.e. one based on the designs of Venetian <b>type-founder</b> Nicolas Jenson), and his Nicolas Jenson was the result. [...] Detterer's former student, R. Hunter Middleton, later expanded Nicolas Jenson into a complete type family. First cast in 1923, Nicolas Jenson was reintroduced in 1941 as Eusebius. [...] At {{the time of his}} death, Detterer was employed as the custodian of the John M. Wing Collection on the History of Printing at the Newberry Library in Chicago.|$|E
5000|$|After {{returning}} to the Balkans, Theodosius was appointed a priest in [...] "St. Minas" [...] church in Solun (Thesaloniki) in 1831. While in Solun, he established the firsts printing house in Bulgarian (language) in 1838. Theodosius used the movable type printing press of Daskal Kamche from Vatasha. The moveable types of the press were crafted by a Russian immigrant <b>type-founder.</b> The first books, typed in Teodosius's printing house, were [...] "Primary study through Slavonic-Bulgarian and Greek Orthodox morning prayers" [...] („Началное учение с молитви утренния славяноболгарский и греческия“) and [...] "Jewish ceremony {{and all of the}} harms, they've done" [...] - an anti-Semitic lampoon, which was initially translated [...] "to simple and plain Bulgarian language" [...] by Nathanael Ohridski. In 1839 Teodosius typed his own [...] "A Brief description of twenty monasteries that are situated in the Holly Mount Athos".In 1839 Teodosius' printing-house was burned down, but it was soon restored with the finansical support of Kiril Peychinovich. Peychinovich's book Utesheniе Greshnim ("Solace of the sinner") was typed in the restored printing-house in 1840. Teodosius wrote an introduction to the book, where he mentioned that the book was written by Kiril Peychinovich into [...] "...the plainest Bulgarian language, spoken in Lower Moesia, and the region of Skopie and Tetovo...". There Teodosius also praised the Bulgarian language and compared it to a key, which can unlock the heart of the Bulgarian nation for the light of the truth.|$|E
