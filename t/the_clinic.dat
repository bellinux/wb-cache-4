40|$|At Rowan University, {{design has}} been infused into the {{curriculum}} through an eight-semester course sequence called <b>the</b> Engineering <b>Clinics.</b> Through this experience, students learn the art and science of design in a multidisciplinary team environment and hone their design skills throughout their 4 -year career. This paper describes the objectives of <b>the</b> <b>clinics,</b> types of projects, and how <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> complement traditional core courses in the curriculum. Impacts and benefits of <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> on students and faculty are discussed, including retention and graduate study rates comparing Rowan University mechanical engineering students to their peers nationally. An assessment of <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> is presented based on survey data and accreditation objectives and outcomes. Survey data from students were assessed to determine levels of students 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction and confidence based on <b>the</b> <b>clinics.</b> Results of alumni and employer surveys also provide valuable feedback for assessing and improving <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> as well as confirmation of <b>the</b> impact of <b>clinics</b> after graduation. Survey data are discussed along with challenges of <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> at Rowan and adaptability of them at other institutions. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>clinics</b> are a positive and integrated design experience in the curriculum and assist students in achieving the program objectives...|$|R

5|$|During Sanger's 1916 {{speaking}} tour, she promoted {{birth control}} clinics {{based on the}} Dutch model she had observed during her 1914 trip to Europe.

On October 16, 1916, she opened the Brownsville clinic in Brooklyn; it was an immediate success, with over 100 women visiting on the first day.Engelman, p. 79–80.

The effect of CM on the longest duration of continuous stimulant abstinence (LDA) varied by a factor of 8. 0 across <b>the</b> <b>clinics,</b> ranging from an additional 0. 5 to an additional 4. 0 weeks.
