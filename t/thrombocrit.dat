40|$|Platelet factor 4 (PF 4) is a {{negative}} regulator of megakaryopoiesis in vitro. We have now examined whether PF 4 regulates megakaryopoiesis in vivo by studying PF 4 knockout mice and transgenic mice that overexpress human (h) PF 4. Steady-state platelet count and <b>thrombocrit</b> in these animals was inversely related to platelet PF 4 content. Growth of megakaryocyte colonies was also inversely related to platelet PF 4 content. Function-blocking anti-PF 4 antibody reversed this inhibition of megakaryocyte colony growth, indicating the importance of local PF 4 released from developing megakaryocytes. The effect of megakaryocyte damage and release of PF 4 on 5 -fluorouracil–induced marrow failure was then examined. Severity of thrombocytopenia and time to recovery of platelet counts {{were inversely related to}} initial PF 4 content. Recovery was faster and more extensive, especially in PF 4 -overexpressing mice, after treatment with anti-PF 4 blocking antibodies, suggesting a means to limit the duration of such a chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, especially in individuals with high endogenous levels of PF 4. We found that approximately 8 % of 250 healthy adults have elevated (> 2 times average) platelet PF 4 content. These individuals with high levels of platelet PF 4 may be especially sensitive to developing thrombocytopenia after bone marrow injury and may benefit from approaches that block the effects of released PF 4...|$|E
40|$|O estudo teve como objetivo identificar os efeitos do tempo de estocagem, da temperatura de armazenamento e da quantidade de anticoagulante sobre parâmetros hematológicos de cães. Foram utilizadas amostras do sangue de dez cães de raças variadas, clinicamente hígidos. As alíquotas foram colhidas com 1, 8 mg; 3, 6 mg; 7, 2 mg e 14, 4 mg de ácido etilenodiaminotetracético (EDTA) por mL de sangue, distribuídas em dois grupos: de 2 °C a 8 °C e temperatura ambiente. Após a coleta, foram avaliadas em quatro tempos: 0, 12, 24 e 48 horas. Usando um contador automático de células, foram avaliados leucócitos, eritrócitos, hemoglobina, hematócrito, volume corpuscular médio (VCM), índice de anisocitose eritrocitária (RDW), plaquetas e plaquetócrito (PCT). O valor do VCM diminuiu nas maiores concentrações de EDTA (7, 2 mg mL- 1 e 14, 4 mg mL- 1), com decréscimo de 2, 36 % na maior concentração. A temperatura e o tempo de armazenagem também ocasionaram alteração nesse parâmetro, ou seja, houve decréscimo no tempo 12 horas à temperatura de 2 a 8 °C e aumento nos tempos 24 e 48 horas à temperatura ambiente (P The study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the effects of time, temperature of storage and excess of anticoagulant on hematological parameters of dogs. Blood samples of ten, clinically healthy dogs, of different breeds were utilized. Aliquots were stored with 1. 8 mg, 3. 6 mg, 7. 2 mg and 14. 4 mg of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) per mL of blood, divided into two groups: 2 °C to 8 °C and room temperature. Right after collection, they were evaluated in four times: 0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h. White blood cells, red blood cells, hemoglobin, packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), platelet and <b>thrombocrit</b> (PCT) were evaluated in the automatic cell counter. In the automatic cell counter analysis, the MCV increased significantly with higher concentrations of EDTA (7. 2 mg mL- 1 and 14. 4 mg mL- 1) peaking at 2. 36 %, in the highest concentration. Temperature and time also influenced the MCV, which showed a decrease in time 12 under temperature of 2 °C to 8 °C {{and an increase in}} time 24 and 48 at room temperature. Storage temperature influenced leukocytes and erythrocytes counts, which showed lower values at room temperature. Hemoglobin, PCV, platelet and PCT did not change significantly. The changes observed did not compromise the results obtained by automatic cell counter, showing that blood samples stored for two days remained in good condition for processing, especially when stored under refrigeration...|$|E
