5|$|In Bishop, {{intensity}} VI effects included {{broken windows}} and cracked walls in commercial and government buildings. Items fell from store shelves at grocery markets, streets were cracked, and wells had {{changes in the}} flow of water. The damage to the mobile homes in Chalfant was also consistent with intensity VI shaking, with some of the homes moving laterally as much as 18 inches. Also in this classification was damage <b>to</b> <b>pipe</b> supports along a portion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct between the Upper, Middle, and Control Gorge Power Plants southeast of Crowley Lake. Intensity V (Moderate) effects (including cracked windows and broken underground pipes) were present in the Central Valley, Death Valley, and Carson City, Nevada.|$|E
5|$|The game {{provides}} {{several options}} for players to face challenges. In addition to direct combat, the player can use plasmids to lure enemies into traps or to turn enemies against each other, or employ stealth tactics to avoid detection by hostiles including the security systems and turrets. The player can hack {{into any of}} Rapture's automated systems; the hacking process is done via a mini-game similar <b>to</b> <b>Pipe</b> Mania where the player must connect two points {{on opposite sides of}} a grid with a limited set of piping within a fixed amount of time, with failure to complete in time costing health and potentially sounding alarms. Early in the game, the player is given a research camera; by taking photographs of enemies, the player will cumulatively gain knowledge about the individual foes which translates into attack boosts and other benefits when facing that enemy type in the future.|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century, {{natural gas}} was usually {{obtained}} as {{a by-product of}} producing oil, since the small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the reservoir to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide effervesces. Unwanted natural gas was a disposal problem in the active oil fields. If {{there was not a}} market for natural gas near the wellhead it was prohibitively expensive <b>to</b> <b>pipe</b> to the end user.|$|E
25|$|Qatar has {{maintained}} cordial relations with Iran.

However, Qatar maintains security cooperation with Iran through bilateral ties. Additionally, plans were being formulated in 1992 <b>to</b> <b>pipe</b> water from the Karun River in Iran to Qatar, but after local resistance in Iran this was laid to rest.|$|E
25|$|This {{same year}} Simpson began {{his tenure as}} {{a faculty member at}} the University of Chicago as a physics instructor, and {{remained}} there throughout his career partaking in research as well until shortly before his death in August 2000. In 1945 also he was able to work as an unofficial adviser to Connecticut Senator Brien McMahon after taking a leave of absence from the university. As part of the university faculty, Simpson was able to invent and patent a gas flow a-particle proportional counter for measuring plutonium yields in the presence of high intensity fission products.

25|$|Henry Weinhard {{purchased}} {{an existing}} brewery on this site, the City Brewery, in 1864. He then moved his operations to the then-two block site on West Burnside Street. Business boomed, and between 1865 and 1872 two additional {{blocks to the}} north were purchased. As many breweries also owned the saloons that sold their beer at the time, a large business empire owning properties throughout the Northwest, from San Francisco to Canada was run from here. Weinhard's brewing business continued to expand {{to the point where}} he even offered <b>to</b> <b>pipe</b> beer directly to the Skidmore Fountain. This offer was declined by civic leaders. By 1890, the brewery produced 100,000 barrels of beer annually.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{engagement}} Graham commissioned William Hogarth to paint as a conversation picture a cabin portrait {{to celebrate his}} victory, probably using the cabin of the Nottingham as a setting. Hogarth painted Graham smoking his pipe in his cabin before dinner, while listening <b>to</b> <b>pipe</b> and tabor music played by his black servant, while his chaplain and clerk sing. Two dogs are visible, one is Graham's own, which joins in the singing. The other is Trump, Hogarth's dog, which is shown wearing Graham's wig, holding a scroll, and reading from a sheet of music propped against a wine glass. A steward, holding a plate of fowl, looks out of the painting at the viewer with a smile, and drops gravy {{down the back of}} the chaplain's neck. The painting has several political and social allusions in Hogarth's satirical style. Cabin scenes in oil are rare, and Hogarth's is considered by the current owner, the National Maritime Museum, to be the most famous in British art.|$|E
25|$|A {{man named}} Baker Pierce, {{who died in}} 1815, and whose remains were buried in the old pioneer {{graveyard}} at Osceola, {{appears to have been}} the first settler within the boundaries of Elkland borough. Just when he settled or how long he remained cannot now be ascertained, but it must have been during the earlier years of {{the first decade of the}} present century. The next to settle was the Taylor family, who located at Barney Hill. The family consisted of Mrs. Permelia Taylor and her three sons, Ebenezer, Philip and Mitchell, who emigrated from the Delaware Water Gap, New Jersey, to the Wyoming valley, thence <b>to</b> <b>Pipe</b> Creek, below Owego, from which place, in 1806, they came to the Cowanesque valley. Ebenezer and Philip soon afterward removed to Osceola. The latter, his mother and his brother, Mitchell, all died before 1815, and were buried at Barney Hill. In 1882, their resting place being disturbed by the building of the Addison and Pennsylvania railroad, Capt. Charles R. Taylor and Charles Tubbs—descendants in the fourth generation of Mrs. Permelia Taylor—removed their remains to the cemetery at Osceola.|$|E

25|$|Finally on 28 November 1944, {{an accord}} was signed between the US and Portuguese governments, that envisioned its {{use as a}} {{waypoint}} for planes travelling to the Pacific theatre of operations, or those {{that needed to be}} diverted due to weather conditions. This was followed on 14 December 1944 by a similar accord between Pan American Airways and the Portuguese government, resulting in the installation of new radio equipment. Work on the passenger terminal and support buildings had already progressed, along with runways 2 and 3 and the parking area. At this time there were 3000 workers onsite: 2000 American, 600 Micaleanse and 400 Marienses, a number that continued to grow over time (eventually reaching 3000 Americans and 1000 Azoreans). Meanwhile, the port was expanded to receive battalions with the equipment necessary to improve the infrastructures and to construct a network <b>to</b> <b>pipe</b> aviation fuel to the plateau. These included: airport infrastructures; roadways; water supply and sewage; residences; and social spaces (such as hotel, gymnasium, church, a cinema/theatre to hold 1000 people, and a hospital in the area of Santana, to evacuate the injured in the European theatre).|$|E

Rózsa researched Greek and Roman music, incorporating this work into his score for authenticity. Rózsa himself directed the 100-piece MGM Symphony Orchestra during the 12 recording sessions (which stretched over 72 hours). The soundtrack was recorded in six-channel stereo. More than three hours of music were composed for the film, and two-and-a-half hours of it were finally used, making it (...) the longest score ever composed for a motion picture. The score contains no leitmotifs for the main characters. While not a leitmotif, the score does transition from full orchestra <b>to</b> <b>pipe</b> organ whenever Jesus Christ appears.|$|E

50|$|Of Nairobi's 3.14 million {{inhabitants}} at night, {{a number that}} swells to about 5 million during the day, only about 50 per cent have direct access <b>to</b> <b>piped</b> water.

5000|$|During {{its first}} five years the company brought 24 hours service to all the city and served an {{additional}} 55,000 families, mostly low income {{in the southern part}} of the city. Access to water supply increased from 64 percent in 2000 to 72 percent in 2003, and access to sewerage has grown from 46 percent to 55 percent during the same period. According to an article written by Interagua for public relations all the [...] "formally developed areas" [...] of the city had access <b>to</b> <b>piped</b> water at [...] "reasonable pressure" [...] in 2012.

In 10 years access <b>to</b> <b>piped</b> water supply thus increased from 64 to 82 percent. Customers who gained access <b>to</b> <b>piped</b> water supply were able to consume twice as much water while paying one fifth of what they paid before, when they had bought it from vendors distributing it in tankers. Tankers charged US$ 3.50 per cubic meter, while Interagua charges only 34 cents per cubic meter for the first 15 cubic meters per month.|$|R
