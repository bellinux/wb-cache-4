5|$|While Aeron {{is within}} the Towers, a <b>time</b> <b>counter</b> is displayed, showing the {{advancement}} of Elena's curse. As Aeron defeats both normal enemies and the Masters of each Tower, he gathers flesh from them which he must give to Elena to eat and reverse the curse's effects, resetting the timer: the amount of reversion {{is dependent on the}} quality of flesh, which deteriorates over time after being extracted. Elena's state is also tied to the Affinity gauge; giving her flesh, talking with her, giving her gifts and asking her to help with tasks raise the meter, but delaying reverting Elena's transformation causes it to decrease. The strength of Aeron's relationship with Elena directly impacts the game's ending. Items and equipment are created and stored in the Observatory, with Mavda using materials brought back from the Towers to create new equipment for Aeron. She can also repair equipment that has been damaged in combat while equipped to Aeron, and upgrade existing weapons and equipment with new materials. If the time limit is exceeded and Elena completes her transformation, or Aeron falls in battle, the game ends and restarts from the last active save.|$|E

For the rest of the war, this became a regular routine, with both attacking and defending infantry in a land battle being constantly liable to attack by machine guns and light bombs from the air.

2500|$|Adolphus better {{deserved}} the credit of introducing a standard caliber light muskets to his infantry forces, replacing the previous mix of arquebus and heavy musket common in Imperial tercios. [...] The shallower infantry {{formation of the}} Swedish brigade, much more conducive to massed firepower, {{was inspired by the}} work of Maurice. [...] However Adolphus perfected the system and introduced the use of salvo fire, where two or three ranks of musketeers fired simultaneously, usually at point blank range, rather than one rank at a <b>time</b> <b>counter</b> marching as was common in that era. [...] Delivered at point-blank range, and immediately followed up by a charge with swords, and pikes, a salvo became the infantry's most feared tactic because it was much more effective at breaking the enemy's morale and repulsing cavalry charges than the earlier method.|$|E

50|$|As Jack, players {{make their}} way through eight worlds, battling hostile alien creatures and leaping over {{bottomless}} canyons. Each world is divided into different quadrants, and the player must pass through each quadrant before the <b>time</b> <b>counter</b> {{on the bottom of}} the game screen reaches zero. In each quadrant, the player can find pillar-like columns that house power-ups, objects that are beneficial or add extra abilities to the game character. At the end of each world's last quadrant is a serpent-like creature which must be defeated to advance. A status bar at the bottom of the screen displays the player's score, the <b>time</b> <b>counter,</b> the world number, the world quadrant, the number of bonus stars (items that increase the player's score count) collected by the player, and the number of lives remaining.|$|E

50|$|An early {{concern was}} related to time and {{frequency}} measurement instruments which had a dead time between measurements. Such a series of measurements did not form a continuous observation of the signal and thus introduced a systematic bias into the measurement. Great care was spent in estimating these biases. The introduction of zero dead <b>time</b> <b>counters</b> removed the need, but the bias analysis tools have proved useful.|$|R

After his resignation as CENTCOM commander, he retired from military service.|$|R
50|$|Time {{points are}} {{collected}} via shooting down when playing as a human, or from grazing bullets when playing as yōkai. If the player loses a life, some time points are deducted.

50|$|The {{single pixel}} {{consists}} of a photo sensitive element (e.g. a photo diode). It converts the incoming light into a current. In analog timing imagers, connected to the photo diode are fast switches, which direct the current {{to one of two}} (or several) memory elements (e.g. a capacitor) that act as summation elements. In digital timing imagers, a <b>time</b> <b>counter,</b> that can be running at several gigahertz, is connected to each photodetector pixel and stops counting when light is sensed.|$|E
5000|$|Every stage has a <b>time</b> <b>counter,</b> which, {{despite what}} the name might imply, {{requires}} the player to collect {{a certain amount of}} [...] "time points". If the player fails to collect the required amount {{by the end of the}} stage, the clock, which tracks the frozen time in Gensokyo, shifts one hour ahead. Otherwise, the clock only advances half an hour. The clock starts at PM 11:00; if the player ever reaches AM 5:00 in-game, the player is given a bad ending. Having to continue also advances the clock by half an hour.|$|E
