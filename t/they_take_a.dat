After being told by Frazier to remain where he is, Chakotay breaks {{out of his room}} where he sees that all the people around him on the alien planet possess Borg implant technology in their bodies.

Chakotay's health gets worse, and the ex-Borg offer to connect him to a joint mind to heal his injuries, and he reluctantly accepts. Once part of the hive mind, he sees a montage of their memories.

5|$|Leaving Cirencester in July 1920, Hammond {{planned to}} go to Winchester Agricultural College, {{following}} the path into farming mapped out by his mother. However, his plans changed when his headmaster wrote to the captain of Gloucestershire, Foster Robinson, reporting Hammond's school cricket record and suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> look at him. Hammond, who scored a century in his first appearance in adult cricket days after leaving school, played in a trial match for the Gloucestershire Club and Ground, scoring 60 runs, taking two wickets and impressing the local press. Subsequently, two members of Gloucestershire's committee visited Hammond's mother {{in an attempt to}} sign him for the club. Hammond's mother was initially reluctant, but his eagerness finally convinced her and he signed a professional contract.|$|E

5|$|The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories {{interconnect}} as they complete missions. Some {{missions are}} completed {{with only one}} character and others feature two or three. Outside the missions, players may switch between characters at will {{by means of a}} directional compass on the HUD. The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete certain objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage. Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> cut from the cash reward and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique skills. There are multiple options for completing heists; in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.|$|E
5|$|After finding {{most of the}} Melodies, Ninten is harassed at a karaoke bar by Teddy, {{the boss}} of a local gang. Teddy surrenders after losing to Ninten in a duel, and joins Ninten's party {{with the intent to}} avenge the deaths of his parents, who were killed at Holy Loly Mountain. Lloyd stays behind. In a cottage at the base of Holy Loly Mountain, Ana pulls Ninten aside and asks him to be with her always. The two dance and profess their mutual love. When about to leave, the party is {{attacked}} by a powerful robot that knocks out the entire party. Lloyd arrives with a tank and destroys the robot, but accidentally attacks the party and critically wounds Teddy, so Lloyd rejoins the party. <b>They</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> boat out on Holy Loly Lake and a whirlpool pulls them into an underwater laboratory where they find a robot who claims to have been built by George to protect Ninten. When the laboratory floods, they leave for the mountain and the robot helps them ascend. On the way, they find a cave with human prisoners including Ana's mother. They need to defeat the Mother Ship to free the prisoners. Another robot (implied to be an upgraded version of the one fought at the cabin) attacks at the summit, and George's robot self-destructs to destroy it, leaving behind the seventh melody. After learning this melody, the party is warped to Magicant, where Ninten sings the melodies he had learned to Queen Mary. She recalls the rest of the song and reminisces about an alien named Gyiyg that she loved as her own child. Queen Mary reveals that she is George's wife, Maria, and vanishes. Magicant, a mirage created by her conscience, vanishes with her.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} Valkyira Chronicles games, Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role-playing game where players {{take control of}} a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces. Stories are told through comic book-like panels with animated character portraits, with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text. The player progresses {{through a series of}} linear missions, gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked. The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player's approach: when one option is selected, the other is sealed off to the player. Outside missions, the player characters rest in a camp, where units can be customized and character growth occurs. Alongside the main story missions are character-specific sub missions relating to different squad members. After the game's completion, additional episodes are unlocked, some of them having a higher difficulty than those found {{in the rest of the}} game. There are also love simulation elements related to the game's two main heroines, although <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> very minor role.|$|E

5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they {{got to know each}} other. They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how things would have turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and <b>they</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E
