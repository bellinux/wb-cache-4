50|$|Where {{multiple}} {{tanks are}} fitted, {{a combination of}} check valves and a hydrostatic relief valve are usually installed to prevent fuel from flowing from one tank to another. In Australia, {{there is a common}} assembly designed for this purpose. It is a combined <b>twin</b> <b>check</b> valve and hydrostatic relief valve assembly built {{in the form of a}} T-fitting, such that the lines from the tanks come into the sides of the valve and the outlet to the converter comes out the end. Because there is only one common brand of these valves, they are known colloquially as a Sherwood valve.|$|E
5000|$|... 35 mm {{films are}} pulled, {{this means the}} end of the film is {{extracted}} from cassette. This can be done manually or by using a small machine that essentially uses tape to pull the film leader out of the cassette. In cases when {{the end of the}} film cannot be removed or if the film is damaged, the film can be removed using a dark bag or a dark box. A <b>twin</b> <b>check</b> number (a pair of stickers with a unique number) is put onto the film and the matching number onto the film processing envelope, so that after processing this film can be easily identified to the customers envelope. Films are spliced on the leader cards one or two at a time, to do this {{the end of the film}} is cut square, special chemical-resistant tape is used to attach the film to the leader card. The leader card(s) is/are then inserted into the film processor and are fed through the machine using sprockets in the card. The film goes through a developer, bleach, fix and stabilizer, then through a dryer. After the film is processed it is cut from the leader card and reunited with the processing envelope containing the customer details, and then from here the film goes forward for printing.|$|E

In the first inning, Dodger speed forced the Twins into fielding mishaps. Wills doubled and Gilliam singled in the run. Willie Davis bunted and third-baseman Killebrew's hurried throw to first went high, {{enabling}} the streaking Davis to {{make it all the way}} to third and plating Gilliam. The Dodgers collected 14 hits and four stolen bases, while Koufax steadily kept the <b>Twins</b> in <b>check</b> for the shutout.|$|R
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their <b>Twin</b> Otters and <b>checked</b> these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the <b>Twin</b> Otter to <b>check</b> the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or the elevator to see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|R
40|$|Frequently {{the data}} we analyse will be incomplete, with some cases lacking {{observations}} for some variables. It is generally useful {{to investigate this}} phenomenon, and one part of this investigation may be to examine the patterns of missingness among the variables of interest. For example, {{it may be that}} there are a few variables which are either all observed or all missing for most cases. It is very easy in MLwiN to produce a list of the patterns of missingness which appear in the data, with a record of how many cases have each pattern. A note on the example data The data which appear in the screenshots in this document demonstrating the process are taken from the US National Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP) 1. They are in the public domain and can be found at ftp://sph-ftp. jhsph. edu/cpp / 2, together with extensive documentation. Here we use a subset consisting of all twins who survived at least to age 8. The variables used have been renamed by the present author for ease of use. They consist of the zygosity of the twin pair (zygosity), a sex variable created by the present author using all the variables recording sex available in the data (so as to reduce the missingness of sex as far as possible; sex), the age when the WISC and WRAT were administered (age), the sex variable from the same dataset as the WISC and WRAT (sex 7), scores for the three WRAT tests spelling, reading and arithmetic, raw full scale WISC score (FS), WISC full scale IQ (FSIQ), raw WISC verbal score (verbal), WISC verbal IQ (verbalIQ), raw WISC performance score (perf), WISC performance IQ (perfIQ), parental education (e 7), occupation (o 7) and income (i 7) when the twins were age 7, and two different codings of parental education (e 01 and e 02), occupation (o 01 and o 02) and income (i 01 and i 02) at registration into the study (before the birth of the <b>twins).</b> <b>Checking</b> missingness is recorded correctly First we make sure that after importation to MLwiN, all the values that represent missingness have been recoded to MLwiN’s missing value.

Biochemist Emil Abderhalden had turned in 1940 to Verschuer, because he needed the blood of <b>twins</b> to <b>check</b> the [...] "Abderhalden reaction named after him" [...] on identical twins. Abderhalden asserted here, that certain reactions of the immune system are stimulated by the production of each specific proteases. Due to the detection of such enzymes in the blood - Abderhalden called it [...] "Defensive enzymes" [...] - the detection of diseases such as mental illness or cancer through blood tests should be possible. Abderhalden also believed that racial characteristics were included in the proteins of the tissue and blood. These suggestions were taken up by Verschuer and developed into a {{research project}} on the inheritance of [...] "specific white type bodies", from which he obviously hoped to, to be able to develop a blood test for the determination of human race. In an interim report of the KWI-A at the German Research Foundation, which funded the project, Verschuer explained that his assistant was posted as a camp doctor in Auschwitz, Dr Mengele, who was entered as an employee in this branch. [...] "With the permission of the Reichsführer-SS be conducted anthropological studies of the various racial groups in this concentration camp and sent the blood samples to my laboratory for processing." [...] Also, the biochemist Günther Hillmann was included in the project, was established as a specialist for protein research by the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biochemistry under Adolf Butenandt.

40|$|International audienceDiagnosability is {{a crucial}} system {{property}} that determines at design stage how accurate any diagnosis algorithm can be on a partially observable system. The existence of two indistinguishable behaviors, i. e. holding the same observations, with exactly one of them containing the fault violates the diagnosability property. A classical approach for diagnosability verification consists in constructing a finite state machine called twin plant {{to search for a}} path representing such indistinguishable behaviors, called a critical path. To avoid the unrealistic hypothesis about the monolithic model of a complex system, recent work constructs local twin plants and then incrementally synchronizes some of them until diagnosability is decided without computing the impractical global twin plant. In this paper, we optimize the distributed approach by abstracting necessary and sufficient diagnosability information from local <b>twin</b> plants to <b>check</b> the existence of critical paths. Thus diagnosability can be analyzed with as small search space as possible. Furthermore, our approach describes how to improve the diagnosis algorithm by using our diagnosability results in a formal way when the system is verified to be diagnosable. Finally, when the system is not diagnosable, the algorithm returns some useful information about its indistinguishable behaviors, which can help in upgrading system diagnosable level...|$|R
5000|$|The story {{starts off}} with Alex {{watching}} his stepfather cut up wood {{for the fire}} place, {{and even though he}} looks strong, Alex decides to ask him if he needs any help. Jake brushes Alex off and carries on, which makes him feel out of bond with his stepfather. Alex goes on to talk to his pregnant mother Virginia who is expecting <b>twins.</b> She is <b>checking</b> up on her pear tree and had pushed a glass bottle onto the branch, over the blossom [...] Inside were twigs and leaves and two pears. Over the summer, the pears had grown and gotten sweet inside the bottle. When the pears were ripe, Virginia would pull the bottle off the tree with the pears inside. She would then fill the bottle with pear nectar and give it to her sister Caroline, who would never guess how Virginia managed to put those pears inside this glass bottle. Alex then goes on to try to help Jake load everything else back to the house, and once again, Jake brushes Alex off. As Jake starts to unload the wood, Alex spots a wolf spider on his neck. Alex starts to talk to Jake about it but Jake thinks they are talking about Virginia who is right outside the window by the pear tree. After having a long conversation about it, Alex lets Jake know that is a wolf spider that they are talking about. Jake panics and asks Alex for help as he starts to search every piece of clothing. Jake is then standing in the porch naked with just his cowboy hat on hand. Virginia comes over and Alex tries to explain the situation to her. She points out to the hat is where the spider had been the whole time. Jake then picks Alex up and starts dancing with joy. Virginia starts feeling the twins dancing in her belly as well as she sees Jake and Alex do the same.|$|R
