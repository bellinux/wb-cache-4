5|$|Middle {{latitude}} glaciers {{are located}} either between the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cancer</b> and the Arctic Circle, or between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle. Both areas support glacier ice from mountain glaciers, valley glaciers and even smaller icecaps, {{which are usually}} located in higher mountainous regions. All are located in mountain ranges, notably the Himalayas; the Alps; the Pyrenees; Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast Ranges of North America; the Patagonian Andes in South America; and mountain ranges in New Zealand. Glaciers in these latitudes are more widespread and tend to be greater in mass the closer they are to the polar regions. They are the most widely studied over the past 150 years. As with examples located in the tropical zone, virtually all the glaciers in the mid-latitudes {{are in a state}} of negative mass balance and are retreating.|$|E
5|$|The {{membership}} of the organization at this time remained largely static. In 1974, {{as a consequence of}} the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Greece withdrew its forces from NATO's military command structure but, with Turkish cooperation, were readmitted in 1980. The Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina did not result in NATO involvement because article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty specifies that collective self-defence is only applicable to attacks on member state territories north of the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cancer.</b> On 30May 1982, NATO gained a new member when the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance; Spain's membership was confirmed by referendum in 1986. At the peak of the Cold War, 16 member nations maintained an approximate strength of 5,252,800 active military, including as many as 435,000 forward deployed US forces, under a command structure that reached a peak of 78 headquarters, organized into four echelons.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of the Earth is {{approximately}} 23.439281° with {{the axis of}} its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies {{over the course of}} the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cancer</b> is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cancer's</b> {{position}} is not fixed, but varies {{in a complicated}} manner over time. Currently, it gradually drifts south almost half an arcsecond (0.47″) of latitude, or 15 metres, per year (it was at exactly 23° 27′ in 1917 and will be at 23° 26' in 2045).

25|$|Some stars {{within the}} far {{northern}} constellation (such as Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Ursa Major, and Ursa Minor) roughly {{north of the}} <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cancer</b> (+23½°) will be circumpolar stars, which never rise or set.|$|E

25|$|The {{tropical}} maritime airmass (MT) {{is responsible}} for Nigeria's rainy season. This wind (the tropical maritime airmass) invades the country from February {{in the southern part}} of Nigeria while it takes longer for the wind to fully cover the whole of the country, reaching the northern part of Nigeria in June. Its invasion is as a result of the northward retreat, of the tropical continental airmass (CT) known as the harmattan. The northward retreat of the tropical continental airmass (CT), is caused by the sun's northward shift from the tropic of capricorn in the southern hemisphere to the <b>tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> in the northern hemisphere. This shift begins from February and ends in June, when the sun is fully overhead, at the <b>tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>cancer</b> in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

25|$|Yves Tardy, {{from the}} French Institut National Polytechnique de Toulouse and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, {{calculated}} that laterites cover {{about one-third of}} the Earth's continental land area.

They cover most of the land area between the <b>tropics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cancer</b> and Capricorn; areas not covered within these latitudes include the extreme western portion of South America, the southwestern portion of Africa, the desert regions of north-central Africa, the Arabian peninsula and the interior of Australia.|$|R
50|$|Astronomical timing as {{the basis}} for {{designating}} the temperate seasons dates back at least to the Julian calendar used by the ancient Romans. It continues to be used on many modern Gregorian calendars worldwide, although some countries like Australia, New Zealand, and Russia prefer to use meteorological reckoning. The precise timing of the seasons is determined by the exact times of transit of the sun over the <b>tropics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cancer</b> and Capricorn for the solstices and the times of the sun's transit over the equator for the equinoxes, or a traditional date close to these times.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Tropic</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cancer</b> {{effectively}} {{divides the}} country into temperate and tropical zones.

25|$|Cancer was the {{location}} of the Sun's most northerly position in the sky (the summer solstice) in ancient times, though this position now occurs in Taurus due to the precession of the equinoxes, around June 21.

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} planting coffee is to place 20 seeds in each hole {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. This method loses about 50% of the seeds' potential, as about half fail to sprout. A more effective method of growing coffee, used in Brazil, is to raise seedlings in nurseries that are then planted outside at six to twelve months. Coffee is often intercropped with food crops, such as corn, beans, or rice during the first few years of cultivation as farmers become familiar with its requirements. Coffee plants grow within a defined area between the <b>tropics</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cancer</b> and Capricorn, termed the bean belt or coffee belt.|$|R
5|$|Coconut crabs {{live in the}} Indian Ocean and {{the central}} Pacific Ocean, with a {{distribution}} that closely matches that of the coconut palm.

There is evidence that the coconut crab once lived on the mainlands of Australia and Madagascar and on the island of Mauritius, but it no longer occurs in any of these places. As they cannot swim as adults, coconut crabs must have colonised the islands as planktonic larvae.|$|R

These regions share a similarly stable climate in terms of relative humidity and rainfall. Like H. capsulatum, the agent of classical histoplasmosis, H. duboisii is associated with chicken runs and bat caves.
