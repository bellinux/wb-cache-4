The reaction mechanisms and the related microstructures in the Si/Ta/Cu, Si/TaC/Cu and Si/Ta 2 N/Cu metallization systems are studied experimentally and theoretically by utilizing the ternary Si-Ta-Cu, Si-Ta-C, Si-Ta-N, Ta-C-Cu, and Ta-N-Cu phase diagrams as well as the activity diagrams calculated at different temperatures. The effects of oxygen on the reactions in the Si/Ta/Cu and Si/TaC/Cu metallization systems are investigated by employing also the evaluated Ta-O and Ta-C-O phase diagrams. The experimental investigations are carried out with the help of sheet resistance measurements, x-ray diffraction (XRD), Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

METHOD: We evaluated the causal effect of TA using instrumental variable (structural equation) modelling on data from a three-arm, randomized controlled trial of 308 people in an acute first or second episode of a non-affective psychosis. The trial compared cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) over 6 weeks plus routine care (RC) v. supportive counselling (SC) plus RC v. RC alone. We examined the effect of TA, as measured by the client-rated CALPAS, on the primary trial 18 -month outcome of symptom severity (PANSS), which was assessed blind to treatment allocation.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive study in a primary care center, involving 320 diabetic patients. TA was measured using the HaynesâSackett (HâS) adherence test during the patient interview and based on pharmacy refill data. TA was calculated globally and by drug groups (antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antidiabetic drugs). Results: Poor TA {{as measured by the}} HâS test was observed in 11. 2 % of the patients. Based on pharmacy refill data, there was a poor global TA rate of 30. 3 %, which was 33. 3 %, 26. 6 %, and 34. 2 % for oral antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering drugs, respectively. Concordance between the two methods was poor. There was no relationship between the degree of disease control and TA as measured by the HâS test. <b>Good</b> <b>TA</b> measured based on pharmacy refill data for antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs was associated with lower glycosylated hemoglobin and diastolic blood pressure values, respectively. Patients with <b>good</b> global <b>TA</b> showed lower glycosylated hemoglobin, diastolic blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values. The multivariate analysis found good oral antidiabetic adherence to be associated to free pharmacy service; good antihypertensive drug adherence to the existence of comorbidities; and good lipid-lowering drug adherence to a history of ischemic heart disease, and a more experienced physician and/or female physician. Conclusion: Concordance between the two methods in assessing TA was low. Approximately one-third of the patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus presented poor TA in relation to antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antidiabetic medication.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the possibility of}} accelerated identification of potential compositions for high-temperature shape memory alloys (SMAs) through a combinatorial material synthesis and analysis approach, wherein we employ the combination of diffusion couple and indentation techniques. The former was utilized to generate smooth and compositionally graded inter-diffusion zones (IDZs) in the Ni-Ti-Pd ternary alloy system of varying IDZ thickness, depending on the annealing time at high temperature. The IDZs thus produced were then impressed with an indenter with a spherical tip so as to inscribe a predetermined indentation strain. Subsequent annealing of the indented samples at various elevated temperatures, T-a, ranging between 150 and 550 degrees C allows for partial to full relaxation of the strain imposed due to the shape memory effect. If T-a is above the austenite finish temperature, A(f), the relaxation will be complete. By measuring the depth recovery, {{which serves as a}} proxy for the shape recovery characteristic of the SMA, a three-dimensional map in the recovery temperature composition space is constructed. A comparison of the published Af data for different compositions with the <b>Ta</b> data shows <b>good</b> agreement when the depth recovery is between 70 % and 80 %, indicating that the methodology proposed in this paper can be utilized for the identification of promising compositions.

We investigated the ability of Ta to support the growth and function of normal human osteoblast-like cells (NHBC). Cell responses to polished and textured Ta discs were compared with responses to other common orthopaedic metals, titanium and cobaltâchromium alloy, and tissue culture plastic. No consistent differences, that could be attributed to the different metal substrates or to the surface texture, were found in several measured parameters. Attachment of NHBC to each substrate was similar, as was cell morphology, as determined by confocal microscopy. Cell proliferation was slightly faster on plastic than on Ta at 3 days, but by 7 days neither the absolute cell numbers, nor the number of cell divisions, was different between Ta and the other substrates.

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the interaction of primary HOB with porous tantalum, using 5 -mm thick discs of porous tantalum. Comparison was made with discs of solid tantalum and tissue culture plastic. Confocal microscopy was used to investigate the attachment and growth of cells on porous Ta, and showed that HOB attached successfully to the metal "trabeculae," underwent extensive cell division, and penetrated into the Ta pores. The maturation of HOB on porous Ta was determined in terms of cell expression of the osteoblast phenotypic markers, STRO- 1, and alkaline phosphatase. Despite some donor-dependent variation in STRO- 1 /AlkPhos expression, growth of cells grown on porous Ta either promoted, or did not impede, the maturation of HOB. In addition, the expression of key osteoblastic genes was investigated after 14 days of culture. The relative levels of mRNA encoding osteocalcin, osteopontin and receptor activator of NFkappaB ligand (RANKL) was not different between porous or solid Ta or plastic, although these genes were expressed differently by cells of different donors.

40|$|Purpose: Texture {{analysis}} (TA) {{has proved}} to be useful to distinguish different tissues and disease states using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). TA has been successfully applied clinically to improve identification of abnormalities in the brain, liver, and bone and, more recently, has been used to enhance the specificity of breast MRI. This preclinical study used a custom-made phantom containing different grades of reticulated foam embedded in agarose gel to assess the capability of TA to distinguish between different texture objects, under different imaging conditions. The aim was to assess whether TA could be used reliably with clinical protocols that were not optimized for texture analysis and also to investigate the effect that changing imaging sequence parameters would have on the outcome of TA. Methods: Clinical fast gradient echo sequences and two different breast RF coils were used in order to reflect standard clinical practice. Three protocols were used: (1) a high spatial resolution protocol run on a 1. 5 Tesla (T) MRI scanner, (2) a parameter matched sequence run on a 3. 0 T magnet, and (3) a high temporal resolution protocol also run on a 3. 0 T magnet. For each protocol, three sequence parameters (repetition time, bandwidth/echo time, and flip angle) were altered from the baseline values {{to assess the impact of}} changes in acquisition parameters on the outcome of TA. Results: TA was performed using MAZDA software and clearly differentiated four foam phantoms when using the wavelet transform method (WAV), also moderately so with the co-occurrence matrix method (COM). The outcome was generally improved for imaging protocols acquired on the 3. 0 T scanner, particularly for the high spatial resolution protocol where changes to the acquisition parameters influenced the TA, especially changes to the bandwidth/echo time. For the other protocols, TA outcome was less affected by changes to the imaging parameters. Conclusions: This phantom study shows that acquisition parameters and protocols that are typically used for clinical breast imaging can result in <b>good</b> <b>TA.</b> Our findings suggest that changes to sequence parameters may not greatly influence the outcome of texture analysis, but rather that spatial resolution may be the most important factor to consider.

El objetivo secundario es analizar la seguridad del procedimiento. MÃ©todos: En este estudio retrospectivo se incluyeron 16 pacientes (22 ojos), en un periodo de seis meses. Se analizÃ³ tipo y tiempo de evoluciÃ³n de la {{diabetes}} mellitus, tratamientos previos, MAVC, estado del cristalino, presiÃ³n intraocular (PIO) y espesor macular central. A lo largo del seguimiento se recogieron datos relativos al nÃºmero de inyecciones, asÃ­ como a cambios en MAVC, PIO, grosor foveal, y complicaciones observadas. Resultados: Se produjo mejorÃ­a en la MAVC en el 30, 77, 47, 37 y 52, 63 %, al mes, 3 y 6 meses, respectivamente (p Purpose: To {{determine the}} efficacy of intravitreal triamcinolone injections (iv TA) for diffuse persistent diabetic macular oedema (DMO) based on the functional parameter of modification in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and the anatomic parameter of quantitative changes in central macular thickness, as determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT). The secondary outcome is to analyse {{the safety of the}} procedure. Methods: In this retrospective study, 16 patients (22 eyes) were included over a period of six months. Type and time of evolution of diabetes mellitus, previous treatments, BCVA, lens status, intraocular pressure (IOP) and central macular thickness, were analysed. During the follow-up period were collected: number of injections, changes in BCVA, IOP, central macular thickness, and complications observed. Results: Improvement in BCVA was recorded in 30. 77 %, 47. 37 % and 52. 63 %, at one, three and six months, respectively (P<. 05 at 3 months). The IOP increased in 57. 69 % at one month, and 75 and 47. 05 %, at 3 and 6 months, respectively (P<. 05 at 3 months). Progression of cataracts was found in 22. 72 %. No cases of endophthalmitis were observed. Conclusions: Intravitreal <b>TA</b> is a <b>good</b> therapeutic option for patients with persistent DMO, increasing BCVA and decreasing central macular thickness in the short term, with a percentage of clinical resolution of more than 70 %. However, due to the transient effect, and potential adverse effects, it should be administered to selected refractory cases with caution...|$|R
40|$|Tropane {{alkaloids}} (TAs) are toxins {{found in}} a wide variety of plant species growing in mild climates. The most well-known are Datura, Atropa and Hyoscyamus sp., belonging to the Solanaceae family. The TAs family comprises more than 200 compounds, of which atropine and scopolamine are the most active producing anticholinergic symptoms (e. g. blurred vision, dry mouth, muscle spasms, tachycardia and death) if ingested in toxic quantities. The presence of botanical impurities (e. g. seeds, leaves and roots) has been reported in a variety of tea and herbal blends, stressing the need to control the quality of these products in the EU market. The European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for Mycotoxins organised a proficiency test (PT) on the determination of TAs (atropine and scopolamine) in tea and herbal infusions upon request from DG SANTE. The measurand levels were targeted to provide insight on the measurement capabilities of EU Member States' laboratories at concentrations close to the recommended limit of quantification (LOQ) established by the Commission Recommendation 2015 / 976 (preferably below 5 Î¼g/kg and not higher 10 Î¼g/kg). Additionally, the ratio of atropine to scopolamine was kept as native in the plant materials in some samples. Three matrices appropriately processed were provided to the participants: black tea, peppermint leaves and fennel seeds. The concentrations of atropine varied from 8. 3 to 42. 2 Î¼g/kg while those of scopolamine ranged from 1. 5 to 20. 8 Î¼g/kg. The participants were asked to determine atropine and scopolamine in 6 contaminated samples (2 per matrix) and 3 blank materials spiked by them with a TAs solution of unknown concentration. This setup was also aimed to allow a preliminary assessment of the robustness of the EURL-developed method. Thirty-three laboratories from 11 Member States joined the PT, with a very significant participation from Germany. The performance of the laboratories was assessed using z-scores with regard to the assigned values obtained by exact matching double isotope dilution mass spectrometry (EMD-IDMS), in line with the ISO 13528 : 2015. In all cases, the consensus values derived from the participants' data were within the range of the assigned values, considering the respective confidence intervals. On average, eighty-seven percent of the z-scores for atropine and 84 % for scopolamine fell in the acceptable range (|z| â¤ 2). The success rate varied from 83 to 94 % for atropine and from 67 to 94 % for scopolamine, across the distributed matrices and concentration levels. The robust standard deviations of the reported results for both <b>TAs</b> were in <b>good</b> agreement with the target standard deviation (22 %). The results of this PT indicate that EU Member Statesâ laboratories can determine atropine and scopolamine reliably in tea and herbal infusions at levels relevant to the current legislation (Commission Recommendation 2015 / 976).

40|$|Cappadocian Greek {{has lost}} the {{tripartite}} grammatical gender distinction into masculine, feminine and neuter nominals, a distinction operative in Greek since its earliest recorded stages. In Cappadocian, nouns, whose cognates bear three different gender values in all other Modern Greek varieties, behave as neuters, in that they combine with the neuter forms of the various determiners and modifiers that agree with them (1). (1) a. UlaghÃ¡tsh Cappadocian do kalon do andra âthe good manâ do kalon do neka âthe good womanâ do kalon do pei âthe good childâ da kalan da andres âthe good menâ da kalan da nekes âthe good womenâ da kalan da peija âthe good childrenâ b. Standard Modern Greek o kalos (o) andras âthe good manâ i kali (i) jineka âthe good womanâ to kalo to peÃ°i âthe good childâ i kali (i) andres âthe good menâ i kales (i) jinekes âthe <b>good</b> womenâ <b>ta</b> kala <b>ta</b> peÃ°ja âthe <b>good</b> childrenâ c. Turkish iyi adam âthe good manâ iyi kadÄ±n âthe good womanâ iyi Ã§ocuk âthe good childâ iyi adamlar âthe good menâ iyi kadÄ±nlar âthe good womenâ iyi Ã§ocuklar âthe good childrenâ This innovation is often found in discussions of contact-induced changes observed in Cappadocian, seemingly implying that language contact with Turkish was the decisive factor in this process of language change. The absence of grammatical gender distinctions and the invariability of elements modifying head nouns denoting entities of different (or no) sex, that {{is the absence of}} agreement within the noun phrase, in Turkish is most commonly brought forth as evidence in support of a contact-related explanation. In this paper, I show that most treatments of grammatical gender loss in Cappadocian in the literature fail to account for a number of questions raised by the Cappadocian data themselves, such as number agreement in the plural, which is found in Cappadocian noun phrases (do kalon do andra versus da kalan da andres) but not in Turkish ones (iyi adam versus iyi adamlar), or the selection of the neuter gender over the masculine or the feminine as the default gender value in Cappadocian. The analysis presented in this paper overcomes these shortcomings and provides answers to the above questions. Following the examination of the agreement patterns in the noun phrases in two Cappadocian varieties as well as in Pontic Greek, one of the closest cognate dialects of Cappadocian, I propose that gender loss in Cappadocian followed the emergence of an inflectionally active [Â±human] feature in the nominal inflection of the Eastern Greek dialects and the subsequent association of the [âhuman] value with the neuter gender. I further suggest that the total loss of gender distinctions in the dialect should rather be viewed {{as the result of a}} series of analogical levellings of gender mismatches in polydefinite constructions (i. e., noun phrases in which the definite article appears both before an attributive adjective and the head noun), which left number agreement within the noun phrase intact. This process was most probably accelerated by language contact with Turkish, but was certainly not triggered by it...|$|R
