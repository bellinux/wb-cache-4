40|$|When a {{large number}} of jobs and {{machines}} are taken into account, efficiency in the Job shop scheduling plays an essential role. In case of classical job shop scheduling, an operation is allowed to be processed by any machine from a given set and the FJSP is an extension of the classical job shop scheduling problem. The problem consists of two steps, one is to assign each operation to a machine and the second is to sequence the operations on the machines, such that the maximum completion time (makespan) of all operations is minimized. Many heuristics methods are designed as solutions with a close to optimal solution.

40|$|Abstract — During recent years, {{various studies}} have {{suggested}} that around 20 % of all road accidents are fatigue-related and up to 50 % on certain roads. In this scenario, preventing accidents under drowsiness state has become a major focus for active safety driving. To reduce the accidents rate, it is needed to provide an efficient safety measure. Literature says that, the drowsiness condition of driver can be best monitored by using an eye blink sensor (or) fabric electrode (or) ECG Sensor. But by monitoring the drowsiness condition alone, the accidents cannot be avoided, unless vehicle speed is controlled. To overcome this problem, the proposed hardware system implemented with ECG electrode and PIC microcontroller measures the heart function of the driver and it compares that with stored ECG signal for drowsy state. For that the electrode is fixed in the right hand and left hand of the driver. If the system identifies that the driver is in drowsy state, it follows <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> like alters the driver by a buzzer, sends a warning signal to the control room, monitor and control the speed of the vehicle by cutting the fuel supply to the engine.

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{generate}} realistic production scheduling in the supply chain. The scheduling model determines the best schedule using operation sequences and machine and strongly satisfies the due dates of customer order. The model is NP-hard in the strong sense in general. And, real system can be happened various kinds of uncertain factors such as queuing, breakdowns and repairing time in the manufacturing supply chain. To solve this problem a hybrid approach involving a genetic algorithm (GA) and computer simulation is proposed. Such an approach has not been treated in the literature. The GA is employed in order to quickly generate feasible production and delivery schedules. The simulation is used to minimize the maximum completion time for the production and delivery plan with last sequence with fixed schedules from the GA model. More realistic production and delivery schedules with an optimal completion time by performing the iterative hybrid approach can be obtained. This proposed approach generates: (1) selecting the best machine for each operation, (2) deciding <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> to product and route to deliver, (3) minimizing the makespan for each order. The results of computational experiments for a simple example of the supply chain are given and discussed to validate the proposed approach.

In many ways, the type of matrix updates performed in the selected inversion algorithm {{is similar to that}} performed in the LU factorization, although <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> is different. In the context of LU factorization, it is known that the left-looking and right-looking algorithms exhibit different memory access and data communication patterns, and hence different behavior on shared memory and distributed memory parallel machines. Corresponding to right-looking and left-looking LU factorization, selected inversion algorithm can be organized as a left-looking and a right-looking algorithm. The parallel right-looking version of the algorithm has been developed in [1]. The sequence of operations performed in this version of the selected inversion algorithm is similar to those performed in a left-looking LU factorization algorithm. In this paper, we describe the left-looking variant of the selected inversion algorithm, and based on task parallel method, present an efficient implementation of the algorithm for shared memory machines. We demonstrate that with the task scheduling features provided by OpenMP 4. 0, the left-looking selected inversion algorithm can scale well both on the Intel Haswell multicore architecture and on the Intel Knights Corner (KNC) manycore architecture. Compared to the right-looking selected inversion algorithm, the left-looking formulation facilitates pipelining of work along different branches of the elimination tree, and can be a promising candidate for future development of massively parallel selected inversion algorithms on heterogeneous architecture.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study in {{economic}} anthropology. Opening with a critical estimate of the work previously done in the subject, it proceeds to an analysis of the economic life of the Maori, the method of functional observation and the correlation being followed. An account is first given of the environmental conditions of the native and the natural resources at his command. The social structure of the Maori community is then analysed and its relation to the economic organisation shown, special consideration being given to the problem of the position of the family in native life. By following <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> in a typical industry - bird snaring - it is shown how complex is the psychology of the Maori in his work, how motives of pleasure, pride, vanity and ambition round off the more purely utilitarian interests. Reference to other activities again proves that the native is capable of steady and industrious labour, when the proper stimuli are provided. The different forms of organisation in production are next described, with attention to the nature of leadership. The place of magic in economic life is reviewed at length, owing to its vital importance in assisting the stability and organisation of the work. A further set of problems is opened by consideration of the methods and principles of sharing out the product of labour {{as well as those of}} the ownership of the property, and the tenure of land. The nature of primitive economic values and of the system of exchange examined, while with the aid of maps the extensive nature of communication in oldern times is revealed. The radical alteration in the Maori economic structure consequent upon the coming of the European is analysed with its phases of initial impact, enthusiastic adoption of new culture forms, reaction, and renewed acceptance of the ways of white man. Finally it is emphasised how economic activity enlists forces of other social types to promote its own efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Background: Washbasin {{and sink}} U-bends are {{ubiquitous}} {{in virtually all}} buildings including hospitals and smaller healthcare premises. They {{have been used for}} over a century and their principal purpose is to prevent foul odours emanating from wastewater pipes from entering buildings. U-bends are designed to retain a small volume of water, which acts as the seal preventing the passage of sewer gas from wastewater pipework. The water retained in U-bends is frequently stagnant, which encourages the growth and proliferation of microbial biofilms, populated predominantly by Gram-negative bacterial species and especially by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Over the past two decades there have been numerous reports of nosocomial outbreaks of infection related directly or indirectly to contaminated U-bends. Three different approaches at addressing this problem have been used previously including the application of chemical disinfectants such as bleach, the replacement of sanitary fixtures and/or U-bends and the use of a U-bend heating element together with vibrational cleaning. The first two approaches worked well in several studies reducing contamination and infection risks in the short term, but failed to provide a long-term solution due to recolonisation of U-bends and the associated pipework with biofilm. The use of U-bend heating elements together with vibrational cleaning was shown to be effective, but the approach is expensive as the heating elements are in constant operation. Electrochemically activated (ECA) solution generators produce two solutions through activation of dilute brine. These include a metastable oxidant solution termed ?anolyte? (predominantly hypochlorous acid (HOCl)) and a second solution termed ?catholyte? with detergent properties (predominantly sodium hydroxide (NaOH)) The solutions are generated by passing a brine solution through a flow-through electrolytic cell. Anolyte is highly microbiocidal and capable of penetrating biofilms. Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that treatment of water supplied to dental units and washbasins with residual anolyte consistently eliminates biofilm and provides output water virtually free of contamination. Aim: The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether periodic treatment of washbasin U-bends and associated pipework with catholyte solution as a cleaning agent followed by anolyte solution as a disinfectant could minimise biofilm contamination of U-bends. Achieving this objective would require developing an approach to seal the wastewater outflow pipework from washbasins so that U-bends and associated pipework could be completely filled with ECA solutions for specified periods of time for maximum efficacy. A second objective was to automate U-bend decontamination with ECA solutions. Methods: Initially three identical washbasin U-bends were manually filled with catholyte solution followed by anolyte solution for five min each once weekly for five weeks. Three additional identical washbasin U-bends were used as controls. A programmable system was then developed with one washbasin that automated this process using an actuator-controlled ball valve to seal the wastewater outlet pipe and chemical-resistant dosing pumps to dose ECA solutions into the U-bend and associated pipework. A Programmable Logic Controller was used to coordinate <b>the</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> of the actuator and dosing pumps. This U-bend had three cycles of five min catholyte followed by five min anolyte treatment a week for three months. Quantitative bacterial counts from treated and control U-bends were determined following each round of ECA treatment on blood agar (CBA), R 2 A, PAS and PA agars following automated treatment and on CBA and R 2 A following manual treatment. Bacterial identification was determined by comparing small ribosomal subunit rRNA gene sequences with consensus sequences for individual bacterial species in the EMBL/GenBank databases. Results: The average bacterial density from untreated U-bends throughout the study was > 1 x 105 CFU/swab on all media with Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounting for approximately 50 % of bacterial counts. Manual treatment of U-bends with ECAs reduced counts significantly (< 100 CFU/swab) (P < 0. 01 for CBA; P < 0. 005 for R 2 A). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was eliminated from the U-bend subjected to automated ECA-treatment, with average bacterial counts over 35 cycles on CBA, R 2 A, PAS and PA of 2. 1 (? 4. 5) (P< 0. 0001), 13. 1 (? 30. 1) (P< 0. 05), 0. 7 (2. 8) (P< 0. 001) and 0 (? 0) (P< 0. 05) CFU/swab, respectively. Following the three-month study period, the ECA-treated and control U-bends were removed and cut in cross-section and segments examined by electron microscopy, which revealed the virtual elimination of biofilm from the ECA-treated U-bend. In contrast, the control U-bend was heavily fouled with dense pigmented biofilm. Conclusion: Microbial contamination of washbasin U-bends can be consistently minimised by automated decontamination with ECA solutions. Future Developments: Work is in progress to develop a large-scale system for simultaneous automated decontamination of multiple washbasin U-bends...|$|E
