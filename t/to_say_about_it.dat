The decree also included provision of financial credit {{to the people who}} received the land. The National Agrarian Bank (Banco Nacional Agrario, or BNA) was created on July 7, 1953, and by June 1951 it had disbursed more than $9million in small loans. 53,829 applicants received an average of 225US dollars, which was twice as much as the Guatemalan per capita income. The BNA developed a reputation for being a highly efficient government bureaucracy, and the United States government, Árbenz's biggest detractor, did not have anything negative <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The loans had a high repayment rate, and of the $3,371,185 handed out between March and November 1953, $3,049,092 had been repaid by June 1954. The law also included provisions for nationalization of roads that passed through redistributed land, which greatly increased the connectivity of rural communities.|$|E

The show was organised by public broadcaster ARD and private television station ProSieben, as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant Stefan Raab. Among 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she stated, [...] "I like to test myself.

Cavan Sieczkowski of International Business Times asserted that A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was a [...] "charming throwback to holiday specials of times past." [...] Sieczkowski praised the outfits, and drew comparisons to those of Elizabeth Taylor and Ava Gardner. In concurrence, Joe Drake of Ology wrote: [...] "This special was [...] I have nothing bad <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Lady Gaga proves, yet again, {{that she is the}} artist of our generation.

[...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{credited}} {{the series}} for its bold premise {{and noted that}} the show provided some insight into eating disorders while offering [...] "a few flashes of clever dialogue and satire." [...] Ultimately, however, the Times found that [...] "Starved relies too heavily on sight gags and gross-out farce." [...] The Los Angeles Times found the show [...] "vexing" [...] for being [...] "at once assured and shallow, accomplished and unconvincing, well-acted and empty." [...] The review singles out Schaeffer's character Sam as [...] "especially unappealing" [...] and points to Schaeffer's roles as creator, producer, writer and director as [...] "an object lesson in the wisdom {{of a system of}} checks and balances." [...] Perhaps most damningly, in noting Schaeffer's experiences with addiction, the reviewer writes that [...] "just because you’ve had an experience doesn’t mean you have anything interesting <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or are able to articulate whatever interesting thing you have to say." ...|$|E

The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the immensity of nature".|$|E
500|$|... "En La Disco" [...] (""), {{originally}} from Escorpiones (2004), features an Arabic-influenced beat infused with reggaetón. Lyrically, Queen assures her lover {{that if she}} finds him in the club, she promises to dance with him disregarding what other people have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> She assures him {{that there will be}} no other like her. [...] "Miles De Voces" [...] (""), a hip hop track from Buddha's Family (2001), contains simple harmonic progressions, synthesizers, affronted lyrics and a sociopolitical theme while alternating between major and minor key. [...] "La Abusadora" [...] ("The Abuser") originates from Iván Joy's Diamond Hits (2004). While reviewing the compilation Reggaeton Diamond Hits (2006), Steve Leggett, from Allmusic, named the song the highlight of the album. [...] "Aunque La Distancia" [...] ("") was originally included on the compilation release Romances Del Ruido 2 (2003) by Baby Rasta & Gringo as [...] "Llora Mi Corazón" [...] (""). Queen's rap contributes to a hip hop beat accompanied by Gran Omar. It is also known by the name of [...] "Eres Mi Hombre" [...] (""). [...] "Yo Lamento" [...] (Salsa Version), also from Contra La Corriente, is essentially the same track only re-recorded and mixed into salsa with a duration of four minutes and sixteen seconds; the longest on the album and only salsa track. In the song, Queen sings to her friend about loving her friend's man. She tells her that she had never intended to hurt her. Queen assures that she loves her friend, but acknowledges the fact that their friendship was lost. [...] "He looked at me and we started dancing while the music took us away. Dancing, he touched me. My mind wasn't thinking, passion was leading. My friend don't think that I don't love you", she sings.|$|E

2500|$|Cage {{returned}} to the United States in 1931. He went to Santa Monica, California, where he made a living partly by giving small, private lectures on contemporary art. He got to know various important figures of the Southern California art world, such as pianist Richard Buhlig (who became his first teacher) and arts patron Galka Scheyer. By 1933 Cage decided to concentrate on music rather than painting. [...] "The people who heard my music had better things <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> than the people who looked at my paintings {{had to say about}} my paintings", Cage later explained. In 1933 he sent some of his compositions to Henry Cowell; the reply was a [...] "rather vague letter", in which Cowell suggested that Cage study with Arnold Schoenberg—Cage's musical ideas at the time included composition based on a 25-tone row, somewhat similar to Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. Cowell also advised that, before approaching Schoenberg, Cage should take some preliminary lessons, and recommended Adolph Weiss, a former Schoenberg pupil.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, Van der Vaart's {{performances}} were attracting interest {{from some of}} Europe’s top clubs. He had previously been strongly linked to Milan, but {{in the summer of}} 2005, he signed for Bundesliga outfit Hamburger SV in Germany. Van der Vaart's €5.5million transfer to Hamburg, on 1 June 2005, raised many eyebrows. Many other top-flight clubs had shown interest in the midfielder but he chose Hamburg. Ajax legend Johan Cruyff himself commented in his De Telegraaf column, [...] "I don't know what <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> or what Rafael van der Vaart is doing in Hamburg." [...] He played a massive part in Hamburg’s impressive away form that season, scoring in each of their first four games on the road; in fact, {{in the course of his}} first one and a half seasons with the German club, they did not lose a single match away from home while he was on the pitch. Van der Vaart finished his first season as the team's top scorer as Hamburg finished third in the league and won the 2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1999, HBO {{commissioned}} {{an interview}} of Wilson by the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne for {{an episode of}} Reverb which never aired.

He's been asked about his music, like, everyday of his fucking life, so you'd think that he'd have something <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> ... I'm not in contempt of him, though. I just hate that if someone is drug-damaged, or eccentric, or possibly mad, people will let them shit all over themselves thinking, 'Isn't he cool?'." [...] In 2014, fans reacted negatively to the announcement that Wilson was to record a duets album, titled No Pier Pressure, and called it a [...] "cash-in". A Facebook post attributed to Wilson responded to the feedback: [...] "In my life in music, I’ve been told too many times not to fuck with the formula, but as an artist it’s my job to do that." [...] The album received mixed or average reviews.|$|E
