5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After <b>talking</b> <b>for</b> a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E
25|$|Hankey {{tried to}} {{institute}} weekly breakfasts between Lloyd George and Robertson, but these had failed as Lloyd George liked to sit <b>talking</b> <b>for</b> {{a long time}} after breakfast. Although he cultivated a myth that he never read, Lloyd George was in fact a very early riser, who would have already have completed much of the day's paperwork before breakfast, and therefore preferred to do business at breakfast meetings rather than in the evening. Austen Chamberlain found the practice equally irritating.|$|E
25|$|With war still looming on 24 February 2003, Saddam Hussein {{took part}} in an {{interview}} with CBS News reporter Dan Rather. <b>Talking</b> <b>for</b> more than three hours, he denied possessing any weapons of mass destruction, or any other weapons prohibited by UN guidelines. He also expressed a wish to have a live televised debate with George W. Bush, which was declined. It was his first interview with a U.S. reporter in over a decade. CBS aired the taped interview later that week. Saddam Hussein later told an FBI interviewer that he once left open the possibility that Iraq possessed {{weapons of mass destruction in}} order to appear strong against Iran.|$|E

500|$|Black Beauty was {{originally}} released only in Japan in 1973. It contained four side-long tracks spread across a double album, grouping the songs as medleys titled [...] "Black Beauty Part I", [...] "Black Beauty Part II", and so on, {{all of which}} credited Davis as the composer. He {{did not want the}} actual segments specified on the track listing out of a distaste for critics and listeners who arduously analyzed his music; according to DeJohnette's wife Lydia, [...] "Miles really felt that critics and people spent too much time in their mental mind, analyzing and <b>talking</b> <b>for</b> hours about something that really just is." [...] Columbia spent several years identifying some of the individual compositions to ensure royalty payment for the actual composers. The Japanese release also mistakenly credited Michael Henderson—Davis' other bassist during this period—rather than Holland in the liner notes.|$|E

500|$|Two filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "St. Valentine's Day" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season 3 DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the bonus feature. In the first scene, Kenneth tells Tracy that he cannot go through his date with Jennifer as {{he does not want to}} deceive Jennifer, as the plan is that Tracy will do all the <b>talking</b> <b>for</b> Kenneth during the date. Tracy, however, tells Kenneth that no deceiving will occur and that he will be honest during the date. Kenneth is still not convinced about the whole idea, but Tracy manages to change his mind. In the second scene, Jack and Elisa are in church. Jack intrigued with what has happened during church is ready to leave, though, Elisa tells him that the sermon is almost over, but that the service is about to begin.|$|E
500|$|Although {{some in the}} Conservative party {{agreed with}} Wilson (and Jo Grimond, the Liberal leader) that the Conservatives would have won the 1964 {{election}} if Butler had been Prime Minister, The Times observed, [...] "it should not be overlooked that in October 1963 Home took over a Government whose morale was shattered and whose standing in the opinion polls was abysmal. A year later Labour won the general election, with an overall majority of only four seats. That [...] recovered so much ground in so short a time was in itself an achievement." [...] However, looking back across Home's career, The Times considered that his reputation rested not on his brief premiership, but on his two spells as Foreign Secretary: [...] "He brought to the office... his capacity for straight <b>talking,</b> <b>for</b> toughness towards the Soviet Union and for firmness (sometimes interpreted {{as a lack of}} sympathy) towards the countries of Africa and Asia. But he brought something else as well: an unusual degree of international respect." ...|$|E

[...] The author identifies the press as a key figure in the tenor of the 2016 campaign, [...] "The public hates us reporters in the best of times. But the summer of Trump could easily turn into an Alamo moment for the press." [...] Taibbi comes to the view that members of the press should spend more time hearing out the viewpoints of the American populace, writing, [...] "Just like the politicians our job was to listen, and we talked instead.

500|$|After {{returning}} from Moncton, Schmirler felt physically well, but suffered a setback when a CAT scan revealed spots around her lungs. The {{decision was made}} not to proceed with further chemotherapy, but she continued with the orthomolecular therapy. She {{had been scheduled to}} work the 2000 Scott Tournament of Hearts, but was unable to do so. She faxed a statement from the hospital, which was read by TSN's Vic Rauter. [...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still hope {{to make it to the}} Brier, not playing but <b>talking.</b> <b>For</b> Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott). But keep things in perspective. There are other things in life besides curling, which I have found. But I hope to be on the curling trail again next year. And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition. She had been moved to palliative care. She died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital Palliative Care Unit on the morning of March 2, 2000 at age 36.|$|E
500|$|Marcel Wissenburg and David Schlosberg {{organised}} {{a workshop}} entitled [...] "Political Animals and Animal Politics" [...] at the 2012 European Consortium for Political Research Joint Sessions conference, {{which was held}} at the University of Antwerp, Belgium, between 10–15 April 2012. The two had been <b>talking</b> <b>for</b> around a year about organising a conference broadly on the theme of [...] "nature, animals and political theory". The workshop aimed to fill a gap in the political literature on the status of nonhuman animals, something, they claimed, previously considered only at the margins of work otherwise about the environment/resource management, or else by those more primarily interested in moral issues. Both Wissenburg and Schlosberg presented papers, and, in addition, papers were presented by Manuel Arias-Maldonado (University of Granada), Susan Boonman-Berson (Wageningen University and Research Centre), Kurtis Boyer (Lund University), Clemens Driessen (Utrecht University), Chad Flanders (Saint Louis University), Robert Garner (University of Leicester), Margareta Hanes (Vrije Universiteit Brussel), Paul Lucardie (University of Groningen), Christopher Neff (University of Sydney), Kaspar Ossenblok (Ghent University), Simon Otjes (Leiden University), Christie Smith (University of Exeter), Mihnea Tanasescu (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) and Catherine Zwetkoff (University of Liège). For Schlosberg, the workshop, and the wide range of papers presented, illustrated the [...] "coming-of-age of animal politics as a sub field of political theory".|$|E
500|$|In November 2009, in an {{interview}} with MTV News, Canadian rapper Drake praised Rihanna's then-upcoming fourth studio album, Rated R (2009). During the same interview, he revealed that they have collaborated on a track that didn't make the final cut on the album, [...] "the record we have is great. It's a special record, so for it not to make it, I know something had to click. It's all good. I think the project's gonna be great no matter what." [...] <b>Talking</b> <b>for</b> the same publication, Tor Erik Hermansen of Norwegian production duo StarGate recalled that during an event Rihanna met with Drake backstage and asked him to record a verse on her song, [...] "She's calling me up saying, 'Where are the files?' That's one thing you don't hear often from artists on her level." [...] "What's My Name?" [...] was written by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Hermansen, Ester Dean, Traci Hale and Drake, while the production was done by StarGate. In {{an interview}} for HitQuarters, Hale explained that she got into the project that's to a phone call she received from Dean. She also elaborated that her work on the song was mostly lyrical, while Dean and StarGate did most of the music. When asked what's the inspiration behind the song she stated, [...] "Oh love, love, love! And it’s sexy – it started as a real sexy track and then you put something sexy over it." ...|$|E

[...] In addition, Hoover and MacDonald came to an agreement that formed the basis of the 1930 London Naval Treaty while meeting at Rapidan Camp, <b>talking</b> <b>for</b> hours sitting on an [...] "historic log".

2500|$|In 2013, the Ventura County Star commemorated the 50th {{anniversary of}} the JFK {{assassination}} with a long article about the unknown woman who had used a phone {{in the vicinity of}} Oxnard, 50 miles away from Karyn Kupcinet's home, immediately before the shooting of JFK.
