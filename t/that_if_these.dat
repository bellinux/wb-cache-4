5|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Lloyd F. Lonergan, but {{the director of the}} film is uncredited. Little is known of the production, but a review in The New York Dramatic Mirror made the assumption that the scenes were shot in the morning. The film starred Florence La Badie, who was the most prominent player of the Thanhouser Company and frequently in the leading roles of films including the The Million Dollar Mystery which would captivate the United States. The role of the father was played, Sidney Bracy, was a stage actor of considerable experience who claimed to have been affiliated with the Thanhouser players since 1910. Though Q. David Bowers says that it is probably an incorrect assertion, it is possible that Bracy may not have been a full-time member of the company. Bracy's first credited work appears in 1913, but it would not be until The Million Dollar Mystery that Bracy would garner much attention in the role of Jones, the Butler. The role of the doctor was played by Arthur Bauer who was a veteran of the stage and film, through the Great Northern Film Company, before signing onto the Thanhouser Company. The announcement of Bauer's role at Thanhouser came after the release of sixteen films, including Adrift in the Great City, on March 21, 1914. Lila Chester, played the role of a nurse in the production. Chester was claimed by a Thanhouser publicist to have appeared in over 400 films by February 14, 1914. Bowers reasons <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>these</b> productions were with Thanhouser, than most of them had to be minor roles {{because of the lack of}} attention and credits she was given. The one reel drama film, approximately 1008 feet long, was filmed in New York City and New Rochelle, New York.|$|E

25|$|Not only {{do these}} losses reduce food {{security}} in India, the study claims that poor farmers and others lose income {{because of the}} waste and inefficient retail. Over US$50 billion of additional income can become available to Indian farmers by preventing post-harvest farm losses, improving transport, proper storage and retail. Organised retail {{is also expected to}} initiate infrastructure development creating millions of rural and urban jobs for India’s growing population.

25|$|The {{main issue}} {{turned out to}} be political, with War Plans {{concerned}} that reconstruction of the Tennessees might disrupt the building of new cruisers and with doubts about whether they would compare to more modern ships, even with their superior tonnage. Costs had escalated to $17 million and it did not seem profitable to modernize ships that would be between 25 and 28 years old once modernization was complete. Also, the Bureau of Ordnance did not consider replacing their guns practical. This meant <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>these</b> ships were kept in service 15 years after modernization, they might eventually face weapons over 40 years more advanced than their own. Despite these developments, detailed studies continued.|$|E

He reviewed biomass, namely timber, and commented that forests covering all of the UK could not supply energy equal to the current coal production. He also mentioned possibilities for geothermal and solar power, pointing out <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>these</b> sources did become useful, the UK would lose its competitive advantages in global industry.

To this end he purchased part of the upper Palatinate of the Rhine in1353, and in 1367 annexed Lower Lusatia to Bohemia and bought numerous estates in various parts of Germany. On the death of Meinhard, Duke of Upper Bavaria and Count of Tyrol, in 1363, Upper Bavaria was claimed by the sons of the emperor LouisIV, and Tyrol by RudolfIV, Duke of Austria. Both claims were admitted by Charles on the understanding <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>these</b> families died out both territories should pass to the House of Luxembourg.

25|$|Many rice grain {{producing}} {{countries have}} significant losses post-harvest {{at the farm}} and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmer's inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. A World Bank – FAO study claims 8% to 26% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure. Some sources claim the post-harvest losses to exceed 40%. Not only do these losses reduce food security in the world, the study claims that farmers in developing countries such as China, India and others lose approximately US$89 billion of income in preventable post-harvest farm losses, poor transport, the lack of proper storage and retail. One study claims <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>these</b> post-harvest grain losses could be eliminated with better infrastructure and retail network, in India alone enough food would be saved every year to feed 70 to 100 million people over a year.|$|E
25|$|Another theory {{involves}} Titanics watertight doors. This {{theory suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>these</b> doors had been opened, the Titanic would have settled {{on an even}} keel and therefore, perhaps, remained afloat long enough for rescue ships to arrive. However, this theory appears to be far from reality for two reasons: first, there were no watertight doors between any of the first four compartments, thus it was impossible to lower the concentration of water in the bow significantly. Second, Bedford and Hacket have shown by calculations that any significant amount of water aft of boiler room No.4 would have resulted in capsizing of the Titanic, which would have occurred about 30 minutes earlier than the actual time of sinking. Additionally, the lighting would have been lost about 70 minutes after the collision due to the flooding of the boiler rooms. Bedford and Hacket also analysed the hypothetical case that there were no bulkheads at all. Then, the vessel would have capsized about 70 minutes before the actual time of sinking and lighting would have been lost about 40 minutes after the collision.|$|E
