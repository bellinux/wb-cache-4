500|$|Media {{response}} to Intimacy was generally favourable; aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 69% based on 27critical reviews. Steven Robertshaw of Alternative Press described the album as arguably Bloc Party's finest career moment {{and noted that}} it offers [...] "sweat and circuitry, savagery and submission, and a captivating energy that's severely lacking in many music scenes on the planet". Kyle Anderson of Rolling Stone claimed that by [...] "replacing Bloc Party's distant cool with vivid honesty, Okereke makes Intimacy a confident new peak for his band", while PopMatters' Ross Langager explained that the record [...] "might not actually be all that intimate, {{but it is a}} thing of rough, recycled beauty". Adam Mazmanian of The Washington Times commented that the album's final mix showed that producers Epworth and Lee preserved the essence of Bloc Party's signature sound—"minor key rock <b>thrumming</b> with rhythmic intensity"—while taking the band in new musical directions. Dave Simpson of The Guardian concluded that it would please old and new fans alike by being [...] "brave, individual and heartfelt".|$|E

Her {{instrument}} is undeniably powerful, and more controlled here {{than it was}} before", but still demonstrates [...] "remarkable rawness and vulnerability". Sam Shepherd wrote that [...] "er voice is so unique and haunting that it is instantly recognisable." [...] Brian Howe of Pitchfork commented, [...] "Whatever biosphere you choose to project on it , Danilova's voice remains fixed on a faraway horizon, receding as you approach. When she bursts into the foreground on 'Avalanche' and stays there {{for the remainder of}} the album, the impression of impassable distance lingers. This is partly because of the authority of Danilova's voice, and partly because the music gives nothing away, <b>thrumming</b> along with power that shades into ambivalence toward the shifting emotional register of the singing. The results are dramatic but never melodramatic, as Danilova maps the dimensions of her self-imprisonment with resolve." ...|$|E

40|$|Heterostyly in Primula is {{characterized}} by the development of long-styled pin and short-styled <b>thrum</b> flowers, with anthers midway down the corolla tube in pin flowers, and at its mouth in <b>thrum</b> flowers. Other differences include pollen size and stigmatic papillae length. Several linked genes at the S locus control these differences. • In this study we have analyzed pin and <b>thrum</b> flowers through the temporal development of heteromorphy. • These studies indicate that the S locus linked genes that orchestrate heteromorphic flower development act in coordination, but with different temporal and spatial dynamics. • Style length is differentiated by longer style cells in pin than <b>thrum.</b> However, our studies on cell shape and size within the corolla tube show that a different mechanism mediates the dissimilar elevation of anthers between pin and <b>thrum</b> types. These studies have also revealed that upper corolla tube cells in <b>thrum</b> flowers are wider than those in pin flowers. This results in a larger corolla tube mouth in <b>thrum</b> flowers and represents a new and previously undocumented heteromorphic variation between pin and <b>thrum</b> flowers. © The Authors (2006) ...|$|R

30|$|The {{development}} of distyly {{is thought to}} arise from differential growth patterns in the pin and <b>thrum</b> morphs. However, few detailed studies exist on the early floral {{development of}} distylous flowers, and fewer still look at variation in these traits among populations. Buds at multiple stages of development were collected from five populations of Hedyotis caerulea to quantify how pins and <b>thrums</b> diverge {{with respect to the}} initiation, rate, and termination of growth between the stamens and stigmas. The growth rate of anthers varied little spatially across five populations and temporally in both pins and <b>thrums,</b> although <b>thrum</b> anthers grew faster than pin anthers. Dimorphy in stigma height was more complex. Pin stigmas first grew at a faster rate than those of <b>thrums,</b> and late in bud development, growth of <b>thrum</b> styles slowed. These rate changes varied among populations, and they differed from the congeneric H. salzmanii. Similar differences between morphs are known in other heterostylous species, and such variation in growth pattern among related species has been used to infer independent evolution of distylous systems.|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} heteromorphy in Primula {{over the past}} 140 years has {{established}} the reproductive significance of this breeding system. Plants produce either <b>thrum</b> or pin flowers that demonstrate reciprocal herkogamy. <b>Thrums</b> have short styles and produce large pollen from anthers {{at the mouth of}} the flower; pins have long styles and produce small pollen from anthers located within the corolla tube. The control of heteromorphy is orchestrated by the S locus with dominant (S) and recessive (s) alleles that comprise a co-adapted linkage group of genes. <b>Thrum</b> plants are heterozygous (Ss) and pin plants are homozygous (ss). Reciprocal crosses between the two forms are required for fertilization; within-morph crosses are impeded by a sporophytic self-incompatibility system. Rare recombination events within the S locus produce self-fertile homostyles. As a first step towards identifying genes located at the S locus, we used fluorescent differential display to screen for differential gene expression in pin and <b>thrum</b> flowers. Rather than only detecting differentially regulated genes, we identified two S locus linked genes by virtue of allelic variation between pin and <b>thrum</b> transcripts. Analysis of pin and <b>thrum</b> plants together with homostyle recombinant reveals that one gene flanks the locus, whereas the other shows complete linkage. One gene is related to Arabidopsis flower-timing genes Col 9 and Col 10; the other encodes a small predicted membrane protein of unknown function. Notwithstanding the diallelic behaviour of the Primula S locus, analysis of pin and <b>thrum</b> plants reveal three alleles for each gene: two pin and one <b>thrum.</b> © 2007 The Authors...|$|R

40|$|Nectar robbers {{are thought}} rarely to {{pollinate}} flowers, {{especially those with}} sexual organs hidden within corollas. In this study, we examined whether robbers pollinate flowers of distylous Primula secundiflora. Distylous plants have two floral morphs. Pin flowers have long styles and short stamens, and <b>thrum</b> flowers have short styles and long stamens. Flowers of P. secundiflora were commonly robbed by bumble-bees, and robbing holes were always situated {{between high and low}} sexual organs for both floral morphs. We observed that pollen grains of pin flowers were removed while <b>thrum</b> flowers received fresh pollen grains immediately after flowers were robbed. We manipulated flowers so that only nectar robbers could visit them. This resulted in 98 per cent of <b>thrum</b> flowers and 6 per cent of pin flowers setting fruit, and seed number per <b>thrum</b> fruit was also significantly higher than per pin fruit. Our findings suggest that nectar robbers transfer pollen from pin flowers to <b>thrum</b> flowers effectively, and consequently increase male fitness of the pin morph and female fitness of the <b>thrum</b> morph. Such asymmetrical pollen flow caused by nectar robbers may act as an important selective agent in floral fitness and evolution of distyly...|$|R

5000|$|Supergenes have cis-effects due to {{multiple}} loci (which may be within a gene, or {{within a single}} gene's regulatory region), and tight linkage.

It is known that the two forms exist in nature in about equal numbers; and that "legitimate " unions between the two types are much more fertile than "illegitimate " unions within a type (Darwin, 1877). Gregory (1915) found that <b>thrum</b> is dominant to pin, all natural <b>thrums</b> examined being heterozygous, so that the union of <b>thrum</b> and pin gave the two types in almost equal numbers (229 <b>thrum,</b> 236 pin), while <b>thrum</b> selfed gave 3 thrum: 1 pin (39 <b>thrum,</b> 13 pin). In counting natural populations I had two objects in view, to see whether the ratio of the two types diverged significantly from unity, and whether individual populations varied significantly from the mean proportion.
