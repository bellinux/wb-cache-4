40|$|Obtaining an MBA {{degree is}} an {{expensive}} and time-consuming process. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> is ameliorated, however, if a tax deduction can be taken. Although many {{in the business community}} believe they are entitled to deduct <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> obtaining <b>an</b> MBA, <b>the</b> {{fact of the matter is}} that a deduction is not a certainty. There have been numerous litigated cases concerning whether <b>a</b> deduction for <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MBA should be allowed. The cases reveal, however, that it all depends on the particular facts and circumstances. This paper reviews the case law concerning <b>the</b> deductibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> obtaining <b>an</b> MBA: first some older cases, then some more recent cases, and finally the most recent case decided in 2005. Based upon two cases decided by the Tax Court in 2002 and 2004, in which the taxpayers lost, tax practitioners were concerned that a tax deduction for <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MBA was virtually foreclosed for everyone. But in the case decided in 2005, it appears that the Tax Court softened its position. Accordingly, it seems that there is still the possibility <b>of</b> deducting <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> MBA. But again, it’s not automatic and will depend on the facts...|$|R

5|$|After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz {{variation}} 3...Ne4 which {{concentrates on}} the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler variation 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a spatial advantage in the centre with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine variation 4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong pawn centre. The Rubinstein variation 4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between 6.Nbd2 and 6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys the bishop pair and tries to break through on the queenside, while 6.Nc3 keeps the material advantage of a pawn at <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> weakening of the white pawn structure. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines can shock opponents that {{do not know the}} theory) or cripple White's pawn structure.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1942 and November 1943, Groves paid monthly {{visits to}} the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley.

On the other hand, while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles, the electromagnetic process was proven to work, and could be built in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material.

5|$|By 1774, canal {{building}} {{was much better}} understood, and a new attempt was made. The plan was led by Dallaway's son William, who asked Thomas Dadford, Jr., the engineer on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and John Priddy, {{who had been the}} engineer on the Droitwich Canal during its construction, to carry out a survey. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> canal which avoided the river and hence the mills, was put at £16,750, and soon £20,000 had been raised. Deciding that they did not need a new Act of Parliament, since the powers of the 1730 Act were still valid, Yeoman, who had carried out the 1754 survey, was asked to survey the route again, and a route was selected, which would require 12 locks. Work started, with Samuel Jones as engineer, but he was replaced by Priddy within a month. A challenge to the legality of building a canal under the 1730 Act was mounted by landowners and millers in 1775. An injunction was obtained, and the Gloucestershire Assizes ruled that the Act did not cover the work. A new Act was obtained on 25 March 1776, authorising the raising of £20,000 and an extra £10,000 if required. Both sides commissioned the writing of poems to support their causes.|$|E
5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, their parties, {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country. For this purpose, Duhalde created the ministry of production, with functions that used {{to belong to the}} ministries of economy and foreign relations. The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head of the Argentine Industrial Union. Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full dollarization of the Argentine economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a devaluation. Although it was initially expected to make a 40% devaluation, the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar, a 200% devaluation. The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> higher cost of living.|$|E

5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft.
