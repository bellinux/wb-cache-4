5|$|Before the reform, in {{the north}} of the empire the Nuremberg {{standard}} had been in effect, and in Italy the local standards had been even lighter. It is not surprising that an increase by 17% and more met with some inertia. The 1770 edition of the pharmacopoeia Dispensatorium Austriaco-Viennense still used the Nuremberg standard libra medicinalis minor, indicating that even in the Austrian capital Vienna it took some time for the reform to become effective. In 1774, the Pharmacopoea Austriaco-provincialis used <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard,</b> and in 1783 all old apothecaries' weight pieces that were still in use were directed to be destroyed.|$|E

40|$|The Institute of Internal Auditors is in {{the process}} of {{developing}} <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> for <b>the</b> internal auditing profession. The first set of these standards will be implemented with effect from 1 January 2002. The purpose of professional standards is to lay down the minimum requirements to be maintained for acceptable practice. In June 1999, a new formal definition of internal auditing was adopted to address relevant issues with which internal auditing is currently faced. Existing standards, when read in conjunction with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> definition, have deficiencies and these deficiencies have led to <b>the</b> development of <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> for <b>the</b> profession. The purpose of this article is to discuss the limitations of the current standards, to identify the changes incorporated in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards,</b> and to evaluate the changes. The article evaluates whether <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> address <b>the</b> changes in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> definition and highlights the influence of the changes in the standards on the internal auditing profession. The findings are that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> are difficult to analyse, especially because the current standards must still be used in conjunction with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards,</b> yet <b>the</b> changes successfully address the challenges facing the internal auditing profession...|$|R
5|$|In 1887 Michelson {{proposed}} {{the use of}} optical interferometers for the measurement of length, work which contributed to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1907. In 1952 the CIPM {{proposed the}} use of wavelength of a specific light source as the standard for defining length, and in 1960 the CGPM accepted this proposal using radiation corresponding to a transition between specified energy levels of the krypton 86 atom as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> for the metre. By 1975, when the second had been {{defined in terms of}} a physical phenomenon rather than the earth's rotation and Einstein's assertion that the speed of light was constant, the CGPM authorised the CIPM to investigate the use of the speed of light {{as the basis for the}} definition of the metre. This proposal was accepted in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{introduction of}} the metric system in September 1799 was unpopular in large sections of French society. Napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> not only across France but also across the French sphere of influence. Napoleon took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the mesures usuelles (traditional units of measurement) for retail trade—a system of measure that resembled the pre-revolutionary units but {{were based on the}} kilogram and the metre; for example the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g instead of 489.5 g—the value of the livre du roi (the king's pound). Other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner prior to the definitive {{introduction of the}} metric system across parts of Europe {{in the middle of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|When Cunard died in 1865, {{the equally}} {{conservative}} Charles MacIver assumed Cunard's role. The firm retained its reluctance about change and was overtaken by competitors that more quickly adopted new technology. In 1866 Inman started to build screw propelled express liners that matched Cunard's premier unit, the Scotia. Cunard responded with its first high speed screw propellered steamer, Russia which {{was followed by}} two larger editions. In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the White Star Line commissioned the Oceanic and her five sisters. The new White Star record-breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines. White Star also set new standards for comfort by placing the dining saloon midships and doubling the size of cabins. Inman rebuilt its express fleet to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard,</b> but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals. Throughout the 1870s Cunard passage times were longer than either White Star or Inman.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standard</b> rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, they tended to freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|E

40|$|For {{those who}} do not know me, or do not know me well, I would like to provide a bit of background, or perhaps a bit of warning. This quote from Samuel Butler sums it up: "The one serious {{conviction}} that a man should have is that nothing is to be taken too seriously. " Perhaps I do not take things seriously enough for some people. If so, I apologize to anyone I may offend with my comments. Because I was not at this meeting last year, I will be taking a bit of editorial license. By that, I mean I will be talking about the nature of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> as I discuss our implementation of them. That is because I read the proceedings from last year’s meeting in which the presenters were nearly universal in their praise for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards.</b> I do not share their unbridled enthusiasm. In fact, I had two different working titles for this paper. The first was “Bob and the Standards: A Love Story. ” My latest is “Into the coal mine [...] . without a light ” because that is largely what <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> require us to do. Another quote that sums up <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> quite well is “the number one cause of problems is solutions. ” “Problems? ” you might ask. Well, yes – I think we all have to be honest about what we are getting into. As we undertook implementation of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards,</b> and studied <b>the</b> standards, a number of potential problems became apparent. The first of these, I think, is quite obvious. Stated succinctly, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards</b> say that SLPs will know everything {{and be able to do}} everything and they will learn this in their graduate programs. That is because the skills validation study on which <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>standards,</b> in part, were based basically went out and asked practitioners what SLPs need to know. Each practitioner feels that what s/he does is important and that students entering practice should know those skills. The problem is that we are expected to turn out students who make all employers happy; that is, students wh...|$|R
