5|$|After the games, Evans {{returned}} to the United States to continue his studies and collegiate swimming career. Before the 1984 Olympics, Evans travelled to Hong Kong to train with Haller, who was coaching the British colony's swimming team. Evans revitalised himself under his favourite coach and {{returned to}} his old style of sprinting. He <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> ankle later in Perth and missed some training time. He won the Australian 100m breaststroke championship to qualify for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and returned to Arizona to continue training. His Olympic campaign was placed in jeopardy when the ASU threatened to remove Evans from the team for skipping their training camp in Australia. The threat was withdrawn after Evans' father confronted the ASU and pointed out that his son was training, although in a different location. Before the Games, Evans joined the Australians for their final training camp at Stanford University in California. Evans arrived in Los Angeles with the same program as in Moscow; he entered both breaststroke events and the medley relay. Evans started brightly to win his heat of the 100m breaststroke in an Olympic record time of 1m 2.87s. His new mark did not last long—John Moffet broke it in a later heat to relegate Evans to the second-fastest qualifying time.|$|E
5|$|A {{victory against}} Los Angeles in the twelfth {{week of the}} season {{preserved}} Cleveland's undefeated record. The Dons began the scoring in the first quarter with a 75-yard drive engineered by quarterback Glenn Dobbs. The series ended with a short touchdown run by halfback Walt Clay. The Browns came back to tie the game in the second quarter after a 71-yard drive that features several completions from Graham to Lavelli. Lavelli caught a 49-yard pass from Graham for the score. On the next possession, Los Angeles converted a fourth down deep in their own territory, extending a long drive that ended with another touchdown by Clay. Cleveland again evened the score with under two minutes left in the first half on a touchdown pass to Edgar Jones. The Browns pulled away in the third quarter, when Graham ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. Groza later kicked a 36-yard field goal, and an interception by Cliff Lewis set up a run by Tony Adamle for a final touchdown. The final score was 31–14. Graham <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> knee in the fourth quarter, and Edgar Jones, Parseghian and Bob Gaudio also had injuries. The Browns planned to stay at the hot springs in Boyes, California to recover as they prepared to face the 49ers for a second time in San Francisco three days later.|$|E
5|$|The 1931–32 {{season was}} another {{productive}} season for Morenz. With 49 points he {{finished third in}} league scoring, {{and became the first}} player in NHL history to win the Hart Trophy for a third time, also being named to the First All-Star Team again. In a March 17, 1932, game against the New York Americans, Morenz scored his 334th point with an assist, passing Cy Denneny as the NHL record holder for career points. Minor injuries led to Morenz's point totals going down the following season as he finished second on the Canadiens in scoring behind Joliat, the first time in seven years he did not lead the Canadiens, ending up 10th in the league with 35 points. In the playoffs, he had three assists in two games. The 1933–34 season also saw Morenz's goal and point totals fall, to 8 goals and 21 points. Even with his decline in scoring, he still managed to reach a significant milestone, once again passing Cy Denneny to do so. Against the Detroit Red Wings on December 23, 1933, he scored his 249th career goal, to become the NHL leader for career goals. On January 2, 1934, Morenz <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> ankle in a game in New York, bruising the bone and tearing ligaments. It was the first serious injury of his career, and he was unable to play for a month. After returning to the team, Morenz was unable to play at his previous level, and the Canadiens' fans began booing him.|$|E

25|$|Super Bowl XXIII {{started out}} with devastating {{injuries}} on both sides. On the third play of the game, 49ers tackle Steve Wallace {{was taken off the}} field with a broken ankle. Later on, Bengals defensive lineman Tim Krumrie <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> ankle nearly 180 degrees, shattering two bones in his left leg.|$|E
25|$|Kennedy made further {{appearances}} for Celtic {{over the}} next several months, but during a Champions League match against Shakhtar Donetsk on 28 November 2007, he was stretchered off after he <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> knee on landing from an aerial challenge. The initial diagnosis was that he sustained damage to his lateral meniscus and the posterior lateral complex of the same knee he had previously injured, ruling him out for three months. This match proved to be Kennedy's final appearance for Celtic.|$|E

25|$|Lowe's first outing {{was at the}} First Battle of Bull Run, with General Irvin McDowell and the Army of Northeastern Virginia. His {{performance}} was impressive, though he had the misfortune of having to land behind enemy lines. Fortunately he was found {{by members of the}} 31st New York Volunteers before the enemy could discover him, but after landing, he had <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> ankle and was not able to walk out with them. They returned to Fort Corcoran to report his position. Eventually his wife Leontine, disguised as an old hag, came to his rescue with a buckboard and canvas covers and was able to extract him and his equipment safely.|$|E
25|$|Atiyah's {{mathematical}} collaborators include Raoul Bott, Friedrich Hirzebruch and Isadore Singer, and {{his students}} include Graeme Segal, Nigel Hitchin and Simon Donaldson. Together with Hirzebruch, he laid the foundations for topological K-theory, an important tool in algebraic topology, which, informally speaking, describes ways in which spaces can be <b>twisted.</b> <b>His</b> best known result, the Atiyah–Singer index theorem, was proved with Singer in 1963 and is widely used in {{counting the number of}} independent solutions to differential equations. Some of his more recent work was inspired by theoretical physics, in particular instantons and monopoles, which are responsible for some subtle corrections in quantum field theory. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1966 and the Abel Prize in 2004.|$|E
25|$|He later {{made his}} ODI début against Bangladesh, again taking a wicket {{in his first}} over. When Bangladesh later toured England, he made his Test début in the second Test, {{replacing}} the injured Tim Bresnan. After only scoring 5 runs in England's innings and an expensive start with the ball, he later took 3 wickets in 3 overs in his second spell as Bangladesh missed the follow-on target. Pakistan toured England in July and Shahzad was included in England's 12-man squad for the first Test. A week {{in advance of the}} Test, he <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> ankle in a match for Yorkshire. As he was still experiencing discomfort the day before the Test, England chose to drop him from the squad as a precaution and bring in Tim Bresnan.|$|E

25|$|He {{was offered}} a {{professional}} contract with Swansea Town {{at the age of}} seventeen, and he immediately settled into the Second Division side. His debut came at Bramall Lane on 20 December 1952, in {{what turned out to be}} a 7–1 defeat to Sheffield United. However his progress was halted when he <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> knee on National Service, though this injury came as he was messing around outside the cook house rather than on parade or in the 9th Battalion's march to the Army Cup. He went straight back into the first team upon his recovery, and he was played mostly at centre-half, or in his preferred position at right-half. He remained in the first eleven under Ron Burgess, who was appointed manager following McCandless' death in July 1955.|$|E
25|$|After {{their victory}} over Vanderbilt, Alabama moved up one {{position}} in the polls to the No. 3 spot prior to their first non-conference game of the season. In a game that saw starting quarterback Joe Namath injured in the second quarter, backup Steve Sloan rallied the Crimson Tide to a 21–0 victory over the NC State Wolfpack in Tuscaloosa. After a scoreless first quarter, Namath <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> knee with just over 6:00 remaining in the half. Sloan entered the game and led Alabama on a 69-yard drive that culminated with his one-yard touchdown run to give Alabama a 7–0 halftime lead. The Crimson Tide then closed {{the game with a}} three-yard Steve Bowman touchdown run in the third and a 10-yard Sloan touchdown pass to Tommy Tolleson in the fourth that made the final score 21–0. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against NC State to 3–0.|$|E
25|$|The Ducks {{entered the}} game ranked No. 2 {{in both the}} AP poll and the BCS standings. A win in this game, {{followed}} by wins against UCLA and Oregon State, would almost assuredly result in a berth in the BCS National Championship Game in New Orleans. The Ducks started the game hot, with a 39-yard touchdown run by Dennis Dixon and a successful two-point conversion. Following an Arizona interception, the Ducks had the ball back on the Arizona 4-yard line threatening to score again. However, Dixon threw an interception that was returned 45 yards and eventually capitalized by the Wildcats as a touchdown, cutting the score to 8–7. The Ducks responded with another solid drive getting {{the ball to the}} Arizona 15 and looked set to score again. On 2nd and 7, Oregon quarterback Dennis Dixon (the leading Heisman candidate at this point of the season) fell to the ground without being touched. Upon review it was clear that Dixon <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> already-injured knee and tore his ACL. It would later be revealed that Dixon had actually torn the ligament in the previous week's game against Arizona State.|$|E

25|$|The third Test at Old Trafford {{followed}} the same course, ending in a draw after rain washed out the fourth day {{and much of the}} second, although it was an eventful match for Evans. In Australia's first innings he took three dismissals; however he dropped two earlier chances to dismiss Neil Harvey and Alan Davidson, the miss of Harvey was costly as he went on to make 122, having been 52 at the time. In England's innings, Evans scored a quick 44 not out in 39 minutes on what was at that stage a wet wicket. Evans took three further dismissals in Australia's second innings as they collapsed to 35/8. At Leeds, more rain and England's defensive batting ensured a fourth draw of the series. Batting first England scored 167 in 109.4 overs, Evans's contribution was 25 runs in 90 minutes. Three England players suffered injuries {{during the course of the}} innings; the third of these was Bailey who <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> knee as he attempted to make his ground after a mix up with Evans. Facing a 99-run deficit, England continued to bat slowly in their second innings adding 275 in 177.3 overs, Bailey batted over four hours with the tail on the final day to leave Australia one hour and fifty-five minutes to chase 177; they were 30 short when play ended.|$|E
500|$|Overall, Bogdan-Pitești {{claimed to}} have been held in {{judicial}} custody for some forty separate incidents, stressing that all these convictions were owed to political crimes—while reporting this statement, T. Vianu noted that at least some should in fact be considered punishments for various misdemeanors. In time, the anarchist boyar had also {{come to be known as}} an inveterate criminal and jailbird, which attracted him the disparaging moniker Bogdan-Văcărești (after Văcărești prison in Bucharest).

500|$|Reinhart {{suffered}} a serious injury {{midway through the}} 1983–84 season. [...] Skating behind his net during {{a game against the}} Winnipeg Jets, his skate caught a rut and he <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> back as he fell. He had to be carried off the ice on a stretcher, and was initially diagnosed with back spasms. He was later diagnosed as having {{suffered a}} herniated disc. He missed 51 games {{as a result of the}} injury, but scored a goal and an assist on his return, a 4–1 victory over the Hartford Whalers. Despite missing the majority of the season, Reinhart was the Flames' offensive leader in the 1984 playoffs, leading the team and finishing first amongst all players who did not reach the finals with 17 points.|$|E

500|$|Though Everton {{had won a}} {{place in}} the European Cup, English clubs were banned from European {{competitions}} following the Heysel Stadium disaster. Southall remained bitter over this, blaming UEFA for the tragedy and stating that the ban was a convenient way to break up English dominance of European competitions. Limited to domestic competitions, Everton won the FA Charity Shield with a 2–0 win over Manchester United; during the celebrations Southall wore a T-shirt saying [...] "I Love My Wife" [...] as a symbolic gesture following tabloid stories of an alleged affair. After getting sent off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October, Kendall criticised Southall in the press by saying he [...] "let the lads down". Despite this set-back, he agreed to sign a six-year contract in December, which was then the longest contract the club had ever issued. However, he <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> ankle ligaments on international duty with ten league games left to play. In his absence, his deputy Bobby Mimms took his place, and Everton lost both the league title and the 1986 FA Cup Final to Liverpool.|$|E
500|$|Rivera {{began the}} 2012 season by blowing a save on Opening Day but {{followed}} it with eight scoreless innings and five saves {{for the remainder}} of April. After just nine appearances, his season was prematurely ended by a freak injury; prior to a May3 game against the Kansas City Royals, Rivera <b>twisted</b> <b>his</b> right knee on the field's warning track while shagging balls during batting practice, causing him to tear his right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Speculation grew that the injury would end his career, as he had hinted at retirement in spring training. Rivera put those concerns to rest the following day when he announced his intentions to return, saying, [...] "Write it down in big letters. I'm not going down like this." [...] He successfully underwent ACL reconstructive surgery on June12, while his meniscus, previously thought to have been damaged, {{did not need to be}} repaired. Rafael Soriano filled in as closer in Rivera's absence and saved 42games in 46opportunities. Rivera signed a one-year, $10million contract in the offseason to remain with the team.|$|E
