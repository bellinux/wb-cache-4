5|$|The {{role of the}} sea {{in human}} culture has been {{important}} for centuries, as people experience the sea in contradictory ways: as powerful but serene, beautiful but dangerous. Human responses to the sea {{can be found in}} artforms including literature, art, poetry, film, theatre, and classical music. The earliest art representing boats is 40,000 years old. Since then, artists in different countries and cultures have depicted the sea. Symbolically, the sea has been perceived as a hostile environment populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. In the works of the psychiatrist Carl Jung, the sea symbolises the personal and <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> in dream interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{distinguished}} between the personal unconscious and <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b> To find the positive therapeutic direction as impartially as he could, Jung identified and interpreted dream images generated by <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> in a constructive way rather than reducing them to personal indications. Since collective themes {{are common to}} all humanity, they find their counterpart in mythological motifs.|$|E
25|$|In Jungian psychology, archetypes {{are highly}} {{developed}} elements of <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Being unconscious, {{the existence of}} archetypes can only be deduced indirectly by examining behavior, images, art, myths, religions, or dreams. Carl Jung understood archetypes as universal, archaic patterns and images that derive from <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> and are the psychic counterpart of instinct. They are inherited potentials which are actualized when they enter consciousness as images or manifest in behavior on interaction with the outside world. They are autonomous and hidden forms which are transformed once they enter consciousness and are given particular expression by individuals and their cultures.|$|E

50|$|<b>Collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> (kollektives Unbewusstes), a term {{coined by}} Carl Jung, refers to {{structures}} of the unconscious mind which are shared among beings of the same species. According to Jung, <b>the</b> human <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> is populated by instincts and by archetypes: universal symbols such as the Great Mother, the Wise Old Man, the Shadow, the Tower, Water, the Tree of Life, and many more.|$|R
50|$|Based on {{empirical}} inquiry, Jung {{felt that}} all humans, regardless {{of racial and}} geographic differences, share <b>the</b> same <b>collective</b> pool of instincts and images, though these manifest differently due to the moulding influence of culture. However, above {{and in addition to}} <b>the</b> primordial <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> people within a certain culture may share additional bodies of primal collective ideas.|$|R
25|$|Archetypes are innate {{universal}} pre-conscious psychic dispositions {{that form}} the substrate from which the basic themes of human life emerge. The archetypes are components of <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> and serve to organize, direct and inform human thought and behaviour. Archetypes hold control of the human life cycle.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the central}} {{concepts}} of analytical psychology is individuationâ€”the lifelong psychological process of differentiation {{of the self}} out of each individual's conscious and unconscious elements. Jung considered {{it to be the}} main task of human development. He created some of the best known psychological concepts, including synchronicity, archetypal phenomena, <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> the psychological complex, and extraversion and introversion.|$|E
25|$|Archetypes {{abound in}} {{contemporary}} films and literature {{as they have}} in creative works of the past, being unconscious projections of <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> that serve to embody central societal and developmental struggles in a media that entertain as well as instruct. Films are a contemporary form of mythmaking, reflecting our response to ourselves and the mysteries and wonders of our existence.|$|E
50|$|It {{appears that}} the term was {{inspired}} by Carl Jung's use of <b>the</b> term <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Jellicoe admired Jung, {{but the use of}} 'collective landscape' in the above quotation has something in common with its use in collectivism. Unlike the terms public park and national park, <b>the</b> term <b>collective</b> landscape is a psychological construct and an abstract concept.|$|R

25|$|Automatic {{writing was}} an {{important}} vehicle for action painters Franz Kline (in his black and white paintings), Jackson Pollock, Mark Tobey and Cy Twombly, who used gesture, surface, and line to create calligraphic, linear symbols and skeins that resemble language, and resonate as powerful manifestations from <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b> Robert Motherwell in his Elegy to the Spanish Republic series also painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> which reflects the cosmic {{order and the}} history of the human species, is {{the most important part of}} the mind. It contains archetypes, which are manifested in symbols that appear in dreams, disturbed states of mind, and various products of culture. Jungians are less interested in infantile development and psychological conflict between wishes and the forces that frustrate them than in integration between different parts of the person. The object of Jungian therapy was to mend such splits. Jung focused in particular on problems of middle and later life. His objective was to allow people to experience the split-off aspects of themselves, such as the anima (a man's suppressed female self), the animus (a woman's suppressed male self), or the shadow (an inferior self-image), and thereby attain wisdom.|$|E
25|$|Carl Jung also applied psychoanalytic {{theory to}} art. C.G. Jung was a Swiss psychiatrist, an {{influential}} thinker, {{and founder of}} analytical psychology. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the psyche through exploring the worlds of dreams, art, mythology, world religion and philosophy. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, alchemy, astrology, sociology, as well as literature and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological archetype, <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> and his theory of synchronicity. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as coincidence were not merely due to chance but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic. He argued that a collective unconscious and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American Abstract expressionists in the 1940s and 1950s. His work inspired the surrealist concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.|$|E
50|$|The role {{of images}} which spontaneously {{arise in the}} human psyche (images include the {{interconnection}} between affect, images, and instinct) to communicate the dynamic processes taking place in <b>the</b> personal and <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> images {{which can be used}} to help the ego move in the direction of psychic wholeness.|$|R
50|$|Jung's {{suggestion}} that Hitler personified <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> Aryan <b>unconscious</b> deeply interested and influenced Miguel Serrano, who later concluded that Jung was merely psychologizing the ancient, sacred mystery of archetypal possession by the gods, independent metaphysical powers that rule over their respective races and occasionally possess their members. A similar esoteric thesis is also {{put forward by}} Michael Moynihan in his book Lords of Chaos.|$|R
50|$|Individuation is {{a process}} of {{transformation}} whereby <b>the</b> personal and <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> are brought into consciousness (e.g., by means of dreams, active imagination, or free association) to be assimilated into the whole personality. It is a completely natural process necessary for the integration of the psyche. Individuation has a holistic healing effect on the person, both mentally and physically.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{childhood}} memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny mannequin {{into the end}} of the wooden ruler from his pencil case and placed it inside the case. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language. He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with totems in indigenous cultures, such as the collection of soul-stones near Arlesheim or the tjurungas of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced {{in a way that was}} strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about. His observations about symbols, archetypes, and <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} group eventually explores {{all four}} labyrinths, successfully unlocking the {{doors in the}} Velvet Room and restoring Zen's memories. He reveals that his true identity is the human avatar of Chronos, a manifestation of death created by <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious,</b> and Rei is really a girl named Niko who died of illness twelve years prior. When Chronos came to escort her to the afterlife, he was intrigued by her descent into nihilism {{as a result of}} having lived an apparently meaningless life. Chronos created the alternate Yasogami High, split himself into Zen and a powerful being known as the Clockwork God, and sealed both of their memories {{in order to try to}} bring Rei happiness. The Clockwork God is the one responsible for trapping SEES and the Investigation Team in the alternate Yasogami, hoping for them to traverse the labyrinths and recover Zen's memories so they can merge and become Chronos once again: this would result in the teams being erased from time when their tasks were completed. The Clockwork God abducts Rei and transports her to the top of a clock tower outside the school. SEES and the Investigation Team decide to help Zen rescue Rei, and they ascend the tower and defeat the Clockwork God. After spending some carefree time together before the pocket dimension collapses, Zen and Rei vanish into the afterlife, while SEES and the Investigation Team promise to meet again someday and return home, although their memories of the incident are erased.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the late}} 21st century, human culture begins to {{fragment}} into different aspects. Following {{the events of}} Necromancer, humanity has colonized some 14 Younger Worlds. The inhabitants of these worlds have evolved culturally, and to some extent, genetically, into several specialized Splinter Cultures. This was done by <b>the</b> racial <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> itself as an experiment to see what aspects of humanity are the most important.

500|$|A central {{concept for}} the series is <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious,</b> a place {{generated}} by the hearts of humanity and from which Personas are born. According to the official Persona Club P3 book, <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious</b> was generated by the primitive life on Earth {{as a means of}} containing the spiritual essence of Nyx, a space-born being whose presence would cause the death of all life on Earth. Her body was damaged by the impact and became the moon, while her psyche was left on the surface and locked away at the heart of <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious.</b> The fragments of Nyx's psyche, known as [...] "Shadows", are both a threat and a crucial part of humanity's existence. To further help defend against hostile Shadows, people generated the deities that exist within <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious,</b> many of which manifest as Personas. Nyx appears in Persona 3 as the antagonist. The major dungeon locations in each game (such as Tartarus in Persona 3 and the Palace in Persona 5) are generated by the latent wishes or anxieties of humans, and are generally used by another force for their own ends. A recurring location is the Velvet Room, a place between reality and unconsciousness created by Philemon that changes form depending on the psyche of its current guest. Its inhabitants, especially an enigmatic old man called Igor, aid the main characters by helping them hone their Persona abilities.|$|E
500|$|Although {{not present}} in every New Age group, a core belief within the milieu is in channeling. This {{is the idea that}} humans beings, {{sometimes}} (although not always) in a state of trance, can act [...] "as a channel of information from sources other than their normal selves". These sources are varyingly described as being God, gods and goddesses, ascended masters, spirit guides, extraterrestrials, angels, devas, historical figures, <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> elementals, or nature spirits. Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of [...] "articulated revelation", and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.|$|E
500|$|Later, Scully {{returns to}} {{apologize}} to Azar and agrees {{to listen to her}} ideas. [...] Azar shares her knowledge of Buddhism, the concept of <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious,</b> and the idea of personal auras. Azar believes these concepts might explain these strange occurrences. After a confrontation with Maggie at the hospital, Scully walks through Chinatown. Seeing the woman who appeared earlier at the crosswalk, she follows her to a small Buddhist temple before the mysterious woman seemingly vanishes. Inside the temple, Scully has a vision of what is ailing Waterston. She returns to the hospital with Azar to visit Waterston.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{assesses the}} significance of Jeanette Winterson's 'Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit' 25 years after its initial publication. It discusses the {{many ways in which}} the text circulates as a 'classic', as a much loved comic novel of growing up, as teaching material, as an aspect of popular/literary culture, and as part of Wintersonâ€™s own mythobiography. Its success may be attributed {{to the ways in which}} the narrative â€˜hooksâ€™ itself onto classic texts, which circulate in <b>the</b> cultureâ€™s <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b> <b>The</b> paper combines these emphases to consider the novel as a literary classic that both inscribes and subverts the canonical tradition in the process of reworking autobiography as art.

[...] Alexander Jacob suggests that the Jesus story was the Judaized, historicized version of a very ancient myth which {{can be described as}} archetypal (i.e. its origins ultimately lie rooted in <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> human <b>unconscious).</b>|$|R
500|$|The game {{takes place}} in Japan in 1996, {{in the town of}} Mikage-cho. All the main {{characters}} attend St. Hermelin High, the town's high school, being in Class 4 taught by Saeko Takami. The other main feature of the town is the local branch of SEBEC (Saeki Electronics & Biological & Energy Corporation). All the main characters have the power to summon Personas, described in the manual as [...] "the power of their hidden selves".

500|$|The folkish {{sector of}} the {{movement}} deems Heathenry to be the indigenous religion of a biologically distinct Nordic race. Some practitioners explain this by asserting that the religion is intrinsically connected to <b>the</b> <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> of this race, with prominent American Heathen Stephen McNallen developing this into a concept which he termed [...] "metagenetics". McNallen and many others in the [...] "ethnic" [...] faction of Heathenry explicitly deny that they are racist, although Gardell noted that their views would be deemed racist under certain definitions of the word. Gardell considered many [...] "ethnic" [...] Heathens to be ethnic nationalists, and many folkish practitioners express disapproval of multiculturalism and the mixture of different races in modern Europe, advocating a position of racial separatism. In this group's discourse, there is much talk of [...] "ancestors" [...] and [...] "homelands", although these concepts may be very vaguely defined. Those adopting the [...] "ethnic" [...] folkish position have been criticized by both anti-racist and radical racist factions, the former deeming [...] "ethnic" [...] Heathenry a front for racism and the latter deeming its adherents race traitors for their failure to fully embrace the white supremacist cause.|$|E
500|$|The main {{character}} of each Persona {{game is a}} silent protagonist representing the player, with a manner described by the series' director as [...] "silent and cool". When the writer for new story content in Eternal Punishments PSP version wished for the {{main character}} to have spoken dialogue, this was vetoed as it went against the series tradition. Two recurring characters generated by <b>the</b> <b>Collective</b> <b>Unconscious</b> are Philemon and Nyarlathotep, the respective representatives of {{the positive and negative}} traits of humanity. In Innocent Sin, the two reveal that they are engaged in a proxy contest as to whether humanity can embrace its contradictory feelings and find a higher purpose before destroying itself. Philemon makes appearances in later Persona titles as a blue butterfly. Many of the major antagonists in the series are personifications of death generated by the human subconscious. The central theme of the Persona series is exploration of the human psyche and the main characters discovering their true selves. The stories generally focus on the main cast's interpersonal relationships and psychologies. There is also an underlying focus on [...] "the human soul".|$|E

5000|$|On {{the basis}} of {{research}} by Mattias Gardell, Goodrick-Clarke traces the original conception of the Odinist religion by Alexander Rud Mills in the 1920s, and its modern revival by Else Christensen and her Odinist Fellowship from 1969 onwards. Christensen's politics were left-wing, deriving from anarcho-syndicalism, but she believed that leftist ideas had a formative influence on both Italian Fascism and German National-Socialism, whose totalitarian perversions were a betrayal of these movements' socialist roots. Elements of a leftist and libertarian racial-socialism could therefore be reclaimed from the fascism {{in which they had}} become encrusted. However, Christensen was also convinced that the diseases of Western culture demanded a spiritual remedy. Mills' almost-forgotten writings inspired her with a programme for re-connecting with the gods and goddesses of the old Norse and Germanic pantheons, which she identified with the archetypes in Carl Jung's concept of <b>the</b> racial <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious.</b> According to Christensen, therefore, Odinism is organically related to race in that [...] "its principles are encoded in our genes".|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study delves {{into the}} notion of klezmer as both a link {{in the chain of}} Jewish {{continuity}} and a mirror to the multifarious variations of Jewish identification. It explores the music in relation to various events within the last century of Jewish history, such as the Jewish enlightenment movement, migration from Eastern Europe and the Holocaust, and draws on various discourses of memory and identity to frame and elucidate the music. It also proposes the theory that klezmer could indeed be an archetype, comprised of mnemonic and archetypal musical devices, that resides deep within <b>the</b> Jewish <b>collective</b> <b>unconscious</b> and rouses nostalgic yearnings to reclaim a cherished yet imperilled heritage. Embracing this notion of klezmer as archetype sheds light on the contemporary klezmer scene, particularly in Germany, Poland and the United States of America, and the many social, cultural and moral sensibilities that define it. Paving the way for the various avenues of Jewish, and often non-Jewish, memory work and identification klezmer not only sounds the synthesis of cultural, social and religious boundaries, but also emerges as a bastion of Jewish continuity...|$|R
