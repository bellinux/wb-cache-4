25|$|In Switzerland a <b>{{transfer}}</b> <b>tax</b> (Umsatzabgabe) is levied on {{the transfer}} of domestic or foreign securities such as bonds and shares, {{where one of the}} parties or intermediaries is a Swiss security broker. Other securities such as options futures, etc. do not qualify as taxable securities. Swiss brokers include banks and bank-linked financial institutions. The duty is levied at a rate of 0.15% for domestic securities and 0.3% for foreign securities. However, there are numerous exemptions to the Swiss <b>transfer</b> <b>tax.</b> These are among others: Eurobonds, other bonds denominated in a foreign currency and the trading stock of professional security brokers. The revenue of the Swiss <b>transfer</b> <b>tax</b> was CHF 1.9 billion in 2007 or 0.37% of GDP.|$|E

40|$|When the United States {{acted to}} {{phase-out}} its estate tax by 2010, it joined {{a small but}} growing group of countries which have also repealed their wealth <b>transfer</b> <b>taxes.</b> In Canada, federal gift and estate taxes were repealed in 1972 and provincial wealth <b>transfer</b> <b>taxes</b> were abolished in the 1970 s and 1980 s.

This paper reviews the abolition of wealth <b>transfer</b> <b>taxes</b> in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, relying on public choice theories of politically efficient revenue structures to help explain the repeal of these taxes in each country. Part II outlines the essential elements of public choice theory and its implications for tax policy.

25|$|The purchase-like Cafritz lease was controversial. Since no deeds for the {{improvements}} changed hands, Cafritz {{was able to}} avoid paying $3 million in transfer taxes and recordation fees. Since the District of Columbia did not tax leases, Cafritz only paid taxes and fees on the land, which amounted to only $620,000.

25|$|Historically, in many countries, a {{contract}} {{needs to have}} a stamp affixed to make it valid. The charge for the stamp is either a fixed amount or a percentage {{of the value of the}} transaction. In most countries, the stamp has been abolished but stamp duty remains. Stamp duty is levied in the UK on the purchase of shares and securities, the issue of bearer instruments, and certain partnership transactions. Its modern derivatives, stamp duty reserve tax and stamp duty land tax, are respectively charged on transactions involving securities and land. Stamp duty has the effect of discouraging speculative purchases of assets by decreasing liquidity.
