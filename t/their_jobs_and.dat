5|$|These {{plans were}} {{extremely}} controversial. All three envisaged {{reducing the number}} of stalls from 205 to 140–160 to increase space, and all three involved splitting the market into isolated clusters of stalls, significantly altering its character and appearance. The Eastern Daily Press organised a campaign against the perceived unattractiveness of the designs, the proposed {{reduction in the number of}} stalls which would mean stallholders losing <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> the remaining stallholders facing rent increases to cover the difference, and the change to the character of central Norwich that such a radical redesign of the market would entail. A petition of over 12,000 signatories rejecting all three proposed designs was gathered.|$|E
5|$|Fear of {{the loss}} of one's purpose in life is a theme in Vonnegut's works. The Great Depression forced Vonnegut to witness the devastation many people felt when they lost <b>their</b> <b>jobs,</b> <b>and</b> while at General Electric, Vonnegut {{witnessed}} machines being built {{to take the place of}} human labor. He confronts these things in his works through references to the growing use of automation and its effects on human society. This is most starkly represented in his first novel, Player Piano, where many Americans are left purposeless and unable to find work as machines replace human workers. Loss of purpose is also depicted in Galápagos, where a florist rages at her spouse for creating a robot able to do her job, and in Timequake, where an architect kills himself when replaced by computer software.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} {{to rein in the}} SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist fervour. Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the well-being {{and perceptions of}} organizational change of 1560 UK and 1414 Australian managers using the frame of psychological contract theory.

The results support these hypotheses, and demonstrate all change is difficult, but hard change is most detrimental. Directors are more positive than lower level managers about <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> organization, and are more positive about change. Negative effects of change are strongest in the public sector and Australian managers are more satisfied than UK managers with <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> the organization they work within.

After three months, the pair decided that they would go on an adventure – walking through western Victoria and New South Wales. In February 1936, Kingsbury and Avery left <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> began travelling north, working on various farms and estates. The pair eventually arrived in Sydney several months later, and returned to Melbourne on the first train back. Kingsbury resumed working as a real estate agent, while Avery worked as a nurseryman.

As the war in Europe escalated, Kingsbury and Avery made up their minds to enlist. Despite his parents' disapproval, Kingsbury signed up to the Australian Imperial Force on 29 May 1940.|$|E
5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences.

The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E
5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple have lost <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal {{to stand up for}} himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with their relationship. However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep their relationship at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue their relationship more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into their relationship and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E
40|$|If workers {{anticipate}} a technological innovation, some workers {{may decide to}} quit <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> retrain themselves to acquire the skills which are needed by this new technology. However, this may facilitate the innovation {{and make it a}} self-fulfilling prophecy. This self-fulfilling mechanism is reinforced if the anticipated innovation causes job insecurity for workers who do not retrain themselves <b>and</b> keep <b>their</b> current <b>job,</b> but realize that the innovation may make <b>their</b> <b>job</b> obsolete. If these workers engage in precautionary saving and cut their consumption expenditures, aggregate output contracts. This gives the other workers an extra incentive to quit <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> acquire new skills, and therefore facilitates even more the innovation which consumers were worried about. This paper formalizes this idea. It also provides an illustration of how a first-order Taylor-approximation of the Euler equation yields an effect of precautionary saving. ...|$|R

5|$|Brezhnev's family, Yuri, Galina and Yuri Churbanov, were {{investigated}} and all, {{with the exception}} of Galina, were arrested on charges of political corruption during Mikhail Gorbachev's administration. Churbanov, Brezhnev's son-in-law, was sentenced to twelve years in prison on charges of large-scale embezzlement and corruption. By December 1988 Churbanov had been stripped of all state honours, and sent to a labour camp. Galina, {{along with the rest of}} Brezhnev's family, lost all their state privileges. The city of Brezhnev reverted to its old name Naberezhnye Chelny, and a group within the Soviet leadership wanted to rename all towns, street, factories and institutions bearing Brezhnev's name. This was actually carried through by the authorities in December 1988 when the Soviet Government issued a decree which stated all town, streets, factories, institutions and the like bearing Brezhnev's and Konstantin Chernenko's were to revert to their former name. According to his grandson Andrei Brezhnev, the very name Brezhnev had become a curse for the family, and several family members had been forced out of <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> their friends had deserted them. Brezhnev, who had inflated his role in World War II, was rescinded the Order of Victory on 21 September 1989 in a Supreme Soviet convocation.|$|E
5|$|The Commander Keen series {{began in}} 1990 when John Carmack, then a game {{programmer}} at Softdisk, {{came up with}} a method to produce scrolling graphics for a 2D platform video game on IBM-compatible general-purpose computers. After a demo port of Super Mario Bros. 3 failed to entice Nintendo, he and a group of his coworkers from Softdisk—including programmer John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack—used the technique to make an original trilogy of shareware episodes for publisher Apogee Software. The game, Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, was a large success for the market, and led the group to quit <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> found id Software. The game was followed by four more episodes during 1991: Keen Dreams, a pair titled Goodbye, Galaxy, and Aliens Ate My Babysitter. Further plans were made for another trilogy to be produced in 1992 under the name The Universe is Toast, but before any work began it was cancelled due to the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. Id did not return to the series afterwards, instead continuing to focus on 3D first-person shooters.|$|E
5|$|The second {{considered}} {{application is}} animal agriculture. Cochrane argues that animals possess concrete rights {{not to be}} made to suffer or be killed while being raised for food. The book argues that factory farming inflicts suffering upon the animals used, and this suffering outweighs the cost to humans of not using the method. Killing animals for their flesh is also challenged, and objections that this infringes on human liberty, that many humans would lose <b>their</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> that flesh-consumption is necessary for human health are all considered and rejected. Milk and egg production may be permissible under certain circumstances, provided animals are not killed or made to suffer, and, equally, animal corpses could be used provided that the animals have died naturally. Three counter arguments are considered. First, Cochrane contends that the fact farmed animals would not exist {{were it not for the}} human desire for their flesh is irrelevant: it is not clear that creating animals is good for them, and, even if it is, doing a good thing for an animal will not justify subsequently harming them, just as it would not in a human case. Second, Cochrane considers the fact that some animals are killed by nonhuman predators. He rejects Regan's claim that intervention is not required when killers are not moral agents and the consequentialist claim that interference will do more harm than good, instead suggesting that nonhuman predators need to kill to survive, but humans do not. Third, he considers the fact that animals are killed in the harvesting process. These animals, he suggests, are killed for human survival, but as fewer are killed than would be killed were humans eating meat, they do not possess a concrete right to life. Despite this, political communities must take steps to ensure that fewer animals are killed in harvest.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study of the heroines' efforts to have self-fulfilment in life through <b>job</b> <b>and</b> love in two different novels, Villette and Namaku Hiroko. It examines the background or conditions of each heroine which lead them to have the idea of self-fulfilment and their struggle to have self-fulfilment. Since there are two heroines, {{it is assumed that}} there are some similarities and dissimilarities between both of them. To show those similarities and dissimilarities, a literary approach, by using conflict and characterization, is applied. Besides, library reaserch is also conducted to collect criticisms and books. The first similarity between both heroines, Lucy Snowe and Hiroko, is that they face hard conditions or surroundings which lead them to have the idea of self-fulfilment. The idea of self-fulfilment, as a matter of fact, reveals that both of them are encouraged to have a <b>job</b> <b>and</b> a "heterosexual love". The second similarity is that both of them have to encounter many conflicts in <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> love. Yet, <b>their</b> struggles to have self-fulfilment through <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> love are not exactly the same way. Lucy's struggle to become a teacher is not as complex as Hiroko's struggle to achieve a steady job. Another difference is on the way the heroines gain a heterosexual love. However, both heroines' strong-determination enable them to solve all the conflicts they encounter. As a result, they are able to have self-fulfilment through <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> love. Nevertheless, the roles of the opposite sex's love, Paul's love to Lucy and Yoshida's love to Hiroko, also contribute to their self-fulfilment...|$|R
