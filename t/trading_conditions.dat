She was wrecked on her maiden voyage in 1949, the sixth ship built by Harland and Wolff to suffer this fate.

5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{of the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century, and emergency laws aimed at restricting drinking during the First World War created difficult <b>trading</b> <b>conditions</b> for brewers. In 1919 net profit was reported at £22,325 (£900,000 at 2010 prices). Samuel Wentworth Webster, a director of the company and grandson of the founder, died in 1928 with a personalty of £45,000 (£2.2million in 2010). In 1928, one of the brewery's most successful beers was launched; Webster's Green Label, a light mild ale. In 1929 the company's entire stock of properties, land and brewery buildings was valued at £468,833 (£23.2million in 2010). The company took over Joseph Stocks of Halifax in December 1932, which could trace its origins back to 1790. In 1957, Webster's took over the brewer, John Ainley & Sons of Huddersfield and Woodhead Brothers of Elland, near Halifax, a mineral water manufacturer. The company dray horses, used for local beer deliveries, were retired by the end of the 1950s. In 1961 Webster's bought Daniel Fielding & Sons of Halifax, which added 19 public houses to their tied estate. The same year the company sought out partnership with the national brewer Watney Mann in order to benefit from the technical knowledge of the much larger company. In return Webster's brewed and sold the brewery conditioned Watney's Red Barrel ale throughout their tied estate. In 1962, a reciprocal trading agreement was reached with Ind Coope's North East division which saw Webster's houses stock lager for the first time. That same year the group won the contract to bottle Tuborg for West Yorkshire.|$|E

Yet, the effectiveness of <b>trade</b> <b>conditions</b> in IMF programs has not been systematically studied. Using a unique dataset, this paper provides such an assessment. It finds that <b>trade</b> <b>conditions</b> are associated with an increase in trade openness on average, but the effect comes mostly from countries that, by some measure, have a high degree of "willingness to reform.

25|$|Fair {{trade is}} a social {{movement}} whose stated {{goal is to help}} producers in developing countries achieve better <b>trading</b> <b>conditions</b> and to promote sustainable farming. Members of the movement advocate the payment of higher prices to exporters, as well as improved social and environmental standards. The movement focuses in particular on commodities, or products which are typically exported from developing countries to developed countries, but also consumed in domestic markets (e.g. Brazil, India and Bangladesh) most notably handicrafts, coffee, cocoa, wine, sugar, fresh fruit, chocolate, flowers and gold. The movement seeks to promote greater equity in international trading partnerships through dialogue, transparency, and respect. It promotes sustainable development by offering better <b>trading</b> <b>conditions</b> to, and securing the rights of, marginalized producers and workers in developing countries. Fair trade is grounded in three core beliefs; first, producers have the power to express unity with consumers. Secondly, the world trade practices that currently exist promote the unequal distribution of wealth between nations. Lastly, buying products from producers in developing countries at a fair price is a more efficient way of promoting sustainable development than traditional charity and aid.|$|E
25|$|The hotel's heyday was in {{the early}} 20th century, when it played host to royalty, {{politicians}} and film stars as well as staging many dinners, concerts and dances in the Grosvenor Suites. King George VI, Winston Churchill, Neville Chamberlain, Charlie Chaplin, James Cagney and Joe Louis attended functions or stayed in the hotel at this time. Despite its previous success, as the century continued, the hotel ran into financial difficulties and closed in 1969.

By December the fleet passed the Great Fish River—where Dias had turned back—and sailed into unknown waters. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at Calicut. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favourable <b>trading</b> <b>conditions</b> were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there. Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India.|$|E

In 1936 – {{during the height of}} the Depression – the company sought to raise additional share capital in order to fund expansion of manufacturing capacity and capitalise on an agreement with Delman of New York.

Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies wrote back to Bligh, his instructions being received on 31 December 1807. [...] The instructions were to stop the barter of spirits and H.V. Evatt concludes in his history of the Rebellion that ...

2500|$|The English {{doctrine}} of restraint of trade was {{the catalyst for}} {{much of what is}} now called [...] "competition laws" [...] (or sometimes [...] "antitrust"). These laws are a way of restraining those who would restrain [...] "free competition" [...] in the market economy, through monopolising production, setting up cartels, imposing unfair <b>trading</b> <b>conditions,</b> prices and so on. The English approach has traditionally been very flexible and liberal in its scope, but draconian when it did deem certain behaviour to be in restraint of trade. Many of these laws around {{the end of the nineteenth}} century were focused on the emasculation of trade unionism, until the reforming government of 1906 and the Trade Disputes Act 1906. Aside from the common law, legislation was introduced shortly after the second world war to foot policy on a statutory basis, the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act 1948, followed later by the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 and the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965.|$|E
