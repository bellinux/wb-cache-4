500|$|Feminist {{economics}} often {{assert that}} power relations exist within the economy, and therefore, must be assessed in economic models {{in ways that}} they previously have been overlooked. For example, in [...] "neoclassical texts, the sale of labor {{is viewed as a}} mutually beneficial exchange that benefits both parties. [...] No mention is made of the power inequities in the exchange which tend to give the employer power over the employee." [...] These power relations often favor men and there is [...] "never any mention made of the particular difficulties <b>that</b> <b>confront</b> women in the workplace." [...] Consequently, [...] "Understanding power and patriarchy helps us to analyze how male-dominated economic institutions actually function and why women are often at a disadvantage in the workplace." [...] Feminist economists often extend these criticisms to many aspects of the social world, arguing that power relations are an endemic and important feature of society.|$|E

[...] Charlie Spicer, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press, described the actions of Erhard's representatives with regard to the book as [...] "a desperate campaign by someone with something to hide".

In 1942 the Central Conference of American Rabbis had abandoned its former anti-Zionist stance, and adopted a resolution favoring {{the creation of a}} Jewish army in Palestine, to fight alongside other Allied armies, and under Allied command. Sack and other prominent Reform rabbis opposed this; meeting on March 18, 1942, they agreed [...] "there was a need to revitalize Reform Judaism, to oppose Jewish nationalism, and to publicize their point of view". They planned [...] "for a meeting of non-Zionist Reform Rabbis to discuss the problems <b>that</b> <b>confront</b> Judaism and Jews in the world emergency", to be held in Atlantic City. 36 rabbis eventually attended the two-day conference on June 1, 1942, including Beth Israel's Landman. The conference {{led to the formation of}} the anti-Zionist American Council for Judaism, [...] "the only American Jewish organization ever formed for the specific purpose of fighting Zionism and opposing the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} that Haggard began writing She, society had more anxiety {{about the role of}} women. Debates {{regarding}} [...] "The Woman Question" [...] dominated Britain during the fin de siècle, as well as anxieties over the increasing position and independence of the [...] "New Woman". Alarm over social degeneration and societal decadence further fanned concerns over the woman's movement and female liberalisation, which challenged the traditional conception of Victorian womanhood. The role and rights of women had changed dramatically since {{the early part of the}} century, as they entered the workforce, received better education, and gained more political and legal independence. Writing in 1894, Haggard believed that marriage was the natural state for women: [...] "Notwithstanding the energetic repudiations of the fact <b>that</b> <b>confront</b> us at every turn, it may be taken for granted that in most cases it is the natural mission of women to marry; that – always in most cases – if they do not marry they become narrowed, live a half life only, and suffer in health of body and of mind." [...] He created the character of She-who-must-be-obeyed [...] "who provided a touchstone for many of the anxieties surrounding the New Woman in late-Victorian England".|$|E
500|$|A shorter {{version of}} The Tombs of Atuan was {{published}} in the magazine Worlds of Fantasy in the Winter 1970 issue. The complete version was published by Atheneum Books in 1971. It was the second book of the original Earthsea [...] "trilogy", being preceded by A Wizard of Earthsea, and followed by The Farthest Shore in 1972. The Tombs of Atuan has since been translated into more than 20 languages, and has been reprinted many times. The first three Earthsea novels received critical acclaim as works for children when they were published. The classification of the original trilogy as children's literature was decried by many critics, such as Barbara Bucknall, who stated that the stories were [...] "ageless because they deal with problems <b>that</b> <b>confront</b> us at any age", and could be read by both children and adults. It took several decades and the publication of a fourth novel, Tehanu for the series to be recognized as adult literature. Two more books were published in subsequent years; Tales from Earthsea and The Other Wind, both in 2001. These books, along with Tehanu, have sometimes been referred to as a second trilogy. Tehanu {{has been described as a}} rewriting or reimagining of The Tombs of Atuan, because Tenar's power and status are the inverse of what they were in the earlier book. In 2005 an original mini-series titled Legend of Earthsea, based loosely on the first two Earthsea books was broadcast on the Sci Fi Channel. Le Guin expressed strong displeasure with the result, which she said had [...] "whitewashed Earthsea".|$|E

500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} that the Earthsea novels in general {{received}} less critical attention because they were considered children's books. Le Guin herself took exception to this treatment of children's literature, describing it as [...] "adult chauvinist piggery". In 1976, literary scholar George Slusser criticized the [...] "silly publication classification designating the original series as 'children's literature'". Barbara Bucknall stated that [...] "Le Guin was not writing for young children when she wrote these fantasies, nor yet for adults. She was writing for 'older kids.' But in fact she can be read, like Tolkien, by ten-year-olds and by adults. These stories are ageless because they deal with problems <b>that</b> <b>confront</b> us at any age." [...] Only in later years did A Wizard of Earthsea receive attention from a more general audience. Literary scholar T. A. Shippey {{was among the first}} to treat A Wizard of Earthsea as serious literature, assuming in his analysis of the volume that it belonged alongside works by C. S. Lewis and Fyodor Dostoevsky, among others. Margaret Atwood said that she saw the book as [...] "a fantasy book for adults", and added that although the book could be categorized as either young adult fiction or as fantasy, but since it dealt with themes such as [...] "life and mortality and who are we as human beings", it could be read and enjoyed by anybody older than twelve. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction echoed this view, saying the series's appeal went [...] "far beyond" [...] the young adults for whom it was written. It went on to praise the book as [...] "austere but vivid", and said the series was more thoughtful than the Narnia books by C. S. Lewis. In his 1980 history of fantasy, Brian Attebery called the Earthsea trilogy [...] "the most challenging and richest American fantasy to date". Slusser described the Earthsea cycle as a [...] "work of high style and imagination", and the original trilogy of books a product of [...] "genuine epic vision". In 1974, critic Robert Scholes compared Le Guin's work favorably to that of C. S. Lewis, saying, [...] "Where C. S. Lewis worked out a specifically Christian set of values, Ursula LeGuin works not with a theology but with an ecology, a cosmology, a reverence for the universe as a self-regulating structure." [...] He added that Le Guin's three Earthsea novels were themselves a sufficient legacy for anybody to leave. In 2014 David Pringle called it [...] "a beautiful story—poetic, thrilling, and profound".|$|E

2500|$|The {{title of}} the film is a {{reference}} to the 1941 Preston Sturges film Sullivan's Travels, in which the protagonist (a director) wants to direct a film about the Great Depression called O Brother, Where Art Thou? that will be a [...] "commentary on modern conditions, stark realism, and the problems <b>that</b> <b>confront</b> the average man." [...] Lacking any experience in this area, the director sets out on a journey to experience the human suffering of the average man but is sabotaged by his anxious studio. The film has some similarity in tone to Sturges's film, including scenes with prison gangs and a black church choir. The prisoners at the picture show scene is also a direct homage to a nearly identical scene in Sturges's film.|$|E
2500|$|The Culture {{stories are}} largely about {{problems}} and paradoxes <b>that</b> <b>confront</b> liberal societies.

2500|$|Advertisers {{and retail}} {{consultants}} {{have said that}} because of consumer cynicism, a company can benefit from marketing its support for a cause such as breast cancer awareness only when the company treats that support as [...] "a commitment and not a marketing opportunity".

[...] Pink products have also been condemned as promoting consumerism, materialism, and environmental degradation. Critics are also concerned that the ubiquity of pink products may mislead people into thinking that significant progress has been made, and that small, individual actions, like buying a breast cancer-themed product, are sufficient. Responding to criticism, Komen CEO Nancy G. Brinker said that corporate promotions enabled the organization to reach new audiences and that [...] "America is built on consumerism.

Archaic forms of words and expressions, with which the ripe student is familiar, worry the tyro, and must be accounted for. Often the common dictionaries will give all needed help; but the best means of acquiring speedy familiarity with obsolete and rare forms is a Milton concordance--such as that of Bradshaw--in connection with the Century Dictionary, or with the Oxford Dictionary, so far as this goes. These means of easy research should be at hand. I find that pupils often need a pretty sharp spur to make them use even their abridged dictionaries. But so far as concerns acquaintance with the vocabulary of poetic diction, nothing will do except the dictionary habit, accompanied by an effort of the memory to retain what has been learned.|$|E
