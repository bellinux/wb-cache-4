5|$|After Méliès's {{financial}} difficulties and decline, most {{copies of his}} prints were lost. In 1917, his offices were occupied by the French military, who melted down many of Méliès's films to gather the traces of silver from the film stock and make boot heels from the celluloid. When the Théâtre Robert-Houdin was demolished in 1923, the prints kept there were sold by weight to a vendor of second-hand film. Finally, in that same year, Méliès had a moment of anger and burned all his remaining negatives in his garden in Montreuil. In 1925, he began selling toys and candy from a stand in the Gare Montparnasse in Paris. A Trip to the Moon was largely forgotten <b>to</b> <b>history</b> and went unseen for years.|$|E

Most of his settlers returned to England, but some remained in as colonists in Weymouth, Plymouth, or Virginia. The remaining Weymouth settlers were supported by Plymouth until they were made part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630. Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop visited the settlement in 1632. In time, the location of the original settlement was lost <b>to</b> <b>history</b> and development. The location of the original fort was not rediscovered until 1891.|$|E

5|$|From 1877 to 1882, Jovanović honed {{his artistic}} skills at Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, {{studying}} under Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller, among others. In {{the early part}} of his career, he painted mostly Orientalist works, which were in high demand at the time. The paintings were based on his own experiences in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, and assured his fame among art connoisseurs in the West. In the late 1880s, Jovanović turned <b>to</b> <b>history</b> painting, depicting scenes from the history of the Serb people, as seen in The Takovo Uprising (1888). Nevertheless, his reputation as an Orientalist meant that he was best known for these types of works in his first decade as a professional artist.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>history</b> paintings Matejko made also numerous portraits.

Altogether Matejko authored 320 oil paintings and several thousands drawings and watercolors. He also designed the polychrome in St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków (1889–1891).|$|E

Until his death, he published influential volumes on a variety of issues, while concentrating on contributions <b>to</b> <b>history</b> and literary criticism, and editing a new collection of his own poems.

5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain {{of the life of}} Hieronymus Bosch or of the {{commissions}} or influences that may have formed the basis for the iconography of his work. His birthdate, education and patrons remain unknown. There is no surviving record of Bosch's thoughts or evidence as to what attracted and inspired him to such an individual mode of expression. Through the centuries art historians have struggled to resolve this question yet conclusions remain fragmentary at best. Scholars have debated Bosch's iconography more extensively than that of any other Netherlandish artist. His works are generally regarded as enigmatic, leading some to speculate that their content refers to contemporaneous esoteric knowledge since lost <b>to</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

5|$|On 22 January 1308, Edward II left England for France, leaving Gaveston {{behind as}} Regent. By the Treaty of Montreuil in 1299, {{it had been}} agreed that Edward should marry Isabella, the {{daughter}} of Philippe IV of France. Accompanying the king were several great nobles, including Lincoln, Pembroke, Clifford, John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. On 25 January Edward and Isabella were married at Boulogne-sur-Mer, and on 31 January Edward performed homage for the Duchy of Aquitaine, which the English king held of the French king. On that same day, the nobles mentioned above, with others, gathered to sign the document that has become known <b>to</b> <b>history</b> as the Boulogne agreement.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to London, the king was confronted by Thomas of Woodstock (now Duke of Gloucester), Arundel and Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, who brought an appeal of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, Tresilian, and two other loyalists: the mayor of London, Nicholas Brembre, and Alexander Neville, the Archbishop of York. Richard stalled the {{negotiations}} to gain time, as he was expecting de Vere to arrive from Cheshire with military reinforcements. The three earls then joined forces with Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby (Gaunt's son, later King Henry IV), and Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottinghamthe group known <b>to</b> <b>history</b> as the Lords Appellant. On 20 December 1387 they intercepted de Vere at Radcot Bridge, {{where he and his}} forces were routed and he was obliged to flee the country.|$|E
5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power <b>to</b> <b>history</b> recreation.|$|E

5|$|Silver {{was one of}} {{the seven}} metals of antiquity that were known to prehistoric humans and whose {{discovery}} is thus lost <b>to</b> <b>history.</b> In particular, the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering. However, unlike copper, silver did not lead to the growth of metallurgy on account of its low structural strength, and was more often used ornamentally or as money. Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold. For example, silver was more expensive than gold in Egypt until around the fifteenth century BC: the Egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt, and then reducing the silver chloride produced to the metal.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{learned of}} La Salle's mission in 1686. Concerned that the French colony could {{threaten}} Spain's {{control over the}} Viceroyalty of New Spain and the unsettled southeastern region of North America, the Crown funded multiple expeditions to locate and eliminate the settlement.

When the Spanish finally discovered the remains of the French colony at the fort in 1689, they buried the cannons and burned the buildings. Years later, Spanish authorities built a presidio at the same location. When the presidio was abandoned, the site of the French settlement was lost <b>to</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
