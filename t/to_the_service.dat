5|$|In 1981, ML {{jointly with}} the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company and the Dart Container Line, instituted a weekly containership service from Felixstowe, Suffolk, to Montreal. MLs {{contribution}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> was the large Manchester Challenge.

5|$|After {{completing}} his master's degree, Giridhar enrolled for the doctoral Vidyavaridhi (PhD) {{degree at the}} same institute, under Pandit Ramprasad Tripathi. He received a research fellowship from the University Grants Commission (UGC), but even so, he faced financial hardship during the next five years. He completed his Vidyavaridhi degree in Sanskrit grammar on 14 October 1981. His dissertation was titled Adhyātmarāmāyaṇe'pāṇinīyaprayogānāṃ Vimarśaḥ, or Deliberation on the non-Paninian usages in the Adhyatma Ramayana. The thesis was authored in only thirteen days in 1981. On completion of his doctorate, the UGC offered him the position of head of the Vyakarana department of the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University. However, Giridhar did not accept; he decided to devote his life <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of religion, society, and the disabled.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2011 provincial election, Premier Dalton McGuinty made a {{campaign}} pledge to provide two-way, full-day train service on all corridors. Metrolinx is continuing {{to move forward with}} planning for this service expansion, which is now known as Regional Express Rail, in likeness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of a similar name in France. Part of Metrolinx's Big Move regional transportation plan, it is estimated to cost $4.9 billion and serve 30 million additional riders by 2031. Other possible future rail service extensions identified in GO Transit's 2020 plan include Niagara Region, Bolton, Brantford, Peterborough and Uxbridge. Metrolinx also announced plans in January 2011 to electrify the Lakeshore West, Lakeshore East and Kitchener rail lines, as well as the Union Pearson Express.|$|E
5|$|At a {{memorial}} service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement, many listening <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including PK van der Byl, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E

25|$|In June 2017, it was {{announced}} that a new service would begin at Waterford Airport. <b>The</b> <b>service</b> was <b>to</b> be provided by Aer Southeast, a new airline set up that month. Aer Southeast planned to operate flights to three destinations from Waterford from July 2017: London Luton, Manchester and Birmingham. However, weeks later it {{was announced}} that the flights would be postponed, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> airline not having <b>the</b> required license <b>to</b> operate <b>the</b> <b>services.</b> An official from the airline stated that the airline was still strongly committed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>services.</b> <b>The</b> airline hopes <b>to</b> begin <b>the</b> <b>services</b> at a later date.|$|R

5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E
5|$|CCSR at the University of Surrey is the UK's {{largest and}} most {{well-known}} academic research centre in Mobile and Satellite Communication Systems and historically it has a unique research approach on both satellite as well as terrestrial mobile communication systems.

It is a major participant in European Union Information Science and Technology (IST) projects.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{the airport}} was again deemed too small. In 1983, all charter flights {{operated}} by SAS and Braathens {{were forced to}} move to Gardermoen. Additional foreign services were introduced, namely Sabena to Brussels in 1985, Dan-Air to London-Gatwick and Newcastle in 1986 and Alitalia to Milan in 1988. During a period of reconstruction at Gardermoen, Trans World Airlines also served Fornebu, and the same year Pan American reintroduced its route to New York. Air Europe also started to fly from London-Gatwick to Fornebu. An additional storey was added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> building, allowing office space to be moved there and free up space for check-in and traveler service on the two main storeys. Two satellites were built for the domestic terminal, one each for Braathens SAFE and SAS, allowing increased waiting area for travelers. The international terminal was expanded with a five-gate pier with jetbridges. A multi-story parking house was also built.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{wakes up}} but, {{unable to speak}} much, asks Will to narrate how his life ends. Though struggling, Will tells his father of their {{imagined}} daring escape from the hospital to the nearby lake, where everyone from Edward’s past is there to see him off. Will takes Edward into the river, where he transforms into the giant catfish and swims away. A satisfied Edward dies, knowing Will finally understands his love for storytelling. At the funeral, Will and Joséphine are surprised when all the people from Edward’s stories come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service,</b> though each one is a slightly less fantastical version than described. Will, finally understanding his father’s love for life, passes on Edward’s stories to his own son.|$|E
5|$|In November 1986 the Chiefs of Staff Committee and Minister for Defence Kim Beazley {{decided to}} {{transfer}} {{all of the}} RAAF's Iroquois and Sikorsky S-70 Black Hawk battlefield helicopters to the Army; the Chinooks remained with the RAAF at this time. The transfer of the RAAF's other helicopter types increased the cost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> of operating the Chinooks, and {{made it more difficult}} to find aircrew for No. 12 Squadron. The RAAF subsequently proposed transferring the Chinooks as well, but the Army was unwilling to accept them. The problems the Army was experiencing keeping the Iroquois and Black Hawk helicopters operational may have influenced this position, with the service being reluctant to take on an even more complex helicopter type.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the new location, new touches were made <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> If a female diner had a handbag, a small side table was placed beside her so {{that she did not}} need to place the bag on the floor. Money was not reused; change was only given in new notes and previously unused coins. The kitchen staff were expanded further to around 25, with Robert Reid as the head chef under White. The front of house staff were also expanded to six sommeliers, four Maître d'hôtels and two head waiters. In 1998, ownership of the restaurant transferred to MPW Criterion, a holding company created by White which also owned the Titanic restaurant.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} year the RNLI raised £10,000, however by 1849, income had dropped to £354. Finding itself in {{financial}} difficulties, the RNLI accepted a government subsidy of £2,000, which rose in subsequent years. This lasted until 1869, when the RNLI ceased accepting subsidies – it had found that voluntary donations had fallen by more than the subsidies; in addition, the government's imposition of bureaucracy and regulations were detrimental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b> It was the loss of 27 lifeboat crew of Southport and St Annes in 1886 that gave new impetus to fundraising and an 1889 appeal raised £10,000. The first Lifeboat Saturday was held in that year.|$|E
5|$|No. 825 Squadron FAA {{and their}} Fairey Swordfish were also made available. Lockheed Hudson's of No. 224 Squadron RAF and No. 233 Squadron RAF were also {{committed}} for reconnaissance operations. No. 22 Squadron RAF was recalled from leave {{to take part}} in any potential operation in the Channel. Hudsons from No. 407 Squadron RCAF were also available, and were placed on high alert. They took part in the fighting. RAF Bomber Command contributed its No. 5 Group RAF, containing some 242 of the 300 aircraft available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1944, the Army {{decentralized}} counterintelligence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>service</b> commands.
