40|$|THE {{usefulness}} of nitrogen mustard (HN 2) in the palliative treatment of certain lymphomas has become well established since the original trials in 1942. 1 More recently, a nitrogen mustard-like preparation, <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> (TEM) {{has been found}} to have therapeutic effects somewhat similar to those of nitrogen mustard itself. This new compound possesses the practical advantages, as contrasted with nitrogen mustard, of being ef-fective by mouth, producing less nausea and little or no vomiting, obviating the necessity of hospitalization during treatment and providing a compound with prolonged effect well suited to spaced maintenance therapy. The structural formula of <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine,</b> chemically 2, 4, 6 -tri-ethylenimino-s-triazine, is shown in figure 1. Its reactivity with actively proliferating tissues, such as lymphoid structures and the bone marrow, is attributed to its ethylenimino groups, which are similar to the ethylenimonium hydrolysate of nitrogen mustard, methyl (/ 3 -chloroethyl) amine, which forms when it is dissolved in water. 2 <b>Triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> was discovered to possess inhibiting effects upon experimental tumors and upon mouse leukemia late in 1949. 8 ' 4 In the first clinical report of this agent, in May, 1950, Rhoads et al. found temporary improvement could be produced in patients with Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma and chronic lymphocytic and granu-locytic leukemia, and in mycosis fungoides. 5 Results from other investiga-tors have since been reported. 6 ' 7 ' 8 ' 9 ' 10 This present report deals with 38 patients with Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, leukemia or other neoplastic disease, who have received <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> orally since September, 1950, when this study was commenced.

Reaction between <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> and nucleic acid components. J. Bacteriol. 82 : 195 – 201. 1961. —Triethylene melamine interacts primarily with phosphorylated intracellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) precursors {{and not with}} DNA. It was found by direct chemical and chromatographic analysis that only pyrimidine precursors of nucleic acids are attacked by <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine.</b> In {{the course of the}} triethylene melamine-deoxycytidine reaction the mutagenicity of the reaction mixture is lost, but the mutagenicity of the triethylene melamine-thymidine reaction products significantly increases above that of the reaction substrates. Several steps are postulated to explain the mechanism of the triethylene melamine-initiated mutagenic reaction: (i) Reaction I, semireversible uptake of triethylene melamine; (ii) reaction II, chemical interaction between <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> and intracellular thymidine mono- or triphosphate with the production of a functional analogue of the latter; (iii) incorporation of this fraudulent analogue into the newly formed DNA strand; (iv) occurrence of self-perpetuating errors in the sequence of natural bases during subsequent rounds of replication of the analogue-containing DNA strand. It is postulated that the mechanism of mutagenic responses to different types of mutagens can fit either a simplified (mutagenic base analogues) or extended version (radiation) of this schema...|$|E
40|$|X-radiation {{remains the}} {{treatment}} of choice in most cases of leukemia and lymphoma, but new agents are playing an increasing role in therapy.

40|$|Mice were {{injected}} with T. A. B. vaccine and, 2 days later, with various doses of different compounds.

40|$|When Saccharomyces cerevisia MP 1 {{was treated}} with bile acids alone or in {{combination}} with <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> (TEM), cholic acid {{was found to be}} comutagenic and antirecombinogenic while lithocholic acid had the opposite effect. Other bile acids enhanced the mutagenic and recombinogenic effects of TEM. Chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid had stronger comutagenic than corecombinogenic effects; hyodeoxycholic acid did not show this difference. Ox gall and a mixture of bile acids antagonized the genotoxic effect of TEM, and it therefore seems plausible that in normal composition bile acids neutralize each other, i. e., the comutagenic (corecombinogenic) effect of one substance is antagonized by the antimutagenic (antirecombinogenic) effect of another one. However, when the composition is altered, bile acids may become harmful. Experiments with yeast strain D 61.

40|$|REPORTS of {{experimental}} tumors resistant to various nucleic acid, amino acid, and folic acid antagonists used in cancer chemotherapy are now fairly numerous (Welch, 1959), and several mechanisms of resistance {{have been demonstrated}} by comparing resistant tumors with their corresponding sensitive lines.

Jackson (1954) has reported a subline of the Walker rat carcinoma resistant to <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> (TEM), and Yoshida (1959), a nitromin-resistant subline of the Yoshida rat ascites sarcoma. Several workers have studied rat tumors (Gorozhansky, 1959; Kurita et al., 1959; Oboshi, 1959) and Ehrlich mouse ascites cells (Inoue et al., 1958) resistant to nitrogen mustard derivatives. Mouse ascites tumors are convenient tools for in vivo and in vitro studies on the mechanism of action of chemotherapeutic agents and on possible differences between sensitive and resistant cells.

40|$|Radiation-associated thyroid {{carcinoma}} is {{of clinical}} importance in modern radiation therapy of both Hodgkin's disease (HD) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), because anatomically the thyroid is {{often in the}} radiation field. We have reviewed the records of HD and NHL patients seen at Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) between 1910 and I 960 to determine associated occurrence of thyroid cancer. Radiation therapy was the major therapeutic modality with the occasional use of single agent chemotherapy with nitrogen mustard, <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> (TEM), chlorambucil and prednisone.

40|$|IN a {{previous}} communication from this laboratory (Roe and Salaman, 1955, p. 193) {{it was reported}} that applications to the dorsal skin of the mouse of / 8 -propiolactone and croton oil, alternately at 3 - to 4 -day intervals, gave rise to significantly more papillomata than equivalent treatment with croton oil only. It was concluded that fi-propiolactone is, like urethane (Salaman and Roe, 1953; Graffi et al. 1953; Berenblum and Haran, 1955), <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> (Roe and Salaman, 1955), and 1, 2 -benzanthracene (Graffi et al., 1953; Roe and Salaman, 1955), an initiator of carcinogenesis in mouse-skin. It was pointed out (Roe and Salaman, 1955, p. 198) that in the group of mice treated with both / 3 -propiolactone and croton oil papillomata appeared as early as the second week of croton oil treatment. This early appearance of papillomata, and the fact that 4 malignant tumours were present in 19 survivors only 25 weeks {{from the beginning of the}} experiment*, suggested that,¢-propiolactone might prove to be carcinogenic for mouse-skin, as it is for the subcutaneous tissues of the rat (Walpole et al., 1954) ...|$|E
40|$|TWENTY {{cases of}} primary {{carcinoma}} of the liver {{have been found in}} 35,- 995 admissions to this hospital in the last 10 years. Twelve of these pa-tients had hepatomas, or liver cell tumors, while six had cholangiomas, or bile duct cell tumors, and two had atypical or mixed types. The ratio of hepatomas to cholangiomas, therefore, was 2 : 1, which agrees with the ratio given by Bockus. 1 Ten of these 20 patients (seven of the hepatoma group and three of the cholangioma group) also had cirrhosis. Seven were white males and 13 were Negro males. Since primary carcinomas of the liver grow rapidly, with death occurring shortly after the onset of symptoms (six and one-half months in this series), and surgical resection of portions of the liver is difficult, a chemotherapeutic agent was sought which might prolong life and relieve symptoms. It had been observed that some of our patients who had enlarged livers accompany-ing Hodgkin's disease and leukemias showed some regression in hepato-megaly following oral treatment with <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> (TEM).

40|$|In recent {{experiments}} with yeast strain MP 1, cocarcinogens {{were found to}} be comutagenic and antirecombinogenic and antimutagenic. Substances that were cocarcinogens as well as tumor promoters had an intermediary effect. In course of the present work with S. cerevisiae MP 1 using bile acids per se and in combination with <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> (TEM), of the following substances dose/effect-curves have been established: Deoxycholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, cholesterol (control), ox gall, and of mixture of a bile salts. Bile acids showed all three possible ways of action supporting the hypothesis that mutagenesis is the mechanism by which chemicals induce malignancy, and that cocarcinogens modify the process by enhancement of mutagenicity whereas tumor promoters effect carcinogenesis mainly by the increase of the spontaneous frequency of recombination. In addition to this, experiments have been performed with yeast strain D 61. M for detection of aneuploidy. In these experiments no effects could be observed. According to the present results it seems furthermore possible that in normal cases bile acids neutralize each other, i. e. the comutagenic (corecombinogenic) effect of one substance is antagonized by the antimutagenic (antirecombinogenic) effect of another one. Only if the balance is lost bile acids may be harmful...|$|E
40|$|Treatment with Thio-TEPA has produced, in a {{significant}} number of patients suffering from very advanced carcinoma of ovary, marked temporary retrogression of growth and improvement of symptoms; in a few cases temporary clinical disappearance of growth, ascites and disappearance of symptoms was achieved, and those patients resumed their normal activities enjoying life for the duration of control of growth. Our article contains observations made from January 1957 till June 1959, and an attempt of quantitative presentation of clinical results was made. Our observations confirm and emphasise previous reports. Triethylene thiophosphoramide (Thio-TEPA) is an alkylating agent structurally related to nitrogen mustard and <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> and has a similar cytotoxic effect. The clinical effect appears to differ significantly. Thio-TEPA was synthesised in the Lederle Laboratories. Shay et at.

These authors quoted and reviewed briefly the extensive experimental work of the Lederle group of workers and described their own work which led to the clinical trial.

40|$|T H E {{object of}} this report is to discuss the {{chemotherapy}} of leukemia, Hodgkin's disease and the related disorders {{in the light of}} our own experi-ence since the development of interest in this field 10 years ago. 1 * 2 A large number of chemotherapeutic agents has been discovered since that time but only a few have earned a solid position in the list of useful drugs. The available chemotherapeutic agents can be best classified and dis-cussed in relation to four groups of disorders, since different ones {{have been found to be}} particularly effective in each group. The four groups are as follows: 1. Hodgkiris Disease. Here, in decreasing order of effectiveness and value, mention may be made of methyl-bis(0 -chloroethyl) amine hydro-chloride or nitrogen mustard, <b>triethylene</b> <b>melamine</b> (TEM), 8 triethylene phosphoramide (TEPA) and diethylene phosphoramide (DEPA), 4 and jG-naphthyl-di- 2 -chloroethylamine (R 48). 5 Only the first two will be con-sidered. 2. Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, Lymphosarcoma and Reticulum Cell Sarcoma. Here TEM is particularly important. 3. Chronic Myelocytic Leukemia. For the treatment of this disease, "Myleran " (1, 4 -dimethanesulphonoxybutane), 6 urethane (ethyl carbamate) 7 and a colchicine derivative, Demecolcin, 8 deserve attention. 4. Acute Leukemia.
