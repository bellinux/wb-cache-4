50|$|In 1900 George W. Fairchild, an {{investor}} {{and director of}} the Bundy Manufacturing Company, led the formation in Jersey City, New Jersey, of the International Time Recording Company (ITR) which consolidated the time recording business of Bundy with the Willard & Frick Manufacturing Co. In 1901, the company was re-incorporated in Binghamton, New York. The same year, it acquired the Chicago <b>Time-Register</b> Co., the first autograph time recorder company in the world, and a manufacturer of key, card and autograph employee time recorders.|$|E
40|$|Poor {{adherence}} to tuberculosis (TB) treatment hinders the individual’s recovery and threatens public health. Currently, directly observed therapy (DOT) {{is the standard}} of care; however, high sustaining costs limit its availability, creating {{a need for more}} practical adherence confirmation methods. Techniques such as video monitoring and devices to <b>time-register</b> the opening of pill bottles are unable to confirm actual medication ingestions. A novel approach developed by Proteus Digital Health, Inc. consists of an ingestible sensor and an on-body wearable sensor; together, they electronically confirm unique ingestions and record the date/time of the ingestion. A feasibility study using an early prototype was conducted in active TB patients to determine the system’s accuracy and safety in confirming co-ingestion of TB medications with sensors. Thirty patients completed 10 DOT visits and 1, 080 co-ingestion events; the system showed 95. 0 % (95 % CI 93. 5 – 96. 2 %) positive detection accuracy, defined as the number of detected sensors divided by the number of transmission capable sensors administered. The specificity was 99. 7 % [95 % CI 99. 2 – 99. 9 %] based on three false signals recorded by receivers. The system’s identification accuracy, defined as the number of correctly identified ingestible sensors divided by the number of sensors detected, was 100 %. Of 11 adverse events, four were deemed related or possibly related to the device; three mild skin rashes and one complaint of nausea. The system’s positive detection accuracy was not affected by the subjects ’ Body Mass Index (p = 0. 7309). Study results suggest the system is capable of correctly identifying ingestible sensors with high accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} a data set collected by an autonomous ground vehicle testbed, {{based upon a}} modified Ford F- 250 pickup truck. The vehicle is outfitted with a professional (Applanix POS-LV) and consumer (Xsens MTi-G) inertial measurement unit (IMU), a Velodyne 3 D-lidar scanner, two push-broom forward looking Riegl lidars, and a Point Grey Ladybug 3 omnidirectional camera system. Here we present the <b>time-registered</b> data from these sensors mounted on the vehicle, collected while driving the vehicle around the Ford Research campus and downtown Dearborn, Michigan during November-December 2009. The vehicle path trajectory in these data sets contain several large and small-scale loop closures, which should be useful for testing various {{state of the art}} computer vision and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms...|$|R
40|$|This article {{introduces}} a previously undescribed method progressively visualizing {{the evolution of}} a knowledge domain's cocitation network. The method first derives a sequence of cocitation networks from a series of equal-length time interval slices. These <b>time-registered</b> networks are merged and visualized in a panoramic view {{in such a way that}} intellectually significant articles can be identified based on their visually salient features. The method is applied to a cocitation study of the superstring field in theoretical physics. The study focuses on the search of articles that triggered two superstring revolutions. Visually salient nodes in the panoramic view are identified, and the nature of their intellectual contributions is validated by leading scientists in the field. The analysis has demonstrated that a search for intellectual turning points can be narrowed down to visually salient nodes in the visualized network. The method provides a promising way to simplify otherwise cognitively demanding tasks to a search for landmarks, pivots, and hubs...|$|R
40|$|Studies on {{short-term}} renal responses to (pharmacological) intervention require accurate and multiple collection of urine samples. Several invasive techniques {{have been described}} for frequent urine collection of the conscious rat, each having their own limitations. No data are available about the feasibility of the spontaneously voiding, freely moving rat for this purpose. In the present study, bladder voidings of six rats were <b>time-registered</b> and collected separately for several days. The data show a considerable 24 -h variation coefficient of both the voided volume and the bladder collection time with a poor correlation between the two parameters. Forced diuresis induced by continuous i. v. infusion (2 ml/h) increased the frequency of urine voiding and thus the time-resolution of the urine-production pattern. However, this method failed to reduce the variation coefficient of the voided volume, the collection time, and {{the correlation between the}} two parameters. The fact that variations in creatinine excretion paralleled the variation in urinary flow suggests that both phenomena are likely be due to incomplete bladder emptying. Correction for this incomplete bladder collection, using the creatinine excretion, indeed reduced the variation coefficient of sodium excretion successfully from 61 +/- 17 % to 29 +/- 5 % during normal diuresis and from 56 +/- 19 % to 22 +/- 6 % during forced diuresis. In conclusion, the spontaneously voiding, freely moving rat can be used for short-term renal response studies if the collected urine samples are corrected for incomplete bladder emptying using urinary creatinine concentrations. This procedure allows the detection of changes in a urinary parameter if this exceeds a 40 % deviation of the normal value. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} process {{conditions}} on coal pyrolysis and char reactivity is systematically studied using the thermogravimetric reactor equipped with in-situ video microscopy imaging (TGA/VMI). This system provides a complete <b>time-registered</b> {{record of the}} history of single coal particles as they are sequentially pyrolyzed and combusted in the reactor. Three coals are investigated: Illinois # 6, Utah Blind Canyon, and Wyodak-Anderson seam. An image analysis procedure was developed to monitor the transient swelling pattern of the two plastic coals (Illinois and Utah). Particle swelling increases with increasing pyrolysis heating rate and increasing particle size. When pyrolyzed in reactive atmospheres, these coals exhibit less plasticity and less "bubbling", but they swell more. The maximum devolatilization rate occurs during the stage of vigorous "bubbling. " Since the Wyodak coal is not plastic, it does not swell during pyrolysis. Process conditions affect char ignition behavior. Particles will ignite more easily when the observed reaction rates are high and heat removal rates are low. During combustion in the presence of intraparticle diffusional limitations, we observed that large char particles and chars produced at high pyrolysis heating rates ignite more easily. Increased particle sizes slow the heat removal rates, while high pyrolysis heating rates produce chars with larger macroporosities and macropore surface areas thus enhancing the reaction rates. Chars produced in reactive pyrolysis atmospheres appear to be more reactive and ignite more easily. Experiments at low temperatures show that the pyrolysis heating rate, particle size, and pyrolysis atmosphere do not affect the reactivity pattern in the kinetic control regime. We also developed a steady-state mathematical model for char particle ignition. Model parameters were obtained from structural measurements for the Illinois # 6 chars. The model predicts that the ignition temperature decreases with decreasing gas flow rate and increasing pyrolysis heating rate, increasing oxygen concentration and increasing particle size. Model predictions are in excellent agreement with our experimental data...|$|R
