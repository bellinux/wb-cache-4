5|$|Over {{the next}} four years, they became a major {{artillery}} tractor, mainly used <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> medium guns like the 6-inch howitzer, the 60-pounder, and later the 9.2-inch howitzer.|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were used}} <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> L passenger trains on the electrified {{section of the}} Outer Circle route between Earl's Court and Mansion House. After December 1908 these services terminated at Earl's Court. The locomotives were used <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> District trains, one coupled to each end of a rake of four trailer cars. From 1910 the locomotives were used on London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT) trains extended over the District line, taking over from steam locomotives at Barking.|$|E
5|$|In 1806, {{the village}} was visited by a Spanish {{expedition}} led by Lieutenant Facundo Melgares and, soon after, by an American expedition led by Lieutenant Zebulon Pike. At the village, Pike persuaded the Pawnee leaders <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> down a Spanish flag that they had received from Melgares, and to raise {{the flag of the}} United States in its stead.|$|E

5|$|A wooden {{bridge was}} {{built over the}} Kennet at Newbury in 1726, {{replaced}} in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and {{now known as the}} Town Bridge or Water Bridge. As there is no tow path, a line <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> the barge had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.|$|E
5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} {{were found in}} warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> out at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E
5|$|Eventually NSB felt {{confident}} that they had found a technical solution that would be satisfactory, and ordered another six units to allow all trains on the Dovre, Bergen and Sørland Lines to be hauled with the class. Units 2227–2232 were delivered in 1987, and put into regular service on the Sørland Line. Although better than the first series, the second series was also prone to technical problems, and never entered regular service on the Bergen Line. During the 1990s, they were also put into service on the regional rail services on the Vestfold and Gjøvik Lines. The units were never well-liked by NSB, {{in part because of}} the bad name the first series had given, and partly because the number of available units was unpredictable. It also took a while for NSB to discover that asynchronous locomotives needed to be operated differently. The locomotives had been designed <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> a six-car train, but NSB regularly needed <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> eight-car trains, and therefore instead used the more powerful El 16.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the Australian line of {{communications}} in the sector, engineers from the 16th Field Company later constructed a road using a bulldozer that had <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> itself up the ridge via a steel cable that was manhandled {{up to a point}} just below the ridge over the course of eight days. A light rail system was also established between Barges' Hill and Pearl Ridge.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, a non-electrified branch {{along the}} West Shore of Staten Island was built <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> {{materials}} {{to construct the}} Outerbridge Crossing, branching off of the main line south of Richmond Valley. The branch was cut back to a point south of the bridge after the bridge was built. Afterwards, the branch served a scrapyard owned by the Roselli brothers. The branch still exists to Page Avenue, and the switch is kept working.|$|E
5|$|Rocket {{remained}} in {{use with the}} L after the accident, albeit rarely used for anything other than internal engineering duties. The more advanced Planet design was better suited to heavy loads, and Rocket became redundant. In 1834 it was used for experiments with new drive systems, after which it was put in storage. In 1836 it was sold to the Midgeholme Colliery, and used <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> coal until 1844.|$|E
50|$|The A class, and the {{preceding}} M class of 1904 and R class of 1910, were closely related designs ideally suited <b>to</b> <b>hauling</b> heavy coal trains {{a relatively short}} distance.|$|R
50|$|The main {{downside}} to the DF {{was the lack}} of power output from the diesel engine. This hindered the DF when it came <b>to</b> <b>hauling</b> heavy freight trains out of multiple.|$|R
25|$|DD class {{locomotives}} {{were initially}} assigned <b>to</b> <b>hauling</b> the Adelaide Express over the steep gradients between Melbourne and Ballarat, but were soon seen on mainline passenger services {{on a number}} of lines.|$|R
5|$|The {{first five}} locomotives, Nos. 6220–6224, {{were built in}} 1937 at the LMS Crewe Works at an average cost of £11,641 each. They were all {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> the Coronation Scot, so the locomotives and the special trainsets bore a common livery. The locomotives were streamlined and painted Caledonian Railway blue with silver horizontal lines along {{each side of the}} locomotive. The special trainsets that they hauled were painted the same shade of blue and the silver lining was repeated along each side of the coaches.|$|E
5|$|The {{line has}} six steam {{locomotives}} for passenger trains and four diesel locomotives, which are primarily used for shunting and <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> works trains. It is unusual for all steam locomotives to be operable {{at the same}} time, as at least one is normally scheduled for overhaul. The railway also owns 23carriages and vans, including all of the original carriages and the brake van built for the railway.|$|E
5|$|Two of the 1960 stock {{cars were}} {{converted}} to work as pilot motor cars in 1987. The conversion was carried out at British Rail Engineering Limited's works at Derby. They were numbered L132 and L133, and were used <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> a track recording car around the system. The recording car is numbered TRC666, and was converted from a 1973-built trailer car.|$|E
50|$|The area's major export in {{the mid-19th}} century to 1940 was lumber. Cook Station and Mount Meigs Station were two main {{stations}} in the region. During World War II they switched <b>to</b> <b>hauling</b> gravel.|$|R
60|$|Then the two {{discussed}} matters relative <b>to</b> <b>hauling</b> the brig {{from her}} bed of sand, and gave no heed to the strangers, who were amidships conversing in low tones, as if fearful of being overheard.|$|R
50|$|The P/P1 {{classes and}} {{preceding}} 1904 introduced M and 1910 A and R classes were closely related designs ideally suited <b>to</b> <b>hauling</b> trains {{a relatively short}} distance. The P's were specifically designed for passenger work having larger driving wheels of 5 ft diameter.|$|R
5|$|Although very {{conveniently}} sited for passengers, Ramsgate Harbour station presented severe operating difficulties. Its {{situation at}} the end of a steep gradient in the tunnel meant there was the constant risk that an out-of-control train would run through the station onto the beach, as happened on 3August 1891 and 24March 1915. Cramped conditions allowed no room for station growth or improvement, and the small turntable meant larger engines could not be used, so heavier trains needed two engines <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> them up the tunnel's gradient. Additionally, by the 1920s the population of Ramsgate had almost doubled since the station had opened, making the freight facilities inadequate, with no room for expansion.|$|E
5|$|As previous, the Swedish {{authorities}} {{continued to}} subsidize freight operations on their side, making it profitable for Swedish exports to go via the Baltic Sea. Hopes in Trondheim {{to act as}} a major transit port for Swedish cargo never materialized. The 1966 opening of Norske Skog Skogn paper mill saw an increase in transport of lumber from Sweden. The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests. A major customer was still Meråker Smelteverk, who used designated trains <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> ore from Muruvik to Kopperå and microsilica in return. By 1980, cargo volumes were up to the level seen during World War I.|$|E
5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> vats of sap from the trees being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
50|$|The M {{class and}} related 1910 {{introduced}} R and A class were successful designs ideally suited <b>to</b> <b>hauling</b> heavy coal trains {{a relatively short}} distance. In 1922 the three Neath and Brecon locos were repaired by the GWR and lasted until 1929-1930.|$|R
50|$|The Rhymney Railway's A, M and R {{classes were}} {{successful}} designs ideally suited <b>to</b> <b>hauling</b> heavy coal trains {{a relatively short}} distance. In 1926, No 17 was reboilered by the GWR {{and in this form}} was visually almost indistinguishable from the GWR 5600 Class.|$|R
5000|$|Ex-Metropolitan Railway {{hauled stock}} {{retained}} their original numbers {{as they did}} not conflict {{with any of the}} numbers allocated to the multiple unit stock; they were all numbered between 41 and 510 (511-519 were later allocated to cars converted from multiple unit <b>to</b> <b>hauled</b> stock).|$|R
5|$|By 20:00, Scheer {{ordered the}} German line to {{complete}} a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold and was forced <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> out of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed. As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed {{the order of the}} German line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship {{from the rear of the}} German line. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.|$|E

5|$|Departmental {{locomotives}} on the London Underground {{consist of}} vehicles {{of a number}} of types which are used for engineering purposes. These include battery locomotives, diesel locomotives, electric locomotives, sleet locomotives, pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars. Details of the first four types are covered elsewhere. Pilot motor cars and ballast motor cars are generally vehicles which have been withdrawn from passenger service, but continue to be used by the engineering department. Pilot motor cars are used to move other vehicles around the system, while ballast motor cars are used <b>to</b> <b>haul</b> ballast trains and engineering trains.|$|E
50|$|Four of {{the class}} have survived. Three are owned by {{preservation}} societies, whilst the fourth, V1213, {{is owned by the}} private rail operator Pemberton Tramway Company who provide Driver Experience courses, in addition <b>to</b> <b>hauling</b> some timber on its railway.
