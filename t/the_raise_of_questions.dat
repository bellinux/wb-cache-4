40|$|A física se relaciona intimamente com a matemática, e essa relação pode ser refletida com olhares distintos e complementares. A respeito dessa temática, existem trabalhos que discutem o papel técnico e operacional que a matemática exerce em diferentes níveis de ensino de física, assim como existem trabalhos que refletem sobre o caráter organizacional e estrutural que ela possui no ensino, construção e aprendizagem da ciência. Esse trabalho tem como {{principal}} objetivo observar esses dois tipos de relações em um curso introdutório de mecânica na licenciatura em física da Universidade de São Paulo e refletir sobre como as relações da física com a matemática podem ser apresentadas no contato inicial na graduação que o futuro professor de física tem com os conceitos da mecânica. Para isso, foi realizado um estudo de caso na disciplina Fundamentos de Mecânica em duas turmas com professores distintos. Nesse estudo, foram gravados áudios das explicações dos professores e anotadas as formulações matemáticas utilizadas nas aulas, como equações, resolução de exercícios e/ou esboços de gráficos. Em um primeiro momento, foram analisadas as representações matemáticas utilizadas pelos professores em trechos das aulas denominados episódios de ensino. Nesses episódios, se observaram aspectos como a transitividade de representações matemáticas, o aspecto operacional da matemática e as relações explícitas com outros cursos da licenciatura, como o cálculo e a geometria analítica. Em um segundo momento, foram analisados os aspectos organizacionais da matemática na física presentes no estudo de caso que permitem pensar a matemática como estruturante do pensamento físico (PIETROCOLA, 2002) : interpretação, significação, abstração e linguagem matemática. Com essas análises, foi possível concluir que a relação da física com a matemática pode ser explorada no início da formação do professor em aspectos que extrapolam o uso técnico e mecânico das operações: a reflexão sobre a utilização das representações, a extração de informações físicas a partir de formulações e o exercício de pensar e ouvir questionamentos sobre o uso da matemática na física. A partir dessas apresentações, emergem outros questionamentos para a área de ensino de física: quando o futuro professor começa a pensar sobre a relação da física com a matemática? Quais as implicações de um curso introdutório em mecânica ser oferecido concomitantemente com um curso matemático de cálculo, por exemplo? Essa dissertação busca oferecer explanações que permitam levantar questões para futuras pesquisas na área e contribuir para a discussão sobre o tema. Physics {{is closely}} related to mathematics, and this relationship can be seen with different and complementary points of view. Regarding this issue, there are studies that discuss the technical and operational role that mathematics plays in different levels of the education of physics, and there are works that focus on the organizational and structural nature that it has in education, construction and learning of science. This work is aimed at evaluate these two types of relationships in an introductory course in the degree in Physics from the University of Sao Paulo and think about on how the relations of Physics and Mathematics can be presented in the initial contact {{at the beginning of the}} university studies that the future teachers of Physics with the concepts of mechanics. For this, a case study in Mechanical Fundamentals course was conducted in two classes with different teachers. In this study, the audio recordings of the teachers explanations were made and noted the mathematical formulations, used in class were noted, as equations, problem solving and/or graphic sketches. At first, we analyzed the mathematical representations used by teachers in parts of classes called episodes of education. In those episodes, aspects such as transitivity mathematical representations, the operational aspect of mathematics and relationships with other courses of degree, such as calculus and analytic geometry, were as noted a second step; the organizational aspects of mathematics in Physics were analyzed to consider Mathematics as a structure for the physical thought (PIETROCOLA, 2002) : interpretation, meaning, abstraction and mathematical language. With these analyzes, it was concluded that the physical relationship with mathematics can be explored at the beginning of a teacher training in aspects that go beyond the technical and mechanical use of the operations: a reflection on the use of representations, extraction of physical information from formulations and the exercise of thinking and hearing questions about the use of Mathematics in Physics. From these presentations, other questions emerge for the area of physical education: when the future teacher begins think about the physical relationship with Mathematics? What are the implications if an introductory course in Mechanics is offered concurrently with a Mathematical Calculus course, for example? This dissertation seeks to offer explanations that enable <b>the</b> <b>raise</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> for future researches in the area and contribute to discussion on the topic...|$|E
