40|$|This paper {{discusses}} several {{considerations and}} techniques {{in doing research}} which attempts to measure the effects of visual images on viewers.

If they fail to do those things, they will not know if the response is really to the environment instead of the image or know which element to credit with impact on the viewer. They may {{have to take into account}} other sources of variance as well. A research design which successfully reduces restraints on audience response can also include magnitude estimation scaling, Cloze procedure, or scales which indicate emotional response.

40|$|Enzo Bonaventura (Pisa, 1891 – Jerusalem, 1948) was an eminent {{figure in}} the {{development}} of scientific psychology in Italy before Second World War. Born to a Jewish family (the father was a musician), pupil of Francesco De Sarlo, one of the “fathers ” of the Italian psychology, he graduated in the University of Florence in 1903, and was appointed there as Assistant Professor and Director of the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology. In 1932 De Sarlo resigned from the University for opposing fascism. Bonaventura won a national concourse to succeed to him as Full Professor, but for political reason the Faculty did not “invite ” him, posponing the decision till 1938, when the fascist government excluded by law all Jews from the Italian universities. He, then, decided to emigrate in Erez Israel. During the Italian period, under the influence of De Sarlo and of Vittorio Benussi, he produced very important experimental and theoretical contibutions on the psychology of time and space. He used many instruments, mainly <b>tachistoscopes,</b> demonstrating a great ingenuity.

5000|$|In 1972, Fergus I. M. Craik and Robert S.

Craik and Lockhart's studies were some of the first studies completed dealing with Transfer-Appropriate Processing, which is now popular because of their ideas. Craik and Lockhart explained that the theory of multistore had very little evidence when it came to capacity, coding and retention. Instead, they proposed that memory involves level of processing. They concluded that we are always building from what we already know through our senses, patterns, and stimulus. Craik and Lockhart completed 10 experiments where participants processed different words by answering questions about them. Depending on the word, the response could be shallow or deep. After this section of the experiment was complete, participants were asked to randomly recall words. They were able to conclude that participants remembered positive and deeper responses more easily. [...] Next, Craik continued his work with Endel Tulving in 1975. They tested subjects individually for perception and speed. Participants had a word revealed to them for 200 ms. through a <b>tachistoscope.</b> Before exposure, questions were asked about the word. These questions were meant to create shallow or deep reactions about the words for the participants. After this was complete, the participants were then asked questions about the words. After these random questions, the participants were asked to recall the words. It was assumed that deeper level questions would be recalled more often. Through four separate experiments, Craik and Tulving found this to be true.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tachistoscope</b> {{has been}} one of the crucial {{instruments}} of the experimental psychology since its early times. This instrument is still in use in recent times, e. g. in the area of subliminal perception studies. The tachistoscopes have been evolving since the first experiments; nowadays, researchers do not use a single-purpose instrument to present the stimuli; they employ a personal computer with a monitor screen as a display unit. Two common technologies currently used at monitor screens - CRT and LCD - have different technical parameters (e. g. decay/refresh characteristics). The aim of our study is to explore whether the different parameters of the tachistoscopic instruments influence the resulting data, i. e. whether they cause an unsystematic measurement error. The results of the comparison of four types of tachistoscopic presentation will be presented in the paper.

40|$|Tachistoscopes allow brief visual {{stimulation}} delivery, which {{is crucial for}} experiments in which subliminal presentation is required. Up to now, tachistoscopes have had shortcomings with respect to timing accuracy, reliability, and flexibility of use. Here, we present a new and inexpensive two-channel <b>tachistoscope</b> that allows for exposure durations in the submillisecond range with an extremely high timing accuracy. The <b>tachistoscope</b> consists of two standard liquid-crystal display (LCD) monitors of the light-emitting diode (LED) backlight type, a semipermeable mirror, a mounting rack, and an experimental personal computer (PC). The monitors have been modified to provide external access to the LED backlights, which are controlled by the PC via the standard parallel port. Photodiode measurements confirmed reliable operation of the <b>tachistoscope</b> and revealed switching times of 3 [*]μs. Our method may also be of great advantage in single-monitor setups, in which it allows for manipulating the stimulus timing with submillisecond precision in many experimental situations. Where this is not applicable, the monitor can be operated in standard mode by disabling the external backlight control instantaneously...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) {{can be used in}} conjunction with existing display technologies as a means for achieving ultra-rapid visual stimulus exposure durations. We review existing rapid visual display methods, and show how our apparatus overcomes the limitations inherent with each technique. Our apparatus, the LED <b>tachistoscope,</b> takes advantage of the fast-switching times and high-brightness capabilities of LEDs in order to present sti muli at previously unachievable durations as rapid as 1 ms. The rapid exposure durations are achieved by external LED backlight illumination of images on a liquid crystal display (LCD) after the components of the LCD have stabilized. This ensures that stimulus onset and offset are discrete. Furthermore, the fast-switching of the LEDs enables stimuli to be revealed for very rapid durations. The paper also describes studies in which the LED <b>tachistoscope</b> has already been applied, and offers suggestions for other possible applications. Interestingly, in our studies we show that the human visual system is very adept at extracting information with only very minimal stimulus exposure durations. Such studies have not been possible with existing display equipment. The LED <b>tachistoscope</b> opens up avenues for a variety of psychological and physiological experiments and provides a means for revealing the limits of human visual perception. </p...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{addresses}} the historiographical {{question of how}} to study scientific instruments and the connections between them without rigidly determining the boundaries of the object under historical scrutiny beforehand. To do this, I will explore an episode in the early history of the <b>tachistoscope</b> - defined, among other things, as an instrument for the brief exposure of visual stimuli in experimental psychology. After looking at the <b>tachistoscope</b> described by physiologist Volkmann in 1859, I will turn to the gravity chronometer, constructed by Cattell at Wundt's Leipzig institute of psychology in the 1880 s. Taking Wittgenstein's notion of family resemblances as a methodological suggestion to travel from one member to another to find out just how members relate to one another, I will investigate part of the family to which both the <b>tachistoscope</b> and the gravity chronometer turn out to belong. A detailed analysis of these instruments, using both historical sources and historical accounts of psychological instruments, may demonstrate that the instrument is not a standard package that, if well applied, will simply secure good results. Each package needs to be assembled again and again; the particular package that is assembled may differ on different occasions. Thus an alternative is developed to an understanding of instruments as univocally functioning material means...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method for rapid visual stimulus delivery, the light-emitting diode (LED) <b>tachistoscope.</b> An array of white LEDs provided a luminous intensity greater than 1 000 000 mcd. This array was placed behind a {{liquid crystal display}} (LCD) {{to function as a}} backlight; switching it on and off determined the visibility of the display. Commands to illuminate for periods from 1 ms to continuously on were relayed from a computer to the LED array. Changes in luminous intensity at the surface of a LED and the LCD were recorded via oscilloscope. The required duration of light pulses consistently matched the durations displayed, with only microsecond discrepancies due to turn-on and turn-off delays. Images were illuminated on the LCD screen for as little as 1 ms, with the amplitude of the luminance consistent across trials. The LED <b>tachistoscope</b> can be used with any computer to display images extremely briefly, potentially at the submillisecond level, providing superior performance to traditional and computer monitor tachistoscopes...|$|E
