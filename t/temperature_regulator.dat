40|$|The {{majority}} of putrescible wastes currently generated in Australia are disposed in landfills, placing increasing stress on current infrastructure and the environment. Anaerobic digestion offers a technological option that cannot only reduce Australia's dependency on landfills, generates {{a source of}} renewable energy but also helps to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. One benefit of anaerobic digestion {{is its ability to}} be undertaken at various scales. Unfortunately, the study of small-scale digesters utilizing food waste remains limited, and feasibility studies are currently unavailable in Australia. This study aimed to evaluate the performance and determine the feasibility of energy generation from small-scale anaerobic digestion of food waste in Australia. These aims were achieved through the development of a decision support tool which can estimate the digester's technical performance together with the cost-benefits analysis. The technical performance used in the tool was based upon laboratory studies conducted to yield the kinetic coefficients of food waste digestion at 38 °C and 28 °C. Field studies of small-scale digesters treating food waste were also conducted to, firstly contribute quantitative data pertaining to the technical performance of small-scale digesters treating food waste, which is currently lacking in the literature and secondly to validate the decision support tool. Sensitivity analysis using the model was then performed to determine the minimum digester size required to enable the technical feasibility of electricity generation and the minimum digester size to ensure financial feasibility in terms of payback period and the ability to achieve grid parity. The tool was also used to determine whether the benefits from the installation of <b>temperature</b> <b>regulators</b> would be a worth while investment for a small-scale digester in Australia. Results revealed that although CH 4 can be generated from digesters of any capacity, a minimum of 10. 9 m 3 is required to ensure financial feasibility. This implies, at current energy tariffs and cost of digester, payback and grid parity is not achievable for household applications. In addition, the minimum size required for electricity generation varies between 3. 5 - 6. 3 m 3; however only digesters larger than 30 m 3 may be financially worthwhile in terms of achieving grid parity, and larger than 17 m 3 to achieve a reasonable payback period. Therefore, unless there are strong demands for electricity generation, digesters smaller than 30 m 3 are strongly discouraged from utilizing the gas for electricity generation purposes and should be used for heat generating purposes instead. Installing <b>temperature</b> <b>regulators</b> will allow for a higher rate of waste degradation, higher gas yield, require a smaller digester capacity and is more cost effective (in terms of payback period) as compared to a digester without <b>temperature</b> <b>regulators</b> treating the small amount of waste. It is thus recommended that for small-scale digesters in Australia, temperature-regulated digesters should be installed to ensure a functional temperature all year round especially during the colder months. Finally, the potential of energy generation and GHG mitigation from food waste anaerobic digesters in Australia was estimated and case study scenarios were created evaluated and analyzed. It was found that the maximum energy generation potential from anaerobic digestion of food waste was approximately 9. 82 PJ/year which would divert up to 2 million ton of putrescible waste from landfills mitigating up to 39...|$|R

Based on an advanced infantry armor system constructed from Nomex, the first layer of protection is an undersuit with built-in <b>temperature</b> <b>regulators</b> designed to keep the wearer at a comfortable temperature in almost any condition. The second layer of protection consists of armor built over the chest, calves, thighs, arms and back.

The armor is then coated with a black latex material for camouflage and to dampen Bruce's heat signature, making him difficult to detect with night-vision equipment. Made of a graphite material, the cowl acts as a protective helmet. The cowl's Kevlar lining is supposed to be bulletproof. A manufacturing defect in the graphite used in the production of the first shipment of the cowl's components made its outer shell incapable of withstanding blunt trauma (a flaw Alfred demonstrates to Bruce using a baseball bat).

40|$|Thermoelectric {{devices have}} {{a wide variety of}} {{potential}} applications including as coolers, <b>temperature</b> <b>regulators,</b> power generators, and energy harvesters. During the past decade or so, new thermoelectric materials have been an active area of research. As a result, several new high figure of merit (zT) materials have been identified, but practical devices using these new materials have not yet been reported. A physics-based compact model could be used to simulate a thermoelectric devices within a full system using SPICE-compatible circuit simulators. If such a model accepts measured or simulated material parameters, it would be useful in exploring the system level applications of new materials. In this thesis, the ground work for such a compact model is developed and tested. I begin with a discussion of thermoelectric transport theory within the Landauer formalism. The Landauer formalism is used as the basis of the tool LanTraP, which uses full band descriptions to calculate the distribution of modes and thermoelectric transport parameters, which can serve as the input to a compact model. Next, an equivalent circuit model is presented, explained, and tested using a simple Bi 2 Te 3 thermoelectric leg. The equivalent circuit is shown to perform well under a variety of DC, transient, and AC small signal operating conditions. With the equivalent circuit it is easy to determine the maximum cold side temperature drop, the maximum cold side heat absorbed, the temperature profile within the leg, the temperature response to a pulsed current, and impedance over a range of frequencies. Finally, Sentaurus®, a computer program that solves the thermoelectric transport equations numerically, is used to compare and benchmark some {{of the results of the}} equivalent circuit when considering Si as the thermoelectric material. The equivalent circuit and Sentaurus® simulations produce similar results in DC and transient cases, but in the AC small signal case the two simulations produce slight differences. The results of this work establishes a baseline compact model for thermoelectric devices whose accuracy and capabilities can be extended. ...|$|R
