The empirical analysis also considers the effects of bank size, but fails to find evidence that depositors preferred large banks. Deposit insurance...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that a bank can offer demand deposits and yet avoid bank runs without deposit insurance if {{it also offers}} <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> that have a low liquidation value. Self-fulfilling runs do not occur, as maturity mismatch is eliminated. To do this, we modify Diamond and Dybvig"s [1983] model so that depositors have differing risks of encountering a preference shock. We show that high-risk depositors will hold their savings as demand deposits, whereas low-risk depositors will prefer <b>time</b> <b>deposits.</b> These deposit choices transfer liquidity optimally from low-risk to high-risk depositors, who place the highest value on liquidity. ...|$|R

40|$|Using {{two sources}} {{of data on}} {{commercial}} bank liabilities we examine the behavior of various components of deposits following a monetary tightening (downturn) {{as well as a}} nonmonetary downturn equal in magnitude to the monetary downturn in order to better understand the portfolio behavior of commercial banks. We find that the increase in total deposits during a monetary tightening (when output is low and interest rates are high) is attributable to an increase in small <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> and that large <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> and demand deposits exhibit a decrease. This suggests that banks are able to, at least partially, offset the potentially adverse effects of a monetary tightening on their balance sheet by borrowing and raising additional small <b>time</b> <b>deposits.</b> Further, non-monetary downturns, when both interest rates and output are low, seem to have little effect on the liability position of banks. ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> or {{term deposit}} (also {{known as a}} {{certificate}} of deposit in the United States, (...) [...] ), is a deposit with a specified period of maturity and earns interest. [...] It is a money deposit at a banking institution that cannot be withdrawn for a specific term or period of time (unless a penalty is paid). When the term is over it can be withdrawn {{or it can be}} held for another term. Generally speaking, the longer the term the better the yield on the money. In its strict sense, certificate deposit is different from that of <b>time</b> <b>deposit</b> in terms of its negotiability: CDs are negotiable and can be rediscounted when the holder needs some liquidity, while time deposits must be kept until maturity.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} market discipline and the deposit insurance system in Japan using unique data set on bank-level weekly deposit rates in Japan. I find that when the government provided an unlimited coverage for all bank deposits, the risk profile of banks {{had no effect on}} either interest rates of deposits or the quantity of deposits. That is, depositors failed to monitor and punish risky banks. On the other hand, when the government imposed an insurance limit on <b>time</b> <b>deposits,</b> 10 million yen (approximately $ 100, 000) per depositor per bank, risky banks started offering higher interest rates on <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> and attracting less <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> than financially strong banks. In addition, as expected, the interest rates differential between partially insured <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> and fully insured ordinary deposits increased for financially weak banks. These two pieces of evidence indicate the emergence of market discipline. However, after the reform, the implicit guarantee provided by the government became a more important determinant of interest rates and deposit growth, thereby partially offsetting the positive effects of deposit insurance reform on market discipline. Because of this implicit guarantee, overall effects of deposit insurance reform on market discipline are likely to be small...|$|R

40|$|Finding {{the causal}} effects of {{liquidity}} shocks on credit supply {{is complicated by}} the endogenous relation between loan demand and liquidity position of banks. This paper attempts to overcome this problem by exploiting, as a natural experiment, the exogenous deposit outflow prompted by the removal of a blanket <b>deposit</b> guarantee on <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> in Japan. We find that during the period of transition from a blanket guarantee to a partial guarantee, weak banks suffered from a large outflow of partially insured <b>time</b> <b>deposits.</b> More importantly, we find that those weak banks were not able to raise a sufficient amount of other types of deposits {{to make up for the}} loss of <b>time</b> <b>deposits,</b> which, consequently, forced them to cut back on loan supply. These results are consistent with the theory that the imperfect substitutability of insured deposits and uninsured deposits affects the tightness of banks' financing constraints and ultimately the supply of bank loans.

A structural model of the Malaysian money deposits applied to annual data for the 1983 - 2001 periods was designed. This structural model consists offve behavioural equations and three identities. A structural model functional form is used and estimated using the ordinary least squares in the log linear form. The behavioural equations are used to estimate the injluences of various factors on the conventional demand <b>deposits,</b> conventional <b>time</b> <b>deposits,</b> Islamic demand <b>deposits,</b> Islamic <b>time</b> <b>deposits,</b> and Islamic investment deposits. The implications of the study are {{that the increase in}} real gross domestic product, interest rate stability, and an increase in the profit-share for savings and investments are important for maintaining and enhancing the development of Malaysian money deposits. The results show that all the models (conventional and Islamic banks deposits) are stable; however Islamic demand <b>deposits</b> and Islamic <b>time</b> <b>deposits</b> are more stable than conventional demand <b>deposits</b> and conventional <b>time</b> <b>deposits,</b> because their Chow tests valzres are smaller than those of conventional deposits. The findings of this study suggests that as shariah compliant deposits are more stable than their conventional equivalents, then this makes a run on deposits less likely, reducing the potential amount of capital adequacy cover needed...|$|R
