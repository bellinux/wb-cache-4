50|$|The barred {{entrance}} to the disused mines {{can be found in}} woods in a shallow valley near the village. Dating from the 17th century, they produced stone for buildings such as Westerham Church. At least four different faces were worked although evidence of other workings is concealed by roof falls. The stone was <b>transported</b> on <b>sledges</b> with a gauge of 14.5ins. Parts of the mine have been backfilled because, it is believed, at times when the price of stone dropped only the best quality stone was excavated, with the poor quality material being stacked in the mine for convenience.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not a}} {{task that}} appealed to Gerald. It would be {{necessary}} to cross a trackless wilderness which {{only a few of the}} Hudson Bay half-breeds knew anything about. He must sleep in the snow with an insufficient camp outfit, and live on cut-down rations, with the risk of starving if anything delayed him, because the weight he could <b>transport</b> without a <b>sledge</b> was limited.|$|R
50|$|This was {{the third}} {{consecutive}} season, and the last, that dog teams {{were used in the}} Shackleton Mountains. A few years later the last dogs were removed from Antarctica following an international agreement that all non indigenous animals should be removed from the Continent. What is indigenous? Most of our dogs were at least the third generation that had been bred and born on the continent. The removal of dogs from the continent brought an end to an era of truly the most reliable and exhilarating forms of <b>transport,</b> dog <b>sledging.</b> The contribution dogs made to the exploration of the continent has been marked by a statue of a husky placed outside the headquarters of the British Antarctic Survey at Cambridge, UK.|$|R
50|$|In early may, the {{expedition}} reached Adzhergaydahe, the northernmost {{settlement of the}} continent, and on 5 May began its journey to the New Siberian Islands. The expedition included 17 people and was equipped with 10 sleds, each dragged by 13 dogs. The boat was <b>transported</b> by two <b>sledges</b> and 30 dogs, who were helped by people, yet they refused to pull for longer than six hours. Transportation was carried at night, when the ice {{was strong enough to}} support the sleds.|$|R
50|$|There is good {{information}} concerning {{the location of the}} quarries, some of the tools used to cut stone in the quarries, transportation of the stone to the monument, leveling the foundation, and leveling the subsequent tiers of the developing superstructure. Workmen probably used copper chisels, drills, and saws to cut softer stone, such as most of the limestone. The harder stones, such as granite, granodiorite, syenite, and basalt, cannot be cut with copper tools alone; instead they were worked with time-consuming methods like pounding with dolerite, drilling, and sawing with the aid of an abrasive, such as quartz sand. Blocks were <b>transported</b> by <b>sledge</b> likely lubricated by water. Leveling the foundation may have been accomplished by use of water-filled trenches as suggested by Mark Lehner and I.E.S. Edwards or {{through the use of a}} crude square level and experienced surveyors.|$|R
5000|$|All {{effort was}} focused on the {{manufacture}} of equipment and clothing for the escape. As the escape planning progressed, May 17 was selected as the day for setting out. A base supply of food would be <b>transported</b> with the <b>sledges,</b> supplemented by hunting and limited dogsled trips back to the brig. The two dried out cypress whaleboats [...] "Faith" [...] and [...] "Hope" [...] were strengthened where possible with oak, fit with collapsible masts, and covered by stretched canvas. A third boat, [...] "Red Eric," [...] was brought along as fuel. Provisions, ammunition, cooking gear, and a few precious scientific instruments were packed within these. Each man was allowed eight pounds of personal effects.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the upper}} {{slopes of the}} Ore Mountains the climate may quite clearly be {{described}} as harsh. For that reason, the Upper Ore Mountains was also {{referred to in the}} past as Saxon Siberia. The annual rainfall on the high ridges is up to over 1,100 millimetres, with the majority falling as snow. The annual average temperatures reach values of only 3 to 5 °C. At Oberwiesenthal, located 922 m above sea level, there are on average only about 140 frost-free days a year. These winter temperatures and snowfalls during the winter months, especially on the mountain passes, lead to traffic problems, congestion and closures, even today. According to reports by historians in the past, winters in previous centuries in the upper Ore Mountain regions must have been even harder than today. Prolonged periods of frost and continuous snow cover, metre-high snowdrifts and snow storms often made roads and passes impassable for weeks. Reports by the State Post Office {{on the road to the}} mining town of Sayda on the Deutscheinsiedler Saddle dated February 1855, state that [...] "... because of the immense masses of snow, progress is almost impossible, just as impossible are the conditions during snowfalls". Post had to be <b>transported</b> by <b>sledge</b> and messengers, because [...] "two horses side by side cannot not wade through the piles of snow".|$|R
6000|$|The toil of the ascent, however, did not commence, {{until the}} boats entered {{what was called}} the creek, or the small {{tributary}} of the Unadilla, on which the beavers had erected their works, and which ran through the [...] "Manor." [...] Here, indeed, the progress was slow and laborious, the rapidity of the current and the shallowness of the water rendering every foot gained a work of exertion and pain. Perseverance and skill, notwithstanding, prevailed; all the boats reaching the foot of the rapids, or straggling falls, on which the captain had built his mills, about an hour before the sun disappeared. Here, of course, the boats were left, a rude road having been cut, by means of which the freights were <b>transported</b> on a <b>sledge</b> the remainder of the distance. Throughout the whole of this trying day, Joel had not only worked head-work, but he had actually exerted himself with his body. As for Mike, never before had he made such desperate efforts. He felt all the disgrace of his adventure on the lake, and was disposed to wipe it out by his exploits on the rivers. Thus Mike was ever loyal to his employer. He had sold his flesh and blood for money, and a man of his conscience was inclined to give a fair penny's-worth. The tractable manner in which the boat had floated down the river, it is true, caused him some surprise, as was shown in his remark to the younger Pliny, on landing.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. In 1999 {{a team of}} geologists {{discovered}} an archaeological site near Cape Southwest, Axel Heiberg Island. On {{the basis of its}} location and the analysis of two artifacts removed from the site, the discoverers concluded that it was a hastily abandoned campsite created by Hans Krüger’s German Arctic Expedition, which was believed to have disappeared between Meighen and Amund Ringnes islands in 1930. If the attribution to Krüger were correct, the existence of this site would demonstrate that the expedition got farther on its return journey to Bache Peninsula than previously believed. An archaeological investigation of the site by the Government of Nunavut in 2004 confirmed its tentative attribution to the German Arctic Expedition but suggested {{that it is not a}} campsite, but the remains of a deliberately and carefully constructed cache. The finds suggest that one of the three members of the expedition may have perished before reaching Axel Heiberg Island, and that the survivors, in order to lighten their <b>sledge,</b> <b>transported</b> valued but heavy items (including Krüger’s geological specimens) to this prominent and well-known location to cache them, intending to return and recover them at some later date.
