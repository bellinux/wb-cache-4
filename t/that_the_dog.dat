5|$|Coat: The Labrador Retriever's coat {{should be}} short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog {{does not get}} cold when taking to water in the winter. That means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> {{naturally}} has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.|$|E
5|$|A ^ Rob {{was awarded}} the Dickin Medal in 1945 for taking part in more than 20 {{parachute}} drops and for his involvement in operations behind enemy lines in Italy and North Africa during the Second World War. There is evidence that his record is a hoax concocted by the training officer at 2nd SAS at the time so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> would remain with the regiment.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} time, {{it seems as}} if the dog is cured, in that he is now {{friendly}} towards Keys. Julie confronts the dog's original owner, who has come to claim him, and who presumably trained him to attack black people. She angrily tells him in front of his grandchildren, who only know the dog as a loving family pet, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> has been cured by a black man.|$|E
25|$|Greyhound {{adoption}} groups frequently report <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> from <b>the</b> tracks have tooth problems, {{the cause}} of which is debated. The groups often also find <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> carry tick-borne diseases and parasites {{due to the lack}} of proper preventative treatments. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> require regular vaccination to minimize outbreaks of diseases such as kennel cough.|$|R

5|$|A veterinarian, Alfred Sewell, {{said the}} system Bayliss was using was {{unlikely}} to be adequate, but other witnesses, including Frederick Hobday of the Royal Veterinary College, disagreed; {{there was even a}} claim that Bayliss had used too much anaesthesia, which is why the dog had failed to respond to the electrical stimulation. Bayliss said the dog had been suffering from chorea, a disease that causes involuntary spasm, and that any movement Lind af Hageby and Schartau had seen was not purposive. Four students, three women and a man, were called by Bayliss's counsel and testified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had appeared to be unconscious.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had been adequately anaesthetized. They said {{the dog had}} appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|After {{discarding}} two drafts, Bell approached producer Frank Spotnitz for help. Spotnitz suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> {{could escape}} from a ship {{and go on}} a killing spree. In addition, Spotnitz also {{came up with the}} idea for Mulder and Berquist to develop a quasi-romance before the latter is killed at the end of the episode. Bell began to write the script on January 2, 1999, a mere three weeks before pre-production was scheduled to begin. The episode ended up being re-written right up to the start of shooting on February 2.|$|E
50|$|O'Higgins {{and others}} back-tested the {{strategy}} {{as far back}} as the 1920s and found <b>that</b> investing in <b>the</b> <b>Dogs</b> consistently outperformed <b>the</b> market as a whole.

5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that he had broken the law by using the dog twice, but said that he had done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E
5|$|Controversy was ignited {{with the}} {{publication}} of Roland Huntford's book Scott and Amundsen (1979, re-published and televised in 1985 as The Last Place on Earth). Huntford was critical of Scott's supposedly authoritarian leadership style and of his poor judgment of men, and blamed him for a series of organisational failures that led to the death of everyone in the polar party. Scott's personal standing suffered from these attacks; efforts to restore his reputation have included the account by Ranulph Fiennes (a direct rebuttal of Huntford's version), Susan Solomon's scientific analysis of the weather conditions that ultimately defeated Scott, David Cranes's 2005 biography of Scott, and Karen May's new analysis of Scott's disobeyed orders specifying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> teams transport his returning party swiftly back to the base camp.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} around 60 students, Bayliss stimulated the nerves with {{electricity}} {{for half an}} hour, {{but was unable to}} demonstrate his point. The dog was then handed to a student, Henry Dale, a future Nobel laureate, who removed the dog's pancreas, then killed him with a knife through the heart. This became a point of embarrassment during the libel trial, when Bayliss's laboratory assistant, Charles Scuttle, testified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> had been killed with chloroform or the ACE mixture. After Scuttle's testimony Dale told the court that he had, in fact, used a knife.|$|E
50|$|Realizing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> {{will return}} for another assault, Jerry tells his family, Marge, Hardiman, and Walker to board up {{the windows and}} doors of <b>the</b> house. Later <b>that</b> night, <b>the</b> group carries Dodge's body down to the docks and place him in a boat, pushing it out to sea to prevent the pack from {{trying to get at}} it. Knowing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> will be back, they then quickly return to the house and lock {{themselves}} inside.|$|R

5|$|Later that night, Detweiler {{arrives at}} a vet's office to get tranquilizers and leaves. The vet goes to the back and is {{attacked}} by the Dhole but he locks the room before it can cause any harm. The dog catchers arrive and open fire on the wrong dog. While the vet tries to operate on the hurt dog Scully enters the building and begins to hear screaming in the back room. She discovers that the vet has been attacked. After Scully leaves, the hurt animal transforms into the dhole, revealing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> can mimic any shape.|$|E
5|$|A fictionalized memoir set in {{both the}} United States and France during the 1960s American civil rights movement, White Dog focuses on the events that occur after Gary and his then-wife Jean Seberg, an actress and an activist, adopt a {{handsome}} and clearly well-trained German Shepherd dog who comes back to their home with one of their other dogs. At first, the dog, which they name Batka, is an ideal new member of the family: intelligent, devoted, and quickly befriending the couple's assortment of other animals. To their dismay, they discover <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> a former Alabama police dog, was trained to attack black people on sight. Although they are told the dog is {{too old to be}} retrained, they take him to a black dog trainer to try. Instead, the man trains the dog to attack white people, including Gary himself. Gary states that he changed the ending of the American version to be more optimistic.|$|E
5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.|$|E

5000|$|The {{main area}} where dogs were buried {{has often been}} termed a cemetery, {{implying}} a sacred area set aside for burials, but Paula Wapnish and Brian Hesse note that [...] "dogs were buried where there was space, rather than a space being prepared to receive dogs." [...] If <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were buried in conjunction with religious activities, the combination of careful burial {{with a lack of}} markers or grave goods and the disturbance of previous burials may indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were revered up to the point of burial, then granted no significance thereafter. Alternatively, Wapnish and Hesse suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were simply semi-feral urban dogs whose burial in one principal site was simply the result of local custom rather than any religious motivation. Another explanation has been put forward by Anne Marie Smith, who argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> could have been bred for trade to supply dog-venerating cults in the eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, and were buried on the same site where they lived.|$|R

5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{reasons why the}} Cynics are so named. First because of the {{indifference}} of their way of life, for they make a cult of indifference and, like dogs, eat and make love in public, go barefoot, and sleep in tubs and at crossroads. The second reason is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> is a shameless animal, and they make a cult of shamelessness, not as being beneath modesty, but as superior to it. The third reason is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> is a good guard, and they guard the tenets of their philosophy. The fourth reason is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> is a discriminating animal which can distinguish between its friends and enemies. So do they recognize as friends those who are suited to philosophy, and receive them kindly, while those unfitted they drive away, like dogs, by barking at them.|$|E
