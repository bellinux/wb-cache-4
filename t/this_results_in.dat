5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. Some {{religious}} thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize {{the use of the term}} agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; <b>this</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> frequent criticisms of those who adopt the term as avoiding the atheist label.|$|E
5|$|Broaching speeds {{vary from}} 20 to 120surface feet per minute (SFPM). <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> a {{complete}} cycle time of 5 to 30seconds. Most {{of the time}} is consumed by the return stroke, broach handling, and workpiece loading and unloading.|$|E

5|$|Liquid or solid xenon {{nanoparticles}} can {{be formed}} {{at room temperature}} by implanting Xe+ ions into a solid matrix. Many solids have lattice constants smaller than solid Xe. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> compression of the implanted Xe to pressures that may be sufficient for its liquefaction or solidification.|$|E
5|$|No {{decompression}} limits {{have been}} reduced. In most cases <b>this</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> the repetitive group shifting one letter down, but for 50fsw it shifted 2 letters, and for 40fsw, by three letters.|$|E

5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes to orbit Earth. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The chronically low oxygen {{levels in}} the blood also lead to {{increased}} release of erythropoietin and the activation of erythropoeisis, the production of red blood cells. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> polycythemia, abnormally increased numbers of circulating red blood cells and an elevated hematocrit.|$|E
5|$|This {{equation}} {{suggests that}} the best solvent for the uranium carbonate processing {{is a mixture of}} carbonate with bicarbonate.

5|$|This {{iterative}} procedure {{keeps track of}} the search boundaries with the two variables. Some implementations may check whether the middle element {{is equal to the}} target {{at the end of the}} procedure. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> a faster comparison loop, but requires one more iteration on average.|$|E
5|$|A simple case {{of dynamic}} {{equilibrium}} occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction. In such a situation, a {{force is applied}} {{in the direction of}} motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> zero net force, but since the object started with a non-zero velocity, it continues to move with a non-zero velocity. Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force. However, when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.|$|E
5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets {{form in the}} inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> coagulation of purely rocky grains {{and later in the}} formation of rocky planetesimals. Such conditions are thought to exist in the inner 3–4AU part of the disk of a Sun-like star.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} through Jarbo Gap, SR 70 {{drops down}} into the canyon of the North Fork Feather River, which it follows almost to Quincy, usually {{on the opposite side}} from the Feather River Route; <b>this</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> two places where both transportation lines cross the river and each other. The first of these is the Pulga Bridge, an arch bridge that crosses over a lower railroad truss bridge; soon after are the highway's three tunnels through rock formations in the canyon. After a fair distance through the canyon, and that formed by the East Branch North Fork Feather River, SR 70 reaches the junction with State Route 89 near Paxton; Routes 70 and 89 overlap southeast from that point, where the East Branch splits into Indian Creek and Spanish Creek.|$|E
5|$|After {{recovering}} from her injuries, Laila discovers {{that she is}} pregnant with Tariq's child. After being informed by Abdul Sharif that Tariq has died, she agrees to marry Rasheed, a man eager to have a young and attractive second wife in hopes of having a son with her. When Laila gives birth to a daughter, Aziza, Rasheed is displeased and suspicious. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> him becoming abusive towards Laila. Mariam and Laila eventually become confidants and best friends. They plan {{to run away from}} Rasheed and leave Kabul but are caught at the bus station. Rasheed beats them and deprives them of water for several days, almost killing Aziza.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom. Wales is mountainous and has a mild, wet climate. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> only a small {{proportion}} of the land area being suitable for arable cropping, but grass for the grazing of livestock is present in abundance. As a proportion of the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast. Arable cropping is limited to the flatter parts and elsewhere dairying and livestock farming predominate.|$|E
5|$|An {{increasing}} number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> initial treatment failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies, such as a quadruple therapy, which adds a bismuth colloid, such as bismuth subsalicylate. For the treatment of clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori, the use of levofloxacin {{as part of the}} therapy has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. <b>This</b> <b>results</b> <b>in</b> an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.|$|E
