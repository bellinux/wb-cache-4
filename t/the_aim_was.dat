5|$|As Reich Commissioner for the Consolidation of German Nationhood (RKFDV) {{with the}} {{incorporated}} VoMi Himmler was {{deeply involved in}} the Germanization program for the East, particularly Poland. As laid out in the General Plan for the East, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to enslave, expel or exterminate the native population and to make Lebensraum ("living space") for Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans). He continued his plans to colonise the east, even when many Germans were reluctant to relocate there, and despite negative effects on the war effort.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion was {{convinced}} that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which would prevent further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{himself said}} {{that he did not want}} such a large number of Ulstermen, as he had saved the grain harvest himself, and that only ten or fifteen labourers were needed to save the root crops. He feared that a large number of Ulstermen would lead to sectarian violence. While local Land League leaders said that there would be no trouble from them if <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> simply to harvest the crops, more extreme {{sections}} of the local population did threaten violence against the expedition and the troops.|$|E

5|$|Concepts for an MMORPG {{within the}} Dragon Quest series began among a small team during the later {{development}} of Dragon Quest VIII. Development progressed alongside that of Dragon Quest IX. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> {{to make it}} accessible to series fans and newcomers alike, along with creating a long-term content plan. The development team featured multiple series veterans, including director Jin Fujisawa, series creator and designer Yuji Horii, series artist Akira Toriyama, and series composer Koichi Sugiyama. New staff members included producer Yosuke Saito, who had previously worked on the Drakengard series and whose company Orca helped with development; and Chikara Saito, who joined as co-director in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Development of Invisible War began {{following}} {{the success of}} Deus Ex. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> {{to create a more}} accessible version of the original game's systems while preserving its essentials. Original designer Harvey Smith directed the game, while Alexander Brandon and Sheldon Pacotti returned respectively as composer and scenario writer. Additional music and voice work was provided by the rock band Kidneythieves. Due to being developed for PC and Xbox, the game's environments needed to be designed with the console's hardware limitations in mind. In later interviews, members of the team have faulted their decisions for the title.|$|E
5|$|Fleischmann and Weissmandl's rescue group, the Working Group, {{devised a}} more ambitious {{proposal}} in November that year. Known as the Europa plan or Grossplan, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to bribe the SS {{with money from}} Jews overseas, primarily the United States, to stop the deportation of all Jews to Poland. Various sums have been mentioned in connection with this, including $2–3 million. Nothing came of it, reportedly because Heinrich Himmler intervened in August 1943.|$|E

5|$|Once the fleets {{were close}} enough, exchanges of {{missiles}} began, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows and javelins. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> not to sink ships, but to deplete {{the ranks of}} the enemy crews before the boarding actions, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Soma Bringer was the {{creation}} of producer and studio co-founder Tetsuya Takahashi. Initially a standard role-playing game before transitioning to action role-playing due to hardware restrictions, <b>the</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to create an engaging multiplayer experience: this resulted in the gameplay being developed before the story, a reversal of the development style used for earlier Monolith Soft titles. It featured returning staff from Takahashi's earlier titles, including Xeno series writer Soraya Saga, and Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Development took approximately two years.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Space Centre was {{established}} as a foundation on 5 July 1987, {{under the protection of}} the Ministry of Trade and Industry. It immediately took over Andøya Rocket Range and TSS followed suit in 1990. TSS was upgraded in 1991 to be able to operate with ERS-1. In 1995 NRS established a subsidiary, Norwegian Space Centre Property, to own the facilities in Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The same year, TSS was converted to a limited company, of which half was sold to the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC). <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> that TSS would operate as a fully commercial enterprise. Its first major contract was with the Canadian Radarsat.|$|E

5|$|The Okapi Conservation Project, {{established}} in 1987, works towards {{the conservation of}} the okapi {{as well as the}} growth of the indigenous Mbuti people. In November 2011, the White Oak Conservation center and Jacksonville Zoo and Gardens hosted an international meeting of the Okapi Species Survival Plan (SSP) and the Okapi European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) at Jacksonville, which was attended by representatives from zoos from the USA, Europe and Japan. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to discuss the management of captive okapis and arrange support for okapi conservation. Many zoos in North America and Europe currently have okapis in captivity.|$|E
5|$|The Red Bull Air Race was {{conceived}} in 2001 in the Red Bull sports think-tank {{which has been}} responsible for creating a range of new sports events across the world. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to develop a new aviation race that would challenge the ability of the world's best pilots, creating a race in the sky that was not simply about speed, but also precision and skill. The answer was to build a specially designed obstacle course which the pilots would navigate at high speeds.|$|E

5|$|The {{modifications}} {{are attributed}} to Maunsell’s Chief Draughtsman James Clayton, who had transferred to Ashford railway works in 1914 from Derby works. They {{were the result of}} cooperation between the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR) and the Great Western Railway (GWR) when Maunsell was seconded to the Railway Executive Committee during the First World War. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to create a series of standard freight and passenger locomotives for use throughout Britain, and meant that Clayton was privy to the latest GWR developments in steam design. These included streamlined steam passages, long-travel valves, the maximisation of power through reduced cylinder sizes and higher boiler pressure.|$|E
5|$|The next NASA {{astronaut}} {{to stay on}} Mir was Michael Foale. Foale and Russian {{mission specialist}} Elena Kondakova boarded Mir from Atlantis on mission STS-84. The STS-84 crew transferred 249 items between the two spacecraft, along with water, experiment samples, supplies and hardware. One of the first items transferred to Mir was an Elektron oxygen-generating unit. Atlantis was stopped three times while backing away during the undocking sequence on May 21. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to collect data from a European sensor device designed for future rendezvous of ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) with the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|Beardmore was {{sufficiently}} impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support, but other donations proved {{hard to come}} by. Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton presented to the Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, {{were published in the}} Royal Society's newsletter, Geographic Journal. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. Shackleton then worked hard to persuade others of his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir Philip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed £2,000 (2011 equivalent £157,000) to secure a place on the expedition; author Campbell Mackellar; and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh, whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship Nimrod. On 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of Lieutenant).|$|E

5|$|In 1986, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) {{approved}} a follow-on {{class of the}} earlier Project 15 Delhi-class destroyers. <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> that the follow-on class would incorporate {{a higher level of}} air-defence, land attack, anti-submarine and anti-ship capabilities than the preceding class. However, the Indian Navy did not initially take up the option. By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had redesigned the follow-on Kolkata class to incorporate even higher levels of technology (including modern stealth characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. Concept and function for Project 15A was framed by the navy's Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL).|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron {{returned}} from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, {{the most of any}} B-1B squadron on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled an average of two to three air support requests per day. On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500lb GBU-54 bombs, 500lb and 2,000lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), and Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare against ground targets; the B-1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March, Germany {{launched}} Operation Michael. This attack, {{which became}} the opening salvo of their Spring Offensive, aimed to deliver a single, decisive, war winning blow. The Germans intended to strike the southern British flank, to separate the British and French armies and then move north to engage {{the bulk of the}} British forces in France in a vernichtungsschlacht (battle of annihilation). <b>The</b> <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> to inflict such a defeat upon the British armies that the country would abandon the war, which in turn would force the French to sue for peace. After the first ten days of the German offensive, the casualties suffered by the 2nd and the 47th (London) Divisions were such that the 38th was ordered south to take up positions near Albert to relieve the two formations. The infantry moved south, and the divisional artillery remained at Armentières to support the 34th Division and subsequently took part in the Battle of the Lys. During this battle, the artillery went on to aid French forces before being transferred temporarily to the British 25th Division and conducting a fighting withdrawal. Its actions with both divisions earned the men of the divisional artillery plaudits from both divisional commanders.|$|E
