5|$|By 1977, {{a second}} wave of the punk rock {{movement}} was breaking in the three countries where it had emerged, {{as well as in}} many other places. Bands from the same scenes often sounded very different from each other, reflecting <b>the</b> <b>eclectic</b> state of punk music during the era. While punk rock remained largely an underground phenomenon in North America, Australia, and the new spots where it was emerging, in the UK it briefly became a major sensation.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the Noble Organisation put {{the pier}} for sale, with an {{expected}} price of £30 million. It was rumoured {{that the council}} wanted to buy the pier, but this was quickly ruled out. It {{was taken off the}} market the following year, due to lack of interest in suitable buyers. In 2016, it was sold to <b>the</b> <b>Eclectic</b> Bar Group, headed by former PizzaExpress owner Luke Johnson, who renamed the pier back to Brighton Palace Pier in July.|$|E
5|$|The Brighton Marine Palace and Pier, {{commonly}} known as Brighton Pier or the Palace Pier is a Grade II* listed pleasure pier in Brighton, England, located in the city centre opposite the Old Steine.

It is managed and operated by <b>the</b> <b>Eclectic</b> Bar Group.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, <b>the</b> <b>eclectic</b> Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and gold leaf for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Peter Kingdom, {{a small-town}} {{solicitor}} whose work revolves around cases brought by <b>the</b> <b>eclectic</b> and eccentric populace of Market Shipborough. The series retains a largely episodic format, where self-contained plots play {{out before the}} hour concludes, though a continuing storyline concerns the mysterious disappearance of Simon Kingdom, Peter's half-brother. The first episode reveals that he vanished at sea six months previously and that everybody who knew him (including Peter) assumed that he committed suicide. Each week there are further indications {{that he did not}} die, culminating in episode six when it is revealed that he had a relationship with a woman, and that she had become pregnant with his child after he had supposedly died. In the first series we are also introduced to Peter's half-sister, Beatrice, who slowly becomes an integral character in the series.|$|E
5|$|Progressive rock {{came to be}} {{appreciated}} overseas, but it mostly remained a European, and especially British, phenomenon. Few American bands engaged in it, and the purest representatives of the genre, such as Starcastle and Happy the Man, remained limited to their own geographic regions. This is {{at least in part}} due to music industry differences between the US and Great Britain. Cultural factors were also involved, as US musicians tended to come from a blues background, while Europeans tended to have a foundation in classical music. North American progressive rock bands and artists often represented hybrid styles such as the complex arrangements of Rush, the hard rock of Captain Beyond, the Southern rock-tinged prog of Kansas, the jazz fusion of Frank Zappa and Return to Forever, and <b>the</b> <b>eclectic</b> fusion of the all-instrumental Dixie Dregs. British progressive rock acts had their greatest US success in the same geographic areas in which British heavy metal bands experienced their greatest popularity. The overlap in audiences led to the success of arena rock bands, such as Boston, Kansas, and Styx, who combined elements of the two styles.|$|E
