25|$|MST3K ran {{for three}} more seasons on the Sci-Fi Channel. During the Sci-Fi era, Best Brains found {{themselves}} more limited by the network: the pool of available films was smaller and {{they were required to}} use science fiction films, and the USA Network executives managing the show wanted to see a story arc and had more demands on how the show should be produced. Conflict between Best Brains and the network executives would eventually lead to the show's second cancellation. Peter Keepnews, writing for The New York Times, noted that the frequent cast changes, as well as the poorer selection of films that were more dull than bizarre in their execution, had caused the show to lose its original appeal. Another campaign to save the show was mounted, including several MST3K fans taking contributions for a full-page ad in the <b>trade</b> <b>publication</b> Daily Variety magazine, but was unsuccessful.|$|E

In March, Paul Hertz was named CEO and President as the company broke even. On January 15, 2015, the <b>trade</b> <b>publication</b> Supermarket News reported that A was still for sale. There were rumors of several parties being interested, including Cerberus, still owning Albertsons assets; however, no suitable offers were received. In May, rumors emerged that A was in more financial trouble as it declared a huge loss (in April) for the previous year, losing more business to better-managed competition. As customers were staying away, A considered its second bankruptcy filing in less than five years. There were rumors that A would sell all stores more than 40 miles from its corporate offices, shrinking the company to about 100 stores; other rumors were that the company would sell all its stores. Rumors also surfaced about a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and total liquidation, selling the company in pieces, as well as a Chapter 11 bankruptcy with selling in pieces. The company remained for sale as a whole, receiving no bids for any of its stores. Other alternatives were explored, including selling other assets.|$|E
