40|$|We {{examine the}} validities of <b>traditional</b> <b>trade</b> theorems and <b>patterns</b> of <b>trade</b> for an economy with an oligopsonistic {{intermediate}} input. Specifically, the model {{consists of two}} final goods. one intermediate good, and two primary factors. One final good and the intermediate good are produced using primary factors, capital and labor. The second final good is produced using the intermediate good and labor. All markets operate under perfect competition except the intermediate good market, which is oligopsonistic. This model reflects the real world phenomena of oligopsony power excerted by some industries (e. g., the food processing industry) in the intermediate good purchases.

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to combine}} the authors' {{findings}} of widespread bilateral trade-share persistence with some recent empirical evidence of substantial and rapid volatility in the country source of most products in order to extend {{the implications of this}} literature in several ways. Design/methodology/approach – The paper focuses on the behavior of aggregate bilateral trade flows for a large number of countries over the period 1980 - 2000. Findings – The paper infers that countries are frequently switching to very different products in their export bundles to particular destinations. It also argues that the evidence of rapid product turnover in trade is not inconsistent with <b>traditional</b> factor endowment <b>trade</b> <b>pattern</b> predictions, as has been inferred in the literature. Finally it finds that sunk costs in international trade appear to be external to particular products going to particular destinations but internal to the sum total of bilateral trade. Originality/value – The novelty of this paper resides in documenting the remarkably constant bilateral trade shares of 93 countries {{over the past two decades}} and the combination of this result with other known <b>trade</b> <b>pattern</b> characteristics to arrive at important new conclusions.

40|$|Trade in {{services}} has become topical, but little {{theory has been}} developed. This paper assumes that one commodity and the services of capital are tradable and examines the <b>traditional</b> <b>trade</b> results. Service trade can produce the same equilibrium as commodity trade, but substantial differences exist {{depending on whether the}} tradable commodity is capital or labor intensive. Tariffs on either commodity have the same commodity price effects and will always increase the welfare of the immobile factor labor. Factor income taxes can also affect <b>trade</b> <b>patterns.</b> When both goods and capital services are tradable, there is an indeterminacy in <b>trade</b> <b>patterns,</b> and tariffs, while reducing commodity trade, may not reduce welfare.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{dynamics}} of <b>trade</b> <b>patterns</b> in the six largest industrialised countries and in eight fast growing Asian economies. For each of these countries we study {{the shape of the}} sectoral distribution of an index of trade specialisation and its evolution over time. Our analysis shows a marked difference between the advanced and the emerging countries as far as the degree of persistence is concerned: the former are in fact characterised by a highly persistent <b>trade</b> <b>pattern,</b> while the latter's specialisation is highly mobile. However, the two groups of countries are more similar as far as the evolution of the degree of specialisation is concerned: although emerging countries are still more specialised than the industrialised countries, both groups show a tendency toward a reduced polarisation and a more symmetric distribution of the specialisation index. This evidence is in line with the <b>traditional</b> <b>trade</b> theory, in which changing comparative advantage is the determinant of a changing <b>trade</b> <b>pattern.</b> On the contrary, this evidence does not support the idea that self-reinforcing mechanisms are prominent in international trade specialisation. ...|$|R

40|$|It is only {{recently}} {{that the need for}} New Zealand to find and develop new food markets has become apparent. Up till then, her established markets, mainly the United Kingdom, have been able to absorb all the food products she produced and to pay the price she expected for them. In recent years, a number of adverse developments, mainly in the field of international trade, have made it necessary for New Zealand to re-examine her <b>traditional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>pattern</b> and to consider seriously, the prospects and problems of developing markets in Asia and other underdeveloped regions of the world. These adverse developments are: (a) The increasing tendency of developed countries to adopt national agricultural support policies, which aim at maintaining domestic farm price and income at levels higher than would otherwise prevail and which imply higher costs and obstructing imports. (b) Virtually all the established markets for New Zealand's food produce are found in the high income countries where food consumption per head is reaching a relatively high level both in quantitative and qualitative terms. (c) There is an increasing possibility of the United Kingdom entering the E. E. C. in the very near future. One of the countries that New Zealand is showing increasing interest in recent years is Malaya. Her thriving economy, friendly government arid the gradually changing tastes of her consumers are attractive attributes to a food exporter like New Zealand. The main {{purpose of the present study}} is to shed some light on the nature of a particular section of the Malayan market, namely the middle and upper middle class market for meat and dairy products. In developing the new market in Malaya, it is extremely important to recognise the fact that there is virtually no one single market serving the whole population, but in reality three distinct markets, depending on the standard of living of the particular section of the people. This is so in practically all underdeveloped countries where there is a great disparity in the distribution of wealth and hence living standards. The three markets are: (a) A relatively small group of consumers with a great deal of wealth. This group provides most of the purchasing power particularly for the better quality goods and luxury items. (b) A second group consisting of the great majority of the population whose purchasing power is extremely limited and this is spent on absolute necessities. (c) The third group – middle and upper middle class - has a living standard in between the above two extremes. In general, it is fair to say that it is the third group which will provide the main market for New Zealand products in the present, as well as for the foreseeable future. However, in the very long run, it is the market below this level, namely the group making up the great majority of the population, which is important, and the rate at which this market could be developed will of course depend on the rate of economic development of the country as a whole...|$|R

40|$|During the 1960 s, {{empirical}} {{data showed that}} countries import and export similar products, which suggested that <b>trade</b> <b>patterns</b> {{would not be in}} accordance with the <b>traditional</b> <b>trade</b> theory of factor endowments and new theoretical approaches set out. Economic theory teaches us that different relative factor prices and endowment will lead to the increasing inter-industry trade while economies of scale and scope will generate intra-industry trade, the exchange of similar manufactured goods, with companies specialized in different varieties of similar goods. Economic theory predicts that the volume of intra-industry trade {{is a function of the}} similarity and the level of gross domestic product of countries, and of a distance. There are two types of intra-industry trade, horizontal (the exchange of similar product) and vertical (the exchange of inputs for more processed outputs or the exchange of quality different products). Scale economics, similarity of income levels, and number of varieties produced play important roles in IIT, especially in horizontal IIT, whereas factors such as comparative advantage, dissimilarity in income levels lead to the development of the <b>trade</b> <b>pattern</b> based on the Heckscher-Ohlin Trade Theory and increasing inter-industry trade and vertical IIT to a lesser degree. Economic studies show a relatively high level of IIT with the EU for all CEECs countries and vertical IIT accounts for 80 to 90 percents of total IIT.
