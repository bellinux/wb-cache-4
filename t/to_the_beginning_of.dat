In this period, {{the form of the}} Czech press has been changed distinctly. The freedom of press has been restricted and {{only a small number of}} periodicals had <b>the</b> permission <b>to</b> publish. All of them needed a license. In the first part of my work I'll start with picturing the Kolín region, sketching its historical development, the biggest part being dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> period around and after the World War II. I'll focus on the political, economical, demographical and cultural events that took place in this time period in the Kolín area. The center of my work lies in the characteristics of the periodical press that has been published in the Kolín area from 1945 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>begin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 60 's, more specifically the information processing that I have been provided with in the Regional archives of Kolín. I will also make use of the contemporary press and secondary literature. The aim of my work is to find out what newspapers were being published in the Kolín area in these years, who published them, how difficult it was to actually publish periodical press and I will also mention the structure, graphic design, contents and prices of the newspaper...|$|R

5|$|A {{hallmark}} of the curriculum in the earliest days was study organized around major themes—trees, Shakespeare, Egypt and other subjects—that built over the school year into major class projects, performances, and all-school gatherings. Many of these themes and events have grown into lasting school traditions, with which the school community has come to identify each group and certain times of year. One the school's most cherished traditions, tapping maple trees to make syrup, began with the move to the new building in 1929. The Spring Fair, in which groups one through five each prepare and perform their own dance, has been held annually since the 1930s—the Maypole dance by the fifth group dates back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the Cottage School.|$|E

5|$|Cerro Azul {{was quiet}} from 1846 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century. After a {{possible}} precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently {{rose out of}} the caldera, {{and at least a}} few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a plume 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4mi) into the air over 8minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.|$|E

5|$|Films of {{the time}} {{typically}} used dinosaurs as monsters, with the added element of atomic fears in the early Cold War. Thus, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953) and Godzilla (1954; American release 1956) portray monstrous dinosaur-like prehistoric reptiles that go on rampages after being awakened by atomic bomb tests. An alternative appears in Disney's animated Fantasia (1940), in its The Rite of Spring sequence, which attempted to portray dinosaurs with some scientific accuracy (although it has the common error of showing prehistoric animals from many different time periods living at the same time) and also in Karel Zeman's Cesta do praveku (1955;Journey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Beginning</b> <b>of</b> Time) Czechoslovakian children's science fiction movie inspired by Zdeněk Burian's work.|$|E

The opening aerial bombardment on 2 October also caused little damage to German defensive positions; the 450 aircraft which took part in the first wave failed to register a single direct hit on any German pillbox. Their targets had been largely obscured by thick smoke from the Allied artillery barrage. As the aircraft finished their assault, the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines, firing 18,696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a couple of hours.|$|E
