The temple {{is classified}} as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Some of the ancient Sanskrit books consider the temple as a uthamakshetram, meaning the place that gives <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> its devotees. The sculptures on the pillars of the temple reveal the earliest practice of Krishna worship in Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|Garfield Sobers, {{from the}} Caribbean island of Barbados, was widely {{regarded}} as one of the world's finest cricketers from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, and is placed by many among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> ever play the sport. An all-rounder, he made his debut for the West Indies cricket team, the multinational side representing the Caribbean in international cricket, at the age of 17 in 1954. He was a regular member of the team for the next two decades. Sobers set a then-world record highest individual score of 365 runs not out during a Test match against Pakistan in 1958, and became captain of the West Indies team six years later. In domestic first-class cricket, he was one of the first West Indians to play abroad, representing South Australia and Nottinghamshire during the 1960s and 1970s. His batting, bowling and fielding were all regarded as excellent by contemporaries, but his decision making and tactics were occasionally criticised.|$|E

Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E

25|$|Go Seigen is {{commonly}} {{considered to be}} among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> have ever played go, and is frequently deemed {{to have been the}} best player of the 20th century. He dominated professional go for {{more than a quarter of}} a century. He maintained a brilliant match record and successively defeated all the leading players of the day in a series of notable jubango (contest between two players consisting of ten games), even forcing them down to handicaps. Some of the defeated were Kitani Minoru, Karigane Junichi, Hashimoto Utaro, Iwamoto Kaoru, Fujisawa Hosai, Sakata Eio, and Takagawa Kaku. Go lost just one jubango, and that was against Fujisawa Hosai. However, the match was played with Fujisawa taking the josen handicap throughout, and Fujisawa only managed to win with a score of 6 to 4. Some ten years later, Go Seigen took revenge on Fujisawa by beating him in two consecutive jubango with lopsided scores of 7-2 and 5-1 respectively. One must note that these jubango matches were all played without komi, and indeed the same applied to the vast majority of games Go Seigen played during his career. Go Seigen won the Oteai six times, and won a special Nihon Ki-in championship tournament in 1933.|$|E

25|$|The Phillies {{opened the}} season {{on the road for}} the first time since the opening of Citizens Bank Park in 2004; they {{defeated}} the Washington Nationals in their first game of the season, 11–1, behind seven innings from Roy Halladay and a grand slam from Plácido Polanco. Ryan Howard moved into a tie for fifth place on the franchise's all-time home run list by hitting his 223rd, matching Greg Luzinski's career total. He passed Luzinski the following day with a two-run home run to center field off of Jason Marquis in Philadelphia's 8–4 victory, sealing the team's first 2–0 start since the 2003 season. They did not complete the sweep, however, as the Nationals won the third game of the series, 6–5, after newly acquired relief pitcher Nelson Figueroa allowed an RBI double to Ryan Zimmerman in the seventh inning. The Phillies took sole possession of first place by defeating the Houston Astros in the opener of their second series on April 9, defeating Brad Mills' new club, 8–0; Raúl Ibañez broke out of a spring slump by collecting three hits and a walk in four official at bats. Jamie Moyer's first start of the season resulted in the Phillies' fourth win, backed by another Howard home run; Philadelphia scored 41 runs in their first 5 games. A complete-game victory for Halladay in his second Phillies start sealed the series sweep for Philadelphia, as they defeated the Astros, 2–1, on April 11. Halladay notched both the 150th win and 50th complete game of his career. In the home opener against Washington, Jimmy Rollins was scratched from the starting lineup due to a calf strain—which later sent him to the disabled list—and Jayson Werth left the game in the fourth inning with a sore hip; however, the Phillies scored five runs in the fifth inning to come from behind and defeat the Nationals, giving Hamels his second victory of the season. Figueroa earned his first victory as a Phillie on April 14 when Philadelphia defeated Washington in the second game of the series, 14–7; their 7–1 start was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> open a season since 1993, when they appeared in that year's World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. The bullpen, however, allowed a 4–2 lead to turn into a 7–5 loss in the final game of the series; Danys Báez allowed three runs on home runs by Adam Dunn and Zimmerman to take the loss.|$|E

500|$|Marc Okrand, who {{developed}} the Klingon language for the Star Trek films, was hired to devise the Atlantean language for Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Guided by the directors' initial concept {{for it to be}} a [...] "mother-language", Okrand employed an Indo-European word stock with its own grammatical structure. He would change the words if they began to sound too much like an actual, spoken language. John Emerson designed the written component, making hundreds of random sketches of individual letters from among which the directors chose <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> represent the Atlantean alphabet.

Before he could get started, Cunningham walked in and offered him a different part: Jason. Without having read a single word, Cunningham just looked at Ari and said, [...] "You're the right size, you've got it." [...] In the original Friday the 13th, Ari Lehman is seen only in a brief flashback as the surprise ending. Subsequent actors who portrayed a young Jason include Timothy Burr Mirkovich in Jason Takes Manhattan and Spencer Stump in Freddy vs. Jason. The adult role of Jason Voorhees has been played by various actors, some not credited, others taking great pride in their parts. Due to the physical demands the adult character requires, and the lack of emotional depth depicted, many of the actors since have been stuntmen.
