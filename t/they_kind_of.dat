[...] "Kind of a get-too-involved-in-her-life-type of therapist," [...] he retorted. [...] "Those guys are so close in real life <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> do that for each other anyway. Bonnie has the life Jules wishes she has." [...] Aniston had previously worked with Courteney Cox in the American sitcom Friends, and again on the serial drama Dirt. Aniston became the second cast member from Friends {{to appear on the}} television series, succeeding Lisa Kudrow, who previously appeared in the season one episode [...] "Rhino Skin", also playing the role of a medical professional (specifically, a dermatologist).|$|E
500|$|Actor Raphael Sbarge became {{attracted}} {{to join the}} series because he would effectively be helping tell two stories, one in a fantasy world {{and the other in}} a modern setting. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Sbarge compared Once Upon a Time to the television series Lost [...] "in that they have a large ensemble and what they do is that they take a few characters and <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> take them, effectively on a deep dive." [...] When Sbarge read the script for [...] "That Still Small Voice", he was worried about [...] "treading into people's imaginations," [...] but ultimately decided that [...] "they cast me for a reason because there are some qualities in me that they obviously recognize for the story they want to tell." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Lomax's single {{received}} considerable promotion, it was {{a surprising}} commercial failure. [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] did not chart in Britain. In America, the song reached number 117 during a two-week run on the Bubbling Under listings of Billboards Hot 100 chart, and [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You" [...] placed at number 125. [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] was a hit in Canada, however, peaking at number 29 on the RPM 100 in November 1968. In a 1974 feature on his career in ZigZag magazine, Lomax said that the song's release in tandem with [...] "obvious" [...] hits like [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and [...] "Those Were the Days" [...] jinxed its commercial performance, since radio stations were reluctant to risk alienating other record labels by featuring all four Apple singles too heavily on their playlists. Lomax added: [...] "So <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> lost me in the shuffle." ...|$|E

500|$|Stardust {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most publications, both on its original release {{and for its}} various reissues. Rolling Stone praised the album: [...] "For all the sleek sophistication of the material, Stardust is as down-home as the Legion dance. Heard coast to coast in lounges and on elevator soundtracks, these tunes {{have become part of}} the folk music of exurban America. And that's the way Nelson plays them—spare and simple, with a jump band's verve and a storyteller's love of a good tale. By offering these songs, he's displaying the tools of a journeyman musician's trade—worn smooth and polished by constant use—and when he lays them out this way, <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> look like works of art. Willie Nelson may be acknowledging both his own and country music's debt to Broadway and Tin Pan Alley, but he's also showing these hallowed musical institutions how the country makes their music its own".|$|E
500|$|Jon Auer, {{co-founder of}} the American power pop band The Posies, {{recorded}} a cover of the song on his 2001 solo EP 6 ½. Website Stereogum listed the cover at number five on their list of The 20 Best Indie Rock Madonna Covers. A 2007 folk music tribute compilation to Madonna, entitled Through the Wilderness, features a cover of the song by Golden Animals. Australian rock band DMA's covered the song during their BBC Radio 1 sessions with Annie Mac on March 8, 2016. Michelle Geslani from Consequence of Sound website praised the cover saying that it would [...] "undoubtedly be hailed as yet another successful entry in DMA's young career" [...] and described the cover as [...] "easily tweaking the swirling, retro number into a psychedelic, arena-ready anthem". Michael Carr from Music Feeds magazine also praised the cover saying [...] "Lending itself surprisingly well to the boys’ shoegazey brit pop treatment, the lads absolutely nail it... To be honest though, <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> won on song choice alone".|$|E
500|$|Minogue is {{regarded}} as a gay icon, which she has encouraged with comments including [...] "I am not a traditional gay icon. There's been no tragedy in my life, only tragic outfits" [...] and [...] "My gay audience has been with me from the beginning ... <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> adopted me." [...] Minogue has explained that she first became aware of her gay audience in 1988, when several drag queens performed to her music at a Sydney pub, and she later saw a similar show in Melbourne. She said that she felt [...] "very touched" [...] to have such an [...] "appreciative crowd", and this encouraged her to perform at gay venues throughout the world, as well as headlining the 1994 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. Minogue has one of the largest gay followings in the world. Minogue's sister, Dannii, also has a large gay following and has been regarded as a gay icon. In September 2007, Kylie Minogue was hailed the greatest gay icon of all time by The Sun.|$|E

500|$|Azaria's friends {{refer to}} him as [...] "the freakish mimic" [...] due to his ability to copy almost anyone's voice, {{instantly}} after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do this, but later {{realized that it was}} not a common talent. Azaria can [...] "remember every voice I hear, famous or otherwise... <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> remain in the memory banks, so I'm ready to trot them out." [...] Azaria was glad to have found the [...] "ultimate outlet" [...] for this skill, in The Simpsons. He [...] "didn't realize it , but it became like a lab for a character actor. I had to do so many voices." [...] In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: [...] "For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, I have made. Even characters like Gargamel, I've done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point I've done something similar on The Simpsons, at least somewhere along the line." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN graded {{the episode}} 8.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "pretty damn busy and quite fun", {{highlighting}} Skye's character {{development and the}} drama it caused, {{as well as the}} connections to [...] "Pilot", as high points of the episode. He praised the [...] "dark, but also necessary" [...] deaths depicted, and concluded that the series [...] "is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be [...] "mostly, quite good," [...] praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "might actually be as bad as the people they're trying to fight", and the character of Raina, who he called [...] "the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating [...] "while I loved the fact that <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of,</b> sort of, dredged up an actual Marvel character to use in this episode ... it was a shame that he too bore almost no resemblance to an actual person". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, [...] "perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight." [...] Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter decided that the [...] "episode wasn't as good as [...] "Eye Spy"—by the time we got to the last two segments, I really didn’t care what happened to “Scorch,”—but it was still better than the first three. It was all just so very ... perfunctory." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. I {{think that was the}} biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of the}} Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E

According to Wilton, this is because [...] "we were going through a lot tense situations and <b>they</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> [...] into the lyrics a bit." [...] La Torre elaborated this, saying: [...] "It's just about moving forward, going through the trenches, and seeing a great light at the end of the other side."
