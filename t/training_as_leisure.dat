40|$|Much {{is known}} about practice-induced {{plasticity}} of the motor system. But {{it is not clear}} how a physical training influences the mental rehearsal of the practiced task and its associated hemodynamic responses. In the present longitudinal study with two measurement time-points, we used the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a motor imagery task, in order to explore the dynamic neuro-functional changes induced by a highly complex physical training. The 11 golf novices between the age of 40 and 60 years practiced the motor <b>training</b> <b>as</b> <b>leisure</b> activity. Additionally, data from an age and sex-matched control group without golf training was collected. As a main result, we demonstrate that changes between the two measurement time-points were only found in the golf novice group. The golf novices showed a decrease in hemodynamic responses during the mental rehearsal of the golf swing in non-primary motor areas after the 40 h of golf practice. Thus, the results indicate that a complex physical leisure activity induces functional neuroplasticity in the seldom studied population of middle-aged adults, and that this effect is evident during mental rehearsal of the practiced task. This finding supports the idea that (a) a skill improvement is associated with a modified activation pattern in the associated neuronal network that can be identified during mental rehearsal of the practiced task, and that (b) a strict training protocol is not necessary to induce functional neuroplasticity...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} how Community Centers for the Elderly (CCEs) in Florianópolis (SC) are shaping up <b>as</b> <b>leisure</b> spaces for men. It’s an exploratory descriptive investigation with qualitative approach. Participated {{of this study}} four coordinators and a secretary (representing coordination) five CCEs, one of each area of the city. One semi-structured interview was used to investigate the leisure understandings; understandings of CCEs <b>as</b> <b>leisure</b> facilities; and perceptions on the participation of men. The technique of content analysis was applied. Leisure understandings were marked by functionalist aspects (practical activities, fun, escape from problems), and extended the understanding of CCEs <b>as</b> <b>leisure</b> facilities. While the CCE Central and Continente participation of men is limited to married in CCE North and East there are no limitations.

30|$|Our {{definition}} of leisure includes 46 activities encompassing socializing; eating out or also eating at home; doing sports; playing video games; watching television; reading; {{going to the}} cinema, the theater, or arts exhibitions; hiking; walking; fishing; hunting; performing religious practices; and relaxing. This corresponds to what Aguiar and Hurst (2007) and others define <b>as</b> “narrow” <b>leisure.</b> Broader measures include any time not at work, including housework and sleep. We do not consider housework <b>as</b> <b>leisure</b> (since it is not seen as enjoyable by many) but estimate a comparable model {{of the effect of}} retirement on housework of both partners. We also do not include sleep in <b>leisure</b> <b>as</b> it is closer to “biological” time than to leisure. Our aim is to capture complementarities in leisure, and therefore, we focus on activities that are considered <b>as</b> “pure” <b>leisure,</b> that is, enjoyable time.|$|R
