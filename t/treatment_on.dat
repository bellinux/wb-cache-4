5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} a reduced quality of life, and people with the condition incur increased healthcare costs, largely due to hospital admissions including observation and <b>treatment</b> <b>on</b> intensive care units.

Its main complication of heart failure affects 21–32% of patients.|$|E

However, with the Heat holding the worst record in the NBA and Wade still experiencing problems in his left knee, Heat coach Pat Riley announced Wade would miss the final 21 {{games of the season}} to undergo OssaTron <b>treatment</b> <b>on</b> his left knee.

5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of <b>treatment.</b> <b>On</b> neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of the war, Braithwaite, a popular commander, was {{temporarily}} in charge of the division while Russell was on leave. The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he was worn out and in January was evacuated to England for <b>treatment.</b> <b>On</b> recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the division that this was a punishment for his refusal to carry on with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.|$|E

Repulsed by Roy's obnoxious, boorish personality and insults toward people, including Lisa, Coach finds Roy not good enough for her. However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to like him and wants her father's blessings. To make matters worse, at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's <b>treatment</b> <b>on</b> her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late.|$|E

5|$|In May, before Cascade {{had become}} fully operational, Rommel {{defeated}} the British Army in Libya. Auchinleck rallied his forces at El Alamein and asked Clarke to draft plans for delaying the Axis advance, giving the Allies time to withdraw. Operation Sentinel {{was designed to}} convince Rommel, using camouflage, fakery and radio deception, that substantial British armour sat {{between him and the}} retreating Eighth Army. In spite of his success at El Alamein Auchinleck was replaced by Harold Alexander on , Clarke's third commander in under two years. Bernard Montgomery was handed control of the Eighth Army and instructed to push Rommel back. Montgomery knew Clarke, having taught him infantry tactics at the Staff College in 1931, and instructed him to prepare deception plans for the Second Battle of El Alamein. The plan involved major camouflage activity, Operation Bertram, radio deception, Operation Canwell and a disinformation campaign, Operation <b>Treatment.</b> <b>On</b> 9 September Clarke was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

5|$|The 5th Division was out {{of action}} for some months. It finally moved {{with the rest of}} the I Anzac Corps to the Somme sector in October. After months of {{fighting}} and recent rain, the front line area was a devastated muddy morass. McCay was ordered to undertake an attack with the 2nd Division's 7th Infantry Brigade at Flers, which cost 819 casualties and gained no ground. Once again, McCay's handling of his division showed poor planning and tactics. Moreover, at Flers he showed that he had not learned from the lessons of Fromelles. His relief was now only a matter of time. Nonetheless, McCay remained in command of the 5th Division until 18 December 1916 when he was granted medical leave in the United Kingdom for <b>treatment</b> <b>on</b> his leg, which the doctors diagnosed as neuralgia. Birdwood took the opportunity of removing McCay, ostensibly on medical grounds. McCay was mentioned in despatches a third time.|$|E
