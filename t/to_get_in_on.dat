2500|$|In early 1914, oil fever swept Calgary {{and other}} parts of {{southern}} Alberta. [...] Investors lined up outside makeshift brokerage houses <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> exploration activity triggered by the May 14, 1914 discovery of wet gas and oil at Turner Valley, southwest of Calgary. Reportedly, in one 24-hour period, investors and promoters formed more than 500 “oil companies.” Incorporated a year earlier, the Calgary Stock Exchange was unable to control some of the unscrupulous practices that relieved many Albertans of their savings.|$|E
2500|$|Adam {{is found}} in 1966, when a {{building}} is being knocked down, and he is revived. [...] On emerging from a hospital and collapsing on the London streets, Adam is rescued by Georgina Jones and taken to her flat. Though {{in many ways a}} typical swinging sixties woman, Georgina had grown up idolising Adam through tales of his turn-of-the-century exploits. She tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> all his cases, despite his efforts to stop her, and often manages to get a job at the scene in question at a moment's notice so she can interfere in the case. The part originally went to Ann Holloway in the untransmitted pilot episode, but was recast with Juliet Harmer as it was felt that Holloway's performance did not fit the series.|$|E

60|$|We {{returned}} to Middelburg by {{an entirely different}} route from that by which we came. Leaving {{the valley of the}} Olifants to our right, we trekked along the high-veldt, and thus avoided all the fever country. Roughly speaking, we had about 120 miles of country to get over to reach Middelburg, and we determined to do this in three days and two nights, so as <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the Saturday night, as we were much pressed for time. Now, according to English ideas, it is no great thing to travel 120 miles in three days; but it is six days' journey in an ox-waggon over bad country, {{and we were going to}} do it in half that time by doubling the speed.|$|E

60|$|He {{did not go}} back to work in {{the shaft}} that day, nor the next, nor the next. Instead, capped and mittened, a light stampeding outfit, {{including}} his rabbit skin robe, strapped on his back, he was out and away on a many-days' tramp over creeks and divides, inspecting the whole neighboring territory. On each creek he was entitled to locate one claim, but he was chary in thus surrendering up his chances. On Hunker Creek only did he stake a claim. Bonanza Creek he found staked from mouth to source, while every little draw and pup and gulch that drained into it was like-wise staked. Little faith was had in these side-streams. They had been staked by the hundreds of men who had failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Bonanza. The most popular of these creeks was Adams. The one least fancied was Eldorado, which flowed into Bonanza, just above Karmack's Discovery claim. Even Daylight disliked the looks of Eldorado; but, still riding his hunch, he bought a half share in one claim on it for half a sack of flour. A month later he paid eight hundred dollars for the adjoining claim. Three months later, enlarging this block of property, he paid forty thousand for a third claim; and, though it was concealed in the future, he was destined, not long after, to pay one hundred and fifty thousand for a fourth claim on the creek that had been the least liked of all the creeks.|$|E
