40|$|An {{understanding}} of the complexity factors that affect controller workload under higher levels of automation for conflict detection and resolution and under higher <b>traffic</b> <b>densities</b> is critical for future operations. This paper examines traffic complexity variables under higher levels of automation where the human controller {{is still in the}} loop, but is being supported by advanced conflict detection and resolution automation. The study involved two conflict resolution automation modes (i. e., trial-planning automation and advisory automation) and three <b>traffic</b> <b>densities</b> (i. e., 1 X, 2 X and 3 X). The results indicate that under the 1 X traffic condition, controller workload was the lowest with advanced levels of automation. The complexity and workload increased progressively for the 2 X and 3 X traffic conditions. Results also showed that several variables such as horizontal proximity, aircraft density, separation criticality index, and two degrees of freedom indices appear to be relevant complexity measures for higher <b>traffic</b> <b>densities.</b> The degrees of freedom index for aircraft in conflict appears to be a relevant measure for higher levels of automation.

5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile <b>traffic</b> <b>density.</b>|$|E

5|$|Alt US40 {{branches}} from US40 near exit 14 on I-68 at Keysers Ridge. It {{runs parallel}} to I-68 through northern Garrett County as a two-lane road with truck lanes on some uphill sections. The annual {{average daily traffic}} (AADT)—that is, the number of cars that use the road per day, averaged {{over the course of}} one year—is 1,831 at the western end of Alt US40. For comparison, the parallel section of I-68 has an AADT of 14,271. Alt US40 passes through some of the most mountainous terrain in Maryland. The route runs perpendicular to the mountain ridges in Garrett County, and as a result much of the section of the road in Garrett County runs uphill or downhill. The first mountain encountered by the highway east of Keysers Ridge is Negro Mountain. The road passes over the mountain at an elevation of , which is the highest point on Alt US40, and was also the highest point along the National Road. East of Negro Mountain, the highway enters Grantsville, where traffic increases, with the AADT increasing to 3,711, the highest <b>traffic</b> <b>density</b> on Alt US40 in Garrett County. In Grantsville, Alt US40 meets MD669, which connects with Pennsylvania Route 669 toward Salisbury, Pennsylvania.

Secondly, based on the model, a decentralized observer is designed. With the help of the Lyapunov function and S-procedure theory, the observer gains are computed by using linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. So, the <b>traffic</b> <b>densities</b> of the whole road network can be estimated by the designed observer.

40|$|Fluid limit a b s t r a c t In {{a variety}} of {{applications}} of traffic flow, including traffic simulation, real-time estimation and prediction, one requires a probabilistic model of traffic flow. The usual approach to constructing such models involves the addition of random noise terms to deterministic equations, {{which could lead to}} negative <b>traffic</b> <b>densities</b> and mean dynamics that are inconsistent with the original deterministic dynamics. This paper offers a new stochastic model of traffic flow that addresses these issues. The source of randomness in the proposed model is the uncertainty inherent in driver gap choice, which is represented by random state dependent vehicle time headways. A wide range of time headway distributions is allowed. From the random time headways, counting processes are defined, which repre-sent cumulative flows across cell boundaries in a discrete space and continuous time con-servation framework. We show that our construction implicitly ensures non-negativity of <b>traffic</b> <b>densities</b> and that the fluid limit of the stochastic model is consistent with cell trans-mission model (CTM) based deterministic dynamics. 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
