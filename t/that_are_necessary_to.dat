25|$|The {{relationship}} between habitus and field is two-way.

Concomitantly, by participating in the field, agents incorporate into their habitus the proper know-how {{that will allow them}} to constitute the field.

25|$|Certain themes appear {{repeatedly}} in {{depictions of the}} journey. Ra overcomes numerous obstacles in his course, representative of the effort necessary to maintain maat. The greatest challenge is the opposition of Apep, a serpent god who represents the destructive aspect of disorder, and who threatens to destroy the sun god and plunge creation into chaos. In many of the texts, Ra overcomes these obstacles {{with the assistance of}} other deities who travel with him; they stand for various powers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> uphold Ra's authority. In his passage Ra also brings light to the Duat, enlivening the blessed dead who dwell there. In contrast, his enemies—people who have undermined maat—are tormented and thrown into dark pits or lakes of fire.|$|E

25|$|The most optimum {{storage media}} that are {{available}} {{have been shown to}} be pH balanced cell preserving solutions. The best known and most extensively tested is called Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). It has all of the metabolites such as Ca, phosphate ions, K+ and glucose <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> maintain normal cell metabolism for long periods of time. HBSS has been extensively tested in dental and medical research for the past twenty years. This research has shown that 90% of cells stored in HBSS for 24 hours maintain their normal viability and after four days, still have 70%viable. In research studies, extracted dog’s teeth that have been placed in HBSS for four days can still be replanted with little signs of resorption. Hank's Balanced Salt Solution is found in a , a storage device for the storage, preservation, and regeneration of tooth root cells.|$|E

[...] "Preserve a quiet conscience and you will always have joy. A quiet conscience can endure much, and remains joyful in all trouble, but an evil conscience is always fearful and uneasy." [...] The anonymous medieval author of the Christian mystical work The Cloud of Unknowing similarly expressed the view that in profound and prolonged contemplation a soul dries up the [...] "root and ground" [...] of the sin that is always there, even after one's confession and however busy one is in holy things: [...] "therefore, whoever would work at becoming a contemplative must first cleanse his [...] conscience." [...] The medieval Flemish mystic John of Ruysbroeck likewise held that true conscience has four aspects <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> render a man just in the active and contemplative life: [...] "a free spirit, attracting itself through love"; [...] "an intellect enlightened by grace", [...] "a delight yielding propension or inclination" [...] and [...] "an outflowing losing of oneself in the abyss of... that eternal object which is the highest and chief blessedness... those lofty amongst men, are absorbed in it, and immersed in a certain boundless thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Priyanka Gandhi, while campaigned in Rae Bareli on 24 April, accused Narendra Modi of favouring {{businessmen}} by allocating land {{to their}} companies {{at very low}} prices and defended her husband Robert Vadra over the accusations of corruptions. While addressing a rally in Amethi on 5 May, Modi responded by criticising Priyanka for saying that BJP was involved in low level politics. He also added that former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had humiliated a former chief minister of a state at an airport. Priyanka Gandhi called Modi's statement an insult to his [...] "martyr father" [...] and criticised BJP for involving in low level politics. INC's senior leaders felt that Priyanka's attacks on Modi had energised the party workers. Priyanka also {{said that it is}} not 56-inch chest but big heart, moral strength <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> run the nation. She further said that Modi wanted power for himself and alleged that books defaming her family members were being dropped at night in the places where her public meetings were scheduled to take place. Agitated by the allegations BJP launched a CD and booklet titled Damadshree accusing Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ashok Gahlot of helping Vadra in acquiring land in violation of the regulations. Priyanka Gandhi criticised this move of the BJP and compared it to [...] "panicky rats". She also took a pun on Modi's remarks on Rahul Gandhi in which he called him Shehzada (prince) and Namuna (specimen), by calling Modi's behaviour childish.|$|E
