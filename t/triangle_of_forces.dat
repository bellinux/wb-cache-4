40|$|Terry Eagleton (1982) {{recently}} announced "the end of criticism" - but characteristically {{the announcement was}} ambiguous {{and by the end}} of his paper it is obvious enough that he is actually announcing another goal for criticism and thsi goal is not much of an advance upon the 'plain speaking' of his traditional English marxist background: We need to insist that rhetoric is a matter of inventio and dispositio,of (if you like) 'subject matter' and not just elecutio: that nothing, in short, persuades better than knowledge, and that certain kinds of knowledge are what the working class and other oppressed groups and classes in our society now need most. If one wanted a relation between 'ideology' and 'science' this late in the day, one could find it here (Eagleton 1982. p 106). The ambiguity is, however, deeper than the one concealed by a pun on 'ends': for this 'closure' of the criticism debate sits uneasily amidst a corpus which has generally eschewed closures of any kind. From the early days of Criticism and Ideology (1976 b) and Marxism and Literary Criticism (1976 a) to the recent work on Benjamin (1981), Eagleton (by which I intend a corpus of texts) has sat in similarly uneasy positions in respect of a number of traditional and recent currents in the arena of criticism and politics. This paper addresses some of the contradictions that arise in Eagleton, and its reason for doing so is to ask the question: does Eagleton furnish a distinct possibility of critique which has implications and applications of a general kind outside the domain of the purely 'literary'? It is this that I gloss by the question of the 'space of commentary'. If breadth is any indication, we should certainly expect a positive answer, judging by the manifold and diverse elements of Eagleton's 'synthesis' (if such it be). Firstly, there is a <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> <b>forces</b> produced by the tension between traditional English literary criticism, formalist semiotics and the deconstructionism of Derrida and the late(r) Barthes. But into this circumscribed geometry creep other English­ Continental tensions, such as that between Derrida (1977) and Austin/Searle (1977) over the position of language generally (Fish 1982); while the node of semiotics is further displaced by its relations with Althusserian marxism and the 'structuralism/phenomenology' contradiction - not to mention the numerous Marx/Freud proto-syntheses (Marcuse, Lacan, Deleuze). This takes us to a further triangle of critical forces which play across Eagleton's texts, forces outside but often subordinated to the domain of the 'literary': namely the relations of British Marxism (Williams, Thompson, etc.) to Althusserianism and to Frankfurt School culture critique, further diffused by glances in the direction of the Brecht/Benjamin productionist thesis. And this second triangle has a further dimension insofar as it is formed in the space of the 'critical' heritage of Marx, Engels and Lukacs. Consequently, a number of traditional concerns are up for grabs: base/super­ structure separations between material conditions and literary productions v pan­ productionist annulments of that dichotomy; ideology v science; the status of liter­ature (and especially fiction) in relation to the opposition formed by science/ideology; the position of and contradiction between theory and practice; and the problems of the 'subject' and textual 'closure'. In short, a veritable array of recent politico-critical oppositionalities and contradictions. The problem for us: how to cut through this broad band of discursive forces and their objects? The task is by no means an easy one, not simply because of its size but also because readings of Eagleton are further complicated by the very presence of 'the question of read­ing' in the corpus and we need to work out just where to stand in relation to the corpus's own reading practices and how much violence needs to be done to them...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{gap between}} {{contemporary}} urban planning theory and practice. Not only does this schism exist within the urban planning and design field, but also {{in regard to the}} social purpose and cultural meaning of the city. This problem persists in an era of increasing global urbanisation where, {{for the first time in}} human history, the majority of people will live in cities. The purpose of this research is to recover the key urban question from the milieu of urban literature and discourse, namely, what is the purpose of the city and its cultural meaning in the 21 st century? New solutions require new thinking. To answer the above question the current research methodology formulates a futures-orientated, holistic teleology for the city. This teleology integrates multiple levels of reality to bridge the schism between revolutionary urban theory and practice. Consequently, both contemporary urban theory and practice of creating better city futures is examined, challenged, and re-formulated to provide greater clarity of purpose and social action when resolving current and emerging urban challenges. The research combines empirical, interpretative, critical and anticipatory action learning methods and integrates frameworks from three disciplines: (1) City Theory and Urban Planning and Design; (2) Models of Cultural Change including macrohistory; and (3) the field of Futures Studies. This process seeks to reframe the siloed intra-disciplinary urban discourses into an integrated, trans-disciplinary urban model with holistic meta-criteria for city development. In Chapter One, the inquiry begins with mapping the urban problem and its challenges using a futures studies method – the futures <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> dialectic <b>forces.</b> The application <b>of</b> this method allows mapping <b>of</b> the <b>forces</b> affecting urban futures as drivers of change, resistors to change, and images that attract change. This futures-orientated dialectic establishes the context for the subsequent investigations.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} anisotropy in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch by relating electrophysiology with anatomy. Background. Atrioventricular (AV) node fast and slow pathway characteristics have been suggested to be due to nonuniform anisotropy in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch. Methods. During atrial pacing, we determined the electrical activity within the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch by multichannel mapping in 11 isolated hearts from pigs and dogs. Orientation of fibers was determined in nine hearts. Results. Fibers were parallel to the tricuspid valve annulus (TVA) in the posterior part <b>of</b> the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch. In the midjunctional area, the direction of the fibers changed to an orientation perpendicular to the TVA. During stimulation from posterior and anterior sites, activation proceeded parallel to the TVA at a high conduction velocity (0. 5 to 0. 6 m/s). During stimulation from sites near the coronary sinus, a narrowzone of slow conduction occurred in the posterior part <b>of</b> the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch where activation proceeded perpendicular to the fiber orientation. Above and below this zone, conduction was fast and parallel to the annulus. After premature stimulation, conduction delay in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch increased by 4 to 21 ms; in contrast, the AH interval increased by 80 to 210 ms. Conclusions. Data support the concept of anisotropic conduction in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch. Activation maps correlated well with the arrangement of superficial atrial fibers. Comparison of conduction delay in the <b>triangle</b> <b>of</b> Koch and AH delay after premature stimulation disproves that anisotropy in the superficial layers plays an important role in slow AV conduction...|$|R
