5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with {{the very nature of}} evolutionary theory, <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method,</b> and philosophy of science.|$|E
5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical facts, as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these facts. There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of facts. Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method.</b> Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{development was}} in the process for discovery, <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method,</b> focusing on empirical evidence and the importance of mathematics, while discarding Aristotelian science. Early and influential proponents of these ideas included Copernicus, Galileo, and Francis Bacon. The new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.|$|E

5|$|During his {{university}} {{studies at the}} École, Durkheim was influenced by two neo-Kantian scholars, Charles Bernard Renouvier and Émile Boutroux. The principles Durkheim absorbed from them included rationalism, scientific study of morality, anti-utilitarianism and secular education. His methodology was influenced by Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a supporter of <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method.</b>|$|E

5|$|Poe eschewed <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> in Eureka {{and instead}} wrote from pure intuition. For this reason, he {{considered}} it a work of art, not science, but insisted that it was still true and considered it to be his career masterpiece. Even so, Eureka is full of scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions ignored Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets.|$|E

25|$|Pseudoarchaeology is an {{umbrella}} term for all activities that falsely {{claim to be}} archaeological but in fact violate commonly accepted and scientific archaeological practices.

5|$|The {{establishment}} of <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> from about {{the mid-19th century}} on demanded testable hypotheses and verifiable phenomena for causation and transmission.

5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research {{based on the assumption that}} the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method,</b> astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E

5|$|In {{fields such}} as {{astrophysics}} or meteorology, where direct observation or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method</b> instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, Newton's theory of gravitation was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, {{argue that the}} idea of life being directly designed by a god or intelligence is at least as scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method,</b> evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method,</b> most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the global environmental issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E

5|$|Book Four, The Alchemist, {{takes place}} in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid, {{attempts}} to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone (which supposedly can turn Lead into Gold), but his fraud is uncovered and his hand is chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with Alchemy (the prevailing belief of the scholars of the time) and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books (which come to Samarkand via the trade routes {{from all over the}} known world). However, his friends Iwang (a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician) and Bahram (a Sufi blacksmith) instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims in the books and thus see if there is any true wisdom to be gained. They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly improve knowledge of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create <b>the</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>method.</b> Their discoveries create interest (and alarm) amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch the eye of the Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East.|$|E
