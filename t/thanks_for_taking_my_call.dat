50|$|CALLER: Hi, Rush. <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E
25|$|Please {{disregard}} {{all other}} messages which I have written, {{they are only}} thoughts which I was thinking about as possible reasons <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> own life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will help}} you all I can, Upton. You have done me a great service, and I {{certainly}} owe the young lady much <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> child in and caring for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{excellent}} reason, then, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice, and marrying me instantly! But you wander {{from the}} question. Where are you going? That {{is the issue}} now before the house. You persist in evading it." ...|$|R
6000|$|So many <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> {{your kind}} little note {{and the book}} which I have {{received}} quite safely; and many more <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> all the enemies' fire off me and leaving me quiet. I've been all this morning at work on finches and buntings; but I must give the Bishop a turn to-morrow. This weather takes my little wits out of me wofully; but I am always affectionately yours, ...|$|R
6000|$|BUILDER. [In a voice {{different}} from any we have heard from him] Say! What business had he to touch me, a magistrate? I gave my daughter two taps with a cane in a private house, for interfering with me <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> wife home-- ...|$|R
60|$|She {{threw her}} lapful of flowers {{away from her}} {{on the table at}} which she was sitting. She became {{perfectly}} furious with him <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> side. I permitted myself (the poor child could not see it, remember), the harmless indulgence of a smile.|$|R
40|$|We {{will share}} the TEACHERS' BOOK {{with the answer}} keys for all the exercises, all the transcriptions and some audio tracks, *FREE OF CHARGE* to all {{teachers}} currently using or would like to adopt the texbook, here in Language Box, {{from the end of}} August 2012. Watch this space! Many <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> the time to read this. The authors...|$|R
60|$|I {{had just}} given a porter the {{necessary}} directions <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> portmanteau to Mr. Keller's house, when I heard a woman's voice behind me asking {{the way to}} the Poste Restante--or, in our roundabout English phrase, the office of letters to be left till called for.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think we}} ever would have {{hit it off}} together; and I can't help a fancy that, after all, he didn't blame me very much <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> own way in spite of him," [...] he said. [...] "Still, it is a pity Eleanor had to come back. I suppose keeping her in Toronto {{was out of the}} question?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you'll {{have to do}} {{what you}} can to cheer up both of them." [...] Dave drew a long breath. [...] "I do wish {{somebody}} would catch those two rascals, not only on your account but on my account also. I'd like to settle matters with Porton, for having impersonated me at those stores, and <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> cap and overcoat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One cannot do everything, and I'm not insatiable. I'm {{getting too}} old to stand the shaking in the hot and dusty cars, and I can't accustom myself to going to bed in public, without undressing. No doubt, it's a matter of prejudice, but I've been used to more room <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> clothes off than they give you behind the {{flapping}} curtain." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{her native}} city {{she could not}} get to inaugurate an avenue in her honor, but she had the {{opportunity}} to witness how she was granted, in 1965, the silver medal of Jerez de la Frontera, in <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> the name of his city to all corners of the world. The construction of a museum is being built in her memory in the Palace of Villapanés (next to her monument), which will house bibliography, multimedia and personal objects (dresses and enseres) of the artist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose that I were Brooks or Woodhouse, {{or any of}} {{the fifty}} men who have good reason <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> life, how long could I survive against my own pursuit? A summons, a bogus appointment, and all would be over. It is well they don't have days of fog in the Latin {{countries}}--the countries of assassination. By Jove! here comes something at last to break our dead monotony." ...|$|R
40|$|First of all, I {{would like}} to thank all the Latin American, Spanish and Dutch {{subjects}} that participated in this study. Secondly, I {{would like to}} thank Paola Escudero for giving me the opportunity to use data of her longitudinal project and for supervising me during the first stages of writing this thesis. Paul Boersma, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> over Paola’s role and advising me {{in the final stages of}} writing my thesis. Finally, of course, I {{would like to thank}} my family and friends for supporting me, special thanks to my father who helped me analyzing the data. Contents Acknowledgemen...|$|R
25|$|My {{sister was}} slim and {{beautiful}} and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.|$|R
50|$|As {{the city}} recovers from the infection, Amanda and Datak address the town via the radio station. Amanda <b>thanks</b> Datak <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> over {{while she was}} ill only for Datak to {{announce}} his intent to run against her for the position of mayor.|$|R
50|$|Returning to {{the temple}} and giving offerings to Che Kung in <b>thanks</b> to him <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of you {{throughout}} the prior year.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Danvers and I {{were both}} of opinion, Mr. Hawtrey, that by his tone and manner {{when he spoke}} to you about payment of debts, that he had already done you some injury or had some {{distinct}} plan in his head. At that time your daughter was not engaged to Lord Halliburn, and his ideas may have been vague ones until the public notice of the engagement met his eye, when he may have said to himself, [...] "This is <b>my</b> opportunity <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> revenge, by annoying both father and daughter."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You thought! you thought! Yes, {{it makes}} me {{impatient}} to hear you: but, however, you have suffered, {{and are likely to}} suffer enough <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice; so I'll say no more. Carter--hurry!--hurry! The sun will soon rise, and I must have him off." ...|$|R
50|$|At {{the company}} Christmas party, {{the owner of}} Jolly Dreams announces that, if {{production}} increases sufficiently, the company {{will be able to}} donate toys to the disadvantaged children at Willowy Springs State Hospital. Afterwards, Harry is greeted by coworkers Ben, who <b>thanks</b> him <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> Frank's place at the warehouse, and Frank, who introduces him to new employee George.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind, then; for I have {{a reason}} <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> up <b>my</b> old cudgels against you, Elfie. Can you guess what the reason is?' ...|$|R
50|$|At the hospital, Brian is {{returned}} to his normal pretentious self, and sarcastically <b>thanks</b> Stewie <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> away his life of restful sleep and much casual sex and returning him to being a pompous alcoholic who can only hang out with a baby. Peter comes in stating that he has gotten the two-penis surgery, but the original one falls off.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will; I will; {{it looks}} {{brighter}} and better already, and I won't lose my one comfort by any fault of my own. Thank you so much, Mother Bhaer, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> side. I felt so ungrateful and mean and crushed when I thought you all considered me a sneak {{who had no}} business to love such a precious girl as Daisy. No one said anything, but I knew how you felt, and that Mr Laurie sent me off partly {{to get me out}} of the way. Oh dear, life is pretty tough sometimes, isn't it?' And Nat took his head in both hands as if it ached with the confusion of hopes and fears, passions and plans that proved boyhood was past and manhood had begun.|$|R
5000|$|... “My {{dear friend}} Osbald … I am {{disappointed}} in you <b>for</b> not <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> advice. I urged {{you in my}} letter that you should give up this way of life. Do not add sin to sin by ruining your country and shedding blood. Think how much blood of emperors, princes, and people has been shed through you and your clan.” ...|$|R
60|$|My fair friend, Miss Clack, having {{laid down}} the pen, {{there are two reasons}} <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>taking</b> it up next, in my turn.|$|R
60|$|THE MAN [ignoring the interruption] Bless you <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> him off <b>my</b> hands! I {{have had}} as much of him as I can bear. [He goes {{down the steps and}} disappears].|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you care}} to, by all means," [...] he answered. [...] "Tell Mr. Pengarth {{to let me}} have your address. Goodbye! Thank you <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of <b>my</b> treasures so well." ...|$|R
50|$|Kanako is Jyunpei Kousaka's classmate and {{childhood}} friend {{who has a}} fondness for cats and Jyunpei. She is introduced in the series wearing manba make-up, which {{is a result of}} Kanako misunderstanding Jyunpei's intention of showing her Nyamsus doll to a girl. During Tokiwa High School's cultural festival, her makeup is washed off. Later, Jyunpei passes on the caba cat Kumaneko's <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of him and Kanako reconciles with Jyunpei when he reveals that he still has Kanako's doll. Kanako stops wearing her make-up and she becomes popular with Tokiwa's male students. She has a well-endowed body, and is not afraid to flaunt it, but often gets unwanted attention and is groped by Nagi Ichinose. Kanako is very forceful and often gets Jyunpei to purchase her food and merchandise at his own expense. She harbors feelings for him since childhood. Kanako has a younger brother named Toru, who is dating Jyunpei's younger sister.|$|R
6000|$|... "And on {{the ground}} also with it"--Vanderbank so far concurred--"of your quite <b>taking</b> <b>for</b> granted <b>my</b> only having to put myself forward?" ...|$|R
50|$|While Monica helps Mildred pack her house, {{she tells}} her how much Frankie has {{improved}} as a husband, but senses Mildred being distant. Frankie brings J.J. over, and he asks to talk to Mildred in private. J.J. gives her a drawing and <b>thanks</b> her <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of him, and the three say their goodbyes. Annie drives Mildred to the airport, though Mildred refuses to tell her where she's going, saying it's a secret.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Louisa!' said Mr Dombey. 'It is not {{necessary}} to prolong these observations. The woman is discharged and paid. You leave this house, Richards, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> son--my son,' said Mr Dombey, emphatically repeating these two words, 'into haunts and into society which are not to be thought of without a shudder. As to the accident which befel Miss Florence this morning, I regard that as, in one great sense, a happy and fortunate circumstance; inasmuch as, but for that occurrence, I never could have known--and from your own lips too--of what you had been guilty. I think, Louisa, the other nurse, the young person,' here Miss Nipper sobbed aloud, 'being so much younger, and necessarily influenced by Paul's nurse, may remain. Have the goodness to direct that this woman's coach is paid to'--Mr Dombey stopped and winced--'to Staggs's Gardens.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a miserable}} fool I was!" [...] said he. [...] "I {{might have had}} that very ticket. He as good as offered to {{exchange}} with me. Such a stupid dolt as I was, not to know when it was upside down! Then, besides, I was offered two pounds for my ticket, sure--and I believe I should have taken it, if my father had not advised me not to do it. That would have come to almost fifteen dollars, and that I should have been sure of. So much <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> father's advice. I hope they'll get up another lottery to-morrow, and then I'll buy a ticket and do just as I please with it, and not take any body's advice. I shall be sure to make fifteen dollars, at least, if I don't do any better than I might have done to-day." ...|$|R
5000|$|The next morning, Percy is glad {{to realise}} that Gator {{must now be}} a member of the North Western Railway. James, on the other hand, is still miserable from the night before. At the station, Henry <b>thanks</b> him <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> the [...] "Kipper" [...] for him, but cannot help but remark that James is {{supposed}} to deliver the fish, not throw them back into the water, something everyone finds hilarious. Seeking revenge on Percy, James makes a plan.|$|R
5000|$|When Sir Stanley died in 1968, Unwin {{became the}} new {{chairman}} of the firm. His father had been preparing him for the role during his time at the firm; Rayner's older brother David had decided to pursue a career as a children's author instead. David Unwin later wrote in his memoirs: [...] "I have always felt guilty at <b>my</b> defection, <b>for</b> by <b>taking</b> <b>my</b> place Rayner sacrificed his own promising career as an author".|$|R
50|$|While Jessie {{is talking}} to Justin, who is {{actually}} just pretending to be dead, he scares her and the two reconcile. The next day they go to visit Elaine, who apologizes for what she has done and sets Justin free to Jessie. Justin goes to visit Luigi who is moving to New York in US to work and <b>thanks</b> him <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of Jessie and loving her when he couldn't. They both say goodbye and see {{each other for the}} last time.|$|R
