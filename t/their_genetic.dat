5|$|Genes {{are made}} from DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and, in many viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid). The {{biological}} information contained in an organism is encoded in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but many viruses have RNA as <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary copper {{accumulation}} {{has been}} described in Bedlington Terriers, where it generally only affects the liver. It is due to mutations in the COMMD1 (or MURR1) gene. Despite this findings, COMMD1 mutations could not be detected in humans with non-Wilsonian copper accumulation states (such as Indian childhood cirrhosis) to explain <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> origin.|$|E
5|$|Mycology is {{the branch}} of biology {{concerned}} with the systematic study of fungi, including <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans {{as a source of}} medicine, food, and psychotropic substances consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of phytopathology, the study of plant diseases, is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi.|$|E

5|$|On May 21, 2008 President George W. Bush {{signed into}} law the Genetic Information Non{{discrimination}} Act (GINA). The bill aims to protect Americans against discrimination based on <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> information {{when it comes to}} health insurance and employment. The issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law. It is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic research.|$|E
5|$|The {{thematic}} and period {{setting of}} Carnivàle required an unusual casting approach. While some actors were hired for <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> disabilities, most actors were specifically cast for their unique and distinct looks {{to fit the}} 1930s period. Award-winning costumes and make-up enhanced the illusion. Reviews generally lauded the actors and characters, and several actors received award recognition for their performances.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} a number of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that use RNA as their {{template}} for synthesis of a new strand of RNA. For instance, a number of RNA viruses (such as poliovirus) use this type of enzyme to replicate <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> material. Also, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase {{is part of the}} RNA interference pathway in many organisms.|$|E
50|$|The Y {{chromosome}} {{is passed}} on from father to son with little changes to Y-DNA. Surnames {{also tend to}} generally be passed on from father to son. The Sorenson Database used Y-chromosome genetic markers and surnames to determine common ancestors. Users could share DNA results and pedigree charts obtained from other sources. They could search for ancestors using <b>their</b> surname, <b>genetic</b> marker values obtained through their DNA analysis, {{or a combination of}} the two. The database also had genetic marker default values if users did not have <b>their</b> own <b>genetic</b> information.|$|R

5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{mutations}} {{that change}} protein sequences are harmful or neutral, some mutations have benefits. These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation {{will tend to}} become more common in a population through natural selection. Viruses that use RNA as <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> material have rapid mutation rates, which can be an advantage, since these viruses thereby evolve rapidly, and thus evade the immune system defensive responses. In large populations of asexually reproducing organisms, for example, E. coli, multiple beneficial mutations may co-occur. This phenomenon is called clonal interference and causes competition among the mutations.|$|E
5|$|Some redback {{males have}} been {{observed}} using an alternative tactic that also ensures more of <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> material is passed on. Juvenile female redbacks nearing their final moulting and adulthood have fully formed reproductive organs, but lack openings in the exoskeleton that allow access to the organs. Males will bite through the exoskeleton and deliver sperm without performing the somersault seen in males mating with adult females. The females then moult {{within a few days}} and deliver a clutch of fertilised eggs.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about how {{consumers}} of direct-to-consumer personal genetic services share personal genetic risk information. In an age of ubiquitous online networking and rapid development of social networking tools, understanding how consumers share personal genetic risk assessments is critical {{in the development of}} appropriate and effective policies. This exploratory study investigates how consumers share personal genetic information and attitudes towards social networking behaviors. Methods: Adult participants aged 23 to 72 years old who purchased direct-to-consumer genetic testing from a personal genomics company were administered a web-based survey regarding their sharing activities and social networking behaviors related to <b>their</b> personal <b>genetic</b> test results. Results: 80 participants completed the survey; of those, 45 % shared results on Facebook and 50. 9 % reported meeting or reconnecting with more than 10 other individuals through the sharing of <b>their</b> personal <b>genetic</b> information. For help interpreting test results, 70. 4 % turned to Internet websites and online sources, compared to 22. 7 % who consulted their healthcare providers. Amongst participants, 51. 8 % reported that they believe the privacy of <b>their</b> personal <b>genetic</b> information would be breached in the future. Conclusion: Consumers actively utilize online social networking tools to help them share and interpret <b>their</b> personal <b>genetic</b> information. These findings suggest a need for careful consideration of policy recommendations in light of the current ambiguity of regulation and oversight of consumer initiated sharing activities...|$|R

50|$|The {{taxonomy}} of this genus is still uncertain. Some species {{may in fact}} be subspecies of others, and some subspecies may be distinct species of <b>their</b> own. <b>Genetic</b> analysis is in process.|$|R
5|$|The species' genetic {{diversity}} {{is similar to}} that of other pocket gophers occupying a larger geographic range and diversity of habitat. Compared to Townsend's pocket gopher, which is distributed across a much larger area, but less diverse habitat, it is more genetically heterogeneous. Although there is considerable differentiation between separate populations of camas pocket gophers, <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> variability does not affect the mammal's appearance. Study of the effects of genetic change over time revealed a pattern affected by a cataclysmic event across the species' entire geographic area about 13,000 years ago. Such an event would cause a population bottleneck, leading to scattered, isolated populations.|$|E
5|$|Although the cheetah is an African cat, {{molecular}} {{evidence indicates}} that the three species of the Puma lineage evolved in North America two to three million years ago, where they possibly had a common ancestor during the Miocene. They possibly diverged from this ancestor 8.25 million years ago. The cheetah diverged from the puma and the jaguarundi around 6.7 million years ago. A genome study concluded that cheetahs experienced two genetic bottlenecks in their history, the first about 100,000 years ago and the second about 12,000 years ago, greatly lowering <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> variability. These bottlenecks may {{have been associated with}} migrations across Asia and into Africa (with the current African population founded about 12,000 years ago), and/or with a depletion of prey species {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria do {{not have}} a membrane-bound nucleus, and <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> {{material}} is typically a single circular bacterial chromosome of DNA located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid. The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S. Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host.|$|E

50|$|From an {{evolutionary}} standpoint, these females are passing <b>their</b> full <b>genetic</b> code {{to all of}} their offspring (rather than the 50% of genes that would be passed in sexual reproduction). Certain species of gecko also reproduce by parthenogenesis.|$|R
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the Conservancy worked to {{preserve}} the San Clemente Island goat, a rare Spanish-descended breed from California. In 1991, it added genetic material from the San Clemente to <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> database, later transferred to the National Animal Germplasm Program. As of June 2010, the organization {{was working on the}} rescue of a group of feral Spanish goats from an island in South Carolina. There are less than 2,500 members of the breed in the United States, and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known to exist in the southeastern US. Conservancy members first made trips to the island to document and photograph the herd of around 30 goats, then undertook action to remove some goats from the island to preserve the bloodlines from threatened extinction. A small flock was established in a nature preserve just south of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, and as of June 2010 plans were in place for satellite herds to be established.|$|E
5|$|Captive {{populations of}} both ruffed lemur species exist in American and European zoos, {{representing}} a safeguard against extinction. In the United States, captive breeding is {{managed by the}} Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Although the populations are very limited in <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> diversity, these species thrive in captivity, making them an ideal candidate for reintroduction into protected habitat, if it is available. Although reintroduction {{is seen as a}} last resort among conservationists, a combination of in situ conservation efforts, such as legal protection, public education, the spread of sustainable livelihoods, and reforestation offer hope for ruffed lemurs. In the meantime, reintroductions offer conservation research opportunities and allow the limited genetic diversity maintained by the SSP to improve the genetic diversity of dwindling Malagasy ruffed lemur populations.|$|E
5|$|Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a {{polymeric}} molecule {{essential in}} various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA and DNA are nucleic acids, and, along with lipids, proteins and carbohydrates, constitute {{the four major}} macromolecules essential for all known forms of life. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of nucleotides, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use messenger RNA (mRNA) to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases guanine, uracil, adenine, and cytosine) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many viruses encode <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> information using an RNA genome.|$|E

5|$|The best bulls go to {{artificial}} insemination (AI) cooperatives where semen is taken. AI allows the wide distribution of a bulls' genetics {{to the benefit}} of more farmers. However, in order to guarantee <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> qualities, the bulls are subject to a strict selection scheme to increase the accuracy of the different genetic indexes. The best bulls identified at Lanaud are sent to another test station at Naves in Corrèze. Here they are tested more accurately and evaluated for feed conversion efficiency, growth and muscle development. Progeny of the top 10 bulls out of this testing, and the best natural service bulls, are then evaluated. Cows are inseminated to produce 60 to 80 calves per bull tested, which are in turn evaluated.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens on}} May 1, 2017, when a {{blackout}} occurs in LeMU, its communications system go down, {{and the park}} springs a leak; portions of it get flooded, blocking the exit and trapping the characters inside. Due to water pressure, the park is estimated to implode after 119 hours; the water pressure also ensures that the characters cannot escape by swimming, as it would crush their lungs. If the player plays as Takeshi, he builds a relationship with Tsugumi, who reveals {{that she and her}} pet hamster Chami are carriers of the Cure virus, which has rewritten <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> code, and halted their biological aging. She and Takeshi have sex, and she is impregnated. Later, Coco becomes sick. It is revealed that a research facility exists under LeMU, called IBF, and that LeMU was created by the Leiblich Pharmaceutical company as a cover for IBF. The facility developed the deadly virus Tief Blau; the LeMU disaster was caused when IBF lost containment of it. Coco was exposed to the virus while visiting her father, an IBF researcher.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of the Industrial Revolution it was {{realized}} that the military and economic might of nations were dependent on both the body size and strength of their soldiers and workers. Increasing the average body mass index from what is now considered underweight to what is now the normal range {{played a significant role in}} the development of industrialized societies. Height and weight thus both increased through the 19thcentury in the developed world. During the 20th century, as populations reached <b>their</b> <b>genetic</b> potential for height, weight began increasing much more than height, resulting in obesity. In the 1950s increasing wealth in the developed world decreased child mortality, but as body weight increased heart and kidney disease became more common.|$|E
