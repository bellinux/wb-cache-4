40|$|MAXIMUM 200 WORDS) The U. S. Coast Guard {{is seeking}} to develop Cone {{calorimeter}} acceptance criteria to qualify linings, and combustible components of furniture and other contents as fire restricting materials for high speed craft. In support, a research program was conducted at Southwest Research Institute between August 1997 and July 1998 to develop data for comparing the results of various fire tests. Eight composite materials and one <b>textile</b> <b>wall</b> <b>covering</b> were tested in the ISO 9705 room. The same materials were also evaluated in small-scale according to the test procedures of the Cone calorimeter, the IMO Surface Flammability Test, and the IMO Smoke and Toxicity Test. The ISO 9705 room tests {{and some of the}} Cone calorimeter experiments were supplemented with toxic gas analysis using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. This report covers the IMO Smoke and Toxicity Tests, and the supplemental toxic gas analysis in the room/corner and Cone calorimeter tests. 17. Key Words [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Today, what is {{commonly}} called barkcloth is a soft, thick, slightly textured fabric, {{so named because}} it has a rough surface like that of tree bark. This barkcloth is usually made of densely woven cotton fibers. Historically, the fabric has been used in home furnishings, such as curtains, drapery, upholstery, and slipcovers. It is often associated with 1940s through 1960s home fashions, particularly in tropical, abstract, [...] "atomic" [...] and [...] "boomerang" [...] prints, the last two themes being expressed by images of atoms with electrons whirling, and by the boomerang shape which was very popular in mid-century cocktail tables and fabrics. Waverly, a famed design house for <b>textiles</b> and <b>wall</b> <b>coverings</b> between 1923 and 2007, called their version of this fabric rhino cloth, possibly for the rough, nubbly surface. [...] American barkcloth shot through with gold Lurex threads was called Las Vegas cloth, and contained as much as 65% rayon as well, making it a softer, more flowing fabric than the stiffer all-cotton rhino cloth or standard barkcloth.|$|R
5000|$|Seventy {{years after}} its first review, the home is still {{recognized}} by architectural scholars as a significant milestone {{in the history of}} modernism. Scholars and critics who have visited the site are unanimous in their understanding of its importance as a masterpiece that must be preserved. John Carter Brown III, director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, described the house as “the nation’s crown jewel.” Toshiko Mori, Chair of the Department of Architecture at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Design, said the experience of visiting is “one of those rare occasions when you enter a house and it’s absolutely authentic. Mr. Frank preserved the house in its totality — equipment, furniture, fixtures, even original <b>textiles</b> and <b>wall</b> <b>coverings.</b> It’s all intact. It’s a very exquisite balance of architectural proportions, textures and colorations with machine-age aesthetics. Everything is very functional.” Barry Bergdoll, Chief Curator, MoMA Department of Architecture and Design, who is using the house and its trove of correspondence as part of an extended study of Marcel Breuer, described the Frank House as “an exceptional historical document, as well as a major monument of American architectural art and architectural history.” ...|$|R

The material is metallized plastic fabric, a spinoff from space programs. <b>Wall</b> <b>coverings</b> are one of many consumer applications of aluminized plastic film technology developed for NASA by a firm later bought by King-Seeley Thermos Company, Winchester, Massachusetts, which now produces the material. The original NASA use was in the Echo 1 passive communications satellite, a "space baloon" made of aluminized mylar; the high reflectivity of the metallized coating enabled relay of communications signals from one Earth station to another by "bouncing" them off the satellite. The reflectivity feature also made the material an extremely efficient insulator and it was subsequently widely used in the Apollo program for such purposes as temperature control of spacecraft components and insulation of tanks for fuels that must be maintained at very low temperatures. I Used as a <b>wall</b> <b>covering,</b> the aluminized material offers extra insulation, reflects light and I resists cracking.
