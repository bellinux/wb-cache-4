500|$|During his Bruins career, Orr {{was often}} the player the press wanted for a post-game interview. Orr instead would hide in the trainer's room. Teammate Terry O'Reilly {{described}} him as a [...] "very private, very shy guy, who {{just happened to be}} the best hockey player in the world." [...] According to the Bruins public relations director Nate Greenberg [...] "one of my toughest jobs in the day was trying to get Orr {{to come out of the}} trainer's room to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> The reason he wouldn't or didn't all the time was that he really wanted his teammates to get proper accolades, while everybody, all the time wanted him."

500|$|When someone {{pulled on}} Jones' bra strap, he ran away, {{and the crowd}} pursued and {{attacked}} him further down the road. He was beaten, stabbed, shot and {{run over by a}} car. He slipped {{in and out of consciousness}} for two hours before another attack finally killed him. There were no reports of anyone trying to help him during the altercation. Khloe was also attacked and almost raped, but escaped by hiding first in a church and then in neighbouring woods. Khloe commented, [...] "When I saw Dwayne's body, I started shaking and crying. It was horrible." [...] Police arrived at the scene at 5am to find the body dumped in bushes along Orange Main Road. They launched an investigation into the homicide, inviting friends and family of the victim to contact them. Jones' family declined to claim the body, and his father refused to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> about the incident.|$|E

Due to the small number of staff employed at Ultimate in the early days they didn't have the time to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> or attend trade events.

Many were quick to point to Guardiola's lack of coaching experience, but Cruyff said, [...] "The biggest test for a coach at a team like Barça is the strength to make decisions {{and the ability to}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> because they don't help and you have to manage that.

2500|$|The next day, the {{situation}} in Ryesgade had become {{the talk of the}} nation. The national news broadcasters canceled shows in order to transmit live updates on {{the situation}}. Most elements of the press were very critical and hateful towards the squatters and their supporters. Headlines calling the squatters [...] "a bunch of terrorists" [...] and [...] "masked maniacs" [...] were common. The squatters found themselves facing a horde of journalists, all shouting questions and demanding answers from the defenders. The tone of the coverage angered the squatters, and they at first refused to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>press.</b> But when the squatters found that they might be facing a prolonged siege, they eventually decided to address the media.|$|E

2500|$|According to Vikernes, the {{anonymous}} interview was planned {{by himself and}} Euronymous. The goal, he says, was to scare people, promote black metal and get more customers for Helvete. At the time, Burzum was about to release the Aske mini-album. Vikernes said of the interview: [...] "I exaggerated a lot and when the journalist left we [...] had a good laugh, because he didn't seem to understand that I was pulling his leg". He added that the interview revealed nothing that could prove his involvement in any crime. Vikernes claims that, after he was arrested, [...] "the journalist edited the interview and [...] published an insane version of it the following day, without even letting me read through it." [...] Some of the other scene members were also arrested and questioned, but all were released for lack of evidence. Jørn Inge Tunsberg of Hades said that the interview had [...] "grave consequences" [...] {{for the rest of}} the scene and that they did not know he was going to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>press,</b> as [...] "he had said nothing". He added that they became [...] "bloody angry" [...] and he, Tunsberg, was [...] "pissed off".|$|E

2500|$|In part {{these changes}} were an {{increased}} awareness of how important news media were to Labour's election campaign. [...] One party press secretary said, of Labour's attitude {{to the news media}} in the 1983 general election campaign, that [...] "If a miracle had happened and Fleet Street had suddenly come clamouring to Walworth Road for pro-Labour material, they would have been sent away with a copy of the manifesto each." [...] The party leadership noted afterwards that it had been the effect of the [...] "Loony Left" [...] image that had caused it to lose the 1987 Greenwich by-election by such a large margin. [...] This is not to say, of course, that Labour ignored the press. [...] However, it became reluctant to talk to it. [...] Kinnock refused to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> on the flight back from his visit to the US President Ronald Reagan after British journalists had continually sought a story that would represent the trip in a negative light. [...] Similarly, Patricia Hewitt, then party press secretary, considered abandoning holding daily press conferences {{in the run-up to the}} 1987 general election, because [...] "they allow the newspaper journalists to set the agenda [...] and we know where they stand".|$|E
