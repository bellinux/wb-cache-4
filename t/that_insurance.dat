5|$|During the 1906 {{legislative}} session, Beckham urged {{investigation and}} prosecution of corrupt insurance companies, {{following the lead of}} New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred dividends, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on-hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky, bolstering the its economy and providing policyholders some protection against fraud.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{members of}} Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni {{provided}} $2,500 {{to the town}} of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> claims from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6billion (US$11.4million). The total was split between ¥49billion (US$44million) in housing claims and ¥7.9billion (US$71million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas {{in the days after the}} storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; trucks were mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.|$|E
5|$|Both {{chambers}} {{worked to}} reconcile differences between their respective {{versions of the}} bill, and on April 1, 1994, the last regular day of the legislative session, the Senate passed a compromise bill, but the House killed it on a procedural motion. On April 15, {{the last day of}} the session, which legislators had set aside to override any gubernatorial vetos, the health care bill was reintroduced and passed both houses of the General Assembly. Jones then reversed course and signed it. Among the reforms included in the bill were a mechanism making the policies of all companies uniform and the creation of a Health Policy Board to regulate rate increases. It ensured <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> companies could not deny coverage because of a pre-existing condition and allowed workers to retain their insurance after changing jobs.|$|E
30|$|There {{is a large}} {{literature}} in the United States that shows <b>that</b> health <b>insurance</b> is an important determinant of job mobility (Gruber and Madrian 2004).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a critical review}} of the empirical literature {{on the relationship between}} health insurance, labor supply, and job mobility. We review over 50 papers on this topic, almost exclusively written in the last 10 years. We reach five conclusions. First, there is clear and unambiguous evidence <b>that</b> health <b>insurance</b> is a central determinant of retirement decisions. Second, there is fairly clear evidence <b>that</b> health <b>insurance</b> is not a major determinant of the labor supply and welfare exit decisions of low income mothers. Third, there is fairly compelling evidence <b>that</b> health <b>insurance</b> {{is an important factor in}} the labor supply decisions of secondary earners. Fourth, while there is some division in the literature, the most convincing evidence suggests <b>that</b> health <b>insurance</b> plays an important role in job mobility decisions. Finally, there is virtually no evidence in the literature on the welfare implications of these results. We present some rudimentary calculations which suggest that the welfare costs of job lock are likely to be modest. Our general conclusion is <b>that</b> health <b>insurance</b> has importan...|$|R

5|$|Many Public Storage {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt to}} conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states have criticized the practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

25|$|In some locations, {{such as the}} United States, {{voluntary}} hospitalizations are {{outnumbered by}} involuntary commitments {{partly due to the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> tends not to pay for hospitalization unless an imminent danger exists to the individual or community.

Therefore, patients who are not admitted will be referred to services in the community.|$|E

Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies. On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates {{with the state}} and give customers 100 days’ notice.|$|E

County Executive Isiah Leggett, who supported the bill, said the fees would have helped close the budget gap and help fund improvements to the county's emergency services. Opponents of the bill were skeptical <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> companies would pay the fees and wondered if the fees would reduce emergency service calls.|$|E
25|$|In {{insurance}} law, arbitration {{is complicated}} by the fact <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> is regulated at the state level under the McCarran–Ferguson Act. From a federal perspective, however, a circuit court ruling has determined that McCarran-Ferguson requires a state statute rather than administrative interpretations. The Missouri Department of Insurance attempted to block a binding arbitration agreement under its state authority, but since this action was based only on a policy of the department and not on a state statute, the United States district court found that the Department of Insurance did not have the authority to invalidate the arbitration agreement.|$|E
25|$|Formal self-insurance is the {{deliberate}} decision {{to pay for}} otherwise insurable losses out of one's own money. This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually {{used to pay for}} high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> otherwise affords.|$|E

25|$|Constructing the {{replacement}} Tacoma Narrows Bridge was delayed {{for nearly a}} decade primarily due to the demand on steel created by World War II, {{and the fact that the}} state had trouble arranging insurance for the new span. On April 30, 1947, Governor Mon Wallgren had announced <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> had finally been arranged. It wasn't until August 1947 that Washington finally requested bids for the construction, and by that time, the price tag for construction went from $8.5 million (US$ in present terms) to $11.2 million (US$ in present terms). On October 15, the state opened bids for the construction, with Bethlehem Pacific Steel Corporation bidding $8,263,904 (US$ in present terms) on construction of the superstructure, and John A. Roebling's Sons Company of San Francisco bidding $2,932,681 (US$ in present terms) for the construction of the suspension cable system.|$|E
25|$|Some male {{behaviors}} {{that may have}} led to polyandry are displacement, where a male is gripped onto and mating with a female, another male may make an effort to mate as well and displace the male that was originally copulating; forced copulation, where there is a high density of aggressive males, and female abandonment, where a female but spots a better one to mate with and abandons the less favorable one. This can lead to sequential polyandry if the male leaves before the entire clutch is released and an additional male fertilizes these eggs as well. In Bibron's toadlet (Pseudophryne bibronii) females spread out their eggs across the nests of two to eight males, with those who exhibited higher levels of polyandrous behavior having higher mean offspring survivorship, showing <b>that</b> <b>insurance</b> against nest failure and dispersal of mortality risk is related to the evolution of polyandry.|$|E
