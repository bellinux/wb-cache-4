5|$|I am excited <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for {{the amazing}} {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E

25|$|Count Benedetti {{spoke to}} me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to {{telegraph}} at once that I bound myself for all future time never again <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind à tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.|$|E

500|$|Mariel Concepcion of Billboard {{said that}} the song is [...] "a clear {{indication}} that the R crooner is bringing sexy back," [...] "atop a silky piano pattern and hand claps." [...] She also said, [...] "Plies makes a nice addition to the already sexified track, as the self-proclaimed goon drops a raunchy verse in his raspy Southern drawl." [...] The review went on to say, [...] "'Hey Daddy' {{may not be a}} chart-topper-yet-but it sure will make the naysayers pay attention again." [...] Mark Edward Nero of About.com {{said that the}} song was [...] "is not only the album's first official single," [...] but [...] "also a declaration." [...] He goes on to say, [...] "In the song, Usher's basically sending a message to his female fans that the Usher they knew and loved is back in their lives and that they don't need to stray any more: [...] "You know your daddy's home, and it's time to play, so you ain't got <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> lovin' away." [...] Nero calls 'Hey Daddy' [...] "one of more than half a dozen sex songs on the album." [...] Sara D. Anderson of AOL Music said that the song has a [...] "catchy R tune" [...] and [...] "the song showcases Usher's role as the ladies' man as he croons: [...] "You know your daddy's home (daddy's home) / And it's time to play (so it's time to play) / So you ain't got <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> loving away." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe said that the track was one of the album's songs to showcase [...] "Usher's signature loveman moves" [...] however called them [...] "hollow as a chocolate Easter bunny", as he pointed out the whole album had a lack of emotion Andrew Rennie of Now Magazine said that on the song and on [...] "Lil Freak" [...] that Usher shows [...] "he’s unafraid to get lewd".|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{enrolled}} at Ryerson University School of Theatre in Toronto to further improve his acting. He left Ryerson in 1985, {{several months before}} graduating, [...] to accept a position with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, where he spent five seasons performing. [...] "It was all I wanted, to be a classical actor {{for the rest of}} my life, but during the last couple of years I was there, I started to realise that it wasn't for me. Perhaps I didn't have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> Hamlet before I died, that the world might be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact." [...] McCormack appeared in the productions A Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry V, Murder in the Cathedral and Three Sisters. McCormack later performed with the Manitoba Theatre Centre in a production of Burn This, as well as with Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre in Biloxi Blues.|$|E
500|$|On August 25, 2014, Usher {{announced}} his UR Experience Tour {{in support of}} his then-titled eighth studio album UR.

500|$|According to CBS Soaps In Depth DeGarmo said: [...] "I'm {{definitely}} spicing things up! Angelina {{is getting}} into a bit of shenanigans and trouble along the way, {{just to make sure}} people are on their toes." [...] Additionally, she noted that: [...] "Angelina may {{have a little bit of}} a crush on Kevin and she is not afraid to show it." [...] CBS Soaps In Depth wrote: [...] "viewers definitely can expect Angelina to make her mark in Genoa City." [...] DeGarmo confessed that she never watched daytime soap operas because she was in school, but her family was [...] "super excited" [...] about seeing her on one. Because she never had experience working on soaps, she talked about how fast-paced it was, stating: [...] "I would equate this to guerrilla theater. It’s very fast. You do your presentation and you’re done. It keeps me on my toes. I have <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> best performance at that very moment." [...] She also discussed having crossed over in the genre: [...] "Sometimes being a ‘reality’ person can be a bit of a stigma. ‘The Young and the Restless’ was willing to take a chance on me. They are so fantastic." ...|$|E
500|$|Walter Afanasieff, long-time Mariah Carey collaborator, {{worked with}} Simpson on three cuts from Irresistible. One of the songs, [...] "When You Told Me You Loved Me", {{was written by}} Afanasieff in {{collaboration}} with Billy Mann. In an interview with Allpop, Simpson named the song {{as one of her}} favorites and said, [...] "I really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced. I like the emotion behind that song." [...] Cory Rooney wrote [...] "Hot Like Fire" [...] solely, which Simpson described as [...] "certainly not kid stuff", a song [...] "with a lot of attitude." [...] Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for the album. One of the cuts, [...] "For Your Love", according to Simpson, is reminiscent of [...] "I Wanna Love You Forever" [...] (1999). Simpson covered the gospel hymn [...] "His Eye is on the Sparrow" [...] as the last song of the album. She said, [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> audience a piece of my heart and soul. The message is there's so much in life that can get you discouraged, but if you trust that you're being watched over, you have a reason to live and a sense of freedom. It's different for everyone, but for me, my relationship with God is the way I clear out the shadows that hang in our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|The Franco-Bavarian commanders {{deployed}} their forces. In {{the village}} of Lutzingen, Count Maffei positioned five Bavarian battalions with a great battery of 16 guns at the village's edge. In the woods {{to the left of}} Lutzingen, seven French battalions under the Marquis de Rozel moved into place. Between Lutzingen and Oberglauheim the Elector placed 27 squadrons of cavalry – Count d'Arco commanded 14 Bavarian squadrons and Count Wolframsdorf had 13 more in support nearby. To their right stood Marsin's 40 French squadrons and 12 battalions. The village of Oberglauheim was packed with 14 battalions commanded by the Marquis de Blainville (including the effective Irish Brigade known as the 'Wild Geese'). Six batteries of guns were ranged alongside the village. On the right of these French and Bavarian positions, between Oberglauheim and Blenheim, Tallard deployed 64 French and Walloon squadrons (16 drawn from Marsin) supported by nine French battalions standing near the Höchstädt road. In the cornfield next to Blenheim stood three battalions from the Regiment de Roi. Nine battalions occupied the village itself, commanded by the Marquis de Clérambault. Four battalions stood to the rear and a further 11 were in reserve. These battalions were supported by Hautefeuille's 12 squadrons of dismounted dragoons. By 11:00 Tallard, the Elector, and Marsin were in place. Many of the Allied generals were hesitant to attack such a relatively strong position. The Earl of Orkney later confessed that, [...] "had I been asked <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> opinion, I had been against it." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] an [...] "A+." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] "one {{of those}} deliciously dense episodes {{in which the}} nourishment of revelation is mixed with huge chunks of sugary intrigue" [...] and speculated that the scene in which Alex is executed will be [...] "sitting very high on this ranking of all-time pivotal Lost moments" [...] by the series' May 2010 end. [...] Before the season finale aired, Jensen ranked this as the second best moment {{of the season and}} put the scene in which the monster attacks the mercenaries in ninth place. [...] Dan Kois and Lane Brown of New York magazine thought that this [...] "episode didn't exactly feel like the usual moderately paced, secret-revealing drama Lost usually is; it felt like an action movie... it was like watching Die Hard on an island". [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9.3/10, concluding that [...] "if 'The Shape of Things to Come' is any indication of the level of quality that [...] should expect from here on out then we are in for some incredible storytelling" [...] and [...] "Alex's death will probably be remembered as one of the more pivotal scenes in the entire series [...] it is such a phenomenally shot, edited and acted moment... it would be incredibly hard not to feel for [...] here." [...] Upon grading the best episodes of the first five seasons, the episode ranked second, beating episodes like [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] and the pilot and losing to [...] "The Constant." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad summed up [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] as [...] "a brilliant episode... tons of action, several big revelations, and more questions to ponder". [...] Don Williams of BuddyTV decided that the episode was [...] "worth waiting five weeks for" [...] and [...] "so jam packed that I need <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>my</b> brain time to rest". [...] Williams's colleague Oscar Dahl ranked the scene in which Alex is killed as the fifth best moment of the season, noting that [...] "it was perfectly paced... and provided a huge shock... and some of the best acting you'll ever see". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into the swing of Lost. [...] It wasn't a [...] à la 'The Constant'. [...] It was an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, which to me matched the 'Pilot' bombastic grandeur".|$|E
