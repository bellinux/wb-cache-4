5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{purchased}} {{land in the}} Nishi Azabu {{district of}} Tokyo to build his new office and living quarters. The office was built using the traditional Japanese post and lintel type construction using unplaned timber logs. The office served as a proving ground for the latest American building innovations including veneered plywood and suspended metal ductwork for forced air heating. Taking influence from Le Corbusier's modulor, Raymond used the traditional Japanese module of the ken (based upon the size of tatami mats) as a unit of measure to set out the building's structure. Again he used fusuma partitions and shoji screens, but in a modern way <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> the spaces.|$|E
5|$|The few {{courts that}} have {{considered}} the antitrust implications of concurrent use registration have determined {{that it does not}} raise any violation of antitrust laws. Although it is considered a violation of such laws for companies to agree <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> geographic territories for the sale of goods, concurrent use agreements dividing up trademark territories are specifically provided for by Congress. Furthermore, even with such an agreement in place, a company can still sell competing products in the trademark territory of another company, so long as the intruding party sells that product under a different mark.|$|E

5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E
25|$|The Commission also {{deals with}} matters of succession. When a boss dies or retires, his clan's {{reputation}} often crumbles with his departure. This can cause clients {{to abandon the}} clan and turn to neighboring clans for protection. These clans would grow greatly in status and power relative to their rivals, potentially destabilizing the region and precipitating war. The Commission may choose <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> the clan's territory and members among its neighbors. Alternatively, the commission {{has the power to}} appoint a regent for the clan until it can elect a new boss.|$|E
25|$|In 1876 Britain and Germany agreed <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> {{the western}} and central Pacific, with each {{claiming}} a ‘sphere of influence’. In the previous decade German traders had become active in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands. In 1877 the Governor of Fiji was given the additional title of High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. However, the claim of a ‘sphere of influence’ that included the Ellice Islands and the Gilbert Islands {{did not result in}} the immediate move to govern those islands.|$|E
5000|$|Area code 386, {{which was}} put into service in July 2001, {{is one of a}} few {{examples}} of how rapid population growth (and explosive growth in unexpected areas) coupled with an increase in auxiliary devices (such as cell phones and pagers) has led to some unusual, unorthodox, and often controversial solutions <b>to</b> <b>dividing</b> <b>up</b> [...] "full" [...] Area codes.|$|R

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, the Entente Powers proposed <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> its Anatolian lands in the Treaty of Sèvres. Among other things, the full application of the treaty would have led to the expansion of the Democratic Republic of Armenia to include regions such as Bitlis, Van, Erzurum and Trabzon while granting local autonomy to the Kurdish inhabited areas east of the Euphrates river and to the south of Armenia. Sharif Pasha, the Kurdish representative in the Paris Peace Conference, reached an agreement with the Armenian representatives on December 20, 1919, and both parties made joint declarations to the conference.|$|E
25|$|Out {{of these}} changes came the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program (SSMP), which, among other things, {{included}} funds {{for the development of}} methods to design and build nuclear weapons that would work without having to be explosively tested. In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments, and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1billion, with completion in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins in}} Havana on December 31, 1958, roughly {{three years after}} the closing events of the {{previous}} game. Hyman Roth (Danny Jacobs) has called a meeting in Cuba to celebrate the Mafia's success in their partnership with the government of Fulgencio Batista. Attending the meeting are Michael Corleone (Carlos Ferro), his brother Fredo (John Mariano), his underboss Aldo Trapani (Rick Pasqualone), and Trapani's caporegime, Dominic (Chris Cox), as well as representatives of the Granados and Mangano families, amongst others. Roth announces that when he retires, he plans <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> his Cuban businesses between the families. However, later that night, Batista resigns from office, as the Cuban Revolution proves victorious. Michael, Aldo, Fredo and Dominic head for a nearby airport, but Aldo is shot and killed. The others escape, and Michael believes with Aldo gone, the smaller families may try to muscle in on Corleone businesses in New York City. Fredo offers to take Aldo's place, but Michael ignores him, telling him to make sure Aldo's mother is taken care of financially, and instead he appoints Dominic as Aldo's replacement.|$|E
50|$|In 1884, the Texas Legislature passed {{legislation}} requiring Wood County, Texas <b>to</b> be <b>divided</b> <b>up</b> into free school districts, including several African American schools. Interestingly, {{what would become}} South Ward/Mineola Colored/McFarland wasn't among the African American schools the legislature authorized.|$|R

500|$|The term {{bacon in}} this book does not refer to the sliced and {{pre-packaged}} bacon that is ubiquitous in American markets, but instead the cured whole side of the pig. Furthermore, the differences between bacon in the United States and in the United Kingdom are quite pronounced, and the book refers only to cuts common in the United Kingdom. The cut {{that is used to}} produce [...] "American bacon" [...] is a cut referred to as [...] "streaky bacon" [...] in the United Kingdom. Most bacon consumed in the United Kingdom is known as back bacon and consists of both pork belly and pork loin in a single cut. The Wiltshire cut was a way <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> the meat, and was marketed to consumers in still further cuts.|$|E
500|$|As American {{troops were}} sent to China to relieve the nation's legation, Hay {{sent a letter to}} foreign powers (often called the Second Open Door note), stating while the United States wanted to see lives {{preserved}} and the guilty punished, it intended that China not be dismembered. [...] Hay issued this on July 3, 1900, suspecting that the powers were quietly making private arrangements <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> China. Communication between the foreign legations and the outside world had been cut off, and the personnel there were falsely presumed slaughtered, but Hay realized that Minister Wu could get a message in, and Hay was able to establish communication. [...] Hay suggested to the Chinese government that it now cooperate for its own good. [...] When the foreign relief force, principally Japanese but including 2,000 Americans, relieved the legations and sacked Peking, China was made to pay a huge indemnity but there was no cession of land.|$|E

2500|$|Peres {{lost the}} {{chairmanship}} of the Labor Party in November 2005, in advance of the 2006 elections. As party leader, he favored pushing off the elections for as long as possible. He claimed that an early election would jeopardize both the September 2005 Gaza withdrawal plan and the standing of the party in a national unity government with Sharon. However, the majority pushed for an earlier date, as younger members of the party, among them Amir Peretz, Ophir Pines-Paz and Isaac Herzog, overtook established leaders such as Binyamin Ben-Eliezer and Haim Ramon in the party ballot <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> government portfolios.

2500|$|The {{alliance}} of Guarino [...] "Willie" [...] Moretti and Abner [...] "Longie" [...] Zwillman operated in Northern New Jersey for the Luciano family. Zwillman {{was his own}} boss, known by the media as the Al Capone of New Jersey because he controlled {{a majority of the}} illegal alcohol in Newark, New Jersey. Moretti the highest ranking capo for the Luciano family's New Jersey faction dominated the illegal gambling in the state with his Jewish associate Zwillman. In early 1937 the Newark family boss Gaspare D’Amico fled the United States after a failed assassination attempt on his life ordered by Joseph Profaci. The Commission decided <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> his territory among the Luciano (Boiardo crew), Gagliano (Jersey crew), Mangano, Bonanno, Badami, Profaci and Philadelphia (North Jersey crew) crime families.|$|E
2500|$|Estonia had {{pursued a}} policy of neutrality, but it was of no {{consequence}} after the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on 23 August 1939. In the agreement, the two great powers agreed <b>to</b> <b>divide</b> <b>up</b> the countries situated between them (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland), with Estonia falling in the Soviet [...] "sphere of influence". After the invasion of Poland, the Orzeł incident took place when Polish submarine ORP Orzeł looked for shelter in Tallinn but escaped after the Soviet Union attacked Poland on 17 September. Estonia's lack of will and/or inability to disarm and intern the crew caused the Soviet Union to accuse Estonia of [...] "helping them escape" [...] and claim that Estonia was not neutral. On 24 September 1939, the Soviet Union threatened Estonia with war unless provided with military bases in the country—an ultimatum with which the Estonian government complied.|$|E
