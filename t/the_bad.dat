50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Badding</b> Rug is a Victorian {{cross-stitch}} needlepoint made in 1950 {{entirely by}} hand by Carolyn Badding of San Leandro, California. Measuring 12 feet by 15 feet, on a Smyrna canvas backing of seven strips assembled {{to be one}} piece before any stitching began, it features approximately 1,260,000 stitches in French wool. Research done prior to its completion revealed no record of any needlepoint rug of the proportions of <b>the</b> <b>Badding</b> Rug completed by any American citizen. This rug was credited in numerous news articles to be a masterpiece in needlepoint. <b>The</b> <b>Badding</b> Rug was compared to one owned by Queen Mary that was fashioned of six completed strips sewn together.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, the primary legal test used in the United States to {{determine}} if speech could be criminalized was <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> tendency test. Rooted in English common law, the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it {{had a tendency to}} harm public welfare. One of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court addressed punishment after material was published was Patterson v. Colorado (1907) in which the Court used <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.|$|E

5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} {{the origins and}} the nature of <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> blood between the two. According to Jackson, the rivalry exists because {{he was one of the}} few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to eat or be in an elevator with Silva, but he was not one of them. He added that <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E

5|$|A third {{attempt was}} planned for September 13; bad weather delayed {{attempts}} until September 16. However, General Schuyler was {{by this time}} so ill that he thought it necessary to withdraw to Ticonderoga. He left that day, turning full command of the invasion over to Montgomery. Schuyler {{was not the only}} one falling ill; <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> weather, and the swampy, malaria-infested terrain of Île-aux-Noix was also taking a toll on the troops, as more of them became ill as well. <b>The</b> <b>bad</b> news was tempered by good; an additional 250 troops, in the form of a company of Green Mountain Boys under Seth Warner, and another company of New Hampshire men under Colonel Timothy Bedel, arrived at Île-aux-Noix.|$|E

5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> weather, the B-17s {{returned}} individually to Mitchel Field.

5|$|His dispositions for {{the battle}} are {{described}} as a clear mistake leaving the right far too strong and the left much too weak.

5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even relatively recent graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials.
