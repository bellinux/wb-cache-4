5|$|Aspirin, {{also known}} as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a {{medication}} used to treat pain, fever, or inflammation. Specific inflammatory conditions in which aspirin is used include Kawasaki disease, pericarditis, and rheumatic fever. Aspirin given shortly {{after a heart attack}} decreases the risk of death. Aspirin is also used long-term <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> heart attacks, ischaemic strokes, and blood clots, in people at high risk. Aspirin may also decrease the risk of certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. For pain or fever, effects typically begin within 30 minutes. Aspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and works similar to other NSAIDs but also suppresses the normal functioning of platelets.|$|E

5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} design of fault-tolerant computer systems, particularly via lockstep systems performing the same operation in parallel.

Although additional measures may be required in embedded or specialized systems, this method can provide a cost effective approach to achieve n-modular redundancy in commercial off-the-shelf systems.|$|E

5|$|After beating Razor Ramon for the WWF Intercontinental Championship in April 1994, Diesel was in {{the midst}} of a major push. He was {{considered}} the top contender to Bret Hart's WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and a match was booked for King of the Ring in which only Hart's title would be on the line. The feud intensified on the May 30, 1994, episode of Monday Night Raw during Jerry Lawler's interview segment, The King's Court. During an interview with Hart, Lawler invited Diesel and his friend Shawn Michaels to confront Hart. After a verbal confrontation, Diesel performed his Jacknife Powerbomb on Hart, after which Diesel, Michaels and Lawler attacked Hart. The following week on Monday Night Raw, Bret announced that he would have a family member, whose identity would be a secret until the pay-per-view, in his corner <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> Michaels from interfering on Diesel's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{with the}} GCR on outer {{suburban}} services on the extension line saw {{the introduction of}} more comfortable Dreadnought Stock carriages from 1910. Ninety-two of these wooden compartment carriages were built, fitted with pressurised gas lighting and steam heating. Electric lighting had replaced the gas by 1917 and electric heaters were added in 1922 to provide warmth when hauled by an electric locomotive. Later formed into rakes of five, six or seven coaches, conductor rail pick-ups on the leading and trailing guard coaches were joined by a bus line and connected to the electric locomotive <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> gapping. Two rakes were formed with a Pullman coach that provided a buffet service for a supplementary fare. The Vintage Carriages Trust has three preserved Dreadnought carriages.|$|E

The reinforced Italians successfully managed to halt the Austro-Hungarian advance at the battle of the Piave river. During the Allied counter-attack in October 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Army collapsed after taking heavy losses at the battle of Vittorio Veneto. An armistice was signed shortly afterwards on 3 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> further drinking.|$|E
5|$|The Undertaker did {{not appear}} in the WWF for several months after his loss to Yokozuna. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal.

Ted DiBiase claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF, but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase's Undertaker was an impostor. Paul Bearer claimed to have located the true Undertaker, which led to a match at SummerSlam 1994 between DiBiase's Undertaker (portrayed by Brian Lee) and Paul Bearer's original Undertaker. After defeating the false Undertaker, Bearer's Undertaker got revenge against Yokozuna by winning a Casket match at Survivor Series 1994. <b>To</b> <b>help</b> <b>prevent</b> outside interference, Chuck Norris was brought in as a guest referee.|$|E
