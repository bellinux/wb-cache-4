5|$|After {{separating}} from Leissègues on 15 December, Willaumez sailed south, capturing {{a number}} of vessels from a British troop convoy and sending <b>the</b> <b>prizes,</b> with the frigate Volontaire, to Tenerife. Willaumez's intention was to raid the China Fleet, a large convoy of valuable East Indiamen that sailed from the Far East to Britain every year.

Turning westwards, Willaumez raided shipping in the South Atlantic until April, when he anchored at Salvador in neutral Brazil. By early May, Willaumez was at sea again, stopping at Cayenne and then splitting his force to raid shipping in the Leeward Islands prior to reuniting at Fort-de-France on Martinique in June.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 135 million sestertii {{was spent}} on donatives, or congiaria, throughout Domitian's reign. In addition, he also revived the practice of public banquets, which {{had been reduced to}} a simple distribution of food under Nero, while he invested large sums on entertainment and games. In 86, he founded the Capitoline Games, a quadrennial contest comprising athletic displays, chariot races, and competitions for oratory, music and acting. Domitian himself supported the travels of competitors from the whole Empire and attributed <b>the</b> <b>prizes.</b> Innovations were also introduced into the regular gladiatorial games, such as naval contests, night-time battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights.

The right or eastern column was headed by USS Cabot and was followed by Hopkins' flagship USS Alfred, which had 20 guns and was the largest ship of the fleet. The left column was headed by the USS Andrew Doria and was followed by USS Columbus. Behind these came USS Providence, with USS Fly and USS Wasp trailing farther behind as escorts for <b>the</b> <b>prizes.</b> The need to provide crews for the prize ships further reduced the fighting effectiveness of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, {{and aimed}} to {{increase}} the number of stores by approximately 50 per year over the following five years.

The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in Dothan, Alabama.

50|$|Since <b>the</b> {{secondary}} <b>prizes</b> {{are defined}} in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability {{for a given}} <b>prize</b> level exceed <b>the</b> funds in <b>the</b> <b>prize</b> pool for that level the amount of <b>the</b> <b>prize</b> may be reduced and <b>the</b> <b>prize</b> pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a <b>prize</b> lower than <b>the</b> fixed amounts given in <b>the</b> <b>prize</b> tables. Because <b>the</b> secondary <b>prize</b> pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.|$|R
