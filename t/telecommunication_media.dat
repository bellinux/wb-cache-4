40|$|A growing part of {{communication}} in couple relationships involves technical means {{such as the}} conventional telephone, the cell phone and the Internet. This study examines how <b>telecommunication</b> <b>media</b> are integrated in the couples' everyday life based on three theoretical approaches: 1. Using the Theory of Interpersonal Media Choice, different profiles of couple's media use were analyzed. 2. By adopting the Social Exchange Theory it was investigated to what extent couples regard their telecommunication messages (i. e. letters, e-mails, SMS) as emotional resources and if and how they strive to achieve equity regarding this message exchange. 3. Attachment theory was adopted {{to find out how}} attachment styles affect media use within couple relationships and which role <b>telecommunication</b> <b>media</b> play in attachment situations (i. e. distressing situations in which the partner's support is strongly sought). Data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with N= 10 respondents (5 couples). A qualitative content analysis of the interview data revealed that couples develop very different patterns of media use, that they indeed see telecommunication messages as emotional resources and that they are able to cope with attachment situations successfully, especially via mobile communication. But sometimes <b>telecommunication</b> <b>media</b> also seem to generate new communication problems. Further research is needed to better understand how telecommunication is embedded in couple relationships and how it transforms couple communication. URN: urn:nbn:de: 0114 -fqs 03032...|$|E

40|$|The {{opening of}} {{telecommunications}} to competition {{since the beginning}} of the 1980 's has several explanations. Governments have acknowledged that the regulatory preservation of national monopolies had become impossible as well as economically inefficient, notably because of certain technological revolutions. Liberalization of telecommunications must also be seen in the context of a global opening of markets, of which the most obvious manifestation is the creation of the WTO. At the European level, liberalization is the logical consequence of the Treaty of Rome principles and objectives. Introducing competition to the telecommunication sector proves to be extremely difficult in practice, especially in a context where <b>telecommunication,</b> <b>media</b> an information technologies industries converge. The new regulation must find, through the definition of interconnection conditions between operators and the preservation of universal service, an equilibrium between the conflicting interests of incumbent and new operators, and those of professional and residential customers...|$|E

40|$|The {{roles of}} {{broadcast}} media and <b>telecommunication</b> <b>media</b> are being redefined, as {{the diffusion of}} new forms of interactive media progresses. The broadcasting model has clear advantages in rapidly and ubiquitously spreading information and other content to large audiences, and in quickly building brand recognition. However, this synchronous broadcast media consumption model is challenged by new technology that promotes more fragmented and asynchronous media usage patterns. For example, digital television receivers and personal video recorders, such as TiVo or Replay, allow flexible local caching and customization of digital media content. Simultaneously, people are gradually taking more active roles in seeking digital information and entertainment, participating in shared virtual environments, and becoming producers of media content. New forms of customized media and group communication enabled by the Internet are fundamentally different compared with traditional mass media communications. There are signs signaling the emergence of more demanding and technologically empowered citizens and media customers. They demand new kinds of media content and services, but the role of traditional media in this process is largely to be defined. Therefore, the media companies are struggling to understand...|$|E

Advances made by the country in health and education are at par with those of the advanced countries. Near universal literacy and a well-developed system of school education, places Sri Lanka as a leader in education in South Asia and amongst the top-performing countries in the entire world. High priority was given to education for over six decades whereby free education has resulted in an increase of school enrolment from 1 million in 1947 to a peak of 4. 2 million in the mid-nineties, achieving universal primary education and a high level of participation in secondary education. Net enrolment ratio (in 2004) of 97. 9 % at primary level, a completion ratio of 95 %, and a gender parity of 96 % are laudable achievements. In terms of multi-disciplinary e-readiness criteria, Sri Lanka is also ranked higher than the neighbouring Asian countries in spite of the relatively slow penetration of computers, internet and other <b>telecommunication</b> <b>media.</b> According to the United Nations Report on e-Government Survey of 2008, Sri Lanka is ranked at eighth among twenty other countries in the Southeast/South Asian region...|$|E
40|$|Working on the {{ambiguity}} and circularity intrinsic {{to the operation}} of 'dusting', this paper explores the role of dust in the definition, organisation and dissolution of the domestic interior in its 20 th century representations. An analysis of images from the visual arts, film, and advertising, shows how their readings of dusting offer contradictory interpretations of space that blur the distinction of interior and exterior and expose the permeability of their boundaries. In Richard Hamilton’s iconic collage of 1956, 'what makes today's homes so different, so appealing' (as its title recites), is the fact that, behind the exposed bodies of {{the inhabitants of the}} modern home and besides the pervasive presence of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>media,</b> the act of dusting is here performed by an alter-ego of the female inhabitant reduced to a diminutive appendage of the vacuum cleaner. The new dusting appliance not only removes dust but, participating in the dynamics of the mediatic and machinic centre-less interior, it sucks up (together with dust), all familiar connotations of domesticity. Vacuumed, the interior is fragmented, multiplied and centrifugally dispersed; made permeable and exposed it is no longer separable from world events. Other examples follow, from literary divertissement (Graham Greene's facetious political satire), to tongue-in-cheek high art (Jeff Koons's vacuum cleaner taxonomies), to consumerism and advertising (Dyson's 1990 s high-tech commercials), to show that while dust continues to return, invincible, the enclosures and (false) security of the 20 th century interior are, more than vacuumed, literally and lightly laughed away...|$|E
