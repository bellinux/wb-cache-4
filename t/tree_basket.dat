50|$|Crondall has {{for centuries}} been rich farming land. A {{great variety of}} soils appear in the area because it lies {{on the edge of}} the London Basin {{including}} chalk, clay and heavy fertile loam. There are many natural springs in the area that were used as watercress beds and for growing osier <b>trees</b> for <b>basket</b> weaving. Some of the baskets were incorporated into the balloon baskets and airship gondolas used by S.F. Cody in his early aviation experiments at Farnborough. The area was also renowned for hops that were grown here for two hundred years until the last war. For many years Crondall had a brickworks that supplied tiles and brick to local towns.|$|R
50|$|A {{hanging basket}} is a {{suspended}} container used for growing decorative plants. Typically they are hung from buildings, where garden space is at a premium, and from street furniture for environmental enhancement.

60|$|She {{chose to}} go through the great Piazza that she might take a first survey of the unparalleled sight there while she was still alone. Entering it from the south, she saw {{something}} monstrous and many-coloured {{in the shape of a}} pyramid, or, rather, like a huge fir-tree, sixty feet high, with shelves on the branches, widening and widening towards the base till they reached a circumference of eighty yards. The Piazza was full of life: slight young figures, in white garments, with olive wreaths on their heads, were moving to and fro about the base of the pyramidal <b>tree,</b> carrying <b>baskets</b> full of bright-coloured things; and maturer forms, some in the monastic frock, some in the loose tunics and dark-red caps of artists, were helping and examining, or else retreating to various points in the distance to survey the wondrous whole: while a considerable group, amongst whom Romola recognised Piero di Cosimo, standing on the marble steps of Orgagna's Loggia, seemed to be keeping aloof in discontent and scorn.|$|R
50|$|The region's retail core {{has shifted}} {{to the town of}} Union Gap, where a renovated {{shopping}} mall and other new retail businesses are flourishing. While some see big-box retail leaving the downtown area as a loss, others see it as an opportunity to recast the downtown area as a center for events, services, entertainment, and smaller, more personal shopping experiences. One part of this effort has been the Downtown Futures Initiative. The DFI has provided for street-to-storefront remodeling along Yakima Avenue throughout the entire downtown core, and includes new pedestrian-friendly lighting, water fountains, planters, banner poles and new <b>trees</b> and hanging <b>baskets,</b> all of which complement the new paver-inlaid sidewalks.|$|R
50|$|Today basket weaving {{often leads}} to {{environmental}} activism. Indiscriminate pesticide spraying endangers basket weavers' health. The black ash <b>tree,</b> used by <b>basket</b> weavers from Michigan to Maine, is threatened by the emerald ash borer. Basket weaver Kelly Church has organized two conferences about the threat and teaches children how to harvest black ash seeds. Many native plants that basket weavers use are endangered. Rivercane only grows in 2% of its original territory. Cherokee basket weaver and ethnobotanist, Shawna Cain is working with her tribe to form the Cherokee Nation Native Plant Society. Tohono O'odham basket weaver Terrol Dew Johnson, known for his experimental use of gourds, beargrass, and other desert plants, took his interest in native plants and founded Tohono O'odham Community Action, which provides traditional wild desert foods for his tribe.|$|R
25|$|Surveyed and {{explored}} during the 1950s and 1960s, Yavne-Yam was first excavated between 1967 and 1969 by Tel Aviv district archaeologist Jacob Kaplan. Concentrating {{on the perimeter}} fortifications, Kaplan unearthed a number of superimposed gates dating from the Middle and Late Bronze Ages. Excavations by Tel Aviv University resumed in 1992, {{under the direction of}} Prof. Moshe Fischer. These are still ongoing and are centered on the coast, bay and promontory. In 2007, a 6th-century Byzantine villa featuring a mosaic floor depicting <b>trees</b> and fruit <b>baskets</b> was uncovered at the site. Excavations on the promotory in 2011 revealed a Roman-style bathhouse within the 9th century Early Islamic period fortifications. The use of Roman technology at such a late date was previously unknown. The bathhouse is also the only known example of a bathhouse in an Islamic fortress.|$|R

'The Bishop himself says of this fray:--"I {{was in the}} middle, one man only {{remained}} by me, crouching {{under the}} lee of the branch of the tree, and shooting away from thence within a yard of me. I {{did not like to}} leave the steel-yard, and I had to detach it from the rope with which it was tied to the <b>tree,</b> and the <b>basket</b> too was half full of yams and heavy, so that it was some time before I got away, and walked down the beach, and waded to the boat, shooting going on all round at the time; no one shooting at me, yet as they shot on both sides of me at each other, I was thankful to get well out of it. I thought of him who preserves from [...] "the arrow that flieth by day," [...] as He has so mercifully preserved so many of us from [...] "the sickness." [...] Now don't go and let this little affair be printed.' ...|$|R
60|$|Our life in Burr Oak {{township}} {{that summer}} was joyous for us children. It {{seems to have}} been almost all sunshine and play. As I reflect upon it I relive many delightful excursions into the northern woods. It appears that Harriet and I were in continual harvest of nuts and berries. Our walks to school were explorations and we spent nearly every Saturday and Sunday in minute study of the country-side, devouring everything which was remotely edible. We gorged upon May-apples until we were ill, and munched black cherries until we were dizzy with their fumes. We clambered high <b>trees</b> to collect <b>baskets</b> of wild grapes which our mother could not use, and we garnered nuts with the insatiable greed of squirrels. We ate oak-shoots, fern-roots, leaves, bark, seed-balls,--everything!--not because we were hungry but because we loved to experiment, and we came home, only when hungry or worn out or in awe of the darkness.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} its opening, the Downtown Community House provided {{a wide range of}} medical, social, and occupational opportunities, including musicals, a drama club, classes in scientific housekeeping, and Christmas activities for the neighborhood children with music, dances, Christmas <b>trees,</b> and food <b>baskets</b> donated by wealthy sponsors and Wall Street corporations. In 1929, the Neighborhood Association conducted an occupational survey of the area’s female population, discovering that over two-thirds of the 788 women surveyed were found to be scrubwomen, most over the age of 30, who worked long hours overnight in nearby office buildings on Wall Street at a wage of 50 cents per hour; the results of the survey were then used to establish free summer vacation camps for Lower Manhattan working women. The medical center continued to be a vital resource to the community, providing over 1,500 schoolchildren with dental care in 1926 and 1,400 in 1928; in only one month in 1930, 1,041 visits to 535 people were made, with a total attendance of 3,774 at the health center. Community activities during the Great Depression included plays directed by out-of-work locals, giving the unemployed men “something to work on during their enforced idleness.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Many Vietnamese people visit Chua Huong on {{religious}} pilgrimage. The standard greetings from one pilgrim to another are [...] "A Di Da Phat" [...] or [...] "Namo Amitabha Buddha". For {{the purpose of}} pilgrimage there are various routes that one might take, but the most popular {{is to take a}} boat from Yen wharf, stopping at Trinh shrine to ‘present’ themselves at the ‘registration shrine’. The pilgrims then make their way to Hoi bridge and visit Thanh Son temple inside a cave. The next stop is Tro wharf, from which pilgrims travel on foot to Thien Tru Pagoda. After Thien Tru comes Tien temple, followed by Giai Oan temple. It is believed that Buddha once stopped here to wash himself clean of the dust of humanity, and many pilgrims will wash their face and hands in Long Tuyen Well in hopes of washing away past karmas. While here, pilgrims may also visit Tuyet Kinh cave and Cua Vong shrine to worship the Goddess of the Mountains, or Phat Tich Shrine where there is a stone believed to be the preserved footprint of the Quan Am.From here pilgrims head toward the final destination: Huong Tich Cave. At Huong Tich there are statues of deities, but many pilgrims come to get blessings from the stalactites and stalagmites, many of which are named and have special purposes. Many childless pilgrims seek fertility from Nui Co (the girl) and Nui Cau (the boy), while others visit stalactites and stalagmites thought to give prosperity. Pilgrims often gather under one particular stalactite, which resembles a breast, to catch drops of water in hopes of being blessed with health from the ‘milk’ of the 'breast'. Other names of stalactites and stalagmites include the Heap of Coins (Dun Tien), the Gold Tree, the Silver <b>Tree,</b> the <b>Basket</b> of Silkworms (Buong Tam), the Cocoon (Nong Ken) and the Rice Stack (Dun Gao).|$|R
40|$|Apart {{from using}} {{information}} systems for management of procurement data, sales and purchase transactions, warehouse operations, finance and human resources, information technologies are increasingly used for analysis, planning {{and control of}} business processes. In contemporary economy companies need various business intelligence techniques for analyzing business data, such as sales revenue or production costs. The term business intelligence (BI) was first introduced by Howard Dresher, Gartner Group analyst, to denote “concepts and methods to improve business decision making by using fact-based support systems”. Business intelligence as it is understood today provides tools for online analytical processing, data mining, process mining, business performance management and predictive analytics. Numerous data mining methods are used for marketing, sales and customer support: market basket analysis, clustering, neural networks, decision trees, genetic algorithms, association rules, statistical methods, etc. There {{are a lot of}} programming tools for data mining present on the market, produced by leading software companies. For example tools which are part of the statistical program packages, like Enterprise Miner (SAS) and Clementine (SPSS), specialized tools for general or business usage, such as Intelligent Miner (IBM) and Data Miner (SAS), OLAP tools, as Hiperion, Pentaho and IBM Cognos Business Intelligence. Some DBMS include data mining tools, as for exmple Microsoft SQL Server Business Intelligence and Oracle Data Mining suit Darwin. Besides the above mentioned tools, there are many others on the market such as: Advanced Miner, Affinium Model, DataDetective, DataLab, Kalidara Advisor, XLMiner and open source data mining systems as WEKA, Orange, Tanagra, Rapid Miner, KEEL, KNIME, MiningMart, MLC ++. In this paper we are considering the implementation of methodologies for market segmentation, discovering the profile of typical customers for particular kind of products, their buying preferences and cross selling motivators. We use several data mining techniques, such as Bayesian network, decision tree and neural network, to determine the factors that affect the spending pattern and buying preferences of the customers. From the obtained results several conclusions can be drawn. Customer’s income affects the spending pattern compared to other factors, such as age, marital status, and the number of children. Issuing loyalty cards combined with promotional activities and discounts for pairs of associated products can increases the profit. Using decision <b>tree</b> and market <b>basket</b> analysis the spending patterns of the customers with loyalty cards were discovered...|$|R
