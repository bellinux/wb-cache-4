According to the {{principle}} producing the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter, to study the influence <b>of</b> the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter {{on the process of}} high speed ball-end milling, the single-factor models for evaluating the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter are established. Adopting four kinds of the typical cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter, the experiment of high speed ball-end milling is processed. The model of multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter is established, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> high speed ball-end milling cutter is accomplished by the application of fuzzy mathematics theory. Results show that the cutting contact curve of cutter affects directly the process of high speed ball-end milling, fuzzy and uncertain properties exist in the evaluation for the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> cutter. The optimum cutting track can be selected by multi-ply fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for the cutting <b>track</b> <b>of</b> high speed ball-end milling cutter...|$|R

Then the tracks split {{to join the}} local and express <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the Eighth Avenue Line north of 42nd Street–Port Authority Bus Terminal. At that station, a special lower platform formerly served a single southbound track from the Queens Boulevard Line, merging with both southbound <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the Eighth Avenue Line south of the station; the long-disused platform was demolished in June 2013 {{to make way for}} the extension of the IRT Flushing Line.|$|E

40|$|Thinking {{processes}} and interest {{may be related}} to a <b>track</b> <b>of</b> eye. Moreover, the <b>track</b> <b>of</b> eye can be used also for detecting the indecision behind a final reply to a query. Therefore, taking decision making on WEB survey as an example, the decision making mechanism under the network environment was investigated by observing the <b>track</b> <b>of</b> eye. A correlation between a <b>track</b> <b>of</b> eye and the <b>track</b> <b>of</b> mouse was also estimated to investigate a relation between a <b>track</b> <b>of</b> mouse and a mentality on decision making. In experiments, a question was answered in a multiple answered query and by a slide bar. The eye and mouse track in the multiple-query can be used to evaluate the value of the bar as a confidence factor. 報告番号:; 学位授与年月日: 2010 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 修士; 学位の種類: 修士(環境学); 学位記番号: 修創域第 3492 号; 研究科・専攻: 新領域創成科学研究科人間環境学専...|$|R

5|$|On July 22, 2001, {{concurrent}} {{with the}} closure of the IND Sixth Avenue Line <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the Manhattan Bridge, B and Q train service to this station ceased and was replaced with a full-time shuttle. At this time, the northern <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the bridge were closed to allow for bridge repairs to take place. The southern BMT Broadway Line tracks were reopened allowing for half of the tracks on the bridge to remain open. On December 16, 2001, the 63rd Street Connector, which was built to connect the IND 63rd Street Line and the IND Queens Boulevard Line officially opened, and the F train was rerouted to serve this station at all times, which it still does to this day. When this happened, a free MetroCard out-of-system transfer to the Lexington Avenue–59th Street station was added. This was to provide a transfer to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line for F train customers as such a connection had been provided at the Lexington Avenue–53rd Street station along the previous routing of the F train.|$|E
5|$|The B, D, and Q trains {{were all}} rerouted from the express <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the BMT Broadway Line to the express <b>tracks</b> <b>of</b> the IND Sixth Avenue Line {{as part of}} Manhattan Bridge reconstruction. No more express service was to be run on the Broadway Line, since these {{services}} comprised the entirety of Broadway express service. This also eliminated the divided B and D services (the Sixth Avenue Line B/D services were separate from the Broadway Line B/D services, as the Sixth Avenue services had originated at 34th Street–Herald Square and continued to upper Manhattan and the Bronx via the IND Eighth Avenue Line and the IND Concourse Line).|$|E
