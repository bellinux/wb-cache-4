The surfaces were finished by painting with a <b>thin</b> <b>coat</b> of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E
25|$|The past {{commercial}} success of Nachusa House is reflected through the many changes to its design. The first {{addition to the}} hotel was in 1854 when the old west annex was added, this four story, 60 room structure was demolished during the 1950s and rebuilt as it appears today. In 1868 the mansard roof and fifth floor {{were added to the}} building; both features were important in solidifying the hotel's image as a first class hotel. Other architectural details were added and removed through the years, including the addition of a <b>thin</b> <b>coat</b> of stucco in the 1880s. In 1914 the building's south annex was added, though it was essentially gutted during the 1950s and very little of the original 1914 structure remains.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{reflection}} and diffraction properties of nonlinear thin dielectric coatings are investigated. A quite simple geometry {{consisting of two}} semi-infinite homogenous linear spaces separated by a non-linear coating is considered. An incident plane wave propagating along the z direction towards the nonlinear <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> is taken. The nonlinear <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> is divided into elementary sectors, within each one of which one propagating and one reflected wave exists. The boundary conditions are then applied {{in order to develop}} an efficient numerical algorithm to study the properties of the nonlinear <b>thin</b> <b>coating.</b> Although the model is quite simple, interesting results have been derived by applying the present numerical method. The propagation constant inside the nonlinear <b>thin</b> <b>coating</b> has been found to depend almost sinusoidally on the z variable. The reflection and transmission coefficients depend on the nonlinearity factor of the <b>thin</b> <b>coating.</b> Finally, it is shown that the nonlinear dielectric anti-reflection coating has in one sense broadband properties...|$|R

2500|$|In November 2012, a local {{newspaper}} Philipstown.Info revealed that the Town of Philipstown budget contained proposed expenditures for paving sections of the town's historic dirt roads [...] including 5300 feet of Old Albany Post Road in 2013-14 and an additional 7580 feet to be paved within 5 years. Until the paper revealed this information, residents of the road were unaware of the town's grand plans. The Philipstown Board cited three reasons for paving; the cost of maintaining dirt roads are too expensive, degradation of water quality in nearby streams, and safety. If this plan were undertaken the Old Albany Post Road would lose almost 2.5 miles of historic road. Sections that the town wants to pave include two important historic areas; Saunders Farm and the hill that runs north to the famous revolutionary era Bird and Bottle Inn. There is considerable opposition to paving by local residents and a contentious town board workshop was held for Philipstown residents on January 16, 2013. Those in opposition to paving cite the historic, aesthetic, cultural, and recreational importance of leaving the road untouched. Many residents and an expert engineer presented information documenting that sound dirt road maintenance practices have not been utilized by the Town of Philipstown {{and if they were}} adopted would lead to cost savings, improvement in water quality, and thus preserve the historic nature of the road. Additionally other dirt road residents pointed out that drivers on dirt roads travel at significantly lower speeds reducing mortality in pedestrian vehicle accidents. It was also pointed out that the Town of Philipstown could be in violation of state bonding laws if they were to pave as proposed with merely a <b>thin</b> <b>coat</b> of asphalt and no substructure preparation.|$|E

60|$|As {{he put on}} his {{new clothes}} he felt the moral support which the becomingness of dress alone can give. With the blue silk gauze lightly tied under his collar, and the lapels of his <b>thin</b> <b>coat</b> thrown back to admit his thumbs to his {{waistcoat}} pockets, he felt almost cheerful before his glass. Should he shave? As once before, this important question occurred to him. His thinness gave him some advantages of figure, but he thought that it made his face older. What effect would cutting off his beard have upon it? He had not seen the lower part of his face for fifteen years. No one could say what recent ruin of a double chin might not be lurking there. He decided not to shave, at least till after dinner, and after dinner he was too impatient for his visit to brook the necessary delay.|$|E

Prescott saw Wandle turn his head and look up at him. Then the fugitive sent up a hoarse cry of rage and warning, too late. If he could stop his team, which was very doubtful, he might escape the threatened collision; but this would involve his capture by Stanton, and he lashed his horses and went on, while Prescott and the great plow horse came madly rushing down at him. He looked at them again, with a breathless yell; then he let the reins fall and seized a seat rail.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the process}} of construction, the central wire of the copper core was first covered with a {{semi-liquid}} coating of gutta-percha, mixed with tar--known as [...] "Chatterton's Compound." [...] This was laid on so thick that when the other wires were wound round it all air was excluded. Then a coating of the same compound was laid over the finished conductor, and thus the core was solidified. Next, the core was surrounded with a coating of the purest gutta-percha--a splendid non-conductor, impervious to water--which, when pressed to it, while in a plastic state, formed the first insulator or tube to the core. Over this tube was laid a <b>thin</b> <b>coat</b> of Chatterton's Compound {{for the purpose of}} closing up any small flaws or minute holes that might have escaped detection. Then came a second coating of gutta-percha, followed by another coating of compound, and so on alternately until four coats of compound and four of gutta-percha had been laid on.|$|E
6000|$|This part of {{the court}} was crowded with Gallas, some {{lounging}} about, others squatting in the shade under the palace walls. The chiefs were known by their zinc armlets, composed of thin spiral circlets, closely joined, and extending in mass from the wrist almost to the elbow: all appeared to enjoy peculiar privileges,--they carried their long spears, wore their sandals, and walked leisurely about the royal precincts. A delay of half an hour, during which state-affairs were being transacted within, gave me time to inspect a place of which so many and such different accounts are current. The palace itself is, as Clapperton describes the Fellatah Sultan's state-hall, a mere shed, a long, single- storied, windowless barn of rough stone and reddish clay, with no other insignia but a <b>thin</b> <b>coat</b> of whitewash over the door.

60|$|The general {{aspect of}} the region is prepossessing. It is a rolling surface sinking towards the Atlantic, in parts broken by hills and dwarf chains, either {{detached}} or pushed out by the Ghats; a land of short and abnormally broad rivers, which cannot, like the Congo, break through the ridges flanking the Central African basin, and which therefore are mere surface drains of the main ranges. The soil is mostly sandy, but a <b>thin</b> <b>coat</b> of rich vegetable humus, quickened by heavy rains and fiery suns, produces a luxuriant vegetation; whilst the proportion of area actually cultivated is nothing compared with the expanse of bush. In the tall forests, which abound in wild fruits, there are beautiful tracts of clear grassy land, and the woods, clear of undergrowth, resemble an English grove more than a tropical jungle. Horses, which die of the tsetse (Glossina morsitans) {{in the interior of}} North Guinea, and of damp heat at Fernando Po, thrive on its downs and savannahs. The Elais palm is rare, sufficing only for home use. The southern parts, about Cape Lopez and beyond it, resemble the Oil River country in the Biafran Bight: the land is a mass of mangrove swamps, and the climate is unfit for white men.|$|E
