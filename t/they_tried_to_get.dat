5|$|Ammianus {{reports that}} 6,000 Germans perished on the {{battlefield}} and in the pursuit on land. (Libanius gives a figure of 8,000). Thousands more drowned as <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across the river. It is thus likely that {{about a third of}} the German force lost their lives. However, it appears that the majority escaped, including the eight reges alongside Chnodomar. The Romans lost just 243 men, including four tribuni (regimental commanders) of which two were commanders of cataphracti.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} action, the Swedish fleet {{anchored}} off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies {{at least until}} they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty. <b>They</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ahead of Tromp's ships to gain the weather gage by getting between the allies and the shore, and thereby gaining an advantageous tactical position. The Dutch ships of the allied fleet managed to sail close-hauled faster {{than the rest of the}} force and slipped between the Swedes and the coast, taking up the crucial weather gage. Later that morning the two fleets closed in on each other and were soon within firing range.|$|E
5|$|Resuming its {{pursuit of}} the Prussian army, Nansouty's {{division}} was at Potsdam beginning on 25 October, and two days later they participated to the triumphant parade of the Grande Armée in Berlin, before being reviewed by the Emperor on 30 October. Beginning on 7 November, Nansouty and his division were with Murat, heading for the river Vistula, which they crossed on 22 December {{with the rest of}} the cavalry reserve. After a brief and successful cavalry action at the Lapazin bridge, <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the Battle of Golymin in time for the action, but were delayed by the thick mud and by the slower dragoon division that preceded them; they arrived after the battle. The division then took winter quarters in Warsaw, but with Murat on sick leave, Nansouty was soon called to replace him, taking command of Lasalle's light cavalry division and the dragoon divisions of Klein and Milhaud. These divisions were placed in the first line of the army, and Nansouty, although formally placed under the overall command of Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult, had orders to act independently and report directly to the Emperor if any unforeseen and extraordinary events should occur. Nansouty handled this new mission with care, personally patrolling the front line and deciding where to place the pickets of light cavalry that were to cover the infantry outposts.|$|E

But during the season he was still able to play another 28 games for Feyenoord, where he scored a total of 12 goals, and thereby {{qualified}} to become the top scorer of Feyenoord. With his good performance on the field, he helped Feyenoord to achieve a fourth place in the Eredivisie, and qualify the club to play the final in the Dutch cup. The final was played as a double match, and clearly lost with a total score of 6–1 to Ajax, but Tomasson left a mark of his name in the history books, by scoring the one and only goal for Feyenoord. During the World Championships 2010, he was unfortunately hit by another serious injury, that spoiled his first half of the 2010–11 season for Feyenoord. According to the medical staff at Feyenoord, the injury was a lot worse than original thought. When <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him ready for a game at 15 August, the injury had not entirely healed; and after a too hard training session, it therefore reappeared at its previous strength. Based upon further examination of the injury, the coach now feared that Tomasson only would be ready to play his first game of the season in January 2011.|$|E

25|$|With two {{controversial}} races, {{the trip}} to England generated both bad feelings and bad press for Courtney and the Cornell rowing team. The controversial first heat with Leander caused ill will in England with many considering that Cornell acted in an unsportsmanlike manner. Courtney believed he received good treatment from the fans at Henley, and was mistreated by the English press. Courtney also {{had to contend with}} bad press back home. Courtney believed that part of the problem was the rivalry between competing wire services. C. S. Francis, a Cornell alumni who helped raise money for {{the trip to}} England, was also the editor of the Troy Times, which was associated with United Press. Francis stayed with the Cornell team and helped out United Press reporters with information about the team. The Chicago Associated Press wanted to have their own representative. When this was denied, Courtney claimed that <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> even. Courtney insisted that several things that Chicago Associated Press reported, such as troubles and disagreements between members of the team and Mr. Francis' saying the drawing of the Leander rowing club was fixed, were fabrications. After the regatta, the members of the Cornell rowing team released a statement to the press to address the matter of the Leander race. It stated that it was their understanding that under the rules if they stopped they would have been disqualified. They also said they would consider another race with Leander if they would have won.|$|E
25|$|Back in {{the present}} time, Jean is being helped by the nurse Marjorie on trying to recall her name. Marjorie starts {{speaking}} name after name and would not stop even though Jean asked her to. Jean became confused and not realizing what she was doing, lost control of her telekinetic powers. This caught Emma Frost's attention when it registered on Cerebro and went {{to pick her up}} with Cyclops. Meanwhile, Jean is being chased by the MRD in the hospital and, once cornered, ratted out by Marjorie, she unintentionally manifested her enormously powerful Phoenix abilities in the heat of her fear and hopelessness, which caused an intense psionic wave that affected almost the entire city. Archangel, under Mr. Sinister's command, went to capture Jean but Cyclops and Emma intervened. They soon discovered that the reason why Jean was not in mental contact with Scott was because she had no memory of Scott. Archangel pursued them as <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Jean home, Cyclops desperately fought him, but in the end both he and Jean were captured so that Sinister could take samples of their DNA for his experiments. The X-Men came to rescue them and fought the Marauders, but just as Archangel is about to kill Cyclops, Jean manifests her immensely powerful Phoenix Force abilities and defeats him. Scott was able to calm her down and take her to the Institute for rest and promised her that she would regain her memories in conjunction with Emma's help. Everyone at the institute then became unconscious, except Emma, an undercover agent of the Hellfire Club who now had Jean, and therefore the Phoenix Force itself, in their hands.|$|E

500|$|... "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons for which George Meyer was {{credited}} as a writer, and he wrote it together with Sam Simon, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. The episode {{was inspired by the}} French movie Manon of the Spring. The writers were trying to figure out which country the foreign exchange student should come from when they came up with Albania. They had not seen many uses of the country on television and decided to make the episode a tribute to actor John Belushi, who has Albanian roots. The writers did not know much about the country and could not think of a good name for the boy so they gave him the surname Hoxha after the former leader of Albania, Enver Hoxha. They used real Albanian in the scene where Adil says goodbye to his family, and <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the actual language right at Sam Simon's instigation. They also used real French in the scenes of Bart in France. The writers did some research on a certain airport in France for the shots of Bart at the airport in Paris. Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes Skinner, made her first appearance on The Simpsons in this episode, although her voice was a bit different from what the viewers are used to in the later episodes of the show.|$|E
500|$|After Penn State's quadruple {{overtime}} {{win against}} Michigan, <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> healthy, with veterans being held {{out of a}} scrimmage {{that occurred during the}} week of practice, instead working on conditioning. One ESPN writer opined that defensive coordinator John Butler needed to emphasize reworking the secondary, similar to how he had focused on reworking the defensive line, which was successful during the prior week's game. Also, Penn State needed to find additional [...] "playmakers" [...] to supplement Allen Robinson in the receiving game, as well as determine who would lead the running game, as Zach Zwinak had fumbled against Michigan and was taken out, and Bill Belton took over and performed well. Halfway through the season, ESPN.com rated Robinson as the team's offensive MVP, and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones as the team's defensive MVP. The midseason report noted that Penn State had a grueling schedule {{in the second half of}} the season that would test the depth of its defense, limited by lack of scholarship players. Lancaster Newspapers concurred with ESPN, awarding their first half offensive and defensive MVPs to Robinson and Jones respectively as well, adding Sam Ficken as special teams MVP. The column also called sophomore defensive end Deion Barnes the biggest disappointment of the first half, noting that he had even been relegated out of the starting lineup. Quarterback Christian Hackenberg, who had started the first six games and had a [...] "halftime" [...] in the bye week, as there were still six games to play, viewed the bye week as a bonus: [...] "We have a couple more days to prepare, get a good game plan and get ready to go to a hostile environment and play a really good football team. I think it's more of a bonus for us." [...] Coach Bill O'Brien concurred, asserting that Penn State's win against Michigan gave Hackenberg confidence and development.|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, {{to secure}} the {{extradition}} of Einhorn {{and to ensure that}} he was imprisoned for the murder, the Pennsylvania legislature passed in 1998 a bill, nicknamed the [...] "Einhorn Law", allowing defendants convicted in absentia to request another trial.

However, the French court ruled itself unable to evaluate the constitutionality of foreign laws. Another point of friction with the U.SllS was that the court freed Einhorn under police supervision, as French laws put restrictions on remand, the imprisonment of suspects awaiting trial. Einhorn then became the focus of intense surveillance by the French police.|$|E
