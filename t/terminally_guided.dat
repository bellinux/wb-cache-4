2500|$|The DF-16 (CSS-11) is a new-model missile {{that has}} a longer range than the DF-15 (between [...] ). A Taiwan {{official}} announced on March 16, 2011 that Taiwan believed China had begun deploying the missiles. The DF-16 represents an increased threat to Taiwan {{because it is more}} difficult to intercept for anti-ballistic missiles systems such as the MIM-104 Patriot PAC-3. [...] Due to its increased range, the missile has to climb to higher altitudes before descending, giving more time for gravity to accelerate it on re-entry, faster than a PAC-3 could effectively engage it. The DF-16 is an MRBM longer and wider than previous models with a [...] warhead and 5-10 meter accuracy. [...] Its bi-conic warhead structure leaves room for potential growth to include specialized <b>terminally</b> <b>guided</b> and deep penetrating warheads. [...] It is launched from a 10×10 wheeled TEL {{similar to that of the}} DF-21, but instead of a [...] "cold launch" [...] missile storage tube it uses a new protective [...] "shell" [...] to cover the missile.|$|E
50|$|Further {{developed}} variants {{were the}} R-17 (later R-300) Elbrus / SS-1c Scud-B in 1961 and the SS-1d Scud-C in 1965, {{both of which}} could carry either a conventional high-explosive, a 5- to 80-kiloton thermonuclear, or a chemical (thickened VX) warhead. The SS-1e Scud-D variant developed in the 1980s can deliver a <b>terminally</b> <b>guided</b> warhead capable of greater precision.|$|E
50|$|Revealed in 2006, the DF-21C is a <b>terminally</b> <b>guided</b> {{version that}} has a maximum range {{believed}} to be about 1700 km and accuracy estimated to be 50~10 m. The missile was the first dual-capable version, able to be armed with either a nuclear or conventional warhead. In 2010, the DF-21C was being deployed in central Western China.|$|E
50|$|The M712 Copperhead is a 155 mm caliber cannon-launched, fin-stabilized, <b>terminally</b> laser <b>guided,</b> {{explosive}} shell intended to engage hard point targets such as tanks, self-propelled howitzers or other high-value targets. It may be fired from different artillery pieces, {{such as the}} M114, M109, M198, M777 and CAESAR howitzers. The projectile has a minimum range of 3 km and a maximum range of 16 km.|$|R
5000|$|The DF-16 (CSS-11) is a new-model missile {{that has}} a longer range than the DF-15 (between 800-1000 km).

40|$|The paper {{describes}} our {{low power}} microwave coupling measurements on <b>terminally</b> <b>guided</b> missiles {{in the frequency}} range between 10 [...] . 8000 MHz. The plane wave excitation experiments {{have been carried out}} in our field coupling facility, which consists of a asymmetric triplate transmission line with maximum field levels of about 40 V/m in the working volume. As test objects we examined five (semi) autonomous guides missiles. Three of them, former experimental studies from the Diehl company (GE), are presented in this paper. The test objects were positioned in the simulator in three orthogonal orientation with respect to the external field and were not connected to a power supply (inactive condition). In {{order to be able to}} systematically analyze the interaction of the external electromagnetic fields with the avionics and its wiring, we had to divide the investigations into three independent phases, namely, external interaction with the fuselage, mode of penetration to the interior of the m issile and excitation of the electric systems and the cabling...|$|E
