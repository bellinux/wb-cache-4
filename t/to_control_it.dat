While the new processes are more efficient, loading {{is more difficult}} <b>to</b> <b>control</b> (<b>it</b> can take over an hour just to halt the operation), occasionally resulting in overloading the ship. These unexpected shocks, over time, can damage the hull's structural integrity.|$|E
5|$|A graphic {{description}} of the nuckelavee as it appears on land was given by an islander {{who claimed to have}} had a confrontation with it, but accounts describing the details of the creature's appearance are inconsistent. In common with many other sea monsters it is unable to tolerate fresh water, therefore those it is pursuing have only to cross a river or stream to be rid of it. The nuckelavee is kept in confinement during the summer months by the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient Orcadian spirit, and the only one able <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|On the Wednesday at 1:00, Galatasaray fans {{attacked}} {{a bar in}} Strøget in Copenhagen, where some Arsenal fans were located. The Arsenal fans left the bar to confront the Galatasaray fans, {{which led to a}} fight lasting for an hour before riot police managed <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it</b> and arrested four Britons and four Turks. In the fight, Paul Dineen, an Arsenal fan, was stabbed, leading to Arsenal offering fans refunds if {{they did not want to}} fly to the game. Dineen was released from hospital later in the day and attended the match as a guest of the Arsenal directors.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} molluscs, {{particularly}} certain snails and slugs, can be serious crop pests, and when introduced into new environments, can unbalance local ecosystems. One such pest, the giant African snail Achatina fulica, {{has been introduced}} to many parts of Asia, {{as well as to}} many islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean. In the 1990s, this species reached the West Indies. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it</b> by introducing the predatory snail Euglandina rosea proved disastrous, as the predator ignored Achatina fulica and went on to extirpate several native snail species, instead.|$|E
5|$|The Han-era Chinese used {{bronze and}} iron {{to make a}} range of weapons, culinary tools, carpenters' tools and {{domestic}} wares. A significant product of these improved iron-smelting techniques was the manufacture of new agricultural tools. The three-legged iron seed drill, invented by the 2nd century BC, enabled farmers to carefully plant crops in rows instead of casting seeds out by hand. The heavy moldboard iron plow, also invented during the Han dynasty, required only one man <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it,</b> two oxen to pull it. It had three plowshares, a seed box for the drills, a tool which turned down the soil and could sow roughly 45,730 m2 (11.3 acres) of land in a single day.|$|E

5|$|Twenty {{minutes into}} the final {{qualifying}} session, Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger failed to negotiate the Villeneuve curva in his Simtek; he subsequently hit the opposing concrete barrier wall almost head-on and was critically injured. Although the survival cell remained largely intact, {{the force of the}} impact inflicted a basal skull fracture. Ratzenberger, in his first season as a Formula One driver, had run over a kerb at the Acque Minerali chicane on his previous lap, the impact of which is believed to have damaged his front wing. Rather than return to the pitlane, he continued on another fast lap. Travelling at 190mph (306km/h) his car suffered a front wing failure leaving him unable <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle native to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its native range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees native to the area. Outside its native range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees native to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its native range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it</b> by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{met with}} Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace on October 9, 1941, {{to discuss the}} project. He briefed Roosevelt on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee, which had {{concluded}} that an atomic bomb was feasible, and on the German nuclear energy project, about which little was known. Roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program. <b>To</b> <b>control</b> <b>it,</b> he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George Marshall. On Bush's advice, Roosevelt chose the army to run the project rather than the navy, although the navy had shown far more interest in the field, and was already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships. Bush's negative experiences with the Navy had convinced him {{that it would not}} listen to his advice, and could not handle large-scale construction projects.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it,</b> some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to one part of the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it.</b> About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E

It opens as Megatron, having heard legends about Dark Energon, an {{unstable}} substance with the power to corrupt life on the planet, and the Decepticons attack an orbital research station guarded by the Autobot Sky Commander named Starscream and his forces. After fighting through hundreds of Starscream's soldiers; Megatron, Barricade and Brawl reach the Dark Energon manufacturing plant, and Megatron immerses himself in it. Inspired by Megatron's ability to handle the Dark Energon, Starscream asks him to teach him how <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it</b> in return for his service. Shocked by his betrayal, Starscream's colleague and best friend Jetfire escapes the space station, vowing to warn the Autobot leader Zeta Prime.|$|E

5|$|The nuckelavee is {{the most}} malevolent of the demons {{in and around the}} Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it</b> is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee {{confined}} during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, {{with the possible exception of}} kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh flowing water, therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.|$|E
5|$|Fighting in {{the region}} flared once more on 7 August, with new clashes around Hrvatska Kostajnica and an {{artillery}} bombardment of Topusko. On 14 August, the policemen captured in the first attack against the police station in Glina in June were released in a prisoner exchange. Croatian troops and positions held in Hrvatska Kostajnica, {{as well as in}} Petrinja and Sisak, were inspected by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman on 25 August. The Croatian position {{in the region}} deteriorated further on 9 September when Hrvatska Kostajnica was besieged. Three days later, SAO Krajina forces captured the hill that commanded the town, and the Croatian forces started a breakout from Hrvatska Kostajnica. On 13 September, Hrvatska Kostajnica was captured by SAO Krajina forces, after heavy attacks supported by JNA artillery and tanks forced approximately 300 Croatian troops to retreat or surrender. The capture of the town was followed by killings, looting and torching of buildings in the town and the surrounding villages. A total of 67 Croatian troops were captured in the town and shipped to the jail in Glina, but none arrived. The SAO Krajina forces captured Hrvatska Dubica the same day, and of Topusko on 14 September. On 21 September, Petrinja was captured by SAO Krajina forces and the JNA, denying Croatia an important bridgehead on the south (right) bank of the Kupa River. The town's capture came approximately one month after Martić announced SAO Krajina's plans <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|The new senator {{took his}} seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without {{his wife and}} family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson {{immediately}} set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who {{took advantage of the}} provisions of the Homestead Bill {{were more likely to be}} Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee <b>to</b> <b>control</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
