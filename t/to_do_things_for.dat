2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of books (including both of Guralnick's books) on Presley contain details of his many romances and alleged affairs including many while {{he was married to}} Priscilla.

[...] However, according to Alan Fortas, an all-Memphis football halfback who became a bodyguard and part of the Presley entourage, [...] "Elvis needed someone to baby more than he needed a sex partner. He craved the attention of someone who adored him without the threat of sexual pressure, much as a mother would." [...] Furthermore, [...] "Elvis befriended some of the young girls who used to cluster adoringly in his driveway, or outside the fence ... Some of the girls were as young as fourteen. Fortas said they were frequent houseguests who attended his concerts as part of 'Elvis's personal traveling show.' Out in the backyard, they romped with Elvis in the Doughboy pool and challenged him to watermelon-seed spitting contests. They also slipped into his bedroom ... for rambunctious pillow fights. Sometimes they would all sit cross-legged with him on the bed, flipping through his fan magazines or admiring his stuffed-animal collection. Often they would all lie down together and cuddle. But what went on was horseplay, not foreplay." [...] Therefore, Guralnick writes that for [...] "the more experienced girls it wasn't like with other Hollywood stars or even with other more sophisticated boys they knew."
