5|$|Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland {{were both}} under {{contract}} to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer but <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> had not put them to work in films. With their contracts coming up for renewal, feelings among studio executives were that <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> didn't need two girl singers. Every Sunday would serve as an extended screen test to decide which girl's contract would be renewed.|$|E

5|$|Fuqua {{was fired}} on October 1, 2004, four weeks before {{principal}} photography would begin. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> cited creative differences for the director's departure. After Fuqua's departure, <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> met with Peter Berg {{to take over}} directing the film, and Denzel Washington had approved of the choice. Due to the search potentially escalating a budget already in the US$80million range and the difficulty in recouping the amount based on the film's subject matter, Universal canceled production of American Gangster, citing time constraints and creative elements for its reason. The cancellation cost <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> $30million, of which $20million went to Washington and $5million went to del Toro due to their pay or play contracts.|$|E
5|$|In late 2011, Shadows Fall entered <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> {{to begin}} {{recording}} their seventh studio album.

This album is the first to be produced by Adam Dutkiewicz since the band's original studio release, Somber Eyes to the Sky. Fire From the Sky was released on May 15, 2012 through Razor & Tie.|$|E
2500|$|Bernstein {{exaggerated the}} scale of <b>the</b> <b>studios,</b> to make Granada appear a rival to the BBC, and gave <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> only even numbers so that it {{appeared}} there were 12 despite there being six. <b>The</b> <b>studios</b> were operated by 3sixtymedia, [...] ITV Studios' joint-venture company with BBC Resources Ltd from 2000. <b>The</b> <b>studios</b> later hosted shows displaced by the closure of <b>the</b> Yorkshire Television <b>studios</b> in Leeds in 2009, including Channel 4's Countdown.|$|R
50|$|During {{the later}} {{stages of the}} Second World War <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> were requisitioned for other use first by the Germans and later by the Allies. In the post-war years <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> {{returned}} to film production, although this has been sporadic. In the 1960s the producer Carlo Ponti took over <b>the</b> <b>studios.</b>|$|R

5|$|Madness {{were not}} only running their own label at the time, but also had their own {{recording}} studio, Liquidator Studios. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> is still located on Caledonian Road in North London, in {{what was once the}} premises of their fan club office. They built a 24-track professional studio in the cellar. The ground floor has always been an office and chill out area, while a room upstairs is used for song mixing. The band have recorded a number of demos and b-sides at Liquidator, as well as The Madness album in 1988. Other acts to use <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> include Feargal Sharkey, The Farm, Apollo 440, The Potato 5, The Nutty Boys, The Deltones and The Butterfield 8. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> is still regularly used by musicians, including members of Madness themselves.|$|E
5|$|Producer Ross Bell {{met with}} actor Russell Crowe {{to discuss his}} {{candidacy}} {{for the role of}} Tyler Durden. Producer Art Linson, who joined the project late, met with Pitt regarding the same role. Linson was the senior producer of the two, so <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> sought to cast Pitt instead of Crowe. Pitt was looking for a new film after the failure (in the US market) of his 1998 film Meet Joe Black, and <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> believed Fight Club would be more commercially successful with a major star. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> signed Pitt and offered him a US$17.5million salary.|$|E
5|$|Shadow of Mordor was Monolith's first third-person open world {{video game}} for the eighth {{generation}} consoles PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and de Plater considered its development an educational experience for <b>the</b> <b>studio.</b> In Monolith's introduction to the genre, many core mechanics were built from scratch and <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> were inspired by successful video games such as the Batman: Arkham series created by Rocksteady Studios; those games inspired Shadow of Mordor stealth and free-flow combat mechanics. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> considered Rocksteady's games good examples of {{how to handle a}} licensed title.|$|E
50|$|There is {{also some}} {{hesitation}} about Quick & Flupke. Less popular than Tintin, Hergé has not left any clear instructions about {{a continuation of}} the series. Perhaps more to keep <b>the</b> <b>Studios</b> running than for a truly artistic reason, Fanny accepted the project of Johan De Moor, son of Bob and recent arrival in <b>the</b> <b>Studios,</b> to restart <b>the</b> series. He realized an album of new gags while <b>the</b> <b>Studios</b> modernized a number of old gags never before published in colours. Three albums appeared in 1985, the only ones to officially credit <b>the</b> <b>Studios</b> Hergé on <b>the</b> cover and inside. Fanny then announced that the series would end there and that <b>the</b> <b>Studios</b> were going to be closed.|$|R

5|$|The studio's next feature, Big Hero 6, a CGI comedy-adventure film {{inspired}} by the Marvel Comics series of the same name, was released in 2014. For the film, <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> developed new light rendering software called Hyperion, which <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> continued to use on all subsequent films.

5|$|A second {{satellite}} studio, Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida, {{opened in}} 1989 with 40 employees. Its offices were {{located within the}} Disney-MGM Studios theme park at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, and visitors were allowed to tour <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> and observe animators at work. That same year, <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> released The Little Mermaid, which became a keystone achievement in Disney's history as its largest critical and commercial success in decades. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, who'd been co-directors on The Great Mouse Detective, The Little Mermaid earned $84 million at the North American box office, a record for <b>the</b> <b>studio.</b> The film was built around a score from Broadway songwriters Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, {{who was also a}} co-producer and story consultant on the film. The Little Mermaid won two Academy Awards, for Best Original Song and for Best Original Score.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Esher <b>Studios</b> were a British film studio {{located in}} Esher in Surrey. <b>The</b> <b>studios</b> opened in 1913 during the silent era. <b>The</b> <b>studios</b> were {{built by a}} company that {{included}} the director Warwick Buckland, but the failure of their films led to {{the sale of the}} site to Walter West's Broadwest. Broadwest later switched most of its filming to Walthamstow <b>Studios.</b> <b>The</b> <b>studios</b> continued to be used occasionally by independent filmmakers into the 1920s.|$|R

5000|$|After {{meetings}} between IATSE {{and representatives of}} <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> in early September 1946 guaranteed IATSE workers to fill the positions of existing CSU employees, <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> {{came up with a}} plan to force CSU out of <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> once and for all. On September 23, <b>the</b> <b>studios</b> reassigned all <b>the</b> CSU members from construction supervisors, foremen and maintenance men to work as journeymen carpenters on [...] "hot set", a position many of these men hadn't worked in many years and a violation of their job descriptions and cause for a union grievance.|$|R
5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and {{the production}} team became aware of {{a problem with the}} ending. In the original ending, Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages rapidly as he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in at the last minute to save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. <b>The</b> <b>studio</b> liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow enough time for this. Because <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E
5|$|After {{refusing to}} sign a new {{contract}} with RKO, Selznick returned to MGM in 1933, {{this time in the}} position as vice-president in charge of his own unit.

Before entering <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> Sly and Robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea. Blackwell wanted the duo to come up with original material at <b>the</b> <b>studio,</b> as they had been known to do since their early years in Jamaica.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>studios</b> were {{owned by}} ITV Studios and BBC Resources through {{a joint venture}} company, 3SixtyMedia.

5|$|Alan Rickman voiced Absolem, the Caterpillar. Rickman was {{originally}} {{going to have}} his face composited onto the animated Caterpillar.

5|$|All of the {{location}} shots were filmed {{at the beginning of}} the production block. Recording for the first series of six episodes began on location in the first half of April 1992 and were mainly filmed in Chelsea within a short distance from the director's home. The stand-up sequences were filmed in the Café Des Artistes on London's Fulham Road, now known as the Valmont Club, and were shot for the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> audience, with the intention of reshooting them later for the broadcast version. Robert Bathurst has complained that, in order to save £5,000, this promised reshoot never materialised. The close ups of Bathurst were filmed in <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> for the second series, with stock footage of the club's audience reused.|$|E
