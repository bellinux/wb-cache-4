25|$|Novak’s wife, Geraldine, began regular churchgoing in {{the early}} 1990s and {{eventually}} settled on St Patrick’s Catholic Church, Washington, D.C. One day she persuaded Novak, who had not attended religious services for nearly 30 years, to join her at Mass. The celebrant was Fr. Peter Vaghi, whom he had known before Vaghi switched from politics to the priesthood. Novak then started to go to Mass regularly and decided to convert a few years later. According to Novak, the turning point came when he visited Syracuse University to lecture. Before he spoke, he was seated at a dinner <b>table</b> <b>near</b> a female student who wore a cross necklace. Novak {{asked her if she}} was Catholic and she asked him the same. Novak said he had been going to Mass each Sunday for the last four years, but had not converted. “Mr Novak,” the young woman replied, “life is short, but eternity is forever.” That brief sentence chilled Novak, who felt the student had channeled the Holy Spirit. When he got home and told Geraldine, they {{decided it was time to}} convert. In May 1998 Novak was received into the Roman Catholic Church at the age of 67 and became a Traditionalist Catholic. Geraldine was already a Catholic. Al Hunt, Judy Woodruff, Fred Barnes, Margaret Carlson, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Henry Hyde, and Rick Santorum attended Novak’s baptism, with some of them openly crying.|$|E

2500|$|... is {{a variant}} of the English auction in which bids are written on a sheet of paper. At the {{predetermined}} end of the auction, the highest listed bidder wins the item. This auction is often used in charity events, with many items auctioned simultaneously and [...] "closed" [...] at a common finish time. The auction is [...] "silent" [...] in that there is no auctioneer selling individual items, the bidders writing their bids on a bidding sheet often left on a <b>table</b> <b>near</b> the item. At charity auctions, bid sheets usually have a fixed starting amount, predetermined bid increments, and a [...] "guaranteed bid" [...] amount which works the same as a [...] "buy now" [...] amount. Other variations of this type of auction may include sealed bids. The highest bidder pays the price he or she submitted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} sketches feature two men {{inside the}} brothel; a sailor and {{a medical student}} (who was often depicted holding either a book or a skull, causing Barr and others to read the painting as a memento mori, a reminder of death). A trace of their presence {{at a table in}} the center remains: the jutting edge of a <b>table</b> <b>near</b> the bottom of the canvas. The viewer, Steinberg argues, has come to replace the sitting men, forced to confront the gaze of prostitutes head on, invoking readings far more complex than a simple allegory or the autobiographical reading that attempts to understand the work in relation to Picasso's own history with women. A world of meanings then becomes possible, suggesting the work as a meditation on the danger of sex, the [...] "trauma of the gaze" [...] (to use a phrase of Rosalind Krauss's invention), and the threat of violence inherent in the scene and sexual relations at large.|$|E

He made the first prototype in [...]22 calibre; this he tested by shooting rabbits and other small game for the <b>table,</b> <b>near</b> his home on the Berkshire Downs. In 1943, he approached Major Sir Malcolm Campbell of Combined Operations with his prototype; this was informally tested by firing the weapon into the River Thames from the roof of the New Adelphi building in London. This was chosen to discover if people in the street below heard it firing – they did not. Combined Operations officials were impressed with the weapon and requested De Lisle produce a 9mm version. However, this was a failure. A third prototype, using the [...]45 ACP cartridge that was favoured by de Lisle, was much more successful. Tests of this showed the weapon had acceptable accuracy, produced no visible muzzle flash and was inaudible at a distance of [...]|$|E

2500|$|On 1 June 1894, at {{a meeting}} of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at Oxford University, Lodge gave a {{memorial}} lecture on the work of Hertz (recently deceased) and the German physicist's proof of the existence of electromagnetic waves 6 years earlier. Lodge set up a demonstration on the quasi optical nature of [...] "Hertzian waves" [...] (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission. Later in June and on 14 August 1894 he did similar experiments, increasing the distance of transmission up to 55 meters. Lodge used a detector called a coherer (invented by Edouard Branly), a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When the small electrical charge from waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the metal particles would cling together or [...] "" [...] causing the device to become conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it. In Lodge's setup the slight impulses from the coherer were picked up by a mirror galvanometer which would deflect a beam of light being projected on it, giving a visual signal that the impulse was received. After receiving a signal the metal filings in the coherer were broken apart or [...] "decohered" [...] by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the <b>table</b> <b>near</b> by that rang every time a transmission was received. Since this was one year before Marconi's 1895 demonstration of a system for radio wireless telegraphy and contained many of the basic elements that would be used in Marconi's later wireless systems, Lodge's lecture became the focus of priority disputes with the Marconi Company a little over a decade later over invention of wireless telegraphy (radio). At the time of the dispute some, including the physicist John Ambrose Fleming, pointed out that Lodge's lecture was a physics experiment, not a demonstration of telegraphic signaling. Lodge would later work with Alexander Muirhead on the development of devices specifically for wireless telegraphy.|$|E
