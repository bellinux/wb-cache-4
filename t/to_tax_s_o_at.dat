40|$|Abstract Background Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is {{associated}} with enzootic bovine leukosis and {{is closely related to}} human T-cell leukemia virus type I. The Tax protein of BLV is a transcriptional activator of viral replication and a key contributor to oncogenic potential. We previously identified interesting mutant forms of Tax with elevated (Tax D 247 G) or reduced (<b>Tax</b> <b>S</b> 240 P) transactivation effects on BLV replication and propagation. However, the effects of these mutations on functions other than transcriptional activation are unknown. In this study, to identify genes that {{play a role in the}} cascade of signal events regulated by wild-type and mutant Tax proteins, we used a large-scale host cell gene-profiling approach. Results Using a microarray containing approximately 18, 400 human mRNA transcripts, we found several alterations after the expression of Tax proteins in genes involved in many cellular functions such as transcription, signal transduction, cell growth, apoptosis, stress response, and immune response, indicating that Tax protein has multiple biological effects on various cellular environments. We also found that Tax D 247 G strongly regulated more genes involved in transcription, signal transduction, and cell growth functions, contrary <b>to</b> <b>Tax</b> <b>S</b> 240 P, which regulated fewer genes. In addition, the expression of genes related to stress response significantly increased in the presence of <b>Tax</b> <b>S</b> 240 P as compared <b>to</b> wild-type <b>Tax</b> and Tax D 247 G. By contrast, the largest group of downregulated genes was related to immune response, and the majority of these genes belonged to the interferon family. However, no significant difference in the expression level of downregulated genes was observed among the Tax proteins. Finally, the expression of important cellular factors obtained from the human microarray results were validated at the RNA and protein levels by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively, after transfecting Tax proteins into bovine cells and human HeLa cells. Conclusion A comparative analysis of wild-type and mutant Tax proteins indicates that Tax protein exerts a significant impact on cellular functions as diverse as transcription, signal transduction, cell growth, stress response and immune response. Importantly, our study is the first report that shows the extent <b>to</b> which BLV <b>Tax</b> regulates the innate immune response. </p...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{economics}} of crime and compliance as the dominant approach <b>to</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>tax</b> enforcement {{of the past three}} and a half decades. It evaluates the key advantages and disadvantages of the economic model as well as its application <b>to</b> <b>tax.</b> The Article then addresses the multiplicity of taxpayer behavior and the need and prospect of balancing the economically conceived methods of detection and punishment against other, more cooperative, means and developing a broader approach <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> enforcement more generally. The Article explores responsive regulation as a case study for an alternative method <b>to</b> <b>tax</b> enforcement that heavily draws on the economic paradigm but also supplements this approach with other theories, particularly those involving taxpayer identity, conflict escalation, and procedural justice. The Article suggests that this broader, more balanced, and closely tailored method of regulating responsively may enable regulators to draw on the advantages of the economic model while alleviating some of its drawbacks. Responsive regulation may therefore constitute a superior method for regulating tax compliance...|$|R

40|$|The {{interplay between}} the tax {{laws of the}} United States {{and those of the}} {{countries}} of Latin America creates inducements for capital flight. Most Latin American countries tax only income originating within their boundaries. If other countries tax income of foreigners originating within their boundaries as heavily, there is no <b>tax</b> advantage <b>to</b> capital flight. Latin American countries thus depend on other countries for the prevention of tax-induced capital flight and the loss of public revenues, investment funds, and equity it implies. Income from a U. S. trade or business conducted by foreigners, including capital gains, is subject <b>to</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>tax.</b> Capital gains on real estate and dividends are generally taxed, but it may be possible <b>to</b> reduce those <b>taxes</b> substantially. The United States does not tax most other capital gains realized by foreigners. Most interest income paid to foreigners is also exempt from U. <b>S.</b> <b>tax.</b> Thus U. <b>S.</b> <b>tax</b> laws help attract capital from Latin America. A solution to this problem does not seem likely. The United States seems unlikely to reverse its policies. Little is to be gained from adoption of a residence-based approach by Latin American countries. A more radical approach that might be more effective would be a switch to consumption-based direct taxation in which interest income is neither taxed nor allowed as a deduction. This would reduce the attraction of favorable U. <b>S.</b> <b>tax</b> treatment by making equally attractive treatment available at home, but raises troublesome issues of equity, the treatment of foreign investment, and transition. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes a}} Construction Grammar {{account of how}} the meaning of complex constructions, specifically, analytic causatives, emerges from an aggregation of simpler constructions, which individually have fairly abstract semantics, but which in combination encode very specific event types. The constructions investigated are make <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> V, have <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> V, have <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> Ving, get <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, force <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, set <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> (to) Ving, drive <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, move <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, lead <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to V, bring self to V, send <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> Ving, give <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> to understand, and leave <b>s.</b> <b>o.</b> Ving. Three causation event types are posited {{that are relevant to}} an analysis of analytic causative constructions: the MANIPULATE type, where an animate causer intentionally acts on a causee in a way that influences the causee such that he or she performs some activity; the TRIGGER type, where an event occurs which influences a causee such that, given the nature of the causee, the causee will inevitably undergo some process; and the PROMPT type, where an event occurs and a causee perceives this event and decides to react by performing some activity. Any given analytic causative encodes a more specific version of {{one or more of these}} event types. The two simple constructions that contribute most to a given analytic causative are causation verbs (make, have, get, etc.) and sentential complements (the bare infinitive, the to-infinitive, the present participle, etc.). Which event type(s) can be encoded by a given analytic causative does not depend on the causation verb or the sentential complement alone. Instead, particular combinations of the two yield meanings that are either compatible or incompatible with a given event type. Also discussed in the dissertation are the passivization of matrix or embedded clauses in analytic causatives, the relationship between causation verbs and their lexical sources, and the relationship between analytic causatives and transitive constructions with change-of-state or motion verbs...|$|R

From the dependences of the fluorescence decay rates and intensities on the oxygen pressure P O 2, the quenching rate constants k <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 for the excited singlet states S 1 and the fraction f <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 of the S 1 states quenched by oxygen are estimated. At P O 2 = 5 Torr, the k <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 constants vary from 1. 2 × 107 to 3. 0 × 105 s− 1 Torr− 1, while the fraction of the quenched excited singlet states changes from 0. 1 (fluoranthene) to 0. 7 (chrysene) and 0. 8 (pyrene). The dependences of k <b>S</b> <b>O</b> 2 on the photophysical and electron-donor characteristics of the fluorescing compounds are analyzed.

Methods - The 530 outpatients (of age range from 18 to 70 years) with mood and anxious spectrum disorders have been treated by the authors, observed for a seven year period (from January 1995 until May 2003). The patients live in 16 different Italian provinces, but are predominantly from Lombardia and Veneto. Mood disease (includes substance abuse) was present in 72 % of the patients and anxious disease was present in 28 % (DSM-IV diagnoses based upon clinical interviews). The <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> (various heterosexual long-term relationships) of each patient was interviewed for this study to establish a DSM-IV diagnosis of any psychiatric disease that might be present. In cases in which the patient had no <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> or in which information about the <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> was unavailable, that information was collected. As data was collected, 10 item report was completed for each patient and the respective <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> Results - Patients had an <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> with a similar mental disease to their own in 41 % of cases; only 16 % of the patients chose their <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> with no mental disease; 18 % of the patients did not have any <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> and in 26 % of the cases the health of the <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> was unknown. Conclusion - In this multicentre, retrospective, clinical observational study, the corresponding Significant Others of 530 patients with mood and anxious spectrum disorders presented with a high percentage of similar disease to the patients. These findings suggest that it may be appropriate to counsel our patients with these diseases to encourage their respective <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> to undergo a psychiatric evaluation for possible treatable disease: the first objective of an <b>S.</b> <b>O.</b> is preventive care, secondarily the well-being of the partner may improve the treatment outcomes for the patient.
