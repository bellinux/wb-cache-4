5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, {{including those of the}} General Secretary, President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing in order to better understand what they <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and {{played a role in the}} falling out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E

The large tribe had several major divisions and was highly decentralized. Bands among the Oglala and other divisions operated independently, even though some individual leaders, such as Red Cloud, were renowned as warriors and highly respected as leaders.|$|E

Simmons and Stanley met him in a nightclub where he was playing drums. After hearing Criss sing, they <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> being in the band. Criss then auditioned for and later joined the new version of Wicked Lester. The trio focused on a much harder style of rock than Wicked Lester played. They also began experimenting with their image by wearing makeup and various outfits. In November 1972, the trio played a showcase for Epic Records A director Don Ellis, in an effort to secure a record deal.

25|$|The book is in four parts. The {{first part}} deals with Hayakawa's early career and rise to stardom (1914–15), with {{detailed}} information about the themes explored in his early films like The Wrath of the Gods (dealing with Buddhism) and The Cheat (masculinity, violence). The latter film brought him international fame. He married fellow actress Tsuru Aoki in 1914. The second and third parts discuss his films during 1916–18 and 1918–22, respectively, while the final part gives an account of his public image in both America and Japan. When Hayakawa started Haworth Picture Corporation, Japanese residents in America viewed it {{as a symbol of}} his success and entrepreneurship. However, his Americanization was viewed as a national shame in Japan. Americans, meanwhile, <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a role model for Japanese settled in United States and an Americanized and refined Japanese. He left Hollywood in the late 1920s and moved to Europe, where he acted in English and French movies, before returning to Japan where he became a priest. Hayakawa's filmography is also provided in the book, with details about the characters he portrayed. The final chapter gives a detailed account of Hayakawa's role in The Bridge on the River Kwai and discusses the similarities between this role and the role played by Hayakawa in The Cheat. His stage works are also discussed in this chapter.|$|E

When Khánh was himself deposed in 1965, he handed over dossiers proving that the four generals were innocent; the original documents that Khánh claimed proved his accusations of neutralism were neither presented to nor found by anyone. Robert Shaplen said that [...] "the case...continued {{to be one of}} Khánh's biggest embarrassments". Nevertheless, despite what the South Vietnamese public may have <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> Khánh enjoyed continuing confidence among the Americans until the latter part of 1964.|$|E

During these visits, Maria developed an attraction to Nikolai Dmitrievich Demenkov, an officer of the day at the Tsar's Headquarters.

500|$|McAloney's sons {{recalled}} {{that their father}} [...] "was a very knowledgable and intelligent man", who was largely self-taught and a perfectionist in everything he did. But {{he was also a}} strict disciplinarian with a strong sense of duty. Severe punishments were handed out for minor infractions, while McAloney could also be obsessive about the family's finances. Though, as Marion Hebblethwaite suggests, his failed business in the 1930s and the duty he shouldered after his father's death—of helping to financially support his mother and some of his younger siblings—may have been the cause for the latter. He did, however, possess a dry sense of humour that appealed to many of his extended family, and his grandchildren <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> with affection.|$|E

Stewart Gale, who played Izzy Berkowitz, was a non-actor who {{was sitting on the}} back of a truck when Carter passed. Carter convinced Gale's father—who was initially suspicious of the director's credentials—to let Gale travel to Vancouver to take part in the episode. The characters of Izzy's friends were also played by inexperienced actors. One was a snake handler on the set of The X-Files feature film—the shooting of which overlapped that of season five—and the other worked at a Vancouver coffee shop that Carter frequented.|$|E
