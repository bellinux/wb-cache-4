5|$|When {{access to}} digital {{computers}} became {{possible in the}} middle fifties, a few scientists instinctively recognized that a machine that could manipulate numbers could also manipulate symbols and that the manipulation of symbols could well be the essence of human <b>thought.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> {{a new approach to}} creating thinking machines.|$|E
5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) which show signs of muscular stress, and it is <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E
5|$|Despite their successes, {{these three}} dissenters grew {{increasingly}} unpopular as most other delegates {{wanted to bring}} the Convention's business {{to an end and}} return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a bill of rights, which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> nothing more than another delaying tactic.|$|E

5|$|Four {{years after}} {{returning}} to England Honora Sneyd died of consumption at {{six in the morning}} on 1 May 1780 at Bighterton, surrounded by her husband, her youngest sister, Charlotte and a servant. Honora Sneyd was buried in the nearby Weston church where a plaque on the wall (see box) bears witness to her life. Honora Sneyd died within eight years of her marriage to Richard Edgeworth, at almost the same age as her predecessor. The same disease which had taken the life of her mother and five maternal aunts would soon claim the life of her young daughter, Honora Edgeworth (1790), as well as her younger sister, Elizabeth, seven years later (1797), as well as at least two of Elizabeth's children, Charlotte (1807) and Henry (1813). Honora's brother, Lovell was also affected by the consumption. At the time it was <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a hereditary weakness carried by the family.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some feminists {{did not take}} {{to the fact that}} the spots were painted pink, much less that a woman wearing a pink mini skirt was also painted on the spot.

25|$|The 90-minute {{pilot film}} that aired on March 21, 1976, {{received}} enormous ratings. However, the network ABC - who <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the}} worst ideas for a TV series they had ever heard - didn't believe the figures and showed the pilot again a week later to check. The ratings were just as high, even for a repeat screening.|$|E
25|$|Later, the Pentecostal Movement {{emerged from}} the Holiness Movement, {{teaching}} that the believer could, in addition to becoming sanctified, receive power from God and the Gifts of the Holy Spirit.

25|$|Fort Ancient is {{the name}} for a Native American culture that flourished from 1000-1650 CE among a people who {{predominantly}} inhabited land along the Ohio River in areas of modern-day southern Ohio, northern Kentucky and western West Virginia.

25|$|Many in the army, {{such as the}} Levellers led by John Lilburne, <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{not enough}} and demanded full {{political}} equality for all men, leading to tense debates in Putney during the autumn of 1647 between Fairfax, Cromwell and Ireton on the one hand, and radical Levellers like Colonel Rainsborough on the other.

25|$|Auerbach {{would prove}} to be a lasting {{influence}} on Jameson's <b>thought.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> already apparent in the latter's doctoral dissertation, published in 1961 as Sartre: the Origins of a Style. Auerbach's concerns were rooted in the German philological tradition; his works on the history of style analyzed literary form within social history. Jameson would follow in these steps, examining the articulation of poetry, history, philology, and philosophy in the works of Jean-Paul Sartre.|$|E

The same Ipsos poll revealed that 50% thought that nuclear power {{was the best way}} of solving the problem of the greenhouse effect, while 88% <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a major reason for continuing to use nuclear power.|$|E

50|$|Later economists {{determined}} that the relationship of capital and wages was more complex than originally <b>thought.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> because capital {{in a given year}} is not necessarily a fixed amount.

25|$|Charles Cutler Torrey taught Semitic {{languages}} at Yale University. His lasting contribution {{has been}} to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. He <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose. Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. Had he done so, {{he would have had}} to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.|$|E

Richie Benaud has a fine team; he {{inspired}} them in the field and the team brought off some wonderful catches, and generally I thought Australia's out-cricket was some of the best I have seen. We never got the starts we would have liked and injuries on the tour generally affected the batting, but I have no excuses to offer.|$|E
25|$|On 24 October the inquest {{heard that}} Menezes was {{initially}} not {{considered as a}} suspect, and that the police wanted unarmed officers to halt and question him in case he had information about the failed terrorist attack of 21 July 2005. Detective Sergeant Piers Dingemans and a four-man squad were tasked with stopping Menezes for intelligence purposes as he travelled to Stockwell station on a bus. Dingemans told the inquest that his car was behind the bus when he was stood down at 09:55, and said he <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> because Menezes was then considered a suspect.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the voyage}} of the Beagle, Darwin had at his {{disposal}} a considerable collection of specimens and, on 29 October 1836, he was introduced by Charles Lyell to Owen, who agreed to work on fossil bones collected in South America. Owen's subsequent revelations, that the extinct giant creatures were rodents and sloths, showed that they were related to current species in the same locality, rather than being relatives of similarly sized creatures in Africa, as Darwin had originally <b>thought.</b> <b>This</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the many}} influences that led Darwin later to formulate his own ideas on the concept of natural selection.|$|E
25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door when he heard a second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time the Mongols {{imported}} Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. The Mongols were very tolerant of other religions, and never persecuted people on religious grounds. This was associated with their culture and progressive thought. Some historians of the 20th century <b>thought</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a good military strategy: when Genghis was at war with Sultan Muhammad of Khwarezm, other Islamic leaders did not join the fight, as it was seen as a non-holy war between two individuals.|$|E
