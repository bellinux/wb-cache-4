First we will deal with a law about stay of foreigners on the land of Czech Republic and a law about asylum. This norms are thanks to our subject {{one of the most}} important and its necessary to have a good orientation in it. All stays of foreigners in our country is being governed by these laws. Fundamental part of this paper will deal with secondary analysis of data <b>of</b> legal and <b>illegal</b> migration on soil of Czech Republic with regard to EU. A part of this paper dealing with the law about stay of foreigners on the land of Czech Republic will structure for us a different kinds of stays of foreigners in Czech, that will be later splitted up and individually described. In that description we will find information who and under what conditions and from whom one can obtain the permit, what is its purpose, on the other hand also when, why and who can the permit cancel. In this part you can also find repressive steps in case of breaking this law. Also we mention asylum which is often being used to legalize" the stay. With regard to the title of this paper you can also find here a part about European Union that describes and explains some of the basic, historical, functional and other information about EU. Basic information disclose for example the size, number of inhabitants, national anthem and other. Historical information describe the origin and development of EU. Functional information describe basic principles of functionality of different departments of EU. Secondary data analysis <b>of</b> legal and <b>illegal</b> migration <b>of</b> foreigners in Czech with regard to EU is the core of this paper. This part intends to inform the reader in whole about numbers, nationalities and other data about legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> foreigners in Czech Republic with regard to EU. Also here you can find all the data of all categories of foreigners in Czech in the year of entry to EU compared to the numbers of foreigners in Czech in the previous year.

40|$|BACKGROUND: EUROCAT is {{a network}} of {{population-based}} registries for the epidemiologic surveillance of congenital anomalies covering approximately one quarter of births in the European Union. Down syndrome constitutes approximately 8 % of cases of registered congenital anomaly in Europe, with over 7000 affected pregnancies in the 15 current member states of the European Union each year. In this paper, we aim to examine trends in the live birth prevalence of Down syndrome in Europe {{in the light of}} trends in maternal age and in prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: Descriptive analysis of data from 24 EUROCAT registries, covering 8. 3 million births 1980 - 99. Cases include live births, stillbirths and <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy following prenatal diagnosis. RESULTS: Since 1980, the proportion of births to mothers of 35 years of age and over has risen quite dramatically from 8 to 14 % for the European Union as a whole, with steeper rises in some regions. By 1995 - 1999, the proportion of "older" mothers varied between regions from 10 % to 25 %, and the total prevalence (including <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy) of Down syndrome varied from 1 to 3 per 1000 births. Some European regions have shown a more than twofold increase in total prevalence of Down syndrome since 1980. The proportion of cases of Down syndrome which were prenatally diagnosed followed by <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy in 1995 - 1999 varied from 0 % in the three regions of Ireland and Malta where <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy is <b>illegal,</b> to less than 50 % in 14 further regions, to 77 % in Paris. The extent to which <b>terminations</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy were concen trated among older mothers varied between regions. The live birth prevalence has since 1980 increasingly diverged from the rising total prevalence, in some areas remaining approximately stable, in others decreasing over time. CONCLUSION: The rise in average maternal age in Europe has brought with it {{an increase in the number}} of pregnancies affected by Down syndrome. The widespread practice of prenatal screening and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy has in most of the regions covered by EUROCAT counteracted the effect of maternal age in its effect on live birth prevalence. Under the joint influences of maternal age and prenatal screening the pattern of geographic inequalities in Down syndrome live birth prevalence in Europe has also been changed...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To 'map' {{the current}} (2004) state of {{prenatal}} screening in Europe. DESIGN: (i) Survey of country policies and (ii) {{analysis of data}} from EUROCAT (European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies) population-based congenital anomaly registers. SETTING: Europe. POPULATION: Survey of prenatal screening policies in 18 countries and 1. 13 million births in 12 countries in 2002 - 04. METHODS: (i) Questionnaire on national screening policies and <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy for fetal anomaly (TOPFA) laws in 2004. (ii) Analysis of data on prenatal detection and termination for Down's syndrome and neural tube defects (NTDs) using the EUROCAT database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Existence of national prenatal screening policies, legal gestation limit for TOPFA, prenatal detection and termination rates for Down's syndrome and NTD. RESULTS: Ten of the 18 countries had a national country-wide policy for Down's syndrome screening and 14 / 18 for structural anomaly scanning. Sixty-eight percent of Down's syndrome cases (range 0 - 95 %) were detected prenatally, of which 88 % resulted in <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy. Eighty-eight percent (range 25 - 94 %) of cases of NTD were prenatally detected, of which 88 % resulted in termination. Countries with a first-trimester screening policy had the highest proportion of prenatally diagnosed Down's syndrome cases. Countries with no official national Down's syndrome screening or structural anomaly scan policy had the lowest proportion of prenatally diagnosed Down's syndrome and NTD cases. Six of the 18 countries had a legal gestational age limit for TOPFA, and in two countries, <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy was <b>illegal</b> at any gestation. CONCLUSIONS: There are large differences in screening policies between countries in Europe. These, as well as organisational and cultural factors, are associated with wide country variation in prenatal detection rates for Down's syndrome and NTD...|$|R

40|$|Statement {{before the}} Committee on Government Reform, U. S. House of RepresentativesThe {{biological}} weapons {{threat to the}} United States is fundamentally different today than in the period {{during and after the}} completion of the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. At that time, only four countries [...] the Soviet Union, North Korea, Egypt, and probably Israel [...] had biological weapons programs. Among those countries, the Soviet biological weapons program posed the most direct and serious threat to the security of the United States. Based on defector and other information, we now know that the Soviet program was the largest in the world, eventually employing upwards of 60, 000 personnel. R&D and production of biological weapons was undertaken at secret facilities run by the Soviet military and, beginning in the 1970 s, also at civilian facilities under the management of an organization known as Biopreparat. The Soviet program explored the full-spectrum of traditional biological agents, ranging from lethal agents such as anthrax, smallpox and plague to incapacitating agents such as tularemia, glanders and Venezuelan equine encephalitis. It also used genetic engineering techniques to modify traditional agents, for example by imparting antibiotic resistance, and to explore possible cocktails or combinations of agents. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian President Boris Yeltsin ordered the <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> this <b>illegal</b> biological weapons program. In the years that followed, some research and production facilities were deactivated and many others underwent severe personnel and funding cuts. Although the U. S government continues to be concerned that some elements of the former Soviet program remain, {{it is difficult to imagine}} a scenario in which Russia would use this residual capability deliberately against the United States.
