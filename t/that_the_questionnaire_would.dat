If researchers add demographic and other behavioural items such as prior experience with product or category and the standard battery of demographics including: age, gender, occupation, educational attainment etc. then the average questionnaire will have around 60 items.

Wound infections are the second most commonly encountered type of nosocomial, hospital-acquired, infection in the United States (Nichols, 2007 : 8). Owing to <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> wound infection may be induced, such as, by not applying infection control and sterile technique principles in the operating room complex, it is imperative to implement infection control principles and apply sterile technique principles. <b>The</b> researcher noticed <b>that</b> some of <b>the</b> sterile technique principles were not carried out in the operating room complex which lead to the necessity to assess the knowledge of registered nurses’ regarding the implementation of infection control and sterile technique principles. The main goal {{of the study was to}} explore and describe the knowledge of registered nurses’ in two private hospitals in the Nelson Mandela Metropole, related to infection control and sterile technique principles in the operating room complex. Following the analysis of the data, the researcher made recommendations for changes to be made to the existing infection control guidelines in the operating room complex.

The unit managers were excluded from the study, because the researcher utilized their assistance with the handing out and collecting of <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> because, not all scrub nurses were at work at the same time. Firstly a pilot study was conducted (in both private hospitals) to confirm the reliability of the data collection instrument.

The first is a historical review. The second focuses on measurement concerns from the review. The third section reviews the shortcomings of the literature and how some of these shortcomings might be overcome by considering job satisfaction from a psychometric perspective.;The second chapter outlines the development of a measure of job satisfaction, <b>the</b> Satisfaction Research <b>Questionnaire.</b> <b>The</b> development strategy, readability, reliability, and construct validity are described. An argument is presented for a classification of satisfaction based on model profiles. This classification yielded two bipolar modal profiles of scores.;The third chapter presents empirical results from two samples, a cross-Canada study and a student sample. Five content domains were tapped in this study: (a) respondent information about themselves, (b) response information about their occupations for use in monomethod multitrait comparisons, (c) <b>the</b> Satisfaction Research <b>Questionnaire</b> and another measure (the Job Descriptive Index), (d) a measure of the social desirability response bias, and (e) a measure of the Type A behaviour pattern, as a measure of stress.;The results suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Satisfaction Research <b>Questionnaire</b> <b>would</b> be a viable alternative measure of satisfaction. A robust relationship between satisfaction and stress was evidenced. The differences between this research and historical results were attributed to several factors, including, (a) a modern scale construction approach, (b) the use of modal profile analysis, and (c) a multivariate conceptualization of job satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} mental strain in dispatchers of medical emergency services. I focused on covering these questions, the follow-up analysis and description, {{on the basis}} of research. The first objective was to survey opinions of operations centre dispatchers of the mental strain in their work. The next objective was their opinion of the question whether the number of dispatchers on duty in one shift influences their mental strain. My research is based on <b>questionnaire</b> surveying, and <b>the</b> research object covered 40 employees in operational centres all over the Region of South Bohemia. (Note: a nationwide research would be technically hardly realisable, as it is improbable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> sent in <b>would</b> be returned). The introductory chapters contain {{a brief description of the}} operations centre and activities <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dispatchers perform every day, and I try to formulate the principles of <b>the</b> correct communication <b>that</b> should be led in the conversation with the callers on the distress line. I also describe general features of stress, <b>the</b> factors <b>that</b> lead to it, and the states breaking out as a result of its long-term effect on people. Specifically in this thesis, I describe post-traumatic stress disorder and the burn-out syndrome, and I also mention prevention to defend oneself against these risk factors. The second part of the thesis focuses on the results of the research conducted by quantitative technique, by handing out 45 questionnaires, 40 of which were processed after they were sent back. The research and results make up an essential part of the thesis and bring proofs of <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> employees of operations centres undergo mental strain influenced by a number of factors. Some of these factors can be influenced, and becoming aware of these factors, this strain may be at least partially reduced. The thesis also uses the comparative method with the possibility of comparison of the mental strain between individual dispatchers. Last but not least, it contains inspiration for considering these questions, and personal proposals for a positive contribution to lowering this strain and a further development of this problem in general...|$|R

Initial literature synthesis and qualitative research established a conceptual framework for the condition along with a list of symptoms and effects of PMR that patients felt were important to them. These findings were used to derive the candidate items for a patient-completed questionnaire. We aim to establish the face validity of this initial “long form” of a PROM. Methods: People with a current or previous diagnosis of PMR were recruited both from the community and from rheumatology clinics. They were asked to complete <b>the</b> PMR <b>questionnaire</b> along with <b>the</b> QQ- 10 <b>questionnaire,</b> which is a measure used to assess the face validity, feasibility and utility of patient healthcare questionnaires. Results: A total of 28 participants with an age range of 59 – 85 years and a length of time since diagnosis from 4 months to 18 years completed the QQ- 10. The overall mean “value” score was 79 % (SD 12), and the mean “burden” score was 21 % (SD 18).

To what extent are teacher-centred methods of teaching and assessment perceived to be appropriate for biology as a school subject? 2. In what ways do diverse samples of learners perceive how biology should be taught and assessed? 3. Can the learners' perceptions be reconciled to current curricular pronouncements and expectations in biology as a school subject? The study engaged two research paradigms, qualitative and quantitative. The quantitative approach used a survey methodology to gauge if there were differences between learners' preferences. Data were collected by means of two surveys. The total data collected were the responses of 911 biology learners for <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> "How <b>would</b> you prefer to be taught biology?" and 1259 biology learners for <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> "How <b>would</b> you prefer to be assessed in biology?”.

Since the phenomena of fuzziness {{in the real world}} is also closely related with human beings, this paper discusses the application of fuzzy sets in social sciences. An overview of related research is presented, which focuses on an example of social research using a fuzzy model to measure the fuzzy data from a questionnaire. This paper also discusses <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>that</b> is used to collect data by many researchers in social sciences and the elements of fuzziness in it. The vague attributes and labels of a linguistic variable from <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>would</b> be transformed into standard mathematical values. This fuzzy model offers a substantial improvement in data analyses and gives more accurate conclusions. In short, this paper gives a new insight of the vast contribution of fuzzy sets in social sciences...|$|R
