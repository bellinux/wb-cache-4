30|$|Generally, the lurker {{individual}} {{becomes a}} spreader when being {{convinced of the}} truth of <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> and then decides to inform others. However, note that ‘a convinced’ lurker can possibly refuse to spread <b>the</b> <b>rumor,</b> or alternately a spreader can lose interest in <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> and then decide not to spread <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> any further. In these two situations, both become stiflers. A stifler is therefore either an individual who knows <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> but who is not spreading it or a spreader who, with time, loses interest {{and is no longer}} spreading <b>the</b> <b>rumor.</b> Furthermore, one can notice that the tendency of accepting a rumor as credible information differs from one lurker to another. This {{can be explained by the}} strong background knowledge that some of the lurker individuals possess. These types of lurker individuals, once aware of <b>the</b> <b>rumor,</b> generally raise some reasonable questions and/or logical arguments in order to assess the credibility or the validity of <b>the</b> <b>rumor.</b> Science education is therefore among the factors that also contribute to the cessation of a rumor spreading and is an important aspect that has not been considered in previous studies.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rumor</b> is {{propagated}} {{through the}} population by pair-wise contacts between spreaders {{and others in}} the population.

5|$|Following Radama II's {{apparent}} death, rumors {{spread that}} he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived as his body was being transported to Ilafy for interment in his designated tomb. French historian Delval presents evidence that supports a scenario wherein the group tasked with carrying Radama's body to Ilafy became frightened as the king began to revive, prompting them to abandon the body and then falsely maintain that they had completed their task to place him in the tomb. Within months after his reported death, rumors began circulating that Radama was alive, residing {{on the west coast}} of the island and was amassing supporters for a political comeback. <b>The</b> <b>rumors</b> persisted to the point of causing political turmoil in Antananarivo. These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others. Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded.

According to evidence in Delval's study, Radama may indeed have survived and, failing to regain the throne, lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island.|$|E

40|$|In earlier rumor {{spreading}} models, at {{each time}} step nodes contact {{all of their}} neighbors. In more realistic scenario {{it is possible that}} a node may contact only some of its neighbors to spread <b>the</b> <b>rumor.</b> Therefore it is must in real world complex networks, <b>the</b> classic <b>rumor</b> spreading model need to be modified to consider <b>the</b> dependence of <b>rumor</b> spread rate on the degree of the spreader and the informed nodes. We have given a modified rumor spreading model to accommodate these facts. This new model, has been studied for rumor spreading in complex networks in this work. Nonlinear rumor spread exponent α and degree dependent tie strength exponent β in any complex network gives rumor threshold as some finite value. In the present work, <b>the</b> modified <b>rumor</b> spreading model has been studied in scale free networks. It is also found that if α and β parameters are tuned to appropriate value, <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> threshold becomes independent of network size. In any social network, rumors can spread may have undesirable effect. One of the possible solutions to control rumor spread, is to inoculate a certain fraction of nodes against <b>rumors.</b> <b>The</b> inoculation can be done randomly or in a targeted fashion. We have used modified rumor spreading model over scale free networks to investigate the efficacy of inoculation. Random and targeted inoculation schemes have been applied. It has been observed that rumor threshold in random inoculation scheme is greater than <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> threshold in <b>the</b> model without any inoculation scheme.

40|$|Restricted until 5 Aug. 2010. This {{dissertation}} {{looks into}} rumor propagation mechanisms, and the {{mechanisms by which}} rumor refutations are processed. Prior research that associate <b>the</b> factors with <b>rumor</b> propagation are: <b>the</b> importance of <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> content, rumor target's identification with <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> object, belief congruence, degree of belief in <b>the</b> <b>rumor,</b> rumor valence and rumor induced emotions.; To further <b>the</b> understanding of <b>rumor</b> propagation, we consider an integrative framework, derived from the Appraisal Theory of Emotions, which allows us to integrate a number of such factors, namely, rumor importance, identification, and belief congruence and into {{an understanding of how}} rumor is spread. We use this framework to generate hypotheses regarding <b>the</b> likelihood of <b>rumor</b> transmission for individuals with different levels of identification [...] Strong Identifiers and Weak Identifiers. While both Strong and Weak Identifiers are driven by the instinct of self preference, this drive expresses itself differently depending on the recipient's degree of identification with <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> object. For Strong Identifiers, self preference is expressed by a need to cope with <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> induced emotions while, for Weak Identifiers, self preference is expressed by a need to be in social harmony with the people around them.; This dissertation also looks at mechanisms by which rumor refutations are processed. We use the Heuristic Systematic Model to study rumor refutation mechanisms associated with characteristics of the Strong Identifier. Strong Identifiers process information heuristically when a negative rumor is refuted. However when a positive rumor is refuted, Strong Identifiers, given their desire to 'preserve' the favorable image of the object they identify with, are likely to process <b>the</b> positive <b>rumor</b> information of low importance systematically but a positive rumor of high importance heuristically. A negative rumor is heuristically processed because of the intial disbelief in <b>the</b> <b>rumor...</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{threshold}} R_ 0 {{is increasing}} with <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> propagation coefficient β, the believe and spread rate θ. If there exist many active members who believe and spread <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> actively, then β and θ will be sufficiently large.

Conversely, if the managers induct public views and remind more carefully {{the public of}} not relying on <b>rumors,</b> increasing <b>the</b> ability to distinguish, then the parameters β and θ will become smaller, and make the threshold R_ 0 < 1, and <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> will ‘die out’.

When R_ 0 > 1, y(t) always approaches the rumor-endemic value, y^∗=θα w^∗/λα w^∗+(γ+ 1), where w^∗=βθα-(α+ 1)(γ+ 1)/α (α+ 1)(βθ+λ).|$|R
40|$|We study gossip {{algorithms}} for <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading {{problem which}} asks one node {{to deliver a}} rumor to all nodes in an unknown network, and every node is only allowed to call one neighbor in each round. In this work we introduce two fundamentally new techniques in studying <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading problem: First, we establish a new connection between <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading process in an arbitrary graph and certain Markov chains. While most previous work analyzed <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading time in general graphs by studying {{the rate of the}} number of (un-) informed nodes after every round, we show that the mixing time of a certain Markov chain suffices to bound <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading time in an arbitrary graph. Second, we construct a reduction from rumor spreading processes to branching programs. This reduction gives us a general framework to derandomize <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading and other gossip processes. In particular, we show that, for any n-vertex expander graph, there is a protocol which informs every node in O(log n) rounds with high probability, and uses O (log n · log log n) random bits in total. The runtime of our protocol is tight, and the randomness requirement of O (log n· log log n) random bits almost matches the lower bound of Ω(log n) random bits. We further show that, for many graph families (defined with respect to the expansion and the degree), O (poly log n) random bits in total suffice for fast rumor spreading. These results give us an almost complete understanding of the role of randomness in <b>the</b> <b>rumor</b> spreading process, which was extensively studied over the past years...|$|R
