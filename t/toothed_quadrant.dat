50|$|The ship's stockless bower anchors weighed 10 tons, {{attached}} to 125 ton, 330 fathom chains all manufactured by N. Hingley & Sons Ltd. The steam capstans {{to raise them}} were constructed by Napier Brothers Ltd, of Glasgow. The turbines were 25 ft long with 12 ft diameter rotors, the large diameter necessary because of the relatively low speeds at which they operated. The rotors were constructed on site, while the casings and shafting was constructed in John Brown's Atlas works in Sheffield. The machinery to drive the 56 ton rudder was constructed by Brown Brothers of Edinburgh. A main steering engine drove the rudder through worm gear and clutch operating on a <b>toothed</b> <b>quadrant</b> rack, with a reserve engine operating separately on the rack via a chain drive for emergency use. The 17 ft three bladed propellers were fitted and then cased in wood to protect them during the launch.|$|E
