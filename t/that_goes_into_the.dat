5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may {{be taken}} in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bloodstream. Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but {{little is known about}} absorption rates in children.|$|E

25|$|Acute MI (as {{may occur}} {{due to the}} sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or {{papillary}} muscle) causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> aorta (the forward cardiac output or forward stroke volume) but also the blood that regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume {{is known as the}} total stroke volume of the left ventricle.|$|E

500|$|Originally titled as [...] "What Doesn't Kill You", [...] "Stronger" [...] {{was written}} by Jörgen Elofsson, Ali Tamposi, David Gamson, and Greg Kurstin in September 2010. In an {{interview}} with American Songwriter, Tamposi revealed that the song {{was inspired by the}} Friedrich Nietzsche adage ("That which does not kill us makes us stronger") that her mother told her as advice. Although Tamposi found the phrase as saccharine, she submitted it as an idea to Elofsson and Gamson during their writing sessions. Elofsson originally intended [...] "Stronger" [...] for Leona Lewis, who turned it down in the process. Tamposi's manager, Tom Maffei, then had one of his producers, Matty Trump, to produce a demo track later to be pitched to RCA A executive Jeff Aldrich, who later gave the song to Clarkson. Tamposi revealed that Clarkson had also altered a lyric from the track. Aldrich had then commissioned Greg Kurstin, whom Clarkson wanted to collaborate with, to produce and add additional writing to the final version. Kurstin recalled, [...] "I rethought the music part of it, I guess. It had a different tempo, beat, chords, and I kinda just came up with that guitar riff <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> verse, {{and that was the first}} thing that I kinda contributed just changed the feel of the song." [...] The song's uplifting theme of empowerment led Clarkson to name her fifth studio album Stronger. saying that it is one of her favorite songs in the album, she said, [...] "Everybody loves the message 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.' It's a perfect representation of my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|To {{handle the}} case where both mean and {{variance}} are unknown, we could place independent priors over the mean and variance, with fixed estimates of the average mean, total variance, number of data points used to compute the variance prior, and sum of squared deviations. [...] Note however that in reality, the total variance of the mean depends on the unknown variance, and the sum of squared deviations <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> variance prior (appears to) depend on the unknown mean. [...] In practice, the latter dependence is relatively unimportant: Shifting the actual mean shifts the generated points by an equal amount, and on average the squared deviations will remain the same. [...] This is not the case, however, with the total variance of the mean: As the unknown variance increases, the total variance of the mean will increase proportionately, {{and we would like}} to capture this dependence.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, woodcarving was {{a solitary}} {{activity}} with all aspects done by one person, usually a male. As sales soared in the 1980s, the work {{began to be}} shared among family members. Women and children help mostly with sanding and painting, leaving men to contribute {{less than half of}} the work <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> figures. Despite this, pieces are still referred to as the work of one person, usually the male carver. There are exceptions to this. There are men who paint better than they carve and in the community of San Pedro Taviche, women collect and carve wood about as often as the men. [...] In most cases, all the work on pieces is done by family members. Families may hire other relatives or strangers if faced with a large order. However, only the most established of carving families can have any permanent outside help and a number of these refuse to hire outsiders.|$|E
2500|$|While Nancy is with Mitzeee, {{she gets}} [...] "sudden twinges" [...] which {{she does not}} worry about until [...] "the contractions really start to kick in. She's only 26 weeks' {{pregnant}} and she's totally terrified". Nancy calls Darren who takes her to hospital where she is [...] "doubled over in agony". The doctors try giving Nancy medication to stop the contractions which fails. Nancy has an emergency Caesarean and gives birth to a boy who the doctors are unsure if he will [...] "make it through the night" [...] which Fox said is a [...] "terrible time for Nancy and Darren". Darren blames Nancy for their babies premature birth, Dawson explained that this is because he believes that Nancy did not [...] "take proper care of herself during her pregnancy". He said that Nancy seemed to be preoccupied with Mitzeee and [...] "wouldn't listen {{to him when he}} told her to back off. In his heart of hearts, Darren feels she's responsible for all of this". Fox revealed that she researched premature births, reading up on the subject and attending a meeting at the Liverpool Women's Hospital along with a writer for the serial. There, Fox spoke to a midwife who deals specifically with premature babies, which she found [...] "really helpful". The actress added that although the serial tried to stay true to life there is [...] "a bit of artistic licence <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> scripts, to make things more dramatic or to let the story flow better". On how Nancy would behave as a mother, Fox said: [...] "I imagine that she'll {{be a bit of a}} neurotic mother, particularly as the baby has arrived so early. I think she'd want to wrap him up in cotton wool and not let him out of her sight".|$|E

Suddenly his face gleamed and his muscles grew tense; he ducked his head, clutched his gun with both hands, and stood still. Then watching keenly, he came on down the steps into the park, and still holding his gun in both hands, crept rather than walked towards the jungle of bracken.|$|E
6000|$|So California and I took a steamboat, {{and upon}} a sumptuous {{blue and gold}} morning steered up the Willamette River, on which Portland stands, into the great Columbia--the river that brings the salmon <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tin that is emptied into the dish when the extra guest arrives in India. California {{introduced}} me to the boat and the scenery, showed me the [...] "texas," [...] {{the difference between a}} [...] "tow-head" [...] and a [...] "sawyer," [...] and the precise nature of a [...] "slue." [...] All I remember is a delightful feeling that Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn and Mississippi Pilot were quite true, and that I could almost recognise the very reaches down which Huck and Jim had drifted. We were on the border line between Oregon State and Washington Territory, but that didn't matter. The Columbia was the Mississippi so far as I was concerned. We ran along the sides of wooded islands whose banks were caving in with perpetual smashes, and we skipped from one side to another of the mile-wide stream in search of a channel, exactly like a Mississippi steamer, and when we wanted to pick up or set down a passenger we chose a soft and safe place on the shore and ran our very snub nose against it. California spoke to each new passenger as he came aboard and told me the man's birthplace. A long-haired tender of kine crashed out of the underwood, waved his hat, and was taken aboard forthwith. [...] "South Carolina," [...] said California, almost without looking at him. [...] "When he talks you will hear a softer dialect than mine." [...] And it befell as he said: whereat I marvelled, and California chuckled. Every island in the river carried fields of rich wheat, orchards, and a white, wooden house; or else, if the pines grew very thickly, a sawmill, the tremulous whine of whose saws flickered across the water like the drone of a tired bee. From remarks he let fall I gathered that California owned timber ships and dealt in lumber, had ranches too, a partner, and everything handsome about him; in addition to a chequered career of some thirty-five years. But he looked almost as disreputable a loafer as I.|$|E
