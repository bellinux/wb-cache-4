2500|$|The HKS 700E has dual {{capacitor}} discharge ignition, dual carburetors and electric start. [...] The engine is mainly air-cooled, but with oil-cooled cylinder heads. The OHV pushrod engine has four valves per cylinder, and nickel-ceramic coated cylinder bores. Lubrication is dry sump, with a <b>trochoid</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned <b>trochoid</b> <b>pump.</b> Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple blanking plug at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|E

The data extracted from the SolidWorks ® model are input to a hydraulic analysis software AMESim ® model todetermine the design factors that can influence the properties of a <b>trochoid</b> <b>pump.</b> On {{the basis of the}} simulation results, this paper proposesa methodto reduce the flow loss by adjusting the outlet angle of the <b>trochoid</b> <b>pump.</b> This proposal was verified by using actual experimental results, which confirmed that adjusting the outlet angle can increase the flow rate. Hence,the results presented in this paper can contribute to the prototyping of a <b>trochoid</b> <b>pump</b> by reducing the cost associated with a trial-and-error design...|$|E
