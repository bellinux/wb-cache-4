40|$|Streptococci were {{isolated}} from freshwater and marine aquaculture environments {{by use of}} a new developed selective medium, STAN agar. STAN agar is composed of BHI agar with sodium azide and <b>thallous</b> <b>sulphate</b> as selective agents. The deposits in tilapia culture ponds contained 10 ^{ 2 }- 10 ^{ 3 } cfu/g of streptococci. For the raw-fish diets fed to cultured flounder and yellowtail, viable counts of streptococci were 10 ^{ 2 } cfu/g at first and increased to 10 ^{ 4 } cfu/g after they were dipped in sea water for 24 h. Streptococcus strains isolated from freshwater and marine environments were nonhemolytic, did not hydrolyse casein, starch and chitin, and ferment glucose, fructose, sucrose, trehalose and salicin. Marine isolates were different from freshwater ones in the fermentation of some carbohydrates including lactose, galactose, raffinose and arabinose...|$|E
