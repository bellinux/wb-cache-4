2500|$|The {{mouthpiece}} is a {{part that}} the user grips in the mouth to make a watertight seal. It is a short flattened-oval tube <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> between the lips, with a curved flange that fits between the lips and the teeth and gums. On the inner ends of the flange there are two tabs with enlarged ends, which are gripped between the teeth. Most recreational diving regulators are fitted with a mouthpiece. In twin-hose regulators and rebreathers, [...] "mouthpiece" [...] may refer to the whole assembly between the two flexible tubes. A mouthpiece prevents clear speech, so a full-face mask is preferred where voice communication is needed.|$|E
2500|$|While sexual {{relationships}} with pupils is illegal in the U.S., {{this is not}} the case in higher education. Jane Gallop argues that students learn more effectively in a sexually charged atmosphere. In her book, she describes the separate occasions she slept with two male professors on her dissertation committee, and when she first began sleeping with her own students as an assistant professor. (Gallop, 1997). In her September 2001 essay in Harper's Magazine, The Higher Yearning, academic Christina Nehring celebrated the educative nature of such {{sexual relationships}}: [...] "Teacher-student chemistry is what fires much of the best work <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> universities, even today".|$|E

60|$|Now, in {{the whale}} ship, {{it is not}} every one <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> the boats. Some few hands are {{reserved}} called shipkeepers, whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing, these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats' crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly.|$|E
60|$|Although he was {{bothered with}} a {{distressing}} headache, {{and found that}} a branch had scored his cheek, nevertheless, when he had fitted on another nut from the tool-box in the waggon, he drove ahead, reaching Prospect almost as worn out as the team. Still, after a bite of food, he climbed up into the driving-seat of the big gang-plough. Summer is short in the Northwest, and the wheat <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> late runs a risk of freezing, so he needed in his struggle the efforts of every man he could get. He drove the threefold furrow through the ripping sod until at last the copper sun dipped below the prairie's verge. Then, leaving his team to the men, {{he went back to}} the house, too weary to carry himself erect. The birches swayed in a cold green transparency, the crisp air had vim in it, but the weary man noticed nothing as he plodded, heavy-eyed, through the crackling stubble.|$|E

6000|$|Gipsy Marks.--When gipsies travel, {{the party}} <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> advance leaves marks at cross-roads, {{in order to}} guide those who follow. These marks are called [...] "patterans;" [...] there are three patterans in common use. One is to pluck three large handfuls of grass and to throw them on the ground, at a short {{distance}} from one another, in the direction taken; another is, to draw a cross on the ground, with one arm much longer than the rest, as a pointer--a cross is better than any other simple mark, for it catches many different lights. (In marking a road, do not be content with marking the dust--an hour's breeze or a shower will efface it; but take a tent-peg, or sharpened stick, and fairly break into the surface, and your mark will be surprisingly durable.) The third of the gipsy patterans is of especial use in the dark: a cleft stick is planted by the road-side, close to the hedge, and in the cleft, is an arm like a signpost. The gipsies feel for this at cross-roads, searching for it on the left-hand side. (Borrow's 'Zincali.') A twig, stripped bare, with the exception of two or three leaves at its end, is sometimes laid on the road, with its bared end pointing forwards.|$|E

For two years I've watched men eat, eat, eat, until they represent nothing on earth to me but ruminant bipeds. They're absolutely nothing but something <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> front of a knife and fork and plate at the table. They're fixed that way in my mind and memory. I've tried to overcome it, but I can't. I've heard girls rave about their sweethearts, but I never could understand it. A man and a sausage grinder and a pantry awake in me exactly the same sentiments. I went to a matinee once to see an actor the girls were crazy about. I got interested enough to wonder whether he liked his steak rare, medium, or well done, and his eggs over or straight up. That was all. No, Jeff; I'll marry no man and see him sit at the breakfast table and eat, and come back to dinner and eat, and happen in again at supper to eat, eat, eat.' ...|$|E
