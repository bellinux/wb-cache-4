5|$|American {{officials}} later {{acknowledged that}} the evidence cited by the U.S. in its rationale for the Al-Shifa strike was weaker than initially believed: The facility had not been involved in chemical weapons production, and was not connected <b>to</b> <b>bin</b> Laden. The $30 million Al-Shifa factory, which had a $199,000 contract with the UN under the Oil-for-Food Programme, employed 300 Sudanese and provided {{over half of the}} country's pharmaceuticals, including medicines for malaria, diabetes, gonorrhea, and tuberculosis. A Sudanese named Salah Idris purchased the plant in March 1998; while the CIA later said it found financial ties between Idris and the bin Laden-linked terrorist group Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the agency had been unaware at the time that Idris owned the Al-Shifa facility. Idris later denied any links <b>to</b> <b>bin</b> Laden and sued to recover $24 million in funds frozen by the U.S., {{as well as for the}} damage to his factory. Idris hired investigations firm Kroll Inc., which reported in February 1999 that neither Idris nor Al-Shifa was connected to terrorism.|$|E
5|$|According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a {{prisoner}} named Hassan Ghul revealed that bin Laden {{relied on a}} trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti was close <b>to</b> <b>bin</b> Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that {{he was part of}} bin Laden's inner circle.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 American {{intelligence}} analyst Raelynn Hillhouse {{wrote that}} according to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. had been tipped-off <b>to</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward. According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S. raid, and the original plan was to kill – not capture – bin Laden. Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis. According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance {{on their way to}} and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid.|$|E

5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior <b>to</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. Any evidence of bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{probably}} in 1998, al-Nashiri {{is alleged to}} have joined al-Qaeda, reporting directly <b>to</b> <b>bin</b> Laden. In late 1998, he conceived of a plot to attack a U.S. vessel using a boat full of explosives. Bin Laden personally approved of the plan, and provided money for it. First, al-Nashiri allegedly attempted to attack the USS The Sullivans {{as a part of the}} 2000 millennium attack plots, but the boat he used was overloaded with explosives and began to sink.|$|E
25|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>bin</b> Laden's {{continuous}} verbal {{assault on}} King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, on March 5, 1994, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan demanding bin Laden's passport; bin Laden's Saudi citizenship was also revoked.

25|$|Bin Laden's {{location}} and {{state of health}} were a continuing topic of speculation since his disappearance from Tora Bora. It has become clear {{that most of these}} rumors and speculation were not based on fact. First, rumors surfaced that bin Laden was killed or fatally injured during U.S. bombardments, most notably near Tora Bora, or that he died of natural causes. According to Gary Berntsen, in his 2005 book, , a number of al-Qaeda detainees later confirmed that bin Laden had escaped Tora Bora into Pakistan via an eastern route through snow-covered mountains in the area of Parachinar, Pakistan. The media reported that bin Laden suffered from a kidney disorder requiring him to have access to advanced medical facilities, possibly kidney dialysis.

500|$|In {{a second}} fatwā in 1998, bin Laden {{outlined}} his objections to American foreign policy {{with respect to}} Israel, {{as well as the}} continued presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia after the Gulf War.

[...] Bergen further claimed that Curtis's arguments serve as a defence of Bush's failure to capture bin Laden in the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and his ignoring warnings of a terrorist attack prior to 11 September.|$|E
