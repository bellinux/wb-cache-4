The predominant energy absorption mechanisms of laminates under high-velocity impact are related to kinetic energy of moving a cone formed on a distal side of the target, frictional losses during penetration and energy absorption related to failure modes, such as shear plugging, <b>tensile</b> <b>fibre</b> failure of primary yarns, fibre debonding, fibre pull-out, matrix cracking (intra-laminar) and inter-laminar delamination. For braided composites, although advanced numerical models were employed to predict their mechanical properties and failure modes, some of them are not suitable to study their ballistic behaviour because of high strain rates and high pressure conditions in the impact area in high velocity-impacts. It is well known that carbon/epoxy composites exhibit significant strain-rate sensitivity under such conditions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNickel-based {{superalloys}} {{are used}} in high strength, high-value applications, such as gas turbine discs in aero engines. In these applications {{the integrity of the}} disc is critical and therefore understanding crack initiation mechanisms is of high importance. With an increasing trend towards powder metallurgy routes for discs, sometimes unwanted non-metallic inclusions are introduced during manufacture. These inclusions vary in size from ∼ 10  μm to 200  μm which is comparable to the grain size of the nickel-based superalloys. Cracks often initiate near these inclusions, and the precise size, shape, location and path of these cracks are microstructurally sensitive. In this study, we focus on crack initiation at the microstructural length scale using a controlled three-point bend test, with the inclusion deliberately located within the <b>tensile</b> <b>fibre</b> of the beam. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is combined with high spatial resolution digital image correlation (HR-DIC) to explore full field plastic strain distributions, together with finite element modelling, to understand the micro-crack nucleation mechanisms. This full field information and controlled sample geometry enable us to systematically test crack nucleation criteria. We find that a combined stored energy and dislocation density provide promising results.

The composites with a [0 °r/ 90 °] lay-up had an out-of-plane compressive strength that was dictated by in-plane <b>tensile</b> <b>fibre</b> fracture. By contrast, the out-of-plane compressive strength of the uni-directional composites was significantly lower and was not associated with fibre fracture. The peak strength of the [0 °/ 90 °] composites increased with increasing in-plane specimen dimensions and was dependent on the matrix and fibre strength {{as well as on the}} ply thickness. A combination of micro X-ray tomography and local pressure measurements revealed the existence of a shear-lag zone at the periphery of the specimens. Finite Element (FE) and analytical micromechanical models predict the compressive composite response and reveal that out-of-plane compression generates tensile stresses along the fibres due to shear-lag loading between the alternating 0 ° and 90 ° plies. Moreover, the compressive strength data suggests that the shear strength of Dyneema®Dyneema® is pressure sensitive, and this pressure sensitivity is quantified by comparing predictions with experimental measurements of the out-of-plane compressive strength.

The MoSi 2 matrix microstructure was typical of a splat quenched plasma spray processed material with porosity < 5 %. Matrix cracking occurred between fibres and was attributed primarily to differences in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of MoSi 2, SiC and the steel substrate. Evidence for the formation of SiC by interfacial reaction between the fibre C coating and the MoSi 2 matrix has been observed, although this reaction was not uniform at all points on the interface. SIC formation has been suggested to affect the bonding between the fibre and the matrix and the subsequent mechanical properties of consolidated material. Pest oxidation bf the MoSi 2 matrix has been used to extract the SiC fibres after plasma spraying to assess the effect of process induced damage on the fiber properties in the matrix. However, the extraction process itself caused some changes to fibre properties which made analysis problematical. The similar to 3. 1 GPa as-supplied mean <b>tensile</b> <b>fibre</b> strength was retained during plasma spraying, but the Weibull modulus reduced from 25 to 11, i. e. the spread of fibre strengths increased.

The fibre surface integrity was affected by both oxidation effects during extraction and by the impact of MoSi 2 droplets during spraying. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation into the}} dynamic response of 3 D orthogonal woven carbon composites undergoing soft impact. Composite beams of two different fibre architectures, varying only by the density of through-thickness reinforcement, were centrally impacted by metallic foam projectiles. Using high speed photography, the centre-point back-face deflection was measured {{as a function of}} projectile impulse. Qualitative comparisons are made with a similar uni-directional laminate material. No visible delamination occurred in orthogonal 3 D woven samples, and beam failure was caused by <b>tensile</b> <b>fibre</b> fracture at the gripped ends. This contrasts with uni-direction carbon fibre laminates, which exhibit a combination of wide-spread delamination and tensile fracture. Post-impact clamped-clamped beam bending tests were undertaken across the range of impact velocities tested in order to investigate any internal damage within the material. Increasing impact velocity caused a reduction of beam stiffness: this phenomenon was more pronounced in composites with a higher density of through-thickness reinforcement. A three-dimensional finite element modelling strategy is presented and validated, showing excellent agreement with the experiment in terms of back-face deflection and damage mechanisms. The numerical analyses confirm negligible influence from though-thickness reinforcement in regards to back-face deflection, but significant reductions in delamination damage propagation. Finite element modelling was used to demonstrate the significant structural enhancements provided by the through-the-thickness weave. The contributions to the field made by this research include the characterisation of 3 D woven composite materials under high-speed soft impact, and the demonstration of how established finite element modelling methodologies {{can be applied to the}} simulation of orthogonal woven textile composite materials undergoing soft impact loading...|$|E

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (FRPs) generally {{consist of}} different phases including the matrix phase, the fibres as the dispersed phase and the fibre/matrix interphase. Of great {{importance for the}} FRP properties such as mechanical strength is the contact between the fibre and the matrix. In this work modification of the fibre surface was investigated with the aim to strengthen the contact between fibre and matrix by increasing the surface of fibre and matrix as well as using the atomic forces through nanoparticles. These modifications are to enhance properties of the composite such as tensile strength and interfacial strength. One approach used to achieve this was the modification of the fibre surface by coating it with a resin containing nanoscaled particles including purified carbon nanotubes (CNTs), carbon nanotubes functionalized with carboxyl groups or amino {{groups as well as}} boehmite nanoparticles functionalized with taurine.

Compacted soils used in geotechnical constructions such as dams and clayey liners in waste containment facilities can suffer from cracking due to tensile failure. In order to increase soil <b>tensile</b> strength, discrete <b>fibre</b> reinforcement technique was proposed. An innovative tensile apparatus was developed to determine the tensile strength characteristics of fibre reinforced soil. The effects of fibre content, dry density and water content on the tensile strength were studied. The {{results indicate that the}} developed test apparatus was applicable in determining tensile strength of soils. Fibre inclusion can significantly increase soil tensile strength and soil tensile failure ductility. The tensile strength basically increases with increasing fibre content. As the fibre content increases from 0 % to 0. 2 %, the tensile strength increases by 65. 7 %. The <b>tensile</b> strength of <b>fibre</b> reinforced soil increases with increasing dry density and decreases with decreasing water content.

The evolution of strengthening techniques has consisted in the development of new technologies that ease the application of the solution and minimise the time structures are out of service. In this way, using composite materials in construction has represented a revolution in the strengthening of structures. The textile-reinforced mortar (TRM) is a composite material that combines textiles, made of high strength <b>tensile</b> <b>fibres,</b> with cementitious matrix.

Through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle x-ray diffraction (WAXD) characterizations, we have observed that the presence of the carbon nanotubes nucleated crystallization of PVA in the MWNTs/PVA composite nanofibres, and hence considerably improved the <b>fibre</b> <b>tensile</b> strength. Also, the presence of carbon nanotubes in PVA reduced the fibre diameter and the surface hydrophilicity of the nanofibre mat. The MWNTs/PVA composite nanofibres and the neat PVA nanofibres responded differently to post-spinning treatments, such as soaking in methanol and crosslinking with glutaric dialdehyde, with the purpose of increasing PVA crystallinity and establishing a crosslinked PVA network, respectively. The presence of carbon nanotubes reduced the PVA crystallization rate during the methanol treatment, but prevented the decrease of crystallinity induced by the crosslinking reaction. In comparison with the crosslinking reaction, the methanol treatment resulted in better improvement in the <b>fibre</b> <b>tensile</b> strength and less reduction in the tensile strain.
