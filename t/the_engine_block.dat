5|$|The engine used {{a single}} updraft carburetor; early {{versions}} used a Stromberg unit, which {{was replaced by}} a Schebler unit. The carburetor was {{on the right side of}} the engine, the mixture went into a passage through <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> to the intake manifold on the left side of the engine. Ignition was by Delco coil and breaker points, with the distributor at the end of the generator/starter unit.|$|E
5|$|The Wrights {{wrote to}} several engine manufacturers, but none met {{their need for}} a {{sufficiently}} lightweight powerplant. They turned to their shop mechanic, Charlie Taylor, who built an engine in just six weeks in close consultation with the brothers. To keep the weight low enough, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> was cast from aluminum, a rare practice for the time. The Wright/Taylor engine had a primitive version of a carburetor, and had no fuel pump. Gasoline was gravity-fed from the fuel tank mounted on a wing strut into a chamber next to the cylinders where it was mixed with air: the fuel-air mixture was then vaporized by heat from the crankcase, forcing it into the cylinders.|$|E
25|$|GT-R NISMO S-tune- The S-tune was an M·spec {{but with}} further {{modifications}} to components in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{four main}} engines were {{repaired}} by machining <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>blocks</b> and installing oversized liners {{to correct a}} corrosion problem in the cylinder liners upper landing area caused by incorrect jacket water coolant that was recommended by <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>blocks</b> for <b>the</b> {{prime movers}} are cast in Germany {{and sent to}} <b>the</b> Cummins <b>engine</b> plant in Daventry, England, for the final {{machining}} and assembly process. They are then fitted to the locomotive in Boise, Idaho.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engines</b> are two-cycle {{and have}} fresh water cooling by a sea water heat exchanger. Salt water/fresh water {{condensers}} are installed {{port and starboard}} to cool the fresh water that is circulated through <b>the</b> diesel <b>engines</b> to cool <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>blocks.</b> <b>The</b> fresh water loops are surrounded by circulating sea water.|$|R
25|$|Integrated dry-sump is Porsche's {{name for}} a dry sump {{lubrication}} system integrated within <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block,</b> i.e. no separate oil reservoir.|$|E
25|$|The engine had a {{distinctive}} design; the gearbox and differential were located directly below <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block.</b> This design helped Peugeot produce its first front-wheel-drive car.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> and {{cylinder}} head were cast in one unit. Grinding {{of the engine}} valves was a regular maintenance requirement, and removing the engine valves for grinding required removing and disassembling the large cast iron engine.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>blocks</b> for <b>the</b> {{prime movers}} were cast in Germany {{and sent to}} <b>the</b> Cummins <b>engine</b> plant in Daventry, England, for final {{machining}} and assembly.

5000|$|<b>The</b> petrol <b>engine</b> is a [...] 60° V6. It {{utilizes}} a turbocharger per cylinder bank, twin intercoolers {{and direct}} injection. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> is designed by Maserati and assembled by Ferrari; specifically, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>blocks</b> are cast and machined to Ferrari's specifications respectively in Fiat's Kokomo, Indiana and Trenton Engine Plant, then shipped to Modena, Italy for assembly by Ferrari.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> R-series <b>engines</b> are diesel {{variants}} {{that are}} very {{closely related to the}} F-series, sharing essentially <b>the</b> same <b>engine</b> <b>block.</b>|$|R
25|$|Combined cycles have {{traditionally}} only {{been used in}} large power plants. BMW, however, has proposed that automobiles use exhaust heat to drive steam turbines. This can even {{be connected to the}} car or truck's cooling system to save space and weight, but also to provide a condenser in the same location as the radiator and preheating of the water using heat from <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block.</b>|$|E
25|$|A third cause {{might be}} cracks in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> from {{overtightening}} the head bolts. Some engines developed {{cracks in the}} block that would leak coolant and/or oil, sometimes accompanied by broken head bolts directly above the crack. The leak would spray coolant or oil, the latter resulting in fire if sprayed onto the hot catalytic converter or exhaust manifold {{at the front of}} the engine compartment.|$|E
25|$|The Halberstadt D.III {{primarily}} {{differed from}} the D.II version in its substitution of the Argus As.II 90kW (120hp) straight-six engine, which {{differed from the}} usual Mercedes D.II powerplant in having its camshaft in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> and using pushrods to operate the overhead valves, rather than having a camshaft running atop all of the cylinders as in a single overhead cam engine. A total of 50 D.III examples were built by Halberstadt, with the first 30 ordered in July 1916 and the last 20 ordered in August 1916.|$|E
50|$|Optimism {{surrounded}} the car until March 11, 2006, when armed robbers raided the factory of Izuogu Motors taking {{with them the}} molds for <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>blocks</b> and crank shaft, mudguards and other components. This was a big setback for the project. Since then not much is known {{on the status of}} the car.|$|R
50|$|The SRT-4, PT Cruiser Turbo, Cirrus LXi {{only and}} Stratus R/T only use <b>the</b> same <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> and heads.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine's</b> {{valve covers}} {{are made from}} a {{magnesium}} alloy, the cylinder heads are manufactured from aluminum alloy, while like <b>the</b> 1UR <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> it is die-cast to save weight.|$|R
25|$|Both the Brabham {{team and}} their gearbox {{supplier}} Weismann {{lay claim to}} the idea of doing this with the tall BMW engine {{in order to create a}} car with very low bodywork that would allow a large supply of air to reach the rear wing undisturbed and create more downforce without harming the straight line potential with high drag. The driver was placed in a lying down position (approximately 30° according to Murray), as had been common in the 1960s, but had become rare by the 1980s. BMW designed a special version of their four-cylinder turbocharged engine with <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> tilted almost horizontally (18° from horizontal).|$|E
25|$|Andrew Freeman of Grand Forks, North Dakota, {{invented the}} head bolt heater around 1940 and {{received}} a patent for it on November 8, 1949. In 1951, Freeman received another patent on an improved head bolt heater. These early heaters replaced one of the engine's cylinder head bolts with a hollow, threaded shank containing a resistive heating element. Before the block heater was introduced, people {{used a variety of}} methods to warm engines before starting them, such as pouring hot water on <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> or draining the engine's oil for storage inside overnight. Some even shoveled embers underneath their vehicle's engine to obtain the same effect.|$|E
25|$|Most {{vehicles}} existing {{today have}} been serviced by GM {{during one of}} the safety recalls on the car. For the fire-related recall, shields and drip-trays were added to prevent leaking fluids from contacting hot surfaces. The presence of drip shields between <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> and the exhaust manifold are a clue that the car has been retrofitted. The addition of the longer AC Delco PF51 oil filter and a re-calibrated dipstick added extra oil capacity to the oiling system, and enabled running four quarts of oil in the crankcase instead of three, to help prevent oil starvation to the rods. Certain vehicles also had their connecting rods or entire block replaced.|$|E
50|$|Like the {{previous}} two generations, the Buick and Oldsmobile small blocks, the gen III/IV {{can be found in}} many different brands. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>blocks</b> were cast in aluminium for car applications, and iron for most truck applications (notable exceptions include the Chevrolet TrailBlazer SS, Chevrolet SSR and a limited run of Chevrolet/GMC Extended Cab Standard Box Trucks).|$|R
50|$|In 2006 Formula Nippon {{underwent}} a drastic revision of its regulations. A new Lola FN06 chassis was introduced, while <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> formula underwent drastic revision. <b>Engine</b> <b>blocks</b> {{were provided by}} Toyota and Honda, using <b>the</b> same <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> specifications as found in the 2005 Indy Racing League, with open-tuning still permitted.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> EE 6SKRT <b>engine</b> <b>blocks</b> were {{cracking}} due to premature wear.|$|R
25|$|Formula One cars use {{short stroke}} engines. These engines {{are common in}} racing {{motorcycles}} and streetbikes. The bore is {{the diameter of the}} cylinder in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block,</b> and the stroke is the distance the piston travels from top dead-centre (TDC) to bottom dead-centre (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a short stroke means that a relatively large bore is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient combustion stroke, especially at lower rpm. The stroke of a Formula One engine is approximately , less than half the bore diameter , what is known as an over-square configuration.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} contributors to Fiero engines catching fire. The primary cause {{is thought to}} be a batch of poorly cast connecting rods, produced in GM's Saginaw plant, which failed when the oil level became too low. One theory is that the sports car styling attracted buyers who would drive the car hard, most notably by excessively revving the engine. Another factor was the incorrectly listed three-quart oil capacity; the actual oil capacity is 4.5quarts, but a misprint on the dipstick and in the owner's manual resulted in owners using only three quarts, any leakage or consumption would allow the oil level to decline over time to a dangerously low level. If the proper oil level was not maintained, the bearings could seize, snapping the porous castings of the connecting rods. This could result in a hole being punched in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block,</b> allowing oil to spray onto hot exhaust components where it could ignite.|$|E
25|$|The 75 {{featured}} {{some unusual}} technical features, {{most notably the}} fact that it was almost perfectly balanced from front to rear. This was achieved by using transaxle schema — mounting the standard five-speed gearbox in the rear connected to the rear differential (rear-wheel drive). The front suspension was a torsion bar and shock absorber combination and the rear an expensive de Dion tube assembled with shock absorbers; these designs were intended to optimize the car's handling; moreover the rear brake discs were fitted at the centre of the rear axle, near the gearbox-differential group. The engine crankshaft was bolted directly to the two-segment driveshaft, which ran the length of the underside from <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> to the gearbox and rotated at the speed of the engine. The shaft segments were joined with elastomeric 'doughnuts' to prevent vibration and engine/gearbox damage. The 2.0 L Twin Spark and the 3.0 Litre V6 were equipped with limited slip differential.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Oldsmobile <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> formed <b>the</b> {{basis of}} <b>the</b> Repco 3-liter <b>engine</b> used by Brabham {{to win the}} 1966 and 1967 Formula One world championships. <b>The</b> early Repco <b>engines</b> {{produced}} up to , and featured new SOHC cylinder heads and iron cylinder liners. The 1967 and later versions of <b>the</b> Repco <b>engine</b> had proprietary <b>engine</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 2.4-litre V6 had bore {{and stroke}} {{respectively}} of 92.5 mm and 60 mm, for a total displacement of 2,418 cc. <b>The</b> redesigned <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> was cast iron.|$|R
50|$|In a {{reciprocating}} piston internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>the</b> water jacket {{is a series}} of holes either cast or bored through <b>the</b> main <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> and connected by inlet and outlet valves to a radiator.|$|R
25|$|For 2011, the Shelby GT500 {{received}} significant performance enhancements {{and other}} upgrades. Arguably {{the most important}} of the GT500's upgrades is a new aluminum engine block for the car's supercharged 5.4L DOHC V8, replacing the cast-iron block used previously. The block's cylinder bores are coated with an iron and iron oxide composite that is applied with Plasma Transferred Wire Arc (PTWA) technology, which was developed jointly by Ford and Flamespray Industries (www.flame-spray.com). The developers of PTWA received the IPO 2009 National Inventor of the Year award. The coating allows for the replacement of traditional cast-iron cylinder liners and marks Ford's first use of this process. Between this and the use of lighter-weight aluminum for <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block,</b> the new block is 102lbs lighter than the previous cast-iron version, contributing to a reduction in the overall weight of the GT500 compared to the 2010 model. Thanks to the new liner coating, which has friction-reducing characteristics, and a revised exhaust, horsepower production from the 5.4L V8 has increased slightly for a total of @6200rpm. The combination of the lighter engine, EPAS, and aerodynamic enhancements result in an improvement in fuel efficiency for the 2011 GT500 relative to the 2010 model that eliminates the car's gas guzzler tax.|$|E
25|$|From the {{inception}} of the design, priority was given to easy access to the powerplant, fuselage weapons and other systems while the aircraft was operating from forward airfields. To this end, the entire engine cowling was made up of large, easily removable panels which were secured by large toggle latches. A large panel under the wing centre section could be removed {{to gain access to the}} L-shaped main fuel tank, which was sited partly under the cockpit floor and partly behind the rear cockpit bulkhead. Other, smaller panels gave easy access to the cooling system and electrical equipment. The engine was held in two large, forged, Elektron magnesium alloy Y-shaped legs, one per side straddling <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block,</b> which were cantilevered from the firewall. Each of the legs was secured by two quick-release screw fittings on the firewall. All of the main pipe connections were colour-coded and grouped in one place, where possible, and electrical equipment plugged into junction boxes mounted on the firewall. The entire powerplant could be removed or replaced as a unit in a matter of minutes, a potential step to the eventual adoption of the unitized-powerplant Kraftei engine mounting concept used by many German combat aircraft designs, later in the war years.|$|E
2500|$|The Farman-Voisin biplane was {{powered by}} a {{water-cooled}} Antoinette V8 engine which developed [...] at 1,400 rpm. It used an early form of direct gasoline injection and weighed only 190 pounds in working order, including the water-filled cooling system. <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>block</b> was cast aluminium, holding removable steel cylinders. [...] Levavasseur's Antoinette engines often included advanced features, including direct fuel injection and evaporative engine cooling.|$|E
50|$|It had {{problems}} with seizing of the phosphor bronze sleeves in the cast iron steam chest, with leakage in the glands and piston rings. In 1912, one of the rotary valves seized while on a test run, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> main line for seven hours. As a result it was put in store at Derby and was broken up in 1918, while Paget was in France commanding the Royal Engineers Railway Operating Division.|$|R
50|$|The V12 model {{featured}} an all new 4480 cc 60 degree V12 engine {{designed by}} W. O.
