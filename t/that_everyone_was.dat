Among those problems was <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> in a state of equality. Unequal status was of great import to early Irish Christian society and it is recorded in many places in the early Irish laws.|$|E
25|$|The secret police, Securitate, {{had become}} so omnipresent that it made Romania {{essentially}} a police state. Free speech was limited and opinions that did not favor the Communist Party were forbidden. The large numbers of Securitate informers made organised dissent nearly impossible. The regime deliberately played on this sense <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> being watched {{to make it easier}} to bend the people to the Party's will. Even by Soviet-bloc standards, the Securitate was exceptionally brutal.|$|E
25|$|Snorri relates that Aðils betook {{himself to}} pillage the Saxons, whose king was Geirþjófr and queen Alof the Great. The king and consort {{were not at}} home, and so Aðils and his men plundered their {{residence}} at ease driving cattle and captives down to the ships. One of the captives was a remarkably beautiful girl named Yrsa, and Snorri writes <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> soon impressed with the well-mannered, pretty and intelligent girl. Most impressed was Aðils who made her his queen.|$|E

25|$|On July 11, 2010, a fire {{broke out}} in a {{maintenance}} building during operating hours, forcing the evacuation and closure of the park. The fire was contained to a single building, located adjacent to the park's wave pool and used principally for storage. Spokespeople for the water park and for the Cobb County fire department noted <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> evacuated safely {{and that there were}} no reported injuries. The park re-opened two days later on July 13 after crews had sealed off the damaged area caused by the fire.|$|E
25|$|Ulliott became {{involved}} in a safe-cracking team soon afterwards, after being advised {{by the rest of}} the team <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> involved in the operation, including the shops, which carried out insurance fraud, and the police, who turned a blind eye. Together, they targeted tobacconists, off-licence, and garages. On one occasion, when Ulliott lost over £5,000 at the bookies, he robbed that safe too, and took it home in a pram. One of the team was eventually caught, and informed the police that Ulliott was involved. He went on the run for a week, but was eventually caught.|$|E
25|$|The Ynglinga saga {{was written}} c. 1225 by Snorri Sturluson {{and he used}} Skjöldunga saga as a source when he {{told the story of}} Aðils. Snorri relates that Aðils succeeded his father Óttar (Ohthere) and betook himself to pillage the Saxons, whose king was Geirþjófr and queen Alof the Great. The king and consort were not at home, and so Aðils and his men plundered their {{residence}} at ease driving cattle and captives down to the ships.

But {{as he tried to}} approach Emma, she accidentally pushes him away, resulting in Henry's ear being cut. After Henry takes off, Emma is visited by Ingrid, who tells her that she should embrace her true self, but Emma takes off after the conversation, and heads to Gold's Pawn Shop, where Gold, sensing Emma was in the place by the way the items were coming to life, offered her a chance to rid herself of her powers, and gives her a location as to where to meet him; unknown to Emma, Gold has other plans for her. Back at the loft, David, Mary Margaret, Killian and Elsa ponder their next plan by planning another search, when Henry arrives and tells them he found her, but failed to help her regain control of her magic.|$|E
25|$|The {{developers}} came to {{the conclusion}} that complex battles would only serve to confuse players. One play tester helped them by pointing out the quality of the fire pit puzzle, a puzzle that has the player-character riding on a moving platform that is descending into flames, requiring players to find a way to survive. He stated that it was both dramatic and exciting, but also a difficult puzzle. Wolpaw stated that this made no sense, commenting that it was one of the easiest puzzles in the game. He added that the battle was a dramatic high-point, since it was being the first time GLaDOS directly tries to kill the player-character and the first time that players have to use the environment to their advantage. After learning about what fellow Valve developers had planned for the final boss battle in Half-Life 2: Episode Two, the Portal developers decided to implement a neurotoxin that would kill the player-character in six minutes. This made it easier on the writers, who only had to write six minutes of dialogue. As a result, they scaled the game back, intending to ensure <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> able to see the game to the very end.|$|E
25|$|To be an enlisted woman {{during the}} {{creation}} stages was not easy. Besides the fact <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> learning as they went, {{they did not}} receive the support they needed from the male recruits. Women were initially paid two-thirds of what {{a man at the}} same level made. As the war progressed the military leaders began to see the substantial impact the women could make. In many cases the women had outperformed their male counterparts. This was taken into account and the women received a raise to four-fifths of the wages of a man. A female doctor however, received equal financial compensation to her male counterpart. One commander argued that it would be impossible for female recruits to reach the location of his station, even though it was located only three and a half miles from the city and was serviced by a paved road and a bus route The negative reaction of men towards the female recruits was addressed in propaganda films. Proudly She Marches and Wings on Her Shoulder were made to show the acceptance of female recruits, while showing the men that although they were taking jobs traditionally intended for men, {{they would be able to}} retain their femininity.|$|E

When Hawks (an older friend of the crew) asked a lighting tech who he would rather drop a light on, Hepburn agreed to behave on set.

A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang {{was asked by the}} king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel. He was allowed to accompany the queen as she sang an aria, and he later improvised on the bass part of a Handel aria from which, according to Leopold, he produced [...] "the most beautiful melody in such a manner <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>was</b> astonished".|$|E
500|$|The longest {{casting process}} {{was that of}} Bakula as Archer, due to the {{extended}} contract negotiations that took place, which added to a delay in production.

[...] He had signed up for a pilot for CBS called Late Bloomers before agreeing to appear on Enterprise. One of the reasons he agreed to join the cast of Enterprise was that he had previously worked with Kerry McCluggage, one of the co-founders of UPN, on Quantum Leap.

Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue."
