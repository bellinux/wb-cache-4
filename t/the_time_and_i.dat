Jason Jones organized his core ideas for the sequel's story and approached Staten for input.

[...] To finish the album McGuire's friend Les Young played some of the bass guitar parts, and American Jeff Castleman played bass on [...] "Catchanemu". Young also briefly played live with Ayers Rock in Australia, including an October 1975 show at the State Theatre in Sydney. McGuire returned to the group at the Dallas Brooks Hall on 21 October 1975, to warm applause.|$|E
500|$|... "Little Things" [...] {{was written}} by British singer-songwriters Ed Sheeran and Fiona Bevan, and {{produced}} by Jake Gosling. In February 2012, One Direction expressed interest in working with Sheeran for their second studio album. In June 2012, Sheeran disclosed that One Direction would be recording two of his songs. In October 2012, Sheeran acknowledged Bevan's songwriting credit {{in an interview with}} British radio network Capital FM: [...] "The great thing about it is I wrote that song with a girl called Fiona Bevan when I was 17 and we lost the song. I've kept in touch with Fiona, we've done gigs and stuff and about two months ago she sent me the tune and was like, 'Oh, do you remember this?' I was like, 'Yeah, I do remember that', and I was in the studio with the One Direction boys at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was playing it and they were like, 'We really like that'.

500|$|Gillian Anderson was {{particularly}} {{pleased with the}} episode showing a different side of Scully and said, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} great idea. I personally was going through a dark period at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted to explore Scully's dark side. For some reason, Glen and Jim were on the same wavelength that week. Afterward, a lot of people told me that on that episode I was so 'unlike' Scully or that 'it showed my range'. I told them I thought they were wrong. I don't think that what I did here was out of character for Scully. The only thing different is that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship". Morgan obliged and wrote a scene where Scully enjoys a passionate night with Jerse. This was later removed from the script by series creator Chris Carter, the only time in Glen Morgan's tenure on the show where a scene of his was removed by Carter. Morgan later noted [...] "I think Chris thought that I was monkeying around with him, but I really wasn't." ...|$|E

Her daughter Lourdes was born on October 14, 1996. Madonna published a diary of the film shoot in Vanity Fair. She said of the experience, [...] "This is the role I was born to play.

[...] Lebeau said: “To me, Woody Guthrie is this person {{who wanted to}} write about things from people’s perspective … just normal people. <b>And</b> that’s who <b>I</b> write tunes for.” [...] Ezra Idlet, one-half of the duo Trout Fishing in America said: [...] "Two years ago, <b>I</b> had <b>the</b> <b>time</b> off <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just went (to WoodyFest)....just went and watched — <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was knocked out by the caliber of performers, the camaraderie between the musicians and the presenters." ...|$|R
500|$|Chris Carter {{claimed to}} have been {{inspired}} to write the episode after his dog had worms, a situation he called [...] "very disgusting". He also had been reading about Chernobyl and the extinction of species at the time and blended all three of these concepts when writing the episode. Carter described his mood while writing the episode, [...] "I was in a funk when I wrote that episode. We were coming back from hiatus and I was trying to find something more interesting than just the Flukeman. I was irritated at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> brought my irritation to Mulder's attitude. Basically, he had become fed up with the FBI. They had given him what he felt was a low assignment, which was sending him into the city after a dead body. But lo and behold, he finds that this is a case that {{for all intents and purposes}} is an X-File. It's been given to him by a man he's never looked at as an ally, Skinner. So it's an interesting establishing of a relationship between them." [...] Producer J.P. Finn described the episode as a departure from Carter's usual work as it did not deal with an alien subject matter.|$|E
500|$|For {{the title}} role, King {{required}} the candidate be British, and considered casting an unknown actress. British actress Emily Blunt read the script, and aware other actresses would {{fight for the}} part, she approached King early in the search process. Blunt later admitted she had a [...] "non-existent knowledge" [...] of the queen, but after consulting her mother about Victoria's successful marriage, Blunt told King that the queen [...] "was a young girl who was very in love for the first time, {{and she was in}} a job where she felt way over her head. So I said to Graham, 'She's rebellious. She's a survivor.' I didn't want to approach her as the English rose, but as a young girl who was fighting". They awarded Blunt the role after viewing her entire filmography as well as her Golden Globes acceptance speech for Gideon's Daughter. Blunt noted, [...] "I thought [...] was remarkable and such a challenge. This young girl, who was so feisty and emotional and strong-willed, was very fascinating to me... In my life and in the job I've chosen to do, you have to perform all <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> thought Victoria was a bit of an actress." [...] After winning the part, Blunt was allowed access to Windsor Castle, where she viewed Victoria's paintings, letters, diaries, and music composed by Albert himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} idea for Dragon Quest {{came during the}} development of the NES port of Portopia. Horii and Nakamura came across the RPG Wizardry at a Macworld Conference & Expo. While it had some influence on the NES Portopias dungeon crawl segments, Horii liked the game's depth and visuals. He wanted to create a game similar to Wizardry, to expose the mainly Western-exclusive RPG genre to Japan and to expand the genre past computer enthusiasts. Horii also cited Ultima as an inspiration for Dragon Quests gameplay, specifically the first-person random battles in Wizardry and the overhead perspective of Ultima. While the RPG genre was predominantly Western and limited to PCs, Japanese gamers enjoyed home-grown games such as The Black Onyx and the Dragon Slayer series alongside Western RPG ports. However, while Horii and Nakamura enjoyed the dungeon crawling and statistical nature of Wizardry, they realized most people would not. This had not originally been a concern, but the success of Super Mario Bros. greatly increased the potential audience of any new Famicom/NES game. To create Dragon Quest, the gameplay needed to be simplified. According to Horii: [...] "There was no keyboard, and the system was much simpler, using just a [...] controller. But I still thought that it would be really exciting for the player to play as their alter ego in the game. I personally was playing Wizardry and Ultima at <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really enjoyed seeing my own self in the game." ...|$|E

Moreover, {{in comparison with}} a simple corner-shaped ground plane, the parabolic ground plane enhances bandwidth and improves input return loss.
