5|$|In {{the second}} step, <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> {{is placed in}} an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single {{wavelength}} (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections.

5000|$|... "He's Sure the Boy I Love" [...] is a 1962 single by <b>The</b> <b>Crystals.</b> <b>The</b> {{song was}} {{originally}} recorded by The Blossoms but credited to <b>The</b> <b>Crystals.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After <b>The</b> <b>Crystals</b> {{recorded}} [...] "There's No Other" [...] with Spector, Spector {{released the}} song for his newly founded label Phillies Records, despite originally working with <b>The</b> <b>Crystals</b> for Liberty Records. <b>The</b> <b>Crystals</b> {{did not receive}} payment from Spector for [...] "There's No Other".|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the steady}} flow of hit singles, {{tensions}} between Spector and <b>the</b> <b>Crystals</b> mounted.

5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into <b>the</b> <b>crystal,</b> direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used}} to determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals {{in the presence of a}} heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E
5|$|In modern designs it {{is common}} to use quartz crystal filters, {{especially}} for narrowband filtering applications.

30|$|The initial {{diffraction}} of <b>the</b> <b>crystals</b> was {{not good}} enough to accurately assign the side chains. For optimization, dehydration strategy was used.

5|$|Returning to {{the surface}} with Kida, Milo discovers Rourke has the missing page. Rourke and the crew betray Milo, {{intending}} to bring <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> {{to the surface}} and sell it. Rourke mortally wounds the King of Atlantis while trying to extract information about the crystal's location, but finds its location for himself hidden beneath the King's throne room. <b>The</b> <b>crystal</b> detects a threat before merging with Kida. Rourke and the mercenaries lock Kida in a crate and prepare to leave the city. Knowing that when <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> is gone the Atlanteans will die, Milo berates his friends for betraying their consciences, and ultimately convinces them to leave Rourke and remain in Atlantis. The King explains to Milo that <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> has developed a consciousness; it thrives on the collective emotions of the Atlanteans and provides power, protection, and longevity in return. It will find a royal host when Atlantis is in danger. He then reveals that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he attempted {{to use it as a}} weapon of war. As he dies, he gives his crystal to Milo, telling him to save Atlantis and Kida. Encouraged by Sweet, Milo rallies the crew, and the Atlanteans to stop Rourke.|$|E

40|$|Different {{morphology}} crystals (needle, rod-tetragonal and wedge-shaped) {{were grown}} {{from the same}} solution of ribosome; furthermore, in the same drop using 10 - 15 % 2 -methyl- 2, 4 pentanediol as a precipitant. <b>The</b> <b>crystals</b> appeared in 5 - 48 hours.

40|$|A {{real-time}} dynamic holographic image {{storage device}} uses four-wave mixing {{in a pair}} of photorefractive crystals. An oscillation is produced between <b>the</b> <b>crystals</b> which can be maintained indefinitely after the initial object beam is discontinued. The object beam produces an interference pattern in a first crystal to produce phase-conjugated object beam which is directed towards <b>the</b> second <b>crystal.</b> In <b>the</b> second <b>crystal</b> another interference pattern is created which produces a reconstructed object beam. The reconstructed object beam is directed back towards <b>the</b> first <b>crystal.</b> <b>The</b> interference patterns are produced by interaction of the object and phase-conjugated object beam with a read and write beam in each of <b>the</b> <b>crystals.</b> By manipulation of the ratio of the read and write beam intensities in at least one of <b>the</b> <b>crystals,</b> <b>the</b> phase-conjugate or reconstructed object beam output therefrom can be amplified to maintain stable oscillation between <b>the</b> two <b>crystals...</b>|$|R
40|$|A new {{scheme for}} {{amplification}} of coherent gamma rays is proposed. The key elements are crystalline undulators - single crystals with periodically bent crystallographic planes {{exposed to a}} high energy beam of charged particles undergoing channeling inside <b>the</b> <b>crystals.</b> <b>The</b> scheme consists of two such crystals separated by a vacuum gap. The beam passes <b>the</b> <b>crystals</b> successively. <b>The</b> particles perform undulator motion inside <b>the</b> <b>crystals</b> following <b>the</b> periodic shape of the crystallographic planes. Gamma rays passing <b>the</b> <b>crystals</b> parallel to <b>the</b> beam get amplified due to interaction with the particles inside <b>the</b> <b>crystals.</b> <b>The</b> term `gamma klystron' is proposed for the scheme because its operational principles {{are similar to those}} of the optical klystron. A more simple one-crystal scheme is considered as well for the sake of comparison. It is shown that the gamma ray amplification in the klystron scheme can be reached at considerably lower particle densities than in the one-crystal scheme, provided that the gap between <b>the</b> <b>crystals</b> is sufficiently large.

5|$|When {{a crystal}} is mounted and exposed to an intense beam of X-rays, it {{scatters}} the X-rays into {{a pattern of}} spots or reflections that can be observed on a screen behind <b>the</b> <b>crystal.</b> A similar pattern may be seen by shining a laser pointer at a compact disc. The relative intensities of these spots provide the information to determine the arrangement of molecules within <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> in atomic detail. The intensities of these reflections may be recorded with photographic film, an area detector or with a charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensor. The peaks at small angles correspond to low-resolution data, whereas those at high angles represent high-resolution data; thus, an upper limit on the eventual resolution of the structure can be determined from the first few images. Some measures of diffraction quality can be determined at this point, such as the mosaicity of <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> and its overall disorder, as observed in the peak widths. Some pathologies of <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> that would render it unfit for solving the structure can also be diagnosed quickly at this point.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{a technique}} used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions. By measuring the angles and intensities of these diffracted beams, a crystallographer can produce a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within <b>the</b> <b>crystal.</b> From this electron density, the mean positions of the atoms in <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> can be determined, {{as well as their}} chemical bonds, their disorder, and various other information.|$|E
5|$|X-rays are {{generally}} filtered (by use of X-Ray Filters) {{to a single}} wavelength (made monochromatic) and collimated to a single direction before {{they are allowed to}} strike <b>the</b> <b>crystal.</b> The filtering not only simplifies the data analysis, but also removes radiation that degrades <b>the</b> <b>crystal</b> without contributing useful information. Collimation is done either with a collimator (basically, a long tube) or with a clever arrangement of gently curved mirrors.
