40|$|Abstract: This study {{examined}} the effects of Sharing the Environment (STE), a situated professional development pilot program that uses an inquiry-based approach to teaching Environmental Education (EE) to elementary students in the US and Trinidad. Inquiry is difficult to incorporate in both cultures because proficient performance on national tests is a priority. As a result, teachers must cover the curriculum via transmission of knowledge rather than its discovery. In order to capture an early understanding of the effects of this program on its participants, focus groups and ethnographic interviews were conducted with ten participating teachers from both countries. Using a grounded theory approach on the data sets, three themes emerged that describe conditions required for replicating this program: structural, cross-curricular, and cultural disconnections, technological needs, and environmental and sociocultural knowledge gains. The findings indicate that cultural factors {{had a significant impact on}} how Trinidadian and American teachers and administrators perceived, valued, and reacted to the concrete experiences <b>they</b> <b>had</b> in <b>th...</b>|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years, {{there has been}} {{increasing}} pol-icy emphasis on care in community-based settings for those with dependency needs. This, coupled with the long-term shift towards an ageing population and the improved longevity of those with lifelong disabilities, has had significant implications for family carers. In the United Kingdom, there are currently 6. 5 million carers; this figure is predicted to rise by 3. 4 million by 2045 (Larkin & Milne 2013, Carers UK 2014). The intensity of care needs will also increase and more carers {{are likely to be}} supporting two people, e. g. a disabled partner and a parent.

Twenty healthy subjects (six males; mean age 25. 6) were screened for neurological and psychiatric disorders and gave written informed consent before participating. Participants were financially compensated. Participants attended two sessions, spaced at least one week apart, and were randomized to receive either ATD or placebo on the first session. The UG was administered {{as part of a larger}} cognitive assessment (to be reported separately). The ATD procedure was carried out according to an established protocol (1, 2).

Cross-sec-tional and case-control studies have shown that snoring is associated with: obesity; age; smoking; heavy alcohol consumption; and physical inactivity [5 – 9]. After adjust-ments for these confounding factors, it was found in sev-eral recent studies that hypertension was not significantly associated with snoring [9 – 11].

40|$|SINCE 2006, {{abolition}} of user fees {{at the point}} of service delivery for care and drugs {{has been one of the}} pillars of the public health approach proposed by the WHO for scaling up access to medical treatment and care for PLWHA in low-income countries (Gilks et al., 2006). However, provisions to define the modalities for implementing this recommendation have not been made. This absence of directives has led to numerous concerns, and even reluctance, among public health programme directors in low-income countries, raising questions about the economic feasibility of such a decision and how to implement a policy that supports free access to HIV/AIDS-specific care and services. Moving from the provision of free drugs to the provision of complete free care requires the implementation of effective and sustainable funding management. There is a danger that free access without secure and properly functioning funding will quickly work against the desired objectives. The negative side effects of a poorly-run free access policy—breaks in supply, lower service quality, underthe-counter payments—have frequently been described in the economic and public health literature. In Senegal, several studies have analysed the funding of the national AIDS treatment programme (Ciss et al., 2002; Vinard et al., 2003), the programme’s financial accessibility (Lanièce et al., 2003) and the evaluation of extra-ARV costs for patients (Canestri et al., 2004). <b>They</b> <b>have</b> demonstrated <b>th...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{philosophers}} with a metaphysical orientation <b>have</b> criticized Making <b>Thing</b> Happen for {{its failure to}} provide {{an account of the}} metaphysical foundations or grounds or truth-makers for causal and explanatory claims. I originally attempted to write an ordinary paper responding to these criticisms but found this to be a very difficult undertaking: I realized that I disagreed with my critics about so much that putting everything into a an ordinary “linear ” argument was impossible. I also realized that important elements in my disagreement had to do not just with the ideas of the critics but with the rhetorical devices and strategies for conversational control that they sometimes employ. This led me to the idea of writing a dialog that attempts to highlight the latter as well as a former. What follows is, I readily admit, a caricature which makes no attempt to be fair or balanced. Many of the philosophers I know who are analytical metaphysicians do not share the affect and attitudes of my Professor Metafisico and many are far more knowledgeable about science.

40|$|Blocking {{systems with}} zero buffers are typical for (semi-) process industries. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> not only <b>th</b> {{characteristics}} of limited buffer systems, but if buffer sizes are zero, {{the equipment is}} often used as temporary storage.

For given demand volumes (and mix), the objective is to operate the equipment {{in such a way that}} productivity is maximized without (too much) blocking. This problem happens to be very complex, especially in a stochastic setting. Methodologically, we can conclude that analytical models to model these systems are not wide spread. However, there exists a great similarity between blocking systems without buffer and kanban systems. For kanban systems, analytical models to calculate the performance are available. The purpose of this paper is to apply an analytical model of kanban system to a blocking system without buffer. Based on simulation results, the performance of the kanban analytical model applied to the blocking system is studied and improved. ...|$|R

40|$|The Relation Between Autonomy-based Rights and 	Profoundly Mentally Disabled Persons” 	Competent {{persons have}} {{fundamental}} rights to decide about abortion, methods of contraception, and rejection of life-sustaining medical treatment. Profoundly disabled persons are so cognitively impaired that they cannot {{make their own}} serious medical decisions. Yet some courts suggest that the mentally impaired are entitled to “the same right” to choice regarding critical medical decisions as competent persons. This article discusses the puzzling {{question of how to}} relate autonomy-based rights to never-competent persons. It argues that while profoundly disabled persons cannot be entitled to make their own medical decisions, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a 14 <b>th</b> Amendment right to have a bonded surrogate make important medical decisions on their behalf. Such a right is necessary {{in order to protect the}} disabled patient’s constitutionally grounded interests in bodily integrity, well being, and dignity. This right invalidates the state cases (in California, New York, Wisconsin, and Michigan) that have sought to confine end-of-life decisions to situations where the dying patient has given clear and convincing instructions. Such preclusion of surrogate choice leaves every never-competent patient in a medical limbo that sometimes constitutes an undignified and inhumane status.

40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of local anaesthetic tech-niques in the postoperative period have long been recognized. In a review of early work, Simpson and Parkhouse (1961) pointed out that, in 1935, Capelle irrigated abdominal wounds with local anaesthetic injected through large, curved, hollow needles. These were inserted {{at the end of}} the operation and left in place in a manner similar to deep tension sutures. The method was apparently effective, but was not adopted widely because of fear of wound infection and delayed healing. Gerwig, Thompson and Blades (1951) used the same principle when they inserted polyethylene tubes deep to the anterior rectus sheath for wound irrigation, and they noted that patients so treated required only a quarter of the usual amount of morphine. Gius (1940) described the use of para verte-bral block with procaine for the treatment of post-operative atelectasis, and Cleland (1949) used "continuous " caudal and extradural analgesia for over 100 abdominal and ano—rectal cases. He claimed that this resulted in normal postoperative respiration and early, painless ambulation. Bonica (1953) used intermittent injections through an indwelling extradural catheter to produce seg-mental analgesia, and found that this gave com-plete pain relief and allowed effective ventilation and coughing. Dawkins (1956) preferred to give extradural lignocaine as an infusion. He found that this technique was capable of providing truly continuous analgesia, and pointed out that the use of the word "continuous " is a misnomer when applied to intermittent injections or top-ups of local anaesthetic.
