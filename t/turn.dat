5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a trivial case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm must <b>turn</b> when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first <b>turn</b> must be a right hand <b>turn.</b> A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a <b>turn.</b> The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} <b>turn</b> is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to <b>turn</b> the front wheel in the direction of the <b>turn,</b> and therefore tends to decrease the <b>turn</b> radius.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two {{different}} <b>turning</b> processes namely rotational <b>turning</b> and hard <b>turning</b> are compared {{to each other}} regarding surface generation aspects. By experiments it is shown that, with higher feed rates, rotational <b>turning</b> yields same surface quality as hard <b>turning.</b> Feed rates can be chosen six times higher in rotational <b>turning</b> than in conventional hard <b>turning</b> without losses in the surface roughness quality. Also experiments reveal that the tool wear in rotational <b>turning</b> has a beneficial effect on the surface roughness. A corresponding explanation model is thereby presented which takes the specific tool/work piece engagement in rotational <b>turning</b> into account. Furthermore, it is shown that rotational <b>turning</b> has negative effects on the surface integrity. The phase transformation zones (“white layers”) are thicker in rotational <b>turned</b> parts than in hard <b>turned</b> parts. Also the level of tensile residual stress in rotational <b>turning</b> is higher than in hard <b>turning.</b> Both effects are probably caused by high thermal material loads in rotational <b>turning</b> due to increased friction. However, {{the results of this}} paper show that rotational <b>turning</b> has a high potential to become an efficient alternative to hard <b>turning,</b> {{especially when it comes to}} large scale production of simple shaped parts...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a <b>turn</b> and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that <b>turn,</b> a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of the bike, and this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired <b>turn.</b> Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once a <b>turn</b> is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend to steer into the <b>turn,</b> righting itself and exiting the <b>turn,</b> unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the <b>turn.</b> At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend to steer out of the <b>turn,</b> increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} <b>turn.</b> At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the <b>turn,</b> the force on the tire is towards the center of the <b>turn.</b> Therefore, this torque tends to <b>turn</b> the front wheel in the direction of the side-slip, away from the direction of the <b>turn,</b> and therefore tends to increase the radius of the <b>turn.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Green or wet <b>turning</b> - <b>turning</b> wood {{while its}} {{moisture}} content is above equilibrium. Often done when the wood is newly felled. May be <b>turned</b> to finished thickness, {{in which case}} the differential shrinkage of the wood will result in a finished piece that is not perfectly round. Alternatively, it may be [...] "rough turned". Rough <b>turning</b> involves <b>turning</b> the piece only to its general shape, leaving enough thickness so that after <b>turning</b> it can be allowed to dry to equilibrium moisture content and distort. The advantage over first drying the wood then <b>turning</b> is that a rough <b>turned</b> piece dries faster, will probably distort instead of split as solid wood tends to, and that wet wood <b>turns</b> better, since it creates less dust. Rough <b>turning</b> is inexact science: <b>turning</b> wood too thick will lead to splits, <b>turning</b> wood too thin will lead to distortion that cannot be removed, because not enough thickness is left. Once dry, it is mounted on the lathe a second time and <b>turned</b> to its final form. Rough <b>turning</b> is typically used on most functional work and some artistic pieces.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} early head <b>turning,</b> we retrospectively studied {{videotapes of}} 262 seizures from 82 {{patients who were}} seizure free after temporal lobectomy. Early head movements were arbitrarily classified into non-tonic <b>turning,</b> tonic <b>turning,</b> and absence of <b>turning.</b> Among the 222 seizures which showed early head <b>turning,</b> 168 (75. 7 %) had non-tonic <b>turning</b> and 54 (24. 3 %) had tonic <b>turning.</b> The direction of the first head <b>turning</b> was ipsilateral to the epileptogenic foci in 132 (78. 6 %) seizures with non-tonic <b>turning</b> and in 35 (64. 8 %) seizures showing tonic head <b>turning.</b> The proportion of seizures with <b>turning</b> towards the ipsilateral side {{in the presence of}} tonic and non-tonic head <b>turning</b> were significantly different (P= 0. 04). Seventy-four seizures (28. 2 %) evolved to secondary generalization, more frequently found in seizures with early head <b>turning</b> (P= 0. 0015) and especially those showing tonic <b>turning</b> (P< 0. 0001). The direction of head <b>turning</b> immediately preceding secondary generalization was contralateral to the lesion side in 53 seizures (82. 8 %). Dystonic upper limb posturing occurred in 86 seizures (32. 8 %), exclusively contralateral to the seizure focus, whereas 65 (75. 6 %) were associated with initial head <b>turning</b> ipsilateral to the focus. In summary, temporal lobe seizures with tonic head <b>turning</b> tends to secondarily generalize and the direction of head <b>turning</b> before secondarily generalized was contralateral to the seizure foci. Earlier in the seizures the direction of non-tonic head <b>turning</b> tends to be towards the epileptogenic hemisphere. In addition, dystonic posturing of the extremities is a significant lateralizing sign to the contralateral hemisphere in temporal lobe seizures...|$|R

5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired <b>turn</b> direction, {{this may not}} be the case to maintain a steady-state <b>turn.</b> The sustained steer angle is usually in the same direction as the <b>turn,</b> but may remain opposite to the direction of the <b>turn,</b> especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the <b>turn</b> direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular <b>turn</b> depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a <b>turn,</b> the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the <b>turn</b> to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the <b>turn</b> to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the <b>turn,</b> the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the <b>turn</b> in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
5|$|A {{deepening}} trough {{over the}} eastern United States was forecast to <b>turn</b> the storm toward the north on August16. This <b>turn</b> took place earlier than forecasters anticipated.

Our goals {{was to determine whether}} dopaminergic medication improves preplanned and unplanned walking <b>turns</b> in individuals with PD, compared to healthy controls. Nineteen older adults with mild-to-moderate PD and 17 healthy controls performed one of the following three tasks, presented randomly: walking straight, or walking and <b>turning</b> 180 ° to the right or left. The walking direction was visually cued before starting to walk (preplanned) or after (unplanned, i. e., 0. 6 m before reaching the <b>turning</b> point). Subjects with PD were assessed off dopaminergic medication (OFF) and on dopaminergic medication (ON) medication. <b>Turning</b> strategy (step and spin <b>turns),</b> <b>turning</b> performance (<b>turning</b> distance and body rotation) and walking pattern were analyzed for three <b>turning</b> steps. Irrespective of medication state and <b>turning</b> condition, step and spin <b>turns</b> followed a nearly 50 : 50 distribution. After intake of dopaminergic medication, subjects with PD increased their <b>turning</b> distance but not the amount of body rotation or their walking pattern. Compared to controls, <b>turning</b> impairments in subjects with PD remained while ON medication and problems regulating step width were the most prominent features of their walking pattern. Specifically, subjects with PD <b>turned</b> with narrower cross-over steps, i. e. when the external foot crossed over the line of progression of the internal leg. We conclude that <b>turning</b> impairments remained even after dopaminergic medication and problems modulating step width appears to be a critical feature for <b>turning</b> in PD...|$|R
