5|$|The 2015 Vuelta {{included}} nine summit finishes, none {{of which}} had previously {{been used in the}} race. Unusually, the principal difficulties of the race came in the first two weeks, including all nine summit finishes. It was therefore expected that the climbers would need to attack early in the race, in order <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> significant lead ahead of the lengthy time trial on Stage 17. The race organisers also hoped to encourage sprinters to take part by including seven fairly flat stages.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{proponent of}} the day fighter force and the defence of Germany, Galland used his {{position}} to improve {{the position of the}} Jagdwaffe. The need was now pressing, as Germany had declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, and Galland was keen <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> force that could withstand the resurgence of the Western Allied Air Forces in preparation for what would become known as the Defence of the Reich campaign. Galland was outspoken, something that was not often tolerated by Göring. Yet, by earning and cultivating the support of other powerful personalities in the Luftwaffe, like Erhard Milch and Günther Korten, and personalities in the industrial sector such as Albert Speer and even Adolf Hitler, Galland was able to survive in his position for three years.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{returned}} to Massillon in 1932, {{when he was}} 24 years old and barely two years out of college. His assignment was to turn around a Tigers team that had fallen into mediocrity over the six seasons since the departure of Stewart, Brown's old coach. In 1931, the year before Brown arrived, the Tigers finished with a 2–6-2 record. Brown's strategy was <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> disciplined, hard-working team. He fired an assistant early on for arriving at a practice late {{because he had to}} work on his farm. No Tigers player was allowed to sit on the bench during a game; Brown made them stand. At Massillon, Brown put in an offense and blocking scheme he learned from Duke's Jimmy DeHart and Purdue's Noble Kizer. He emphasized quickness over strength.|$|E

It is also known that during his reign, a k'ini' ajaw—or prince—of Piedras Negras, T'ul Chiik, was captured by Yaxun B'alam IV of Yaxchilan; it has been hypothesized by Martin and Grube that Yo'nal Ahk III's focus on smaller satellite kingdoms such as La Mar and El Cayo was a tactic <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> support base in order to combat the growing threat that Yaxchilan posed. He was succeeded by Ha' K'in Xook, who was possibly his brother.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May the Dutch {{commander}} General Winkelman {{was faced}} with two priorities. First of {{all he wanted to}} eliminate the German airborne troops. Though the strategic assault had failed, he feared a further enemy build-up via Waalhaven and saw the German possession of the Moerdijk bridges as a serious impediment to the movement of allied reinforcements to the Fortress Holland. The second priority was closely related to the first: enabling the French army <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> strong defensive line in North Brabant, to connect the Fortress Holland with the Allied main force in Belgium. As he had withdrawn most of his troops from the area, Winkelman had only limited means available to influence this process, largely leaving the task to local commanders.|$|E

50|$|During the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648) {{in which}} the newly formed Dutch Republic gained its {{independence}} from Spain, the Dutch States-General hired several foreign regiments <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> army—some of these were English and Scottish regiments. In the years that followed, the Republic would again hire foreign regiments if it needed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>an</b> army in times of war. The largest expansion of the army was during the War of the Spanish Succession, when six regiments of Scots were taken into service. After the war, three regiments were disbanded, the remaining three Scottish regiments were brigaded into a separate unit, from then on known as the Scots Brigade.|$|R

5|$|Yugoslav naval {{policy in}} the interwar period lacked {{direction}} until the mid-1920s, although it was generally accepted that the Adriatic coastline was effectively a sea frontier that the naval arm was responsible for securing with the limited resources made available to it. In 1926, a modest ten-year construction program was initiated <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> force of submarines, coastal torpedo boats, torpedo bombers and conventional bomber aircraft to perform this role. The Hrabri-class submarines were one of the first new acquisitions aimed at developing a naval force capable of meeting this challenge.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> base {{of political}} support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take oaths first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful rulers after her. Stephen was amongst those who took this oath in 1127. Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained {{towards the end of}} the King's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels. In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt.|$|E
5|$|New York faced similar {{architectural}} challenges, but {{in comparison}} to Chicago, skyscraper architects worked less closely with engineers and other specialists, and instead held strong backgrounds in the Beaux Arts movement and perceived their role to be primarily artistic rather than {{a partnership with the}} mechanical arts. Their practices tended to be smaller, resembling atelier style workshops. Structural engineers in New York took longer <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> strong professional role there, a trend reflected in the lower engineering quality of many early skyscrapers in the city. The New York style emphasized stunning height and a somewhat eclectic use of architectural features from other periods, creating an energetic, flamboyant appearance. Towers were common, making best use of the relatively small plots of land in New York. Some New York skyscrapers emulated the tripartite style of Chicago, but others broke their exterior down into many different layers, each with its own style. Proponents argued that this reintroduced a sense of human proportion to these tall buildings; critics felt that the results were confusing and ungainly.|$|E

5|$|Vettel and Alonso traded fastest laps as {{they pushed}} hard {{in their efforts}} <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{sufficient}} lead over Webber to maintain first and second positions after their pit stops. Massa, Petrov, Buemi and Alguersuari all passed Glock on lap 17 thus eliminating the queue of cars. By lap20, Alonso was leading Vettel by 3.2 seconds; he in turn was a further 11 seconds in front of Hamilton. Button was in fourth, 20 seconds behind Alonso, with Rosberg 3.3 seconds behind the World Champion in fifth. Webber changed his engine settings {{to give him a}} higher top speed in an attempt to get past Barrichello and decrease the time gap to Hamilton on lap 22. He avoided colliding with an Armco barrier at the entry of turn eighteen one lap later. Hamilton was told to increase his pace on the 24th lap to try to stay ahead of Webber after the pit stop phase. But his car had a large amount of oversteer, as his rear, super-soft, compound tyres began to deteriorate, causing his lap times to drop off the leader's pace. Trulli drove to the pit lane and was pushed by his mechanics into the Lotus garage to retire with an hydraulic issue on lap28. Hamilton made the first scheduled stop for tyres on lap29 and re-emerged in eighth position behind Webber. Alonso and Vettel made simultaneous pit stops on the following lap; Alonso retained his lead despite Vettel's pit crew completing their pit stop first; Vettel avoided stalling and drove away in second gear. With newer tyres which provided more grip, Vettel recorded faster lap times than Alonso to close the time gap as the two came across slower cars.|$|E
5|$|Despite taking massive {{losses on}} the Saturn, {{including}} a 75 {{percent drop in}} half-year profits just before the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast, Sega felt confident about its new system. The Dreamcast attracted significant interest and drew many pre-orders. Sega announced that Sonic Adventure, the next game starring company mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, would arrive {{in time for the}} Dreamcast's launch and promoted the game with a large-scale public demonstration at the Tokyo Kokusai Forum Hall.s Tokyo premiere was a grand event–three stadium-packed showings, a demonstration of the game and more... Afterward, Segata Sanshiro led the crowd in a Sonic chant, which will be used in the game.}} However, Sega could not achieve its shipping goals for the Dreamcast's Japanese launch due to a shortage of PowerVR chipsets caused by a high failure rate in the manufacturing process. As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan. On November 27, 1998, the Dreamcast launched in Japan at a price of JP¥29,000, and the entire stock sold out {{by the end of the}} day. However, of the four games available at launch, only one—a port of Virtua Fighter 3, the most successful arcade game Sega ever released in Japan—sold well. Sega estimated that an additional 200,000-300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply. Key Dreamcast software titles Sonic Adventure and Sega Rally Championship 2, which had been delayed, arrived within the following weeks, but sales continued to be slower than expected. Irimajiri hoped to sell over 1 million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but less than 900,000 were sold, undermining Sega's attempts <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> sufficient installed base to ensure the Dreamcast's survival after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers. There were reports of disappointed Japanese consumers returning their Dreamcasts and using the refund to purchase additional PlayStation software. Seaman, released in July 1999, was considered the Dreamcast's first major hit in Japan. Prior to the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast to JP¥19,900, effectively making the hardware unprofitable but increasing sales. The price reduction and release of Namco's Soul Calibur helped Sega to gain 17 percent on its shares.|$|E
