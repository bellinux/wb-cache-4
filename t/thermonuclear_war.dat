500|$|Having learnt of {{the ongoing}} Cold War and the {{doctrine}} of mutually assured destruction from Stepashin, Skaldak {{plans to use the}} submarine's nuclear missiles to provoke a global <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>war</b> and destroy humanity as revenge for the humans attacking him - under the Martian code humanity as a whole has declared war on the Ice Warrior race by assaulting him. Reaching the bridge, he is able to connect himself to the sub's missile guidance systems and activate the missiles. The Doctor and Clara are attempting to persuade Skaldak to show mercy when the sub is rocked by a tractor beam from above: the Ice Warriors have arrived over the site of the submarine's undersea grounding, and they haul it to the surface. Skaldak is beamed aboard the Ice Warriors' spaceship, though the missile launch system is still active. Showing mercy, Skaldak deactivates the missiles remotely. When the Doctor's sonic screwdriver informs him the TARDIS has reappeared, he informs Clara that it had [...] "relocated" [...] to the South Pole automatically as part of the H.A.D.S. ("Hostile Action Displacement System"), which the Doctor admits he reactivated by accident while fiddling with the controls. As they are at the North Pole, an embarrassed Doctor asks Zhukov for a lift to get the TARDIS before saluting the Ice Warrior ship as it leaves.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, as Cold War {{tensions}} {{were near}} their peak following the Sputnik crisis and amidst {{talk of a}} widening [...] "missile gap" [...] between the United States and the Soviet Union, Kahn published On <b>Thermonuclear</b> <b>War,</b> the title of which clearly alluded to On War, the classic 19th-century treatise by the German military strategist Carl von Clausewitz.|$|E
2500|$|Along with John von Neumann, Edward Teller and Wernher von Braun, Kahn was, reportedly, an {{inspiration}} for the character [...] "Dr. Strangelove" [...] in the eponymous film by Stanley Kubrick released in 1964. It was also said that Kubrick immersed himself in Kahn's book On <b>Thermonuclear</b> <b>War.</b> In the film, Dr. Strangelove refers to {{a report on the}} Doomsday Machine by the [...] "BLAND Corporation". Kahn met Kubrick and gave him the idea for the [...] "Doomsday Machine", a device which would immediately cause the destruction of the entire planet {{in the event of a}} nuclear attack. Both the name and the concept of the weapon are drawn from the text of On <b>Thermonuclear</b> <b>War.</b> Louis Menand observes, [...] "In Kahn’s book, the Doomsday Machine is an example of the sort of deterrent that appeals to the military mind but that is dangerously destabilizing. Since nations are not suicidal, its only use is to threaten." ...|$|E
2500|$|Research {{shows that}} since 1300, the only periods with {{significant}} declines in wealth inequality in Europe were the Black Death {{and the two}} World Wars. Historian Walter Scheidel posits that, since the stone age, only extreme violence, catastrophes and upheaval {{in the form of}} total war, Communist revolution, pestilence and state collapse have significantly reduced inequality. He has stated that [...] "only all-out <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>war</b> might fundamentally reset the existing distribution of resources" [...] and that [...] "peaceful policy reform may well prove unequal to the growing challenges ahead." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{appearance}} on Meet the Press with other minor party candidates in October 1976, LaRouche predicted monetary collapse followed by <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>war</b> before summer if Jimmy Carter were elected. LaRouche also described Carter as [...] "a nitwit to begin with, an empty slop jar into which bad lemonade is being poured." [...] However, conservative Republicans like President Ford fared better, incongruously so, given the Labor Party's stated left-wing stance. [...] "I call them honest Americans", LaRouche said. He described Ford as [...] "weak but well-meaning" [...] and [...] "a known quantity we can live with".|$|E
2500|$|At {{first the}} party was leftist, [...] "preaching Marxist revolution." [...] A state leader {{described}} {{the aims of the}} party and its organ, New Solidarity, as supporting the working class against capitalism, Nelson Rockefeller, and Leonard Woodcock, head of the United Auto Workers. The USLP predicted collapse of the monetary system by November 1976 and <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>war</b> by 1977. It opposed the Rockefeller family and had a reputation for harassing the Communist Party, the United Auto Workers, and other political foes. In a 1974 interview, the USLP candidate for Governor of Michigan characterized the Watergate scandal as a [...] "deliberate attempt" [...] to discredit Richard Nixon and weaken the presidency.|$|E
2500|$|The 2006 game DEFCON by UK-based {{independent}} developer Introversion Software {{puts the}} player {{in charge of}} one of six world territories in a situation which inevitably deteriorates to global <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>war.</b> The game uses a graphical and audio style which deliberately evokes images from films such as WarGames, cited by the developers as a major inspiration. With the sense that nuclear war is being commanded by distant generals in deep underground bunkers using abstract images, the game gives an unsettling impression of how popular culture imagined nuclear war would look to the people responsible for starting it. Because [...] "Everybody Dies", DEFCON {{is extremely difficult to}} win, as all sides will inevitably suffer nuclear attack. In the game's terminology, the victor is the player who 'loses the least'.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, on April 7, 2011, {{the band}} {{released}} a music video for their song [...] "This Is Why We Fight". Directed by Aaron Stewart-Ahn, the video depicts {{a band of}} teenagers living in a bleak, post-apocalyptic society. Disgusted with the tyrannical rule of their [...] "king", one boy and one girl lead a splinter group away from the camp. Outraged, the king and his forces attack, but the video cuts to black before any resolution can be seen. In August, an eight-song set was released on iTunes featuring six previously released tracks and two new covers: Leonard Cohen’s “Hey, That’s No Way To Say Goodbye” and the Fruit Bats’ “When U Love Somebody.” Later that month, a new music video was debuted for the track entitled [...] "Calamity Song". The video depicts a game, played on a tennis court by children, of simulated <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>war</b> {{as described in the}} [...] "Eschaton" [...] scene of David Foster Wallace's novel Infinite Jest.|$|E
2500|$|In , Captain Price {{launches}} a nuclear missile {{out of a}} nuclear submarine - however, instead of attacking land, he detonates it in the stratosphere, destroying the International Space Station and creating an electro-magnetic pulse throughout the eastern seaboard of the United States in order to disable all invading Russian tech sources and turn the tide of battle in America's favor. Also, in multiplayer gameplay, a person that has received 25 kills (or 24 with the second tier perk upgrade called hardline) without dying can call in a [...] "tactical nuke" [...] to end the game. There is also a hidden game mode in multiplayer that {{is very difficult to}} access in any public multiplayer game, entitled Global <b>Thermonuclear</b> <b>War,</b> in which opposing teams fight for control of a backpack nuke and a mutual bomb site similar to the Demolition game mode; the nuclear bomb takes considerably longer for each team to plant, and after successful detonation of the device, the game ends similarly as it would if someone detonated a tactical nuke in normal gameplay outside of the hidden game mode.|$|E
2500|$|Some non-fiction {{works of}} the time {{had an effect on}} {{cultural}} works. Herman Kahn's innovative non-fiction book On <b>Thermonuclear</b> <b>War,</b> (1961) described various nuclear war scenarios, including the possibility of a [...] "Doomsday Machine" [...] (a [...] "thought experiment" [...] described by Leo Szilard after the first Teller-Ulam thermonuclear weapon test, but before relatively small, deliverable thermonuclear weapons were developed in 1954). The 1964 film [...] was a black comedy inspired by the Doomsday Machine meme and, loosely, by Peter George's 1958 novel Red Alert. (Menand, 2005). [...] George later wrote the novelization of Dr. Strangelove, in which the action of the screenplay is framed by a story of aliens reconstructing the events leading to the death of the human race. Fail-Safe (novel 1962) (film 1964) (live-TV remake 2000) portrayed the accidental thermonuclear bombing of Moscow after failure of the US Air Force Strategic Air Command's nuclear command and control system. The Bedford Incident, a 1965 film based on the 1961 novel of the same name, depicts a tense game of naval cat and mouse in the far North Atlantic between the fictional destroyer USS Bedford and a Soviet submarine caught violating Greenland territorial waters. The novel ends as the Bedford accidentally fires a nuclear-tipped ASROC missile at the submarine, and the Soviet submarine responds by firing four nuclear torpedoes. The War Game (BBC TV film, 1965) was a mockumentary film about the effects of nuclear war on England. Pierre Boulle's 1963 novel Planet of the Apes was set on a far-future Earth ruled by apes after a nuclear war that destroyed mankind; the novel was adapted into a movie of the same name which spawned four sequels. Damnation Alley (1977), the movie adaptation of a Roger Zelazny short story. featured a chilling launch and destruction sequence, followed by a trek across a ruined America; Taiyō o Nusunda Otoko / The Man Who Stole the Sun (1979), When the Wind Blows (British graphic novel 1982, animated film 1986) {{is the story of a}} middle-aged British couple, Jim and Hilda, who naively assume that World War III will be no worse than World War II. Special Bulletin was a 1983 made-for-TV movie about anti-nuclear activists detonating a home built nuclear device in Charleston, South Carolina, the film was shot in a live breaking news show format.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{the obvious}} direct {{destruction}} of cities by nuclear blasts, the potential {{aftermath of a}} nuclear war could involve firestorms, a nuclear winter, widespread radiation sickness from fallout, and/or the temporary loss of much modern technology due to electromagnetic pulses. Some scientists, such as Alan Robock, have speculated that a <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>war</b> {{could result in the}} end of modern civilization on Earth, in part due to a long-lasting nuclear winter. In one model, temperatures following a full <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>war</b> fall for several years by 7 to 8 degrees Celsius on average. The accuracy of such models are often the subject of partisan dispute.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the threat}} of global <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>war</b> was {{foremost}} {{in the minds of}} most during the Cold War, both the Soviet and Western governments put enormous resources into developing chemical and biological weapons.|$|E
