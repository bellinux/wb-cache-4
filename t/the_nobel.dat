5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. <b>The</b> <b>Nobel</b> lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> banquet), but this is not mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E

Two Nobel Prize laureates in Chemistry, Germans Richard Kuhn (1938) and Adolf Butenandt (1939), were not allowed by their government to accept the prize. They would later receive a medal and diploma, but not the money. Frederick Sanger is one out of two laureates to be awarded <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> prize twice in the same subject, in 1958 and 1980.
