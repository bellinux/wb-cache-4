On Sunday mornings, congregants {{meet at the}} temple for Sunday School, which begins with prayers and hymns. After that, the preacherusually a ministerpresides over a talk during which he reads from the Bible and presents the material to be covered throughout the week. During the <b>talk,</b> <b>it</b> is common for members of either sex to read a cited verse from the Bible. At {{the end of the}} talk, more hymns and prayers are recited and voluntary offerings are given. Sunday evening services begin with hymns and prayers, after which members of the congregation of both sexes recite from the Bible or sing hymns. A shorter talk is held with the aim of deepening the Sunday School's talk.|$|E

Rather than try to avoid discussing those feelings, allow the individual to <b>talk</b> <b>it</b> out. Sitting and listening, without providing too much feedback to the substance itself, can offer enough support for the person to feel better. Once the grievances are released, it may become easier to negotiate.|$|E
25|$|During {{everyday}} {{interactions with}} other people Genie inconsistently applied what linguistic abilities she possessed, although her use of both vocabulary and grammar remained better in imitation than in her own spontaneous speech. Her ability and willingness to engage in verbal interactions steadily increased during her stay with the Riglers, and she used her language to serve a progressively larger number of functions. Nonetheless, she continued to speak very little, {{and when she did}} <b>talk</b> <b>it</b> was almost always in utterances significantly shorter than she was actually able to spontaneously produce. Because of this, the scientists wrote that it was extremely difficult to analyze her comprehension and use of grammar in conversations.|$|E

25|$|After {{a protest}} {{turned into a}} siege, Uthman refused to {{initiate}} any military action, {{in order to avoid}} civil war between Muslims, and preferred negotiations. After the negotiations, the protestors returned but found a man following them, holding an order to execute the protestors. The protestors returned and Uthman swore that he did not write the order. He refuted the claim and tried to <b>talk</b> <b>it</b> through. The protestors demanded he retire from being a caliph. Uthman refused and returned to his room. This emboldened the protestors and they broke into Uthman's house and killed him while he was reading the Qur'an. It was later discovered that it was not his autograph, but a forgery under his cousin Mu'awiya's autograph.|$|E
25|$|In early August, Hansen {{suggested}} to Rigler that he take custody of Genie if authorities rejected Butler's application, and Rigler initially {{balked at the}} idea but decided to <b>talk</b> <b>it</b> over with his wife, Marilyn; Marilyn had graduate training {{as a social worker}} and had just completed a graduate degree in human development, and had previously worked in nursery schools and Head Start Programs. The Riglers had three adolescent children of their own, which Jay Shurley said made them consider themselves more suitable guardians for Genie than Butler. They ultimately decided that, if no one else would, they were willing to temporarily care for Genie until another suitable foster home became available. Rigler acknowledged the proposed arrangement would clearly put him in a dual relationship with her, but Children's Hospital and authorities decided that, in the absence of other adequate options, they would consent to making the Riglers Genie's temporary foster parents.|$|E

Subsequently, Peter and Olivia had separated; Peter going to search for Etta, who had been taken by the Observers, and Olivia joining Walter in fighting them. Etta takes them to a hidden facility where human resistance members have found the device that Olivia had been trying to locate, the Transilience Thought-Unifier Model-11, which is capable of restoring Walter's thoughts, though they believe the device to be non-functional. While there, they are able to track Walter's capture to a secured Observer facility. Etta uses her Fringe credentials to break into the facility and recover Walter. Afterwards, Windmark connects Etta to images of a young girl from Walter's mind.|$|E

[...] Sherlock deduces that she intentionally shot him in a non-lethal spot and called an ambulance. Sherlock tells John that he observes John's addiction to danger and that John was most probably attracted to Mary because of her hidden past. Mary gives John a memory stick containing information on her, marked with her true initials A. G. R. A., telling him the contents will destroy his love for her. After not viewing the memory stick for a few months, John decides to destroy it without reading it and realises he loves Mary unconditionally. The couple spend Christmas with the Holmes brothers at their parents' home, where Sherlock takes the opportunity to drug everyone but John so that they can steal Mycroft's laptop. [...] Sherlock takes a hesitant John to meet Magnussen at his estate, Appledore, which he believes contains Magnussen's blackmail archive.

500|$|According to Greno and Howard, the {{decision}} to make Pascal and Maximus non-speaking characters has been appreciated by both critics and audiences alike, explaining, [...] "We've gotten so many compliments about him and Pascal ... {{and so many people}} saying: 'Thank you for not making them talk.'" [...] Hailing Pascal and Maximus as [...] "delightful supporting characters who continue yet another Disney custom without saying a word of dialogue", Leonard Martin of Indiewire compared Pascal to a [...] "comic Greek chorus" [...] while dubbing Maximus [...] "an extraordinarily expressive equine adversary ... who earns many of the movie's biggest laughs. Similarly, The Wall Street Journals Joe Morgenstern wrote, [...] "No one voices Maximus ... but he steals every scene he's in", while calling Pascal [...] "endearing". The Quad-City Times Linda Cook reviewed, [...] "it's fun to watch the animal sidekicks express themselves, not through words, but facial expressions and body movements. The critters provide much of the comedy", while Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times penned, [...] "No talking animals here, although when they're as amusing as a loyal chameleon and a horse who's partly bloodhound and cop-flick action hero, they don't need to speak", joking that the Brothers Grimm [...] "probably wouldn't object." [...] ABC Online [...] "like the way the animals were used", explaining, [...] "They don't <b>talk</b> ... <b>it</b> really is funny", accrediting this to executive producer John Lasseter's influence on the film. Criticizing the script's [...] "abundant chatter," [...] Justin Chang of Variety commended the filmmaker's [...] "shrewd decision to have the animal sidekicks ... express themselves without the benefit of speech." [...] Similarly, Richard Corliss of Time wrote that both characters [...] "radiate plenty of personality without speaking." ...|$|E
