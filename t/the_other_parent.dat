5|$|Split custody is an {{arrangement}} whereby one parent has full-time custody over some children, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> has full custody {{over the other}} children.|$|E
5|$|Even in a {{joint custody}} arrangement, parents may follow a more {{conventional}} division of parenting time. For example, children may spend weekends and some holidays with one parent, but spend most weekdays with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1998, Meredith's team {{realized}} that Plavac Mali was not Zinfandel {{but rather that}} one was the parent of the other. In 2000 they discovered that Primitivo/Zinfandel was one parent of Plavac Mali. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> of Plavac Mali was determined by Ivan Pejić and Edi Maletić (University of Zagreb) to be Dobričić, an ancient variety from the Adriatic island of Šolta.|$|E

5|$|Many {{parenting}} schedules {{for joint}} physical custody provide for a more equal time share between parents. For example, parents may choose a form of alternating custody, pursuant to which the children live {{for a period of}} time with one parent, and then for a similar amount of time with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although both Susanna and Beale {{think they}} deserve full custody, {{their desire to}} keep Maisie is {{primarily}} to spite each other, and they are quick to pawn her off onto <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> when looking after her becomes inconvenient. Maisie's time is split between staying with each of her parents, though her primary caregivers become Lincoln and Margo as Susanna leaves on a tour and Beale disappears on business trips.

5|$|In {{a divorce}} or child custody case between {{unmarried}} parents, a judge {{will address the}} joint legal custody rights of the parents. In a custody order, it's common for one parent to have physical custody and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> {{to have some sort}} of visitation rights, but legal custody is awarded separately. Thus, even when one parent is the primary custodian, joint legal custody may be awarded either to both of the parents or to only one of the parents, depending on state law and the facts of the case.|$|E

5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. For example, if the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Riesling was {{sometimes}} {{claimed to have}} originated from wild vines of the Rhine region, without much support to back up that claim. More recently, DNA fingerprinting by Ferdinand Regner indicated that one parent of Riesling is Gouais blanc, known to the Germans as Weißer Heunisch, a variety that, while rare today, was widely grown by the French and German peasantry of the Middle Ages. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> is {{a cross between a}} wild vine and Traminer. It is presumed that the Riesling was born somewhere in the valley of the Rhine, since both Heunisch and Traminer have a long documented history in Germany, but with parents from either side of the Adriatic the cross could have happened anywhere on the way.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E

25|$|Trisomy 18 (47,XX,+18) {{is caused}} by a meiotic {{nondisjunction}} event. With nondisjunction, a gamete (i.e., a sperm or egg cell) is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 18; the gamete thus has 24 chromosomes.

25|$|Inheritance of {{multiple}} mutations tends to infer more serious disease.

Many parents die on the trip, killed by exhaustion or by predators (such as the leopard seal), dooming their chicks back at the breeding ground.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} shared {{parenting}} {{has been demonstrated}} to reduce parental conflict by requiring parents to cooperate and compromise, {{and that it is}} the lack of constraint by one parent resulting from the ability of that parent to exclude the other, that results in increased parental conflict. He further states that only when child support guidelines exceed true costs do parents ask for or seek to prevent changes in parenting time for financial reasons, adding that any argument that a parent is asking for increased parenting time to reduce child support {{is at the same time}} an argument that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent</b> is making a profit from child support.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to test first the {{validity}} of the social learning model, in which children’s externalizing behavior (EB) is considered to be related to problematic parenting, and second, whether and to what extent mothers and fathers moderate the influence of each <b>other’s</b> <b>parenting</b> on children’s EB. Two models were tested with a set of longitudinal prospective data collected from 419 mothers and 419 fathers. The first model tested the relations between parental self-efficacy beliefs at 4 years of age, parenting behaviors at age 5 and child’s EB at age 6. The second model tested the moderating effect of parenting behavior displayed by one parent on the way in which <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent’s</b> concurrent beliefs and subsequent behaviors impact on their child’s EB. The results mainly supported the first model, in particular the bidirectional relations between parents’ controlling behavior and children’s EB. The second model did not fit the data well. The existence of a moderating role of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>parent’s</b> behavior was only demonstrated for the relation between mothers’ or fathers’ controlling behaviors and children’s EB. Very similar results were found for mothers and fathers. The results are discussed for their research and clinical implications...|$|R
