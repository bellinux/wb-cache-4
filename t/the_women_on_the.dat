5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed from most of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Revising Committee in {{that she did not}} feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage was the story of Adam and Eve.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{ordered his}} men not to harass <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> train, but the guerrillas robbed {{all of the}} men, finding over $9,000 and taking the soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the {{captured}} Union soldiers to form a line and {{announced that he would}} keep one for a prisoner exchange, but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them not to put out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted of the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.|$|E

25|$|During the First World War in England {{there was}} a growing {{interest}} in women's football and Dick, Kerr & Co. {{was the name of}} the Preston munitions factory where most of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team worked.

25|$|In Orthodox synagogues, {{the dancing}} is mainly {{carried out by}} men and boys; {{children}} (even young girls) may also dance with their fathers. Women and older girls often have their own dancing circles sometimes with the Torah scrolls, or look on {{from the other side}} of a mechitza (partition), in accordance with the value of tzniut (modesty). In 2014, an Israeli modern Orthodox rabbinical organization called Beit Hillel ruled that women are permitted to dance with a Torah scroll on Simchat Torah. They also recommended in their ruling designating a woman as the kallah Torah, or bride of the Torah, just as a man is designated as the chatan Torah, or groom of the Torah, and making sure there is enough dance space for the women, as well as consulting with <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> songs that will be sung.|$|E

This gives Charlie an idea ("Land of Lola" [...] reprise), and he invites Lola {{to come to the}} factory to help him design a women's boot that can be comfortable for a man ("Charlie's Soliloquy"/"Step One").|$|E

2500|$|Salmon {{was caught}} {{using a variety}} of methods, the most common being the fishing weir. These traps allowed skilled hunters to easily spear a good amount of fish with little effort. Fish weirs were {{regularly}} used on the Cheakamus River, which takes its name from the village of Chiyakmesh. [...] This translates into People of the Fish Weir, denoting the weir utilized in this area. This method of fishing required extensive cooperation between the men fishing and <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shore doing the cleaning.|$|E
2500|$|Every {{episode of}} the show was {{outlined}} by the production team first, co-executive producer Tina Gazzerro stated, {{to ensure that a}} producible episode will result. [...] "We try to identify where we get our discovery moments, our 'Ah-ha!' moments", Gazzerro told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Information about the event under investigation may also be held back from the students in order to create dramatic tension, and only situations which will have a conclusive outcome are investigated. [...] "We may have information we don't give to [...] ", Gazzerro said, [...] "but {{we need to make sure}} [...] produceable." [...] Story arcs were also outlined for each [...] "character" [...] on the show, and the production team had publicly expressed its hope that a romantic relationship would develop between the research team leader Ryan Buell and one of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> series. The production team and the show's researchers say that no pressure was put on the research team to act in certain ways or make paranormal discoveries.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{concluding}} Chapter VII, [...] "The Anathemata: a plague journal", {{bits of the}} whole now and again appear to be laid out. Shifting from the omniscient viewpoint of the first six chapters, this chapter comprises numerous journal entries from the notebook, all of which appear to be by Kid. Several passages from this chapter have, however, already appeared verbatim earlier in the novel when Kid reads what {{was already in the}} notebook—written when he received it. In this chapter rubrics run along beside many sections of the main text, mimicking the writing as it appears in the notebook. (In the middle of this chapter, a rubric running contains the following sentence: I have come to to wound the autumnal city.) Recalling Kid's entry into the city, the final section contains a near paragraph-for-paragraph echo of his initial confrontation with <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bridge. This time, however, the group leaving is almost all male, and the person entering is a young woman who says almost exactly what Kid did himself {{at the beginning of his}} stay in Bellona.|$|E
