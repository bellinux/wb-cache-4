In this paper we report measurements of the detailed spectroscopy of rare earth dopants in both an oxyfluoride transparent glass ceramic and its glass precursor.

30|$|In a HSI, a <b>rare</b> {{signal is}} <b>the</b> {{one that is}} {{represented}} by only a few number of pixels, while the abundant signal {{is the one that}} contains a large number of pixels compared to a rare signal [17]. MWF and PARAFAC treat a HSI as a whole entity in the denoising operation; therefore, the abundant signals and <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> signals are processed together, which inhibits a drawback: <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> signals may be unintentionally removed. In fact, the energy of <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> signal is so weak compared to that of the abundant signal that the estimated signal subspace cannot include <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> signal, and as a result, <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> signal is removed. MWPT-MWF (multidimensional wavelet packet transform (MWPT) with multiway Wiener filter) has been proposed to overcome this drawback of MWF and PARAFAC [32]. Instead of treating the HSI as a whole entity, MWPT-MWF firstly decomposes the HSI into several coefficient sets, also called components, by employing MWPT, therefore the abundant signal and <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> signal can be separated. After this step, each component is filtered by MWF automatically. Because <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> signal and <b>the</b> abundant signal are separated into different components, the signal subspace in each component can be estimated more exactly.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>rare</b> earth metal (REM) {{content in}} some of the apatite-bearing iron ore {{deposits}} in Northern Sweden has been studied. The results are presented in two groups. The first group includes 19 specimens with the percentage of phosphorus varying between 4. 91 and 17. 57, in which <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> earth metal content is as follows: Kiirunavaara 6. 560 ppm, Maimberger 5, 760 ppm, Leveiiniemi 1, 545 ppm, Rektorn 3, 275 ppm, Haukivaara 5, 295 ppm, Henry 5, 210 ppm, Nukutusvaara 6, 730 ppm and Lappmalmen 5, 890 ppm. The second group comprises 44 samples from a drilled cross section in the Lower Hauki ore-bearing rock series. The correlation between <b>the</b> phosphorus and <b>rare</b> earth metal assays in the samples uggests that most of <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> earth content is associated with phosphate minerals. <b>The</b> <b>rare</b> earth metal content of the apatite-iron ores is between that of the Kola peninsula (USSR) apatites and the apatites in granite-pegmatites. <b>The</b> <b>rare</b> earth metal content in sedimentary and metamorphic rocks is commonly about the same as in the apatite-iron ore from Northern Sweden.

The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of <b>the</b> <b>rarest</b> species (for example, only about 2,000 short-tailed albatrosses are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.|$|E
5|$|Iridium was {{discovered}} in 1803 among insoluble impurities in natural platinum.
