5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States Bill of Rights. The idea of adding a Bill of Rights to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E
5|$|The Senate has 100 {{members with}} each state having two senators, elected at-large to six-year terms; {{one third of}} Senate seats are up for {{election}} every other year.

The President is not elected by direct vote, but by an indirect electoral college {{system in which the}} determining votes are apportioned to <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> District of Columbia.

5|$|The United States is {{a federal}} {{republic}} of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and eleven uninhabited island possessions.

5|$|In 1927, Earle Page {{handed down}} the first budget in deficit for the {{coalition}} government, and Bruce recognised that Australia's economic position was deteriorating. Federal and state debt that year totalled just over £1 billion, of which £305 million were war debts and the rest had been spent on development that had failed had deliver high returns. Nearly half of the total debt was owed to overseas lenders, principally those in London. Economic growth was slow, and far lower than the levels hoped. Exports and revenues were falling behind government needs, and investors had begun to express alarm at Australia's level of debt. Bruce persisted with his plans and believed that growing Australian exports were the key to rectifying the problems, thus justifying further investment and encouragement of population growth. The government did act to try to manage the debt problem. By the mid-1920s, states were borrowing at unsustainable rates to fund their own programs to compensate for dwindling revenues. In response, Bruce proposed that the responsibility for all government debts, Commonwealth and state, and the authority to acquire new debt, should be handed over to a National Loan Council in which all states would have one vote and the Commonwealth would have two votes and the casting vote. He also moved to abolish per capita payments to the states, {{to be replaced by}} a funding formula tied more to financial need. These two changes formed the Financial Agreement of 1927, the provisions of which were approved by referendum in 1928. These changes would prove to be amongst the most significant in Australian constitutional history, as the states had now lost much of their financial independence. Faced with severe financial pressures and an increasing reliance upon Commonwealth transfer payments, after some resistance the states consented, although vertical fiscal imbalance between <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth continued to be an enduring feature of Australian federal relations.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War {{it became}} {{increasingly}} clear that these legislative differences were creating unnecessary costs for companies operating nationally. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth co-operated {{in the formation of}} uniform national companies legislation which passed in each jurisdiction by 1962. The difficulty with this scheme was that it did not provide for uniformity in amendment of the legislation and with changes of government and policy each state's legislation once again developed on separate lines.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} a {{continuing}} contest between <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> national government over {{the power of the}} latter—and over the loyalty of the citizenry—almost since the founding of the republic.

50|$|Citizens' {{brand of}} {{community}} organising is distinctive because it deliberately {{sets out to}} build permanent alliances of citizens to exercise power in society. It sees {{its role in the}} UK's political system as determinant of the distinction between Civil Society from <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Market. In a totalitarian Society all three may virtually coincide. In a fully democratic society the three will be distinct. Where <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> market become predominant, even in a democracy, civil society is reduced on the one hand to voting and volunteering <b>and</b> on <b>the</b> other to consuming. This can undermine democracies because the sense of citizenship and agency becomes weak and ineffective. In other words, Civil Society becomes powerless. Community organising <b>and</b> <b>the</b> role of the professional Community Organiser is working out how to take back power from <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Market by holding them accountable. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> market cannot operate without moral values and direction. It is not the role of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> or <b>the</b> market to determine those values. In a democratic society {{there has to be a}} genuine public discourse concerning justice <b>and</b> <b>the</b> common good.|$|R
