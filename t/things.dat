And very smug … I'm in that mode now, so {{hopefully}} I'll stay {{in it for}} a while … I've got a {{few more}} <b>things</b> planned—at least a couple more albums, some EPs, <b>things</b> like that. Some more dance-y <b>things</b> I did about 10 years ago. Experimental <b>things,</b> noise <b>things,</b> weird <b>things.</b> Shitloads of stuff. They're all pretty much ready to go.|$|E
5|$|Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I mostly {{only know}} <b>things</b> are {{different}} because {{people ask me}} different questions, but I don't feel like <b>things</b> are very changed. I mean, I still, I do the same <b>things</b> that I did before … I think about the same <b>things,</b> so … I'm {{the wrong kind of}} person to be really big and famous.|$|E

6000|$|What, then, is the {{character}} which is possessed in common by states of circumstances so heterogeneous and discordant as these: one <b>thing</b> like another; one <b>thing</b> unlike another; one <b>thing</b> near another; one <b>thing</b> far from another; one <b>thing</b> before, after, along with another; one <b>thing</b> greater, equal, less, than another; one <b>thing</b> {{the cause of}} another, the effect of another; one person the master, servant, child, parent, debtor, creditor, sovereign, subject, attorney, client, of another, and so on? ...|$|R
50|$|Thus in what {{actually}} exists as a subsisting extramental <b>thing,</b> {{there is an}} ‘essence’ which makes the <b>thing</b> to be what it is (a horse, for example), and the actus essendi which makes the <b>thing</b> to be a real, individual, existing <b>thing.</b>|$|R

5|$|Due to the series' popularity, {{people who}} {{constantly}} complain and are irritated by minor <b>things</b> are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British media. Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely {{in proportion to}} the <b>things</b> that happen to him.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all natural <b>things</b> as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms. This {{was part of}} a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all <b>things</b> have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of how new types of living <b>things</b> could come to be.|$|E

5|$|It {{became a}} game, with Feiffer {{trying to draw}} <b>things</b> the way he wanted, and Juster trying to {{describe}} <b>things</b> that were impossible to sketch. These included the Triple Demons of Compromise—one short and fat, one tall and thin, and the third exactly like the first two. Feiffer got his revenge by depicting the author as the Whether Man, clad in a toga.|$|E
5|$|It was inevitable...

5|$|Living <b>things</b> like orchids, hummingbirds, and the peacock's tail have {{abstract}} designs with {{a beauty}} of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match. The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, {{notably in the}} mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living <b>things</b> in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.|$|E
60|$|Did it ever strike you, that {{goodness}} is {{not merely}} A beautiful <b>thing,</b> but THE beautiful thing--by far the most beautiful <b>thing</b> in the world; and that badness {{is not merely}} AN ugly <b>thing,</b> but the ugliest <b>thing</b> in the world?--So that nothing is to be compared for value with goodness; that riches, honour, power, pleasure, learning, the whole world and all in it, are not worth having, in comparison with being good; and the utterly best <b>thing</b> for a man is to be good, even though he were never to be rewarded for it: and the utterly worst <b>thing</b> for a man is to be bad, even though he were never to be punished for it; and, in a word, goodness is the only <b>thing</b> worth loving, and badness the only <b>thing</b> worth hating.|$|R

5000|$|According to Eliade, in the archaic worldview, {{the power}} of a <b>thing</b> resides in its origin, so that [...] "knowing the origin of an object, an animal, a plant, and so on is {{equivalent}} to acquiring a magical power over them". The way a <b>thing</b> was created establishes that <b>thing's</b> nature, the pattern to which it should conform. By gaining control over the origin of a <b>thing,</b> one also gains control over the <b>thing</b> itself.|$|R
60|$|Such a {{principle}} cannot be any <b>THING</b> or OBJECT. Each <b>thing</b> {{is what it}} is in consequence of some other <b>thing.</b> An infinite, independent [52] <b>thing,</b> is no less a contradiction, than an infinite circle or a sideless triangle. Besides a <b>thing</b> is that, which is capable of being an object which itself is not the sole percipient. But an object is inconceivable without a subject as its antithesis.
