5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>problems</b> {{of the city as}} a whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money to refurbish the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Henry VI {{proved to}} be a weak king and {{vulnerable}} to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontations, such as the Percy–Neville feud. Without the common purpose of the war in France, Henry's cousin Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, used their networks to defy the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent as the population, agricultural production, prices, the wool trade and credit declined in the Great Slump. This led to radical demands from the lower classes. In 1450, Jack Cade raised a rebellion to force Henry to address <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>problems</b> or abdicate his throne. The uprising was suppressed but conflict remained between villagers, gentry and aristocracy. Society remained deeply unsettled and radical demands continued to be suppressed such as those from the yeoman brothers John and William Merfold.|$|E

Since {{the advent}} of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998. Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992. In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens Mobile and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt. Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>problems</b> of BenQ Siemens. It is currently Fly Emirates which is set to expire in 2018.

40|$|A {{practical}} {{formulation of}} <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> {{is based on}} treating the problem as a non-convex optimization problem in which the practical non-convex cost functions are taken into consideration. Formulating <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> as a non-convex optimization problem and finding a better quality {{solution to this problem}} has consumed {{a large portion of the}} research for decades. Almost all previously presented solutions to <b>the</b> non-convex <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> are centralized solutions. Recently, as a result of current research directions towards enabling the smart grid, a new research trend has emerged. This new research trend is to solve <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> using decentralized and distributed mechanisms. Among these mechanisms, the consensus on lambda approach is the best known mechanism. A drawback of this approach is that it can solve only <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> with convex cost functions; in addition, it lacks the appropriate mechanism for incorporating the transmission losses. This thesis presents a new decentralized approach for solving <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem.</b> <b>The</b> proposed approach consists of either two or three stages. In the first stage, a flooding-based consensus algorithm is proposed in order to achieve consensus among the agents with respect to the units and system data. In the second stage, a suitable algorithm is used for solving <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> locally by each agent. For cases in which a non-deterministic method is used in the second stage, a third stage is applied to achieve consensus on the final solution of the problem, with a flooding-based consensus algorithm for sharing the information required during this stage. The required communication time by the proposed approach has been approximated using JADE software. Four case studies were examined for validation purposes. The results show that the proposed approach is highly effective for both solving the non-convex formulation of <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> and incorporating transmission losses accurately in a fully decentralized manner. Moreover, the proposed approach can also be applied with some adaptation to solve <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> dispatch <b>problem</b> with convex cost functions; in this case, it is very competitive to the consensus on lambda approach. 4 month...|$|R

It covers the behavioral theory of the firm, game theory, agency theory, transaction cost economics, the economics of strategy, evolutionary approaches to organizations and complexity economics in a non-technical way. In the sixth edition (2017) the authors explain the impact of digitization on organizations and the business model of digital platforms (like Amazon, Airbnb, Uber).
