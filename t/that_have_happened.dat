But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

The show generally lasts an hour or more. The show is normally weekly, however, the frequency can change, especially during special events. When events such as the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) occur, the podcast has been known to be broadcast daily.|$|E
25|$|Notable events <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to Croydon's skyline {{include the}} Millennium project {{to create the}} largest single urban {{lighting}} project ever. It was created for the buildings of Croydon to illuminate them for the third millennium. Not only did this project give new lighting to the buildings, but it provided an opportunity to project onto them images and words, mixing art and poetry with coloured light, and also displaying public information after dark. Apart from increasing night time activity in Croydon and thereby reducing the fear of crime, it helped to promote the sustainable use of older buildings by displaying them in a more positive way.|$|E

25|$|In each episode, true {{historical}} dogfights of {{a certain}} battle or war are played out. Pilots from the actual fights are brought in to re-tell their accounts of the battles. Along with the battle, there are occasional scenes that describe the pilot's living conditions or events <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> outside the battle. Each battle is told by the pilot and a special narrator. CGI effects are used, providing a realistic simulation. The show also describes the aircraft, showing diagrams on screen and taking some time to describe {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of each plane. It also describes and illustrates the air maneuvers and tactics used by the pilots. Usually, the battles are told by pilots of the winning side of each war or battle. Occasionally, there are other variants brought into a battle besides the planes. For example, a pilot may recount their experience destroying ship fleets, bombing enemy air fields, or dealing with Anti Aircraft fire from the ground, but the process is interrupted by enemy planes. After each battle, the show usually features a short biography about the pilots and the conflicts they were involved in, and then the credits roll.|$|E

Both times as he crossed home plate, he looked up and pointed to the sky. [...] "That was for him", Youkilis said.

500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think I can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or things would have been avoided <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened,</b> that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E

Sitting at home now in Encinitas, in Southern California, at the age of 88, surrounded by the beautiful greens, multi-colored flowers, blue sky, clean air, and the Pacific Ocean, I often reminisce about all the wonderful places I have seen in the world. I cherish the memories of Paris, New York, and a few other places. But Varanasi seems to be etched in my heart!" ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} about Shiloh, Naylor said: [...] "Like a patchwork quilt, a novel {{is made up}} of things <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings." [...] Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was [...] "the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward on her belly, Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night.|$|E

Diodorus' view was <b>that</b> everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> must be true, and that therefore nothing is possible which can never be true.|$|R
500|$|As the 1950 Detroit Tigers season started, Houtteman {{was on a}} high note, {{pitching}} all {{of spring}} training without allowing a walk. He won his tenth {{game of the season}} on June 28, 1950, and became the first pitcher to hit the 10-win mark alongside Bob Lemon. After the game, he told an Associated Press reporter that he was just about convinced that Lady Luck had decided to give him a break after kicking him around for the past two or three years. Houtteman said, [...] "I've been having a pretty good year and it sure feels good after some of the things <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to me". A week into July, Houtteman notched his eleventh victory, and only lost five games, in a 6–1 win against the St. Louis Browns. Just a few days later, Houtteman was named to the All-Star roster alongside fellow Tigers including Ted Gray, George Kell and Hoot Evers. In the 1950 All-Star game, Houtteman pitched three innings and batted once. He allowed one earned run, three hits, and one walk, his one earned run coming in the ninth inning on a Ralph Kiner home run that made the game go to extra innings.|$|E
500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of times when I have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him a couple of things <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Us Weekly, Makeba Riddick, who assisted with the song's vocal production, spoke about {{the inspiration for the}} song. Riddick explained that Ester Dean had come up with a concept for the song, and had been working with Stargate to develop it. Upon hearing it, Riddick and Rihanna expressed interest in the song but thought that some changes were needed, and sent it to Riddick for completion. Riddick also explained where the idea for some of the sexually provocative lyrics came from: [...] "I was listening to the words and me and [...] and we were just laughing and talking about so many situations <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> in the past and that happen to women everywhere. By the time we were done of course, we were laughing and giggling about the lyrics [...] surprisingly everybody went nuts over the song." [...] Dean explained the development of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] in {{an interview}} with The Boom Box, and said that she wanted to channel Rihanna's alter ego and use it as inspiration for the song's lyrics. Dean praised Rihanna's ability to take risks with her music, saying [...] "I think Rihanna is sexy and will say things that other chicks won't say. Even if she says let's go kiss some girls, who really cares...that's Rihanna. Music is about fantasy. This is what people want to do, but are afraid to do." ...|$|E
