50|$|The terms bitumen and {{pyrobitumen}} have related definitions in the earth’s {{crust and}} in the laboratory. In geology, bitumen {{is the product of}} deposition and maturation of organic matter, and the extractable organic material (EOM) by organic solvents in petroleum source rocks and reservoir rocks is defined as bitumen. Upon exposure to high regional temperatures over geological time, bitumen is converted to pyrobitumen {{as a result of the}} thermally activated reactions that drive off lighter oil and gas products and leave an insoluble, carbon-rich residue. Pyrobitumen represents a significant fraction of the ultimate fate of petroleum liquids formed from kerogen during catagenesis. In the laboratory, experiments on organic-rich rocks (oil shales and petroleum source rocks), decomposition of the initially insoluble organic matter (defined as kerogen) produces gaseous and liquid products. The soluble fluid that remains in the heated rock is defined as bitumen. Upon further <b>thermal</b> <b>exposure,</b> the bitumen continues to evolve and disproportionates into pyrobitumen and more oil and gas.|$|E

This review examines evidence of a causal link between <b>thermal</b> <b>exposures</b> and increases in obesity prevalence, focusing on acute and longer-term biological effects {{of time spent in}} thermal comfort compared with mild cold. Reduced exposure to seasonal cold may have a dual effect on energy expenditure, both minimizing the need for physiological thermogenesis and reducing thermogenic capacity. Experimental studies show a graded association between acute mild cold and human energy expenditure over the range of temperatures relevant to indoor heating trends. Meanwhile, recent studies of the role of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in human thermogenesis suggest that increased time spent in conditions of thermal comfort can lead to a loss of BAT and reduced thermogenic capacity. Pathways linking cold exposure and adiposity have not been directly tested in humans.

40|$|Extreme {{environmental}} {{temperatures are}} considered amongst many {{potential sources of}} infrastructural disfunctioning. This phenomenon emerges severely {{when it comes to}} the adoption of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) in strengthening civil infrastructures due to the vulnerability of one FRP constituent, viz. polymer matrix, and most critically, the interfacial adhesive layer to extreme exposures. Accordingly, the main concern of the research program described in this thesis is in characterizing the bonding aspects between steel adherends and carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) at predefined non-ambient temperatures from both extremes, viz. subzero and elevated <b>thermal</b> <b>exposures.</b> In this research, the basic material and geometrical configuration of the experimental specimens is wet lay-up CF 130 RP and CF 530 RP composite reinforcement bonded to steel plates in double-strap joint configuration. Extensive literature reviews on the effect of extreme <b>thermal</b> <b>exposures</b> on different FRP strengthened real-life and small scale structural members were conducted. However, it is shown that most of published research is highlighting the synergistic detrimental effects within the durability context, in general. In addition, much more insight is paid in studying FRP strengthened concrete structures compared to steel substrata. Another distinguished feature in past studies is the scatter and divergence in behavioural trends of the non-ambient exposure FRP joints and the tendency to generalize those trends on all CFRP-steel joints without displaying adequate emphasis on the key roles played by the mechanical and thermal attributes of CFRP components, individually. In the experimental program, a new fabricating procedure of the composite double-strap joint was devised in an attempt to optimize the quality control and thus maximize the reliability of the results. Three different commercially available epoxide resins and two different-moduli carbon fibres were involved in the production of composite joints. All specimens were sUbjected to direct tensile testing at their predetermined <b>thermal</b> <b>exposures</b> after concluding their corresponding thermal stabilization procedure. Mixed-mode failure (i. e. either two or three patterns) was the prominent experimental failure pattern within almost all specimens. The outcome of the experimental research has emphasized the key effect of CFRP constituents, viz. the adhesive (i. e. epoxy) and CF reinforcing fibres, on the joints capacities, failure patterns, and CFRP strain and stress distributions, at all experimented temperatures. The theoretical and numerical validations of the experimental results were reasonably good in terms of all of the aforementioned parameters and at both ambient and extreme <b>thermal</b> <b>exposures.</b> Some experimental strain-capturing practices were highlighted as possible sources of divergence from theoretical and numerical models which was confined only to the vicinity of both bondlength lap ends, and at load levels much higher than normal service loads of the joints. The well-established stress-based method for predicting joint capacities in conjunction with triggering failure pattern from FE models was implemented by applying the suitable failure criteria. This method which was investigated previously, mainly in terms of ambient <b>thermal</b> <b>exposures,</b> has proved its effectiveness in predicting failure loads for the current extreme-exposures composite joints...|$|R

50|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBC) are highly advanced materials systems usually applied to metallic surfaces, such as on gas turbine or aero-engine parts, operating at elevated temperatures, {{as a form}} of exhaust heat management. These 100 μm to 2 mm coatings serve to insulate components from large and prolonged heat loads by utilizing thermally insulating materials which can sustain an appreciable temperature difference between the load-bearing alloys and the coating surface. In doing so, these coatings can allow for higher operating temperatures while limiting the <b>thermal</b> <b>exposure</b> of structural components, extending part life by reducing oxidation and thermal fatigue. In conjunction with active film cooling, TBCs permit working fluid temperatures higher than the melting point of the metal airfoil in some turbine applications. Due to increasing demand for higher engine operation (efficiency increases at higher temperatures), better durability/lifetime, and thinner coatings to reduce parasitic weight for rotating/moving components, there is great motivation to develop new and advanced TBCs.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there is}} not a direct {{relationship}} between the classification systems in Figures 1 and 2, one kind of pyrobitumen is a subset of the post-oil solid bitumen formed by thermal degradation of kerogen and oil. Of the 27 samples investigated by Curiale, the three impsonite samples had the low solubility (<3%) and low H/C ratio (<0.9) characteristic of highly mature organic matter. These samples also had lowest asphaltene, highest aromatic, and highest volatile content in the soluble fraction. Carbon deposits associated with uranium nodules also had low solubilities and H/C ratios less than 1.0 and correspond to pyrobitumens with inorganic origins. For comparison, coal tar pitch has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.8.In the petroleum geochemistry community, pyrobitumen is the remains of thermally altered oil that was previously generated during kerogen maturation—much of that oil migrated to and accumulated in an oil reservoir. Petrographic studies of residues of hydrous pyrolysis, which {{is considered to be a}} good laboratory simulation of natural petroleum formation, show the formation of a continuous bituminous network during the early stages of kerogen transformation, some of which is converted to pyrobitumen at high <b>thermal</b> <b>exposure.</b> This definition is consistent with that given for pyrobitumen in the Society of Petroleum Engineers Glossary: “a hard, native asphalt within the rock pores. Does not ordinarily move or enter into reaction.” [...] Hunt uses this definition of thermally mature residue to calculate material balances for the fate of oil at very high maturities, both that retained in the source rock and that from reservoirs. Pyrobitumen in thermally mature oil reservoirs has been characterized by Hwang. [...] More recently, the pyrobitumen retained in the source rock is considered to play an important role in the storage and production of shale gas. [...] In oil shale retorting, pyrobitumen residue has an atomic H/C ratio of about 0.5 and is often called coke, which has its analog in the production of petroleum and coal cokes by destructive distillation.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} of Kevlar 49 fibres to thermal, ultrasonic and chemical environments have been analysed. Both the tensile strength and the tensile modulus deteriorate with <b>thermal</b> <b>exposures.</b> However, the former is more sensitive than the latter. The prominent crystal structural changes induced by <b>thermal</b> <b>exposures</b> are 13; reduction in crystallinity, molecular misalignment about the fibre axis, increase in the inter layer distance, changes in crystallite size and/or microstrain. Thermally induced macro changes include introduction of surface holes, partial hollowness near the core, localised thinning, material loss {{in the vicinity of}} surface impurities etc. The structural changes could be satisfactorily correlated with the corresponding changes in tensile properties. All the thermally induced effects are controlled by two parameters, viz., the temperature (T) and the duration of the cumulative exposure to T, tcum(T). The T-tcum(T) effect leads to the observation of isothermal decomposition of Kevlar over a range of temperatures which include Ts, far below the reported decomposition temperature of 500 / 550 xB 0;C. A hitherto unknown direct correlation between X-ray diffraction peak positions and the tensile strength has also been identified. Exposure to ultrasonic waves introduces axial compression, evinced by the formation of kink bands, fibrillation and macro buckling. The unit cell of axially compressed fibres manifests an anisotropic deformation. The process of moisture uptake by Kevlar 49 fibres is controlled by the relative humidity (RH) of ambient atmosphere.
