40|$|Subterranean clover Trifolium subterraneum L. cv. Woogenellup and {{perennial}} ryegrass Lolium perenne L. cv. <b>Tetralite</b> {{were exposed to}} SO 2 in open-top chambers at mean ambient concentrations of 164, 70 or 19 μg m− 3 for 48 days. Exposure to SO 2 {{had no effect on}} calorific value or ash concentration in subterranean clover or ryegrass, but exposure to 164 μg m− 3 of SO 2 decreased leaf protein concentrations in both species. Chlorophyll concentrations were decreased by exposure to 164 and 70 μg m− 3 of SO 2 in subterranean clover but not in ryegrass. Peroxidase activity increased with increasing SO 2 concentration and duration of exposure in subterranean clover, but not in ryegrass. Specific peroxidase activity was increased in both species by exposure to 164 μg m− 3 of SO 2 only. Root and shoot dry weights were not affected by exposure to SO 2...|$|E
