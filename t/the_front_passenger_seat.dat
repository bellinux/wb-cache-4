This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} {{restrictions}} on the new driver. For {{the first three months}} after receiving the license, he may drive only if there is an experienced driver sitting in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>seat,</b> — and <b>the</b> law additionally defines the requirements for the driver to be called [...] "experienced". The charges for violating traffic laws are much more heavy on the new driver; there is a list of traffic law violations that immediately cancel the new driver's license. Additional limitations apply on young drivers; i.e., if the new driver is younger than 21 years old, he may not transport more than two passengers without an experienced driver accompanying him in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R

25|$|In June 2016, {{a mother}} and her {{daughter}} were found deceased in their still-running Porsche Cayenne SUV against a guardrail on Florida's Turnpike, initially thought to be victims of Carbon monoxide poisoning.

25|$|The {{interior}} of the Range Rover was given a minor facelift, consisting mainly of redesigned and repositioned switchgear (which saw many of the originally BMW era designed items updated or replaced), along with new options never before available for Range Rover. The 2010 Range Rover also gained new visual display units as also seen in the new for 2010 Jaguar XJ (X351). This change consisted of a 12-inch TFT LCD virtual instrument panel, which replaces the conventional cluster design — instead 'virtual' gauges are displayed where physical analog gauges were previously. This allows various sets of information to be displayed as required — for example navigation and map information can be displayed instead of engine readouts, whilst {{when one of the}} off-road driving modes is selected on the Terrain Response system the 'gauges' are reorganised to provide space to display the schematic of the vehicle's suspension, steering and transmission systems. The other display unit is fitted to the centre console and uses a bi-directional screen to show different images depending on viewing angle (may not be available in the US). This allows navigational information to be displayed to the driver, whilst someone in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat</b> can use the same screen to use the onboard DVD player at the same time, for example. This system also contains a state-of-the-art multi-camera system from Valeo Vision Systems in Ireland, which allows the driver to see around the vehicle during manoeuvres and which contains multiple overlays and views.|$|E

Rovi Corporation|accessdate=April 14, 2011}} In {{the beginning of the}} video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile {{with a cup of coffee}} in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seat.</b> During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be [...] "ironic" [...] in itself since the video started with her at a gas station).

50|$|A {{motorized}} {{shoulder belt}} {{was added to}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>seating</b> position of US-market Acclaims in 1994, to comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208's requirement for passive restraints.

As a result, Canadian-market Acclaims continued to use a manual passenger seatbelt, and 1994-1995 Acclaims could not be legally imported in either direction. For 1995, its final year, the 2.5-liter engine got a slightly revised cylinder head and the 4-speed A604 automatic transmission and anti-lock brakes were both dropped. Otherwise, the Acclaim remained mostly unchanged during its 6-year run.|$|R

Similar construction for the entire 32 years of production made the Dodge Van very popular with upbuilders, service companies, and other fleets due to the compatibility of installable options from year to year without necessitating a redesign.|$|R
