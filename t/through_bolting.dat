50|$|Cross-bolting has two advantages: it couples the {{two sides}} of the {{crankcase}} together, making it stiffer overall and less prone to twisting. Secondly it helps to hold the bearing cap down against the downward force from the piston. This second advantage is usually only possible with blind bolts, as the dowel effect of a <b>through</b> <b>bolt</b> is less effective.|$|R
50|$|If slip-critical {{connections}} fail (by slipping), they {{revert to}} bearing-type connections, with structural forces now transferred <b>through</b> <b>bolt</b> shear and connection plate bearing. Thus a slippage {{failure of a}} slip-critical connection {{is not necessarily a}} catastrophic failure. However, slippage of a slip-critical connection in columns may lead to column instability. Slippage of a slip critical joint in a roof truss could result in unintended ponding effects.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of externally bonded sprayed {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (Sprayed GFRP) in shear strengthening of RC beams under quasi-static loading is investigated. Different techniques were utilized {{to enhance the}} bond between concrete and Sprayed GFRP, involving the use of <b>through</b> <b>bolts</b> and nuts paired with concrete surface preparation through sandblasting and {{through the use of a}} pneumatic chisel prior to Sprayed GFRP application. It was found that roughening the concrete surface using a pneumatic chisel and using <b>through</b> <b>bolts</b> and nuts were the most effective techniques. Also, Sprayed GFRP applied on 3 sides (U-shaped) was found to be more effective than 2 -sided Sprayed GFRP in shear strengthening. Sprayed GFRP increased the shear load-carrying capacity and energy absorption capacities of RC beams. It was found that the load-carrying capacity of strengthened RC beams was related to an effective strain of applied Sprayed GFRP. This strain was related to Sprayed GFRP configuration and the technique used to enhance the concrete-FRP bond. Finally, an equation was proposed to calculate the contribution of Sprayed GFRP in the shear strength of an RC beam...|$|R

30|$|Concrete anchors {{are needed}} to connect {{structural}} steel members and concrete. For example, reinforce concrete frames have been strengthened using steel braces (Badoux and Jirsa 1990), in which, the steel braces can be fixed to concrete beam/column ends using concrete anchors such as post-installed adhesive anchors or <b>through</b> <b>bolts.</b> The anchor bolts in such connections on the side faces of a concrete frame are subjected to cyclic shear during an earthquake, and the anchors have limited edge distance in the loading direction.|$|R

50|$|Owing {{to their}} high {{compression}} ratios and their high bmep, diesel engines place a high tensile stress on their cylinder block. Light alloy cylinder blocks have their usual weight advantages, but these must also withstand the high forces. Some designs, {{such as the}} US Hercules, achieve this by using long <b>through</b> <b>bolts.</b> In the Hercules design these are long studs with a nut at both top and bottom; they are prevented from rotating by an eccentric collar in the middle.|$|R
50|$|A cross-bolted bearing is a bearing, {{usually a}} {{crankshaft}} main bearing of a piston engine. Most bearing caps are retained by two bolts, {{one on each}} side of the bearing journal, and parallel to the cylinder axis. A cross-bolted bearing has one or more additional bolts, at right-angles to both the cylinder and crankshaft axes. These bolts may be either a single <b>through</b> <b>bolt</b> passing <b>through</b> the crankcase from one side to the other, or else two blind bolts threaded into the bearing cap from each side.|$|R

The double C {{steel section}} {{is made of}} two C steels with gusset plate <b>through</b> <b>bolts.</b> A ridge joint of double C steel is studied through {{experiment}} under cyclic loading in this paper. Through the four specimens with different gusset-plate’s thickness and bolt spacing, we analyze {{the effect of the}} gusset-plate’s thickness and bolt spacing on stiffness, ductility and energy performance. At last we recommend the suitable gusset-plate’s thickness. The results can give a reference to the engineering application of cold-formed steel structure...|$|R

The new Fully Integrated Robotised Engine was developed as part of this, to replace the previous range of small Fiat engines. Although taking the opportunity to update performance and emissions from Fiat's venerable 903cc pushrod engine, {{the primary goal of}} this new design was for easy assembly by robots. Key to this was the 'layer cake' construction of the new engine, held together by its long <b>through</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{transient}} {{behavior of}} structures with bolted joints when subjected {{to medium and}} high shock or impact loads can be challenging due to their nonlinear response, which is induced by the complex interactions between the bolts and the structure. While few researchers have considered shock transmission <b>through</b> <b>bolted</b> joints at low impact loading, there are little literature on shock transmission <b>through</b> <b>bolted</b> joints under high loading conditions. Low impact loading condition generally excites the lower order frequencies but under high impact loading higher order frequencies are excited. Typical factors that affect the response of a bolted joint include, preload (bolt tightening), intensity of the impact, and damping within the joint. The complexity in designing bolted joints under these conditions lies in the limitations of available methods to characterize their behavior. The main objective of this work is to develop computational tools for predicting the shock transmission <b>through</b> <b>bolted</b> joints under medium and high impacts. Examples of these impacts are blast loading and projectile impact. The effect of tightening torque of the bolts on the response is also studied. The strain rate effect of the bolts due to high impact loading is also studied. The study is done in two steps. The first step is a high impact study on a square flange system using a Two-stage gas gun. A steel plate is impacted using Lexan polycarbonate projectile at around 6 km/s. The impact surface is penetrated by the projectile on impact. The response acceleration is measured post joint. The second step would be to study medium impacts on a bolted connection using a circular fixture with a bolted lid to replicate a vessel. This structure is subjected to impact loading in a drop tower. The experiment is conducted at different pre-load torque for the bolts. The bolts are subjected to plastic deformation. The responses are measured using an accelerometer and a force sensor. For these two cases, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is performed. The bolts are modeled as solid elements. In both of these cases, strain rate effect is considered for both the structure and bolts. For high impact study using Two-stage gas gun, the impact region is modeled using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) technique and Lagrangian method is used for rest of the material. The simulation and experimental results from both cases are compared {{using a combination of}} Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and Shock Response Spectrum (SRS) ...|$|R

25|$|When a {{fastener}} is torqued, a tension preload develops in the bolt and an equal compressive preload develops in the parts being fastened. This can be modeled as a spring-like assembly {{that has some}} assumed distribution of compressive strain in the clamped joint components. When an external tension load is applied, it relieves the compressive strains induced by the preload in the clamped components, hence the preload acting on the compressed joint components provides the external tension load with a path (through the joint) other than <b>through</b> the <b>bolt.</b> In a well designed joint, perhaps 80-90% of the externally applied tension load will pass through the joint and the remainder <b>through</b> the <b>bolt.</b> This reduces the fatigue loading of the bolt.|$|R
40|$|Blind bolts allow {{technicians}} {{to connect}} the steel beam and Concrete Filled Circular Hollow Sections (CFCHS) column from the outside of CHS. In addition, using blind bolts as the connection may avoid the brittle behaviour generated by the welded connections.

This paper presents the results of finite element studies on pull-out behaviour of various dimensions of groups of headed anchor blind bolts (HABBs) embedded in CFCHS with various Dlt ratios in both 90 &# 0176; and 180 &# 0176; T-stub.
