5000|$|Though the Lobos {{gained more}} first downs and yards on offense than the Midshipmen, their three {{turnovers}} and Navy's extended {{drive in the}} third and fourth quarters led to the lopsided final score. The 14-minute, 26-second final drive from the Midshipmen, measured by its 26 total plays, set a record for the longest drive in a game. Prior to the contest, the NCAA had not kept a record for longest drive, but began keeping track for the 2005 edition of the record book. No drive in either college football or in the NFL has exceeded the record in terms of total plays or in time of possession since the game was played. At post-game press conferences, both coaches discussed the characteristics of the drive: I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> give the defense on the other side some credit because they kept us out of the end zone and we had 26 plays. I wasn't a lot of big plays, it was four yards, five yards. Running the clock was kinda just what the doctor ordered at that point in the game. Midshipmen Head Coach Paul Johnson [...] I've never seen a drive like that ... In fact it wasn't even as if we were playing bad defense. I think their average gain was 3.6 yards; we just couldn't make them punt. Lobos Head Coach Rocky Long ...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{explores the}} issue of {{participatory}} literacy education in the strong sense as learners exercising "active control, responsibility, and reward vis-a-vis {{some or all of}} program activities" (Fingeret and Jurmo, 1989, p. 18) in light of a case presentation of a program the author directed. While viewing the participatory ethos as inherently desirable, the article points out the problematic nature of implementing a model when neither the learners, the culture of the program itself, nor the sociocultural forces that influence it are strongly grounded in a participatory democratic ethic. Pragmatic strategies are required, then, that come to terms with current constraints while exploring new opportunities for creative growth. Such a process often requires vigorous staff leadership not over and against the needs and interests of learner participants, but in accordance with them. Participatory efforts may best be realized when they are integrated within such contexts rather than imposed from above as an ideal construct. What do we do when the people with whom we work don't show interest in the ideas of dialogical analysis and participatory decision making? (Jurmo, 1985, p. 10). First, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> respond to the group, answering the expectations of the group. Then you must become banking educators at that point. When they ask you to give knowledge as food you have to give it. But by starting this process, you have to begin to challenge them. Even if it means that you have just five minutes, you begin to challenge them about their expectations (Paulo Freire, cited in Jurmo, 1985, p. 12) ...|$|E
