40|$|This paper reports an {{analysis}} of interbasin and interlayer exchanges in the component ocean part of the coupled ECHAM 4 /OPYC 3 general circulation model, aimed at documenting the simulation of North Atlantic deep water (NADW) and related <b>thermohaline</b> <b>circulations</b> in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The modeled NADW is formed mainly in the Greenland-Iceland-Norwegian Seas through a composite effect of deep convection and downward cross-isopycnal transport. The modeled deep-layer outflow of NADW can reach 16 Sv near 30 S in the South Atlantic, with the corresponding upper-layer return flow mainly coming from the ''cold water path'' through Drake Passage. Less than 4 Sv of the Agulhas ''leakage'' water contribute to the replacement of NADW along the ''warm water path''. In the South Atlantic Ocean, the model shows that some intermediate isopycnal layers with potential densities ranging between 27. 0 and 27. 5 are the major water source for compensating the NADW return flow and for enhancing the circumpolar deep water (CDW) flowing from the Atlantic into Indian Ocean.

5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the <b>thermohaline</b> <b>circulation.</b> Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration.

5|$|The first {{forecast}} {{for the year}} was issued by CSU on December 11, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. The scenario considered most likely was that Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and <b>thermohaline</b> <b>circulation</b> (THC) would be stronger, but effects from El Niño would remain, resulting in a slightly above average season. The next most likely scenario was that both the AMO and THC would strengthen and the El Niño effects would cease to exist, causing a well above average season. In the other two scenarios, which were given the same probability of occurrence, the AMO and THC would weaken {{and the effects of}} El Niño would either disappear or some would remain, resulting in either a near average or well below average season.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{currents}} only {{affect the}} top few hundred meters (yards) of the sea, {{but there are}} also large-scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses. A main deep ocean current flows through all the world's oceans and is known as the <b>thermohaline</b> <b>circulation</b> or global conveyor belt. This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature. At high latitudes, the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out. Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks. From the deep sea near Greenland, such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses {{on either side of the}} Atlantic. When it reaches the Antarctic, it is joined by further masses of cold, sinking water and flows eastwards. It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Here it is gradually warmed, becomes less dense, rises towards the surface, and loops back on itself. Some flows back into the Atlantic. It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed.|$|E

40|$|The region {{south of}} South Africa is unique for {{studying}} the development of <b>thermohaline</b> <b>circulations.</b> We observe strong bottom currents, such as North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) that meet south west off South Africa and flow eastward through the Transkei Basin into the Indic.

25|$|Ocean {{currents}} greatly affect Earth's climate by transferring {{heat from}} the tropics to the polar regions.

Changes in the <b>thermohaline</b> <b>circulation</b> are thought to have significant impacts on Earth's energy budget.

25|$|Another {{possibility}} {{is that there was}} a slowing of <b>thermohaline</b> <b>circulation.</b> The circulation could have been interrupted by the introduction of a large amount of fresh water into the North Atlantic, possibly caused by a period of warming before the Little Ice Age known as the Medieval Warm Period.

Aquarius alongtrack retrieved SSS are assimilated into the ocean data assimilation component of Version 5 of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS- 5) assimilation and forecast model.

Second, for both the multiple equilibria and periodic solutions transitions, both Type-I (continuous) and Type-II (jump) transitions can occur, and precise criteria are derived in terms of two computable nondimensional parameters b 1 and b 2. Associated with Type-II transitions are the hysteresis phenomena, and the physical reality is represented by either metastable states or by a local attractor away from the basic solution, showing more complex dynamical behavior. Third, a convection scale law is introduced, leading to an introduction of proper friction terms in the model in order to derive the correct circulation length scale. In particular, the dynamic transitions of the model with the derived friction terms suggest that the THC favors the continuous transitions to stable multiple equilibria.

40|$|Evidence {{of rapid}} climatic {{oscillations}} like those {{observed in the}} Greenland ice cores and sediments from high latitudes of the northern Atlantic have been recognized in the pulses of terrigenous material to continental margin sediments off Cameroon. Fe/Ca ratios used as a parameter to quantify the relative proportions of terrigenous fluxes versus marine carbonate monitor the variability of the west African monsoon. They reveal the history of abrupt changes in precipitation over western and central Africa during the past 52 kyr. These rapid changes are particularly pronounced during the last glacial period and occur at timescales of a few thousand years. Stable oxygen isotope (delta 18 O) records of Globigerinoides ruber (pink) show high negative values reflecting periods of high monsoon precipitation.

The good correspondence between the warm interstadials of the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles from the GISP 2 ice core records and the high pulses of Fe/Ca sedimentation in our core suggest a strong teleconnection between the low-latitude African climate and the high-latitude northern hemisphere climate oscillations during the last glacial.

40|$|Reflection seismics, {{sediment}} drifts, bottom currents. - The region {{south of}} South Africa {{has been a}} crucial gateway for large scale <b>Thermohaline</b> <b>Circulations</b> since late Eocene times. Here, {{three of the most}} important currents for maintaining the global heat exchange, namely the warm and surface related Agulhas Current (AC), and the cold and denser North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) as well as the Atlantic Bottom Water (AABW), flow around South Africa. Due to the special tectonic and geologic situation, a huge amount of the deep and bottom water masses that flow around South Africa have to pass the narrow Agulhas Passage, located between the South African continental shelf and the submarine Agulhas Plateau. As a result, the sedimentary infill of the Transkei Basin, which is located east of the Agulhas Plateau, has been predominantly influenced by NADW and AABW activity since ~ 36 Ma. Via the analysis of this sedimentary infill, a palaeo current reconstruction of (proto-) NADW and (proto-) AABW revealed changing flow paths and flow strengths since then. These variations in current attributes were triggered by large scale effects, such as the opening of the Tasman Gateway and the Drake Passage in the Late Eocene, or the closure of the Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene. A more detailed analysis of the Transkei Basin's depocentre locations and interface outlines resulted in a palaeo flow path reconstruction for this region. Moreover, palaeo climate conditions from the Late Cretaceous were partially reconstructed [...] ...|$|R

25|$|However, {{there may}} be some weak links in this chain of events: the changes in the 13C/12C ratio {{expected}} to result from a massive release of methane do not match the patterns seen throughout the early Triassic; and the types of oceanic <b>thermohaline</b> <b>circulation</b> that may have existed {{at the end of the}} Permian are not likely to have supported deep-sea anoxia.|$|E
25|$|The oceanic {{aspects of}} these circulations can {{generate}} variability on centennial timescales {{due to the}} ocean having hundreds of times more mass than in the atmosphere, and thus very high thermal inertia.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} Regional Ocean Modeling System is used {{to study}} the seasonal water circulations and transports of the Southern South China Sea. The simulated seasonal water circulations and estimated transports show consistency with observations, e. g., satellite altimeter data set and re-analysis data of the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation. It is found that the seasonal water circulations are mainly driven by the monsoonal wind stress and influenced by the water outflow/inflow and associated currents of the entire South China Sea. The intrusion of the strong current along the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia and the eddies at different depths in all seasons are due to the conservation of the potential vorticity as the depth increases. Results show that the water circulation patterns {{in the northern part}} of the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia are generally dominated by the geostrophic currents while those in the southern areas are due solely to the wind stress because of negligible Coriolis force there.
