5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive effect has been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Benzylpiperazine is, however, to be {{the subject}} of a European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) risk assessment, the results of which may {{determine}} what, if any, control will placed on BZP throughout the European Union. The risk assessment comes about {{as the result of a}} joint Europol – EMCDDA report which concluded that BZP needs to be looked at in more detail. The results were published in June 2007. The report concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> BZP can lead to medical problems even if the long effects are still unknown. Taking this concession as a basis, the European Commission has decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control of the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. On 4 March 2008, the EU requested countries to place BZP under control within a year and France complied in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, traffic {{congestion}} had reached such a level <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the square as a modern wholesale distribution market was becoming untenable, and significant redevelopment was planned. Following a public outcry, buildings around the square were protected in 1973, preventing redevelopment. The following year the market moved to a new site in south-west London. The square languished until its central building re-opened as a shopping centre in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Central to the {{reversal}} of the Ninth Circuit {{was the fact that}} the state court did not take into account Alvarado's age and experience with law enforcement in the custody analysis.

Inexperience with law enforcement was rejected as well; the Court noted that previous opinions had rejected reliance on such factors.|$|E

5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female. Given that older studies show no difference in incidence between men and women, {{it has been suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> oral contraceptives in women is behind the disparity between the sexes. A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E
