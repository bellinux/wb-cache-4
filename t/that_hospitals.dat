40|$|Abstract- The US {{health care}} {{industry}} has undergone considerable consolidation, with mergers and acquisitions happening amongst health insurers, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals. Although there have been mergers in the pharmaceutical and insurance sectors, this paper will focus only on the impact <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> mergers have had. With the trend all but continuing, various arguments for and against hospital mergers have been propounded, with {{different points of view}} on the net effects <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> mergers have had. The main concerns of both sides is the impact <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> mergers have had on price, quality of patient care and hospital efficiency. In this article, we find that the impact of hospital mergers on these indices has been mixed as there is no predictable effect <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> mergers will definitely have. Indeed, it appears that the impact of a hospital merger is specific to the degree of hospital consolidation in the region where the hospitals operate, the market share of each partner to the merger, and how good they are in terms of quality of care prior to the merger...|$|R
25|$|In the United States {{and most}} other industrialized nations, {{emergency}} medical providers are required to treat any patient that has a life-threatening condition, irrespective of the patient's financial resources. In the U.S., the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act requires <b>that</b> <b>hospitals</b> treat all patients in need of emergency medical care without considering patients' ability to pay for service.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{requirement}} <b>that</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{help patients}} {{with things like}} living wills began when Republican George H. W. Bush was President. Section 1233 merely allows doctors {{to be paid for}} their time. However, between 30 percent and 45 percent of Americans believed in the death panel story. According to PolitiFact, private health insurance companies already ration health care by income, by denying health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions and by caps on health insurance payments. Rationing exists now, and will continue to exist with or without health care reform.|$|E
25|$|Signs of {{the disease}} have also been found in Egyptian mummies dated between 3000 and 2400 BC. The most convincing case {{was found in the}} mummy of priest Nesperehen, {{discovered}} by Grebart in 1881, which featured evidence of spinal tuberculosis with the characteristic psoas abscesses. Similar features were discovered on other mummies like that of the priest Philoc and throughout the cemeteries of Thebes. It appears likely that Akhenaten and his wife Nefertiti both died from tuberculosis, and evidence indicates <b>that</b> <b>hospitals</b> for tuberculosis existed in Egypt as early as 1500 BC.|$|E
40|$|Many {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> utilization rates vary widely across small geographic areas. The variation is often attributed to the style of practice of the provider. This study demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> utilization varies widely between "micro" areas within individual hospital market areas. Further, the study demonstrates <b>that</b> <b>hospital</b> utilization rates within a hospital market area are more similar to each other than to rates in "micro" areas within other hospital market areas. After adjustment for available demographic, socioeconomic, and epidemiological factors, the utilization rates within "micro" areas are highly related {{to the group of}} <b>hospitals</b> <b>that</b> dominates the market area. After simultaneously adjusting for age and poverty, the market share-dominant group explains 35 {{percent of the variance in}} surgical use rates of "micro" areas and 39 percent of the variance in medical use rates...|$|R

25|$|Later {{in the day}} surgeon Ali al-Ekri {{was arrested}} from the still {{surrounded}} Salmaniya hospital and by April another 47 health workers had been arrested. Their case drew wide international attention. Patients at the hospital reported getting beaten and verbally abused by security forces and staff said patients with protest related injuries were kept in wards 62 and 63 where they were held as captives, denied health care and beaten on daily basis to secure confessions. Physicians for Human Rights accused the government of violating medical neutrality and Médecins Sans Frontières said injured protesters were denied medical care and <b>that</b> <b>hospitals</b> were used as baits to snare them. The government of Bahrain dismissed these reports as lacking any evidence and said forces were only deployed in the hospital to keep order.|$|E
2500|$|Massive looting {{took place}} in the days {{following}} the 2003 invasion. According to U.S. officials, the [...] "reality of the situation on the ground" [...] was <b>that</b> <b>hospitals,</b> water plants, and ministries with vital intelligence needed security more than other sites. There were only enough U.S. troops on the ground to guard a certain number of the many sites that ideally needed protection, and so, apparently, some [...] "hard choices" [...] were made.|$|E
2500|$|A set of 10 {{hospital}} quality measures which, if {{reported to}} CMS, {{will increase the}} payments <b>that</b> <b>hospitals</b> receive for each discharge. By {{the third year of}} the demonstration, those hospitals that do not meet a threshold on quality will be subject to reductions in payment. Preliminary data from the second year of the study indicates that pay for performance was associated with a roughly 2.5% to 4.0% improvement in compliance with quality measures, compared with the control hospitals. Dr. Arnold Epstein of the Harvard School of Public Health commented in an accompanying editorial that pay-for-performance [...] "is fundamentally a social experiment likely to have only modest incremental value." [...] Unintended consequences of some publicly reported hospital quality measures have adversely affected patient care. The requirement to give the first antibiotic dose in the emergency department within 4 hours, if the patient has pneumonia, has caused an increase in pneumonia misdiagnosis.|$|E

2500|$|Identifying {{sentinel}} {{events and}} analyzing {{the root causes}} has been a focus of JCAHO since 1996; the first eight alerts were published in 1998. The Commission defines a sentinel event as [...] "any unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical or psychological injury, or the risk thereof." [...] The health care facility experiencing the sentinel event is expected to complete a thorough root cause analysis, make improvements to the underlying processes, and monitor {{the effectiveness of the}} changes. [...] Although the cause of most sentinel events is human error, changes in organizational systems will reduce the likelihood of human error in the future and protect patients from harm when human error does occur. Specific causes of sentinel events and the solutions <b>that</b> <b>hospitals</b> then used successfully to reduce risks are publicized by JCAHO annually. Alerts have included issues as varied as wrong site surgery, restraint deaths, transfusion and medication errors and patient abductions.|$|E
2500|$|No {{confirmed}} {{numbers of}} dead were reported, but {{people on the}} ground reported bodies lying in the city streets. Aid agency MSF said on February 3 there were [...] "a lot of dead bodies" [...] in the city, and that 300 people were being treated in hospitals. After the battle, MSF said <b>that</b> <b>hospitals</b> had counted 100 killed civilians and nearly 700 wounded. Red Cross officials spoke on February 5 of [...] "hundreds" [...] of civilians killed in the fighting, and over a thousand wounded. They later said over 160 civilians had been killed. Avenue Mobutu, a main thoroughfare, and other streets, were strewn with military and civilian victims and the charred remains of tanks and pick-up trucks using in the fighting. On March 6, President Déby gave an estimate of 700 killed in the city, most of them civilians. Most humanitarian staff were evacuated from Chad, and at least 30,000 refugees migrated to Cameroon according to the UN official Sophie de Caen.|$|E
60|$|But if {{the medical}} man bears witness for God and spiritual things when he seems {{exclusively}} occupied with the body, {{so does the}} hospital. Look at those noble buildings which the generosity of our fellow-countrymen have erected in all our great cities. You may find in them, truly, sermons in stones; sermons for rich alike and poor. They preach to the rich, these hospitals, that the sick-bed levels all alike; {{that they are the}} equals and brothers of the poor in the terrible liability to suffer! They preach to the poor that they are, through Christianity, the equals of the rich in their means and opportunities of cure. I say through Christianity. Whether the founders so intended or not (and those who founded most of them, St. George's among the rest, did so intend), these hospitals bear direct witness for Christ. They do this, and would do it, even if--which God forbid--the name of Christ were never mentioned within their walls. That may seem a paradox; but it is none. For it is a historic fact, <b>that</b> <b>hospitals</b> are a creation of Christian times, and of Christian men. The heathen knew them not. In that great city of ancient Rome, as far as I have ever been able to discover, {{there was not a single}} hospital,--not even, I fear, a single charitable institution. Fearful thought--a city of a million and a half inhabitants, the centre of human civilization: and not a hospital there! The Roman Dives paid his physician; the Roman Lazarus literally lay at his gate full of sores, till he died the death of the street dogs which licked those sores, and was carried forth to be thrust under ground awhile, till the same dogs came to quarrel over his bones. The misery and helplessness of the lower classes in the great cities of the Roman empire, till the Church of Christ arose, literally with healing in its wings, cannot, I believe, be exaggerated.|$|E
