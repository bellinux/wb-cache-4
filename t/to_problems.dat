5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> {{with some}} of the more novel {{features}} of Bulleid's design, all members of the class were modified by British Railways during the late 1950s, losing their air-smoothed casings in the process. The Merchant Navy class operated until the end of Southern steam in July 1967. A third of the class has survived and can be seen on heritage railways throughout Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> {{with some}} of the new features, such as the Bulleid {{chain-driven}} valve gear, sixty locomotives were rebuilt by British Railways during the late 1950s. This produced a design highly similar to the rebuilt Merchant Navy class. The classes operated until July 1967, when the last steam locomotives on the Southern Region were withdrawn. Although most were scrapped, twenty locomotives found new homes on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E

In 2007 Pétrus was awarded its second Michelin star.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Bean {{often seems}} unaware of basic {{aspects of the}} way the world works, and the {{programme}} usually features his attempts at what would normally be considered simple activities, such as going swimming, using a television set, interior decorating, or going to church.

50|$|Common {{barriers}} <b>to</b> <b>problem</b> solving are mental constructs that impede {{our ability}} <b>to</b> correctly solve <b>problems.</b> These barriers prevent people from solving {{problems in the}} most efficient manner possible.

5|$|After a {{month with}} his new wife, Sing {{returned}} to the trenches in France in August 1917, but was in very poor health due to his battle wounds {{and the effects of}} gas poisoning. It is not clear whether he operated as a sniper on the Western Front, but in September 1917, he led a unit in the Battle of Polygon Wood in counter-sniper operations. For this action, he was awarded the Oorlogskruis (Belgian Croix de Guerre) in 1918, and was also recommended for the Military Medal—but never received it. In November 1917, he was confined to hospital again due <b>to</b> <b>problems</b> with his previously wounded leg. In mid-February 1918, he was hospitalised due to a gunshot wound in the back. Sing suffered lung disease from his exposure to gas, and it soon brought his military career to an end.|$|E
