5|$|Both clubs {{having been}} {{eliminated}} from the FA Cup, Small Heath arranged a friendly with Notts County, refereed by the Test cricketer and former England international footballer Billy Gunn, which gave <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> try out reserve players Jack Jones and Alec Leake. On a hard, snow-covered pitch, Billy Walton scored all three goals in a 3–3 draw, but the attendance of under a thousand, though understandable because of the weather conditions, was disappointing. Jones made his competitive debut, standing in for the injured Hallam, as Small Heath again struggled in muddy conditions and, {{for the fourth time}} this season, lost to West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 found them guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later explained that he was giving <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. They said the strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E

25|$|The {{enumeration}} {{and recording}} of Sharecroppers and educating {{them about their}} rights was {{an important step in}} raising their economic and social status. By giving these farmers more rights, and protecting them from exploitation by the landowners, they were assured of a relatively stable livelihood, which would improve their living standards as well, and give <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> become landowners themselves.|$|E

25|$|The {{railway system}} {{suffered}} heavy damage {{in some areas}} due to German Luftwaffe bombing, especially {{in cities such as}} London and Coventry. 482 locomotives, 13,314 passenger and 16,132 freight vehicles were damaged. However this damage was not as extensive as it was in many other European countries such as France and Germany. This unwittingly worked to the railways' disadvantage, because in other European countries the damage to their railway systems had been so bad that it gave <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> essentially re-build their railway systems from scratch, and dramatically modernise them.|$|E

25|$|It was {{possible}} under the former law {{to place a}} corporation on probation. Specifically, a corporation could be sentenced to probation {{over a period of}} time not to exceed 5 years, coupled with suspension of payment of part of the fine. Corporations can be placed on probation, but corporate shareholders of the defendant corporation cannot be placed on probation without making them defendants too and giving <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> be heard. Controversial proposed amendments to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines would encourage courts to install monitors in corporate probationers with wide-reaching powers to examine corporate records. There has also been some debate as to whether courts can order corporate probationers to make charitable contributions.|$|E
25|$|Males are {{produced}} less frequently and in less quantity than females {{are produced}}. After eclosion males {{remain on the}} nest {{for up to a}} week. Upon leaving, they live nomadically and mate with females of other nests. Males do not assist in any of the colony maintenance activities while they reside in the nest. They are not well suited for foraging or defending the colony because of their weaker mandibles and lack of a stinger. They are dependent on female workers feeding them and are sometimes observed to cannibalize nest larvae. It has been experimentally demonstrated that males of R. marginata have the ability to feed larvae, but they do not because they lack food access and females do not give <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> do so in natural populations.|$|E
25|$|After being {{completely}} re-equipped with Spitfires in early 1944, No. 451 Squadron {{was transferred to}} Corsica and arrived there on 18 April, attached to No. 251 Wing RAF (with No. 237 Squadron RAF and No. 238 Squadron RAF). This move was very popular with the squadron's pilots as it gave <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> participate in offensive action. The squadron's role was to support Allied operations in Italy and southern France by escorting bombers and conducting armed reconnaissance patrols. It flew its first operation from Corsica on 23 April and engaged German fighters {{on a number of}} occasions. In mid-June the squadron supported the Free French-led Invasion of Elba. On 12 June eight personnel were killed and all but two of No. 451 Squadron's Spitfires were damaged when 25 German Ju 88 bombers raided the unit's base at Poretta airfield. The squadron's ground crew were able to return ten Spitfires to service by the afternoon of 13 June, however.|$|E

25|$|Theoretically, landless peasants {{were to be}} {{the biggest}} {{beneficiaries}} from collectivization, because it promised <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> take an equal share in labor and its rewards. In fact, however, rural areas did not have many landless peasants, given the wholesale redistribution of land following the Revolution. Alternatively, for those with property, collectivization meant forfeiting land up to the collective farms and selling most of the harvest to the state at minimal prices set by the state itself. This, in turn, engendered opposition to the idea. Furthermore, collectivization involved significant changes in the traditional village life of Russian peasants within a very short time frame, despite the long Russian rural tradition of collectivism in the village obshchina or mir. The changes were even more dramatic in other places, such as in Ukraine, with its tradition of individual farming, in the Soviet republics of Central Asia, and in the trans-Volga steppes, where for a family to have a herd of livestock was not only a matter of sustenance, but of pride as well.|$|E
500|$|In the episode, Bart {{appears on}} the talk show Late Night with Conan O'Brien. Conan O'Brien was a writer for The Simpsons during the fourth and {{early part of the}} fifth seasons. During the {{production}} of the episode, he received an audition to replace David Letterman as the host of Late Night on NBC, after Letterman defected to CBS. The writers decided that since the episode featured Bart getting famous, it would give <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> work in O'Brien's show. The part was written just after O'Brien's audition for Late Night, but before he {{knew he was going to}} be the host. O'Brien recorded his part shortly after Late Night with Conan O'Brien premiered, but he believed NBC would have fired him before the episode aired. He described being a guest star on the show as [...] "really delightful", adding that [...] "it's like being frozen in amber. I know people will be watching The Simpsons long after I'm dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Other mythos {{elements}} were devised as the series progressed. The writers had originally envisioned only spending small portions of episodes within the parallel universe, {{but as they}} wrote these episodes within Season 3, they brought out the idea of setting entire episodes within the parallel universe. This necessitated {{the development of the}} alternate versions of the main characters, which Pinkner considered [...] "a great playground just for imagination". The actors themselves found this concept exciting, as it allowed them to play different characters but with the same background and considered it a creative challenge. Similarly, having Peter erased from the timeline as part of the finale for Season 3 was an idea that grew over the course of that season. The writers were aware this would be a risky move but felt the idea was very appropriate for Fringe, and opted to write towards this after considering all the consequences. Pinkner noted that this gave <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> [...] "reset the character relationships" [...] and determine the key aspects that would remain without Peter, as well as [...] "making the audience uncomfortable at times". The cast was not initially sold with the idea, but came around as the fourth season progressed.|$|E

500|$|During {{this period}} quarterback Charlie Conerly emerged. Conerly was the team's {{starting}} quarterback from 1948 to 1960, {{and had a}} franchise-record string of 12 consecutive seasons in which he led the team in passing. A former US Marine, Conerly was renowned among his teammates for his toughness. [...] "There was a time my rookie year when I really saw it", recalled running back Frank Gifford. [...] "He broke his nose really badly, they literally called a timeout and then they called another one while they stopped the bleeding, they stuck stuff up there until it would stop bleeding. You {{try to get them}} to do that today. They'd be yelling, 'Get my agent!'". In 1951, the Giants finished 9–2–1, but their inability to beat division rival Cleveland cost <b>them</b> <b>an</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> play in the Championship Game. Fullback Eddie Price led the league in rushing and set a league record for rushing attempts in a season, and defensive linemen Arnie Weinmeister and Al Derogatis, linebacker Jon Baker, and offensive tackle Tex Coulter all made the All-Pro team. The following year New York fell to 7–5, but Tunnell continued to impress. [...] "Tunnell returned interceptions, punts, and kickoffs with such electric flair that he actually outgained the league rushing leader in yards gained" [...] according to one publication. Tunnell amassed 924yards, while never lining up on offense, whereas the league rushing leader totalled 894. The Giants offense struggled in 1953, and they fell to a 3–9 record. Gifford was forced to play both ways due to a depleted roster, and in the second to last game of the season they lost 62–14 to division rival Cleveland.|$|E
