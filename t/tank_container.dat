50|$|A <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> can {{be loaded}} and {{unloaded}} {{from the top}} and the bottom. On a standard <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> there is a manhole {{and at least one}} valve on the top, and there is a valve at the bottom. Loading and unloading is done by connecting hoses of the loading and unloading facility to the valves of the tank. The loading or unloading is often done using a pump. Depending on the installation and regulation of certain products, it is determined how the <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> should be loaded or unloaded.|$|E

50|$|Depending on {{the product}} many ISO <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> {{operators}} argue that Flexi Bags can be more costly and less environmentally sound. This is generally the case for higher value products and/or environmentally dangerous products, because the transport protection offered by a Flexi-bag is less {{and the level of}} product that is left in the flexi-bag (2 to 5%) is higher than the amount left in a <b>tank</b> <b>container.</b>|$|E

40|$|Effective {{logistics}} {{is the key}} {{to improving}} supply chain performance. <b>Tank</b> <b>containers</b> are attractive from the viewpoints of safety, cost, and environment, and are widely used for transporting fluid chemicals. Minimizing the logistics costs arising from the container flow imbalances across the globe and container cleaning is a major issue that chemical companies and affiliated third-party logistics firms face routinely. In contrast to dry containers, this important problem of managing <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> in global chemical logistics has received no attention. An innovative, event-based, pull approach is presented for the minimum-cost or the maximum-profit scheduling of the transport and cleaning of multiproduct <b>tank</b> <b>containers</b> (loaded and empty) given a set of projected shipment orders. A novel linear programming formulation is developed and illustrated through examples that successfully solves large, industrially relevant problems with key practical considerations such as alternate ship schedules, delivery time windows, and intermodal transport routes.

50|$|A <b>tank</b> <b>container,</b> {{also known}} as ISO tank, is a {{specialized}} type of container designed to carry bulk liquids, such as chemicals, liquid hydrogen, gases and foodgrade products. Both hazardous and non hazardous products can be shipped in tank containers. A standard <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> is 20 ft long, 8 ft high and 8 ft wide. The tank, which is made from stainless steel, is held within a box-shaped frame with the same shape as an intermodal container. This allows it to be carried on multiple modes of transport, such as truck, rail and ship.|$|E

There are a variety of UN Portable tank types, the most common of which is T11 as it is permitted to transport a thousand or more hazardous bulk chemicals.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> {{concept was}} also {{employed}} in Europe by Bob Fossey, an engineer {{who worked for}} Williams Fairclough in London. They improved on the 1950s framed American elliptical container tanks, oft noted carrying specified USA engine oils for the UK’s MoD aircraft built in Preston, Lancashire. In 1964 Fairclough made a swap body tank for combined transport by truck and train, but not yet constructed according to ISO standards. In 1966, commercial production began and one year later the first <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> to ISO dimensions was developed. The first mass-produced tank containers were purchased by Trafpak, a part of Pakhoed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tank</b> <b>container</b> chassis, also {{referred}} to as tank chassis, drop frame chassis or tank trailers, are a form of intermodal transportation for portable bulk liquid containers or ISO tank containers. They are characteristically longer and have lower deck height ideal for transporting constantly shifting payloads. The invention of the <b>tank</b> <b>container</b> revolutionized the way bulk liquids were transported, stored, and handled worldwide. It has improved safety, reduced costs and brought with it the benefits of convenience and efficiency associated with a multi-modal transport system. Invariably the invention of the drop frame chassis followed soon after to accommodate this new type of intermodal container.|$|E
