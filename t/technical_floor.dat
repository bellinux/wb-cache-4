The residential tower project {{was designed by}} the Architecture firm TAA (Tabet Atelier d Architecture), the Electrical/Mechanical consultants are SERT and the structural engineering was conducted by Bernard Zeinoun. Construction Management was tasked to TAA construction and the Site Engineering consultants are APAVE Nigeria. The residential towers are being developed by ESLA International Limited, a subsidiary of Chagoury Group, while the contractors are Eko Pearl Construction Company and South Energyx Nigeria Ltd. Each of the five towers comprises four apartments per floor, two apartments on the penthouse floors, a <b>technical</b> <b>floor,</b> terrace floor, a ground floor and a basement floor. The penthouse types, two and three bedroom apartments provide viewing access to the Lagos coastline. The five towers cover a total plot area of 22,738 m2. Altogether, the towers will provide approximately over 560 apartment units with views of the Atlantic Ocean, Victoria Island and Lagos Island. The project commenced after the land reclamation for {{the first phase of}} Eko Atlantic in 2013. As of 2016, the Black pearl has been topped out, the Champagne Pearl is scheduled to be completed in 2017. whilst the other three towers are still underdevelopment.

40|$|Abstract—The {{majority}} of contemporary insulation materials {{commonly used in}} the building industry is made from non-renewable raw materials; furthermore, their production often brings high energy costs. A long-term trend as far as sustainable development is concerned has been the reduction of energy and material demands of building material production.

The transcaruncular approach enables {{a clear and}} wide view of the medial wall without any visible scar compared to usual transcutaneous techniques. This approach can be combined with a transconjunctival approach, thus providing an extended exposure of the whole medial wall and the orbital <b>floor.</b> <b>TECHNICAL</b> NOTE: The conjunctival incision is performed with a needle electrocautery in the groove between the plica semilunaris and the caruncle. It is extended laterally within the inferior conjunctival fornix for 20 mm to the lateral palpebral commissure. The sub-conjunctival dissection to the posterior lacrimal crest is performed with Stevens scissors through an avascular plane along the medial wall behind Horner's muscle. The periosteum is incised behind the posterior lacrimal crest. The sub-periosteal periorbital dissection is continued medially thus exposing the insertion of the inferior oblique muscle which is coagulated and cut over the inferior orbital rim. Reconstruction is performed after exposing the complete fracture after freeing the periorbital tissue. The periorbita is sutured with interrupted 5 - 0 Vicryl stitches.

40|$|Serious floor heave in gob-side entry {{retaining}} (GER) with fully-mechanized gangue backfilling mining {{affects the}} transportation and ventilation {{safety of the}} mine. A theoretical mechanical model for the floor of gob-backfilled GER was established. The effects of the mechanical properties of floor strata, the granular compaction of backfilling area (BFA), the vertical support of roadside support body (RSB), and the stress concentration of the solid coal on the floor heave of the gob-backfilled GER were studied. The {{results show that the}} floor heave increases with the increase of the coal seam buried depth, and decreases with the increase of the floor rock elastic modulus. The development depth of the plastic zone decreases with the increase of the c and φ value of the floor rock, and increases with the increase of the stress concentration factor of the solid coal. The development depth of the plastic zone in the test mine reached 2. 68 m. The field test and monitoring results indicate that the comprehensive control scheme of adjusting backfilling pressure, deep grouting reinforcement, shallow opening stress relief slots, and surface pouring can effectively control the floor heave. The roof-floor displacement is reduced by 73. 8 % compared to that with the original support scheme. The roadway section meets the design and application requirements when the deformation stabilizes, demonstrating the rationality of the mechanical model. The research results overcome the <b>technical</b> bottleneck of <b>floor</b> heave control of fully-mechanized backfilling GER, providing a reliable basis for the design of a floor heave control scheme...|$|R

40|$|Rautaruukki Construction is {{developing}} a new frame system for shopping centres. This Master of Science Thesis {{is part of the}} project. The frame system is based on continuous steel trusses and composite steel columns. Floors are typically hollow core slabs. The structural characteristics of shopping centre buildings were researched by examining executed targets in Finland, Sweden and Norway. In analyzed frames the first two storeys are typically parking levels. Above parking levels are hypermarket and commercial levels. On the roof is a <b>technical</b> level. All <b>floor</b> to floor heights and clearances were defined by target reviews. In the parking levels the columns grid is 17, 0 x 5, 4 m 2 and in the upper levels 17, 0 x 10, 8 m 2. The height of steel trusses is determined by optimizing consumptions of steel and required stiffness and also by ensuring adequate routing space for HVACE-utilities. Loads are determined by usage of levels and by Eurocodes. Four static frame models were analyzed. The static function of the frame and critical loads were clarified. The largest loads 5 - 10 kN/m 2 were applied on hypermarket and commercial levels and 2, 5 kN/m 2 was applied on parking levels. The research exhibited that the size of columns was determined by N-M resistance not the sway-factor αcr. The factor αcr is in all researched frame models over 10 so frames are non-sway. Using continuous steel trusses instead of one-bay trusses the circular section of middle columns is about 50 - 100 mm larger. The frame of the shopping centre must be adaptable and configurable. Structural elements that limit the use of space, such as shear walls, bracings and struts, should be avoided or minimized in order to improve the efficiency of the space. In all analyzed frame models the stiffness of the continuous steel truss – composite column -system guaranteed the stability in the direction of frame. The stability in opposite direction was not been checked in this research but it is normally carried out by steel bracings. Topics for future research could be among other things optimizing of continuous steel truss, development of joints between continuous trusses and columns and development of dimension tools for unbraced frame...|$|R

The theoretical and experimental investigations were composed to suitable models for the description of the load bearing and deformation behavior of the developed floor slab systems. In case of the load bearing behavior the existing model of NEFF and EHMANN was found to be suitable and an independent design concept has been developed. For the prediction of the deformations of prestressed girders with large web openings an effective approach has been developed, allowing for the reproduction of the main influencing parameters and an easy application in the field. In addition, a large amount of environmental life cycle assessments has been carried out on different scales: building element, structural system and building. Here, contemporary structural systems of domestic and office buildings as well as a flexible structure using the developed structural elements have been investigated. Different factors influencing the environmental impact of the structural systems have been detected and a great potential for optimization has been highlighted. The service life of a real estate could be adjusted to the physical life of the structural system by multiple changes in utilization using flexible building structures. Thus, an economic and ecologic recycling of the whole building contributes to sustainable development. Finally, technical recommendations and general principles for flexible building structures have been derived. The latter ones have found their way into the guideline “Principles for sustainable buildings made of concrete”...|$|R
