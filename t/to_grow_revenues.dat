5000|$|Two {{companies}} working together, Texas Instruments of Dallas, Texas and Industrial Development Engineering Associates (I.D.E.A.) of Indianapolis, Indiana, {{were behind}} the unveiling of the Regency TR-1, the world's first commercially produced transistor radio. Previously, Texas Instruments was producing instrumentation for the oil industry and locating devices for the U.S. Navy and I.D.E.A. built home television antenna boosters. The two companies worked together on the TR-1, looking <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>revenues</b> for their respective companies by breaking into this new product area. In May 1954, Texas Instruments had designed and built a prototype and was looking for an established radio manufacturer to develop and market a radio using their transistors. (The Chief Project Engineer for the radio design at Texas Instruments' headquarters in Dallas, Texas was Paul D. Davis, Jr., who had a degree in Electrical Engineering from Southern Methodist University. He was assigned the project due to his experience with radio engineering in World War II.) None of the major radio makers including RCA, Philco, and Emerson were interested. The President of I.D.E.A. at the time, Ed Tudor, jumped at the opportunity to manufacture the TR-1, predicting sales of the transistor radios at [...] "20 million radios in three years". [...] The Regency TR-1 was announced on October 18, 1954 by the Regency Division of I.D.E.A., was put on sale in November 1954, {{and was the first}} practical transistor radio made in any significant numbers. Billboard reported in 1954 that [...] "the radio has only four transistors. One acts as a combination mixer-oscillator, one as an audio amplifier, and two as intermediate-frequency amplifiers." [...] One year after the release of the TR-1 sales approached the 100,000 mark. The look and size of the TR-1 was well received, but the reviews of the TR-1's performance were typically adverse. The Regency TR-1 is patented by Richard C. Koch, , former Project Engineer of I.D.E.A.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis article {{examines}} key success factors for designing and delivering combinations {{of goods and}} services (i. e., hybrid offerings) in business markets. Goods manufacturers, unlike pure service providers, find themselves in a unique position <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>revenues</b> through hybrid offerings but must learn how to leverage unique resources and build distinctive capabilities. Using case studies and depth interviews with senior executives in manufacturing companies, the authors develop a resource-capability framework as a basis for research and practice. Executives identify four critical resources: (1) product usage and process data derived from the firm's installed base of physical goods, (2) product development and manufacturing assets, (3) an experienced product sales force and distribution network, and (4) a field service organization. In leveraging these specific resources, successful firms build five critical capabilities: (1) service-related data processing and interpretation capability, (2) execution risk assessment and mitigation capability, (3) design-to-service capability, (4) hybrid offering sales capability, and (5) hybrid offering deployment capability. These capabilities influence manufacturers' positional advantage in two directions: differentiation and cost leadership. The authors propose a new typology of industrial services and discuss how resources and capabilities affect success across categories of hybrid offers...|$|E
40|$|The case {{documents}} {{the journey of}} a start-up from inception to the growth stage, and is suitable for understanding the following business strategies: pivot strategy, credibility and reputation building, role of the Board of Directors, and scalability of young businesses. Tagit is a Singapore-based mobile solutions company. The company’s offering was based on Mobeix, a ground-breaking technology that allowed enterprises to build secure, scalable and innovative mobile applications across multiple mobile devices and operating systems. Leveraging on Mobeix, Tagit had successfully secured its first contract from PVR Cinemas in India, offering the first online ticket-booking platform. Following this, in 2007, Tagit was contracted by Singapore Airlines to develop a mobile app for the airline’s passenger services. Facing intense competition and rapid technological advancement in the online ticketing space, Naffi and his business partners started to consider other options <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>revenues</b> and profits.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of any profit-driven organisation is to maximise {{the share of}} the economic value or profit it generates. Conventional business theory asserts that this can be achieved by either increasing sales revenues or containing operational costs. However, as firms seek to secure sustainable competitive advantages, the imperative has emerged for managers to find methods of achieving revenue growth and cost containment simultaneously. This presents a dilemma to managers as there are trade-offs between revenue growth and cost containment. The aim of this research is to explore the key factors which influence the manager s ability to find an optimal balance between growing revenues and containing costs, with a view towards maximising economic profits. In examining the quandary of balancing revenue growth and cost containment, an exploratory, qualitative research study was conducted through a series of 20 in-depth interviews with business leaders and management experts who are actively engaged with the dilemma. The unique insights uncovered during the expert interviews were collected and analysed using inductive content and frequency analysis techniques, designed to extrapolate the emergent themes into a general management framework for navigating the dilemma. The research results show that managers are able to pursue strategies which simultaneously grow revenues while containing costs, by leveraging the relation between revenue and cost through innovation. Technology and employee engagement were identified as the key enabling factors which drive innovation in a firm, and the resultant productivity gains allow the firm <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>revenues</b> disproportionally higher than costs. As long as the gap between revenue and cost is expanding consistently, the balance between the two is optimised, and the economic profits for the firm are maximised.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper was to examine {{psychological}} variables of young Chinese to determine their impact on identification with global consumer culture, attitudes toward global and USA brands and intention to buy USA brands. The independent or psychological variables examined were self-monitoring, life satisfaction, brand relevance, social demonstration effect, change-seeking behavior and reference groups (interacted and non-interacted). The goal was to understand what forces drive global and USA brand preferences. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected in Guangzhou, China, in 2013 through a survey administered to 152 young Chinese respondents. Confirmatory factor analysis and reliability coefficients verified the psychometrics of each scale. Subsequently, the sample was divided into high versus low groups for each of the independent variables to perform mean tests for each on each of the four dependent variables. Findings – The results showed that all the hypotheses were supported to some extent. The sample had a positive attitude toward all the dependent measures: identification with global consumer culture, global and USA brands and intention to buy USA brands. Self-monitoring and change-seeking behavior had the least association with the dependent variables. Brand relevance, social demonstration effect and interactive and non-interactive reference groups were all found to have strong support. Research limitations/implications – The authors used an urban sample of young Chinese. Examining an older sample or one that was less urban would also be useful. Future research could also examine other emerging markets such as Brazil or Indonesia to identify the impact of the psychological variables. Practical implications – Multinational firms wishing <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>revenues</b> of their USA and global brands in China must be attuned to the social aspects of positioning their brands. The implications show that brand relevance, social demonstration and reference groups can be used for positioning of global and USA brands. As China is a collectivist society, using appeals that establish a brand’s desirability or relevance and its ability to allow users to socially demonstrate the brand to reference groups is likely to work well. Originality/value – No study has assembled the variables in the manner investigated in this research, nor have other studies looked at young Chinese in terms of USA brand attitudes and identification with global consumer culture...|$|E
40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Business Administration at Strathmore UniversityThis evaluative case study {{examined the effects of}} re-regulation of oil prices on oil marketing companies, oil retailers and consumers within Nairobi City County and determined whether the re-regulation was necessary in the first place. The study reviewed secondary literature, obtained and analysed petroleum oil pump prices for the period 2006 to 2010, interviewed executives of the energy policy and regulatory agencies {{as well as those of}} Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) and oil retailers. The study used stratified sampling techniques to select petroleum fuel retail outlets in key business areas within the City of Nairobi and its environs; and convenience sampling to select key informants. Using the ERC price setting formula, the would-have-been regulated prices of 2006 - 2010 were generated and compared with the actual prices that prevailed over the same period and their effects on the various market participants were analysed. With the aid of SPSS, a Paired t-Test was used to generate statistics that revealed the differences between actual oil prices and the would-have-been regulated prices. Qualitative data were analysed and described using predetermined and themes that emerged. The study confirmed the achievement of stated policy objectives of keeping prices low, protecting consumers, providing reasonable margins to retailers while levelling those of oil marketing companies. The study also provided insights into policy decision-making viz. diesel prices did not significantly differ, but the actual pump prices of petrol significantly differed from the would-have-been regulated prices, implying there was no need to regulate diesel pump prices. Secondly, this study found that the regulation of pump prices provided predictable pricing, lowered transport costs and provided a level playing ground for industry players. Further, it protected consumers from arbitrary price increases and provided a point of accountability. Price regulation made retailers to take initiatives <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>revenues,</b> increase profits and sustain their operations into the foreseeable future. The conclusion of the study is that the regulation of petrol oil prices was justified but not justified for diesel. Consequently, the study recommends the regulation of oil prices should be made based on individual product, and hence the prices of diesel should be deregulated because it is not justified by the study findings. Relatedly, it is recommended that analytical study should precede any future policy decision on regulation of oil prices. Finally, until the weak legal, regulatory and institutional mechanisms that accentuated oil price regulation are adequately addressed, petrol fuel prices should remain regulated for the foreseeable future...|$|E
