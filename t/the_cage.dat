5|$|As Owen Hart {{entered the}} steel cage for his {{championship}} match {{with his brother}} Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret {{in the head and}} tried to escape from <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> The brothers both tried to climb over <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> several times, but neither would let the other escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring from the top of <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel cage and Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed over the top of <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> and dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart padlocked <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> and he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} match Matt Hardy faced Edge, who was {{accompanied}} by Lita, inside a Steel Cage. As the bell rang, Hardy tried to throw Edge face-first into <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> wall but didn't succeed. Back and forth action took place until Hardy got the advantage over Edge. Lita began to climb up the outside of <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> but Hardy hit <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> making Lita fall off. As Lita distracted Hardy, Edge started to crawl out. Hardy noticed this, grabbed Edge, and threw him into a corner. Lita interfered, which led to Hardy delivering a Twist of Fate to Lita. Edge executed a Spear on Hardy for a near-fall. After knocking Edge off the turnbuckle, Hardy delivered a leg drop {{off the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> before pinning Edge for the win.|$|E
5|$|The Ultimate Warrior {{gained the}} early {{advantage}} in his steel cage match with Rick Rude. After the Warrior missed a splash attempt, Rude attempted {{to win the}} match by escaping <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> The Warrior stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted to perform their finishing moves. Rude was then able to perform a Rude Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the Warrior rather than escape <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Rude performed a shoulderblock and tried to leave through <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> door. The Warrior held him back while Bobby Heenan, Rude's manager, tried to pull Rude out. The Warrior pulled both Rude and Heenan into <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> He punched Heenan and then threw him out of <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> with an atomic drop. Warrior then knocked Rude down three times with clotheslines and threw him onto the ring floor with a gorilla press drop. Warrior climbed over <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> and dropped to the arena floor to win the match and retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great whites are {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at {{the focus of a}} booming tourist industry. A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> tour operators lure the shark to <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E

Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D). The {{duration}} of the contest was 26 minutes and 45 seconds. A Lethal Lockdown match is fought under no disqualification rules, in which weapons are legal and one wrestler from each team starts the match in <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Afterwards, members from each team enter at time intervals until all wrestlers {{are involved in the}} bout so a pinfall or submission can occur. Cage and Styles started the match. Brother Ray, Rhino, Storm, Nash, Brother Devon, Morgan, Tomko, and Sting were the order of entrances for the contest. Shortly after Sting's entrance, a roof covered in weapons was lowered onto <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> With Sting's participation all men were involved in the match, as such a pinfall or submission could now occur. During the encounter, Cage set up a table on top of the roof of <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Later, he and Styles were fighting on top of a ladder on top of <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> when Storm pushed over the ladder causing them both to crash through the table.

5|$|The first {{match that}} aired {{was for the}} WWE Intercontinental Championship in a Steel cage match, a match fought within a cage formed by placing four sheets of mesh metal around, in, or against {{the edges of the}} wrestling ring. Jeff Hardy was {{defending}} the title against Johnny Nitro. The match included various high-flying moves like top-rope kicks and powerbombs off the top of <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Near the end of the match, Hardy pulled Nitro from the top of <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> and nearly scored a pinfall after a Swanton Bomb, but Nitro put his foot on the bottom rope. Nitro then made it over <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> but just as Nitro was about to jump, Hardy dropkicked the door open, and Nitro fell onto the top of the door, paining him between his legs. As Nitro was on top of the door, Hardy kicked <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> door, and walked out the door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} steel cage match could be won only by {{climbing}} {{over the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> {{all the way to the}} floor to win the match. Pinfalls and submission did not count, neither opponent could be disqualified, and the door to <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> would be locked for the entire match. As <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> lowered, Mike Tenay introduced the match and then handed the microphone over to AAA announcer Arturo Rivera to give the introductions in Spanish. Konnan came to the ring with both the IWC World Heavyweight Championship and the UWA Double Power Cup Championship that he had won from Perro Aguayo, although neither was on the line in the match. Once the door was locked, the two wrestlers began to brawl, with Aguayo trying to use Konnan as a ladder to climb out of <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> on more than one occasion. After a few minutes of fighting, Konnan dropped Aguayo face-first on the wire mesh cage, causing Aguayo to bleed (either by sheer impact or Aguayo secretly cutting himself to sell the brutality of the match). Once Aguayo started to bleed, Konnan began to focus on attacking Aguayo's forehead, including rubbing Aguayo's face across <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Moments later, both wrestlers found themselves on the top rope, fighting each other as they held on to <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> until Aguayo knocked Konnan off the top rope. Moments later, Aguayo attempted a pinfall even though the rules stated a pinfall did not matter. As the match progressed, sweat began to mix with his blood, causing his face to turn red. As Aguayo tried to climb out of the ring, Konnan leapt up with a low blow to keep his opponent in <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> At that point, the cameras showed Eddie Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend watching the show from backstage, then moments later leaving the backstage area. As Aguayo climbed <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> Los Gringos came to ringside and threw a cup of liquid in Aguayo's face. He then passed a set of brass knuckles to Konnan to use in the match. While at ringside, Guerrero got into a fistfight with several fans who were upset over his actions, forcing the security guards to step in and stop the fight. Following the assist by Los Gringos Locos, Konnan continued to attack Aguayo, with Aguayo ending up with his face and chest covered in blood from his head wound. At one point, Guerrero attacked the ringside referee, Pepe Casas, preventing him from stepping into <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> to check on Aguayo. When Konnan tried to escape, Los Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000, and Universo 2000) ran to ringside, attacking Guerrero and Madonna's Boyfriend at ringside. As Konnan straddled <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> Cien Caras climbed up and knocked Konnan off the top and back inside <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> allowing Aguayo to attack his opponent. Moments later, Aguayo dove off the top rope with a double stomp on Konnan and then climbed out of <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> to victory.|$|E
