5|$|Despite Scotland {{having the}} {{advantage}} in the group, <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> superior goal difference, {{they went into the}} game as underdogs due to a number of their senior players being unavailable due to either injury or suspension, and because they had lost to Wales in the return fixture at Hampden Park in Glasgow the previous March. Despite this, Scotland achieved the draw they needed to go to the next stage of qualifying, {{while at the same time}} virtually eliminating Wales from the competition.|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} final round of games, both teams were equal on points with Spain, with Scotland ahead <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{superior}} goal difference; however, Spain's final game at home to Iceland was scheduled to be played two weeks after Wales and Scotland had played each other. With this in mind, a draw for Scotland would be sufficient to virtually guarantee second place in Group 7 and advance at the very least through to the two legged play-off against the winner of the Oceania qualifying tournament, while a win would likely see them top the group and qualify automatically. For Wales, anything less than a win would virtually end their hopes of qualification.|$|E
