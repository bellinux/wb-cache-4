50|$|<b>Teniloxazine</b> (Lucelan, Metatone), {{also known}} as sufoxazine and sulfoxazine, is a drug which is marketed in Japan. Though {{initially}} investigated as a neuroprotective and nootropic agent {{for the treatment of}} cerebrovascular insufficiency in the 1980s, it was ultimately developed and approved as an antidepressant instead. It acts as a potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, with fair selectivity over the serotonin and dopamine transporters, and also behaves as an antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor.|$|E
40|$|The single-dose and {{steady-state}} pharmacokinetics of <b>teniloxazine,</b> an {{investigational drug}} with antidepressant and anti-anoxic properties, were compared in 12 healthy volunteers and 12 cirrhotic patients, following oral administration of 80 mg <b>teniloxazine</b> maleate every 12 h for 7 days. In healthy volunteers, {{an increase in}} oral clearance, CLo (from a mean (s. d.) value of 14. 6 (3. 9) to 18. 0 (6. 6) ml min- 1 kg- 1; mean % ratio between the two values (95 % CI), 123 (94 - 151)) and a significant shortening of t 1 / 2 (from 6. 2 (2. 7) to 4. 8 (1. 4) h; mean % ratio (95 % CI), 78 (58 - 98)) were observed upon repeated administration, suggesting autoinduction of <b>teniloxazine</b> metabolism. In cirrhotic patients, the pharmacokinetic parameters of <b>teniloxazine</b> remained essentially invariant with time. Compared with normal subjects, CLo was about halved in cirrhotic patients, whereas t 1 / 2 was more than doubled. As a consequence of these modifications, the multiple-dose regimen resulted in a two-fold mean drug accumulation in cirrhotic patients, compared with virtually no accumulation in healthy volunteers. Although no adverse events were noted in either study group, {{it is suggested that}} maintenance doses for patients with liver dysfunction should initially be {{at the lower end of}} the therapeutic range...|$|E
