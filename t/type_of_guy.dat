500|$|Relatively small (5 foot 7, 180 pounds (82kg)), Rogan was solidly {{built and}} strong, with thin legs and a narrow waist but broad shoulders. He threw and batted right-handed, and used an unusually heavy bat. [...] "You saw Ernie Banks hit in his prime, then you saw Rogan", said Buck O'Neil. [...] "He could hit that ball...He was the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> that stood {{a long way}} from the plate. Not too close, because they'd jam you." [...] According to his {{longtime}} teammate Frank Duncan, [...] "Rogan was one of the best low-ball hitters I ever saw, and one of the best curve-ball hitters. Rogan taught Bob and Irish Meusel how to hit curve balls." [...] While not extremely fast, he ran the bases well and stole when necessary.|$|E
500|$|Speedie had a {{brief and}} cold reunion with Brown in 1977, when the two met at the annual East–West Shrine Game, a college all-star game. Speedie {{introduced}} himself to Brown, only to be told, [...] "Yes, I know. You're the one who went to Canada." [...] Speedie's friends and former teammates lobbied repeatedly for his inclusion in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but Speedie believed that his conflict with Brown was keeping him out even as numerous former teammates, including Otto Graham, Dante Lavelli and Marion Motley were inducted. He was placed on an old-timers' list of nominees for induction into the hall in the mid-1980s, but ultimately was passed over. [...] "Quite honestly, I think Paul Brown is the reason" [...] for Speedie's exclusion, Graham said in 1991. [...] "Paul wasn't the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> you crossed. He would never forget it." ...|$|E

500|$|A lack of rapport between veteran shortstop Jimmy Rollins {{and manager}} Ryne Sandberg {{attracted}} attention during the offseason; ESPN's Buster Olney described {{sentiment in the}} Phillies' organization that Rollins should be traded. Amaro and Rollins dispelled the rumors, with Amaro calling them [...] "absolute silliness". Sandberg praised backup shortstop Freddy Galvis' attitude (which many in the media saw as the manager {{sending a message to}} the team that no one – including Rollins – was above team rules), and one column examined the point at which Rollins ceased being the team's unquestioned leader. Rollins (who had a good relationship with former manager Charlie Manuel) said, [...] "He's [...] completely different from Charlie from the very onset, their personalities. He's pretty much a real quiet guy, he really is. Charlie was a get-in-your face with jokes <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy.</b> We're still learning him, he's still learning us from this side of it. Being a coach and being a manager are completely different things – you deal with so much more being a manager." ...|$|E
500|$|The Capitals did {{not give}} Hunter his first NHL win until his third game, a 3–2 win over the Ottawa Senators that broke a four-game losing streak. Brooks Laich scored the game-winning goal just 12 seconds into the {{overtime}} period. The goal {{would prove to be}} the fastest overtime goal scored during the 2011–12 NHL regular season. In the rematch four days later, Ovechkin appeared to spear Senators forward Chris Neil. Following a Neil hit on Ovechkin, the pair skated up the ice, whereupon Neil fell to the ice following the alleged spear. Neil was given an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty for diving. A spearing penalty, if called, would have resulted in a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct. Later in the game, Ovechkin scored the eventual game-winning goal, his first goal in six games. When asked about the incident after the game, Neil described it as a [...] "pitchfork in the gut," [...] while Ovechkin stated he was [...] "not the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> who spears players." [...] The following day, a league spokesman stated that Ovechkin would not be suspended or fined for the incident.|$|E

The group eventually recruited guitarist Stacey Blades, with both Muscat and Kelli departing the group, in 2004 while they also released the cover album, titled Rips the Covers Off, the same year. Commenting on Blades addition to the lineup, Lewis stated that [...] "Stacey really is a virtuoso <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> and player. It was really fortunate that we found him and that he's another Hollywood guy. I’ve read reviews where they called him a Tracii [...] clone, but he's not. He is definitely his own man." ...|$|E

Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue {{we have to deal}} with down the road." [...] The comment was condemned as racist by some Republicans and Democrats as well as the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton, though a spokesman for LePage denied the comment had anything to do with race.|$|R

That's why the people that can do it are very few and far between.

2500|$|On April 19, 2016, during Game 4 of the Chicago Blackhawks' first-round {{series against}} the St. Louis Blues, Andrew Shaw was penalized for {{interference}} with 2:04 remaining {{in the third period}} while the Blackhawks down by a goal. He was recorded using an anti-gay slur during a tirade in the penalty box, and the recording circulated widely on social media. As a result, the NHL suspended him for Game 5, fined him $5,000 for related hand gestures, and ordered him to undergo sensitivity training. The following day Shaw apologized to the gay and lesbian community saying [...] "That's not the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> I am" [...] and that [...] "I have no excuses for ..." [...] getting caught up {{in the heat of the}} competition. After the press conference, Shaw personally apologized to Chicago Tribune reporter Chris Hine, who is gay. Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews, who had previously recorded a You Can Play video, said the incident was a learning experience for Shaw. After being traded to the Montreal Canadiens during the off-season, Shaw volunteered to be the team's ambassador to You Can Play as “a leader in the locker room and in the community on diversity, equality and inclusion." [...] The announcement was met by skepticism by some.|$|E
2500|$|Carl is Kirsty's ex-boyfriend, and Coonan {{explained}} {{that they were in}} a relationship [...] before he went to prison. Carl was in his early 20s and Kirsty was 16 when they met and he became obsessive of her. Their relationship was based on hedonism and excess, rather than tenderness. When he went to prison, Kirsty promised to wait for him to be released, but she realised their relationship was toxic and ceased all contact. She then went on to marry Max. Carl is still in love with Kirsty, believing her to be [...] "the only woman for him" [...] and his second mission in Walford is to get her back. Coonan said this would cause problems between Carl and Max. He later said that [...] "In Carl's head, he's coming in on a white horse to save Kirsty from a bad marriage", and {{explained that}} while Carl was in prison he focussed on Kirsty, and she [...] "become an object of this freedom he was dreaming about. [...] Now he sees she's poodling after Max and that he isn't treating her right." [...] However, he thought that Kirsty may not want to reunite with Carl because [...] "he's not the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guy</b> who's just going to change overnight" [...] and he is probably not [...] "the knight in shining armour" [...] he thinks he is. Coonan {{went on to say that}} Carl would treat Kirsty [...] "like a goddess" [...] but would probably have a problem with her independence, and he would want to provide for her, being [...] "old-fashioned and a bit misguided", and they would have a [...] "fiery" [...] relationship because they are both [...] "strong-willed". Kierston Wareing, who plays Kirsty, opined that her character is more suited to Carl than to Max, and hoped they could be a [...] "manipulative, power couple".|$|E

500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{continues}} with track four, [...] "Double Tap" [...] which features American rapper 2 Chainz. With production from Jonas Jeberg, who also produced Sparks' 2008 single [...] "One Step At A Time", {{the song is}} an ode {{to all of the}} Instagram stalkers that don’t show their love {{in the form of the}} likes. It’s also a call to action for those people. Sparks sings [...] "Baby, on the low / You stay on my page cause I guess I’m your favorite / But you won’t let it show, no way / If you like what you see then you gotta let me know / Bet you won’t double tap that hoe / Bet you won’t double tap that hoe". The next song, [...] "Boyz In The Hood" [...] keeps the upbeat energy of the album going with its piano-led snapping production. The [...] "infectious" [...] jam sees Sparks take on her ideal version of the perfect bad boy, describing all different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys</b> that peek her interest, [...] "Snap backs, tattoos and a Vee neck / That's all he'll ever need to be fresh / And we rolling down the street / And them J's on his feet / And His chains all on me". Production on the album then moves on to a senual midtempo ballad, [...] "Silhouette" [...]The song sees Sparks using her falsetto vocals by channeling Mariah Carey's earlier work adopting her [...] "most agile coos". Sparks takes it to the bedroom in speaks of the descriptive and intimate moments she is sharing with her lover [...] " [...] There's no space between us / Tonight we'll be seamless / Painting perfect pictures of what's going on in this bed / Insatiable shadows revealed by the candles / You and me and our silhouette".|$|R

Vito's solo on [...] "Wait" [...] is excellent and doesn't sound like Eddie at all." [...] —Zakk Wylde [...] Bratta's partner in White Lion, Mike Tramp, also remarked that Bratta's skills as a guitar player and songwriter were unmatched:"Vito the guitar player and Vito the songwriter and musician, he was in a calibre all by himself. It shows in his great solos, and so many people love the way he played like Eddie with the hammer-ons and all that stuff like the Van Halen solo on “Ain’t Talkin’ Bout Love.” I just love the way Vito played solos on “Wait” and “Little Fighter” and some of the others. He was like Mozart."Tramp also mentioned that many accomplished guitar players turned him down when he attempted to put together a new version of White Lion. [...] "We tried to do new White Lions with Warren DeMartini and Paul Gilbert and all these others, and no one wanted to do Vito. He was unlike anyone else, he had his own way of doing thing, and plus he was a great songwriter. Had he remained in the business, Vito would have been bigger than Steve Vai and all those <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>guys.</b> With him the melody came before anything else, and that’s nothing but the highest praise."Guitar World Magazine named Vito one of the best 20 guitarists of the 80s, commenting: Vito Bratta was the most tasteful, lyrical and inventive guitarist of his generation, adding structure, style and an unerring pop sensibility to Van Halen’s oft-tapped fountain of inspiration."Producer Michael Wagener called Vito Bratta his [...] "favorite guitar player" [...] on February 17, 2007, when he called the Eddie Trunk show.|$|R
