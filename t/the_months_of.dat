5|$|Due to {{the heavier}} {{concentration}} of Japanese surface combat vessels and their well-positioned logistical base at Simpson Harbor, Rabaul, and their {{victory at the}} Battle of Savo Island in early August, the Japanese had established operational control over the waters around Guadalcanal at night.

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> May and June, four named systems developed. In July, one {{tropical}} storm and two hurricanes formed.

A moderate El Nino was present throughout the season; water temperatures across the equatorial Central Pacific were 1.3°C (3°F) above normal. In addition, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was in a warm phase during this time period.|$|E
5|$|During the season, a {{total of}} sixteen {{tropical}} cyclones developed, featuring ten hurricanes, four tropical storms and two tropical depressions. These totals {{are close to the}} climatological averages established since 1966, when satellite surveillance began. However, the season was less active than 1990, which had a record 16 hurricanes (more than 1991). On the other hand, it ended late with the first November hurricane since 1966. On the other hand, <b>the</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> July and August, often the most active ones in this basin, only produced two tropical cyclones each. The activity in July is four systems below the average of six at that time due to unusual circulation patterns aloft over the tropical Pacific. A shorter gap from late August to early September was attributed to anomalous flow patterns near the Baja California Peninsula. Several tropical cyclones grew into specially long-lived and intense systems. For example, Hurricane Kevin endured as a hurricane for 12½ days to the east of 140°W, establishing a new record for longevity in the eastern Pacific.|$|E
