5|$|The {{first two}} rows of this table are straightforward. The {{homotopy}} groups πi(S0) of the 0-dimensional sphere are <b>trivial</b> for i > 0, because any base point preserving map from an i-sphere to a 0-sphere is a one-point mapping. Similarly, the homotopy groups πi(S1) of the 1-sphere are <b>trivial</b> for i > 1, because the universal covering space, R, which has the same higher homotopy groups, is contractible.|$|E
5|$|The {{homology}} groups H'i(S'n), with i > n, are all <b>trivial.</b> It therefore {{came as a}} {{great surprise}} historically that the corresponding homotopy groups are not <b>trivial</b> in general. This {{is the case that}} is of real importance: the higher homotopy groups πi(S'n), for i > n, are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute, and the effort to compute them has generated a significant amount of new mathematics.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{reveals that}} she is divorcing her {{overbearing}} husband, Charles (Matt Letscher), after a <b>trivial</b> fight. She admits to Theodore that she has become close friends with a female OS that Charles left behind. Theodore confesses to Amy that he is dating his OS.|$|E
5|$|For 0<i<n, any mapping from S'i to S'n is {{homotopic}} (i.e., continuously deformable) to {{a constant}} mapping, i.e., a mapping that maps all of S'i {{to a single}} point of S'n. Therefore the homotopy group is the <b>trivial</b> group.|$|E
5|$|Genuine press cards can be {{obtained}} by people not entitled to them, counterfeit copies of real cards can be made, and plausible-looking cards can be issued by anybody, or made. The reasons and consequences range from the <b>trivial</b> (free drinks) to the catastrophic (access by terrorists to rulers).|$|E
5|$|It {{contains}} the elements titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf) and rutherfordium (Rf). This group {{lies in the}} d-block of the periodic table. The group itself has not acquired a <b>trivial</b> name; {{it belongs to the}} broader grouping of the transition metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{relation}} → is a dense order, {{meaning that}} for all (undirected) graphs G, H such that G < H, there is a graph K such that G < K < H (this holds except for the <b>trivial</b> cases G = K0 or K1).|$|E
5|$|A worm whose ruleset {{begins with}} 0 {{continues}} {{in a straight line}} forever. This is a <b>trivial</b> case, so it is usually stipulated that the worm must turn when it encounters a point with only uneaten gridlines. Furthermore, to avoid mirror-image symmetrical duplicates, the worm's first turn must be a right hand turn. A worm dies if it returns to its origin a third time, because there are then no untraversed edges available. Only the origin can be lethal to the worm.|$|E
5|$|ABC and Nielsen partnered in 2011 {{to create}} a Grey Anatomy {{application}} for Apple's iPad. The application was designed to allow viewers to participate in polls and learn <b>trivial</b> facts as they watch a live episode. It uses Nielsen's Media-Sync software to listen for the episode and to post features as the episode progresses.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Karelin {{was awarded}} for his {{recognition}} {{as the greatest}} wrestler of all time (from antiquity to the present day). He was a Greco-Roman wrestler in the Olympics, and in his career he won 887 bouts and lost only 2 times. His losses are controversial because commentators believe they were caused by <b>trivial</b> rule changes, not a bona fide athletic defeat.|$|E
5|$|Another Trojan in this wave, TorrentLocker, {{initially}} {{contained a}} design flaw comparable to CryptoDefense; it {{used the same}} keystream for every infected computer, making the encryption <b>trivial</b> to overcome. However, this flaw was later fixed. By late-November 2014, {{it was estimated that}} over 9,000 users had been infected by TorrentLocker in Australia alone, trailing only Turkey with 11,700 infections.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{introduced}} in <b>Trivial</b> Games and Paranoid Pursuits, is Russian Alexander Krivenko, {{the commander of}} the Moonbase where the ISPF have their headquarters. A winner of the Nobel Prize for Medicine, it is Krivenko's research into bone damage that has contributed to enabling humanity to access space easily. Although the Star Cops are independent, Spring's relationship with Krivenko is often deferential and he frequently seems to capitulate to Krivenko's wishes.|$|E
5|$|Lesser {{offences}} were {{dealt with}} by commanding officers. For petty offences, a company commander could have men fined or confined to barracks for fatigue duty A battalion Commanding Officer could give detention, order up to 28 days Field Punishment, or demote corporals to the ranks (officers and senior NCOs were {{dealt with by}} court martial other than for very <b>trivial</b> offences). Enlisted men could also lose leave or seniority.|$|E
5|$|Life for the {{ordinary}} {{soldiers of the}} garrison was tedious and harsh, with corporal punishment administered {{for even the most}} <b>trivial</b> offences. Suicide and desertions were common due to boredom, shortages of food and the poor living conditions. At Middle Hill Battery, guards had to be posted to prevent soldiers from deserting by lowering themselves on ropes down the cliff face.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} in the Elapidae family, {{the majority of the}} Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or <b>trivial.</b> For example, P. platurus has a venom more potent than any terrestrial snake species in Costa Rica based on LD50, but despite its abundance in the waters off its western coast, few human fatalities have been reported. Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be handled with great caution.|$|E
5|$|More generally, the i-th {{homotopy}} group, πi(X) {{begins with}} the pointed i-sphere (S'i,s), and otherwise follows the same procedure. The null homotopic class acts as {{the identity of the}} group addition, and for X equal to S'n (for positive n) — the homotopy groups of spheres — the groups are abelian and finitely generated. If for some i all maps are null homotopic, then the group πi consists of one element, and is called the <b>trivial</b> group.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders' {{defensive}} positions {{had been}} improved despite {{the weather and}} the harassment from German artillery, which killed Fulton, the original commander of the Rifle Brigade, when a barrage targeted his headquarters. The division undertook the first offensive action by the British forces during the Spring Offensive when three battalions seized the high ground of La Signy farm on 30 March. This success, although relatively <b>trivial</b> to the New Zealanders, was a morale booster {{for the rest of the}} beleaguered Third Army.|$|E
5|$|The University of Bristol is {{associated}} with two Ig Nobel Prizes, an award for unusual or <b>trivial</b> achievements in scientific research. Sir Michael Berry shared the award (with Andre Geim, a Nobel Laureate) for using magnets to levitate a frog. Gareth Jones also shared an Ig Nobel prize for scientifically documenting fellatio in fruit bats.|$|E
5|$|The above {{procedure}} only performs exact matches, {{finding the}} position of a target value. However, due to the ordered nature of sorted arrays, it is <b>trivial</b> to extend binary search to perform approximate matches. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. Range queries seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} table {{gives an}} idea of the complexity of the higher homotopy groups even for spheres of dimension 8 or less. In this table, the entries are either the <b>trivial</b> group 0, the infinite cyclic group Z, finite cyclic groups of order n (written as Zn), or direct products of such groups (written, for example, as Z24times&Z3 or Z22 = Z2times&Z2). Extended tables of homotopy groups of spheres are given {{at the end of the}} article.|$|E
5|$|The <b>trivial</b> name {{acetic acid}} {{is the most}} {{commonly}} used and preferred IUPAC name. The systematic name ethanoic acid, a valid IUPAC name, is constructed according to the substitutive nomenclature. The name acetic acid derives from acetum, the Latin word for vinegar, and is related to the word acid itself.|$|E
5|$|Baby becomes {{involved}} in a <b>trivial</b> argument with a loafer in {{the centre of the}} village. The dispute escalates, but passersby calm them down. However, Crispin appears and attacks the man who had argued with Baby. The man, joined by Jimson Augustine, jumps on Crispin in retaliation. Noticing the commotion, Mahesh tries to calm everyone down but Jimson, furious at Mahesh's authoritative stance, beats him up. Vincent breaks up the fight. Embarrassed, Mahesh vows to get back at Jimson and pledges that he will wear slippers only after he has avenged his humiliation.|$|E
5|$|Coral Ridge Properties {{established}} strict landscaping {{and sign}} laws for the city—a {{question in the}} original version of <b>Trivial</b> Pursuit noted that the city hosted the first McDonald's without the distinctive Golden Arches sign. Restrictions on commercial signs, exterior paint colors, roofing materials, recreational vehicle and boat storage, and landscaping specifications are all strictly enforced; consequently, real estate values in the city are {{significantly higher than the}} county as a whole. In 2006, the median price of a single family home in Coral Springs was US$415,000, while the median price county-wide was US$323,000.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>trivial</b> names, chemists have constructed semi-trivial names by appending a standard symbol to a <b>trivial</b> stem. Some <b>trivial</b> and semi-trivial names are so widely used {{that they have}} been officially adopted by IUPAC; these are known as retained names.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trivial</b> cases: These are all <b>trivial</b> draws in general: bishop only, knight only, bishop versus knight, bishop versus bishop, knight versus knight.|$|E
25|$|The Whitehead {{group of}} the <b>trivial</b> group is <b>trivial.</b> Since the group ring of the <b>trivial</b> group is Z, {{we have to show}} that any matrix can be written as a product of {{elementary}} matrices times a diagonal matrix; this follows easily from the fact that Z is a Euclidean domain.|$|E
25|$|The {{representation}} RθT {{contains the}} <b>trivial</b> representation if {{and only if}} θ=1 (in which case the <b>trivial</b> representation occurs exactly once).|$|E
25|$|Every {{singleton}} set {x} closed under {{a binary}} operation • forms the <b>trivial</b> (one-element) monoid, {{which is also}} the <b>trivial</b> group.|$|E
25|$|The {{symmetric}} group has two 1-dimensional representations: the <b>trivial</b> representation and the sign representation. The symmetric polynomials are the <b>trivial</b> representation, and the alternating polynomials are the sign representation. Formally, the scalar span of any symmetric (resp., alternating) polynomial is a <b>trivial</b> (resp., sign) {{representation of the}} {{symmetric group}}, and multiplying the polynomials tensors the representations.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the other}} {{characteristic}} classes, the Euler class is unstable, {{in the sense}} of stable homotopy theory. Concretely, this means that if 1 is a <b>trivial</b> bundle, then e(V ⊕ 1) ≠ e(V); stable would mean that these are equal. In fact, adding a <b>trivial</b> bundle gives an obvious section, namely a constant on the <b>trivial</b> component, and 0 on the other, thus e(V ⊕ 1) = 0.|$|E
25|$|If {{replacing}} the aldehyde {{group with a}} carboxyl group (−COOH) would yield a carboxylic acid with a <b>trivial</b> name, the aldehyde may be named by {{replacing the}} suffix -ic acid or -oic acid in this <b>trivial</b> name by -aldehyde.|$|E
25|$|For n = 0 (or in fact n < 0) the {{projective}} space of K0 is empty, {{as there are}} no 1-dimensional subspaces of a 0-dimensional space. Thus, PGL(0, K) is the <b>trivial</b> group, consisting of the unique empty map from the empty set to itself. Further, the action of scalars on a 0-dimensional space is <b>trivial,</b> so the map K* → GL(0, K) is <b>trivial,</b> rather than an inclusion {{as it is in}} higher dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{stabiliser}} of Δ is <b>trivial.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Trivial</b> names often {{arise in}} the common language; they may come from {{historic}} usages in, for example, alchemy. Many <b>trivial</b> names pre-date the institution of formal naming conventions. Names can {{be based on a}} property of the chemical, including appearance (color, taste or smell), consistency, and crystal structure; a place where it was found or where the discoverer comes from; the name of a scientist; a mythological figure; an astronomical body; the shape of the molecule; and even fictional figures. All elements that have been isolated have <b>trivial</b> names.|$|E
