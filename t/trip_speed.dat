50|$|Traffic {{congestion}} reduces average traffic speed. At low speeds, {{scientific studies}} reveal, vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, {{a study in}} the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. At average <b>trip</b> <b>speeds</b> between 20 and 40 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 kilometers per hour. At average <b>trip</b> <b>speeds</b> between 5 and 20 kilometers per hour, the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 kilometers per hour. Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion.|$|R
30|$|Wellbore {{instability}} is a {{key problem}} restricting efficient production of coal-bed methane. In order to perform thorough and systematic research regarding coal-bed wellbore stability problems, a new discrete element model which fully considers the features of cleat coal-beds is established based on the Kirsch equation. With this model, the safe pipe <b>tripping</b> <b>speed,</b> drilling fluid density window and coal-bed collapse/fracture pressure are determined; in addition, the relationships between pipe <b>tripping</b> <b>speed</b> and pipe size, cleat size, etc. and wellbore stability are analyzed in the coal-bed drilling and pipe tripping processes. The case studies show the following results: the wellbore collapses (collapse pressure: 4.33 MPa) or fractures (fracture pressure: 12.7 MPa) in certain directions {{as a result of}} swab or surge pressure when the pipe <b>tripping</b> <b>speed</b> is higher than a certain value; the cleat face size has a great influence on wellbore stability, and if the drilling fluid pressure is too low, the wellbore is prone to collapse when the ratio of the face cleat size to butt cleat size is reduced; however, if the drilling fluid pressure is high enough, the butt cleat size has no influence on the wellbore fracture; the factors influencing coal-bed stability include the movement length, pipe size, borehole size.|$|R
50|$|From {{the time}} it was built one shaft was {{specifically}} used by the British Standards Institution (BSI) for type testing of lift safety components at the time under the BS5655 and BS EN81 standards. Safety Gear testing involved putting the lift cars (frame) into free fall conditions with rated mass at <b>tripping</b> <b>speeds</b> as required by the designers of the safety gear to ensure the lift cars decelerated and stopped within the requirements of the standard. Buffer testing involved impacting them with the maximum and minimum mass at <b>tripping</b> <b>speeds</b> to ensure decelerations were within that requirement by the standard in both cases the aim was to ensure if the lift ever went into free fall or uncontrolled downward movement the safety components stopped the lift without causing any serious injury to the occupant. BSI ceased using the test tower soon after the site was acquired for housing in 1997-98.|$|R

50|$|The double motion {{technique}} halves the <b>tripping</b> <b>speed</b> of {{the moving}} part. In principle, the kinetic energy could be quartered if the total moving mass were not increased. However, as the total moving mass is increased, the practical reduction in kinetic energy is closer to 60%. The total tripping energy also includes the compression energy, which is almost the same for both techniques. Thus, {{the reduction of the}} total tripping energy is lower, about 30%, although the exact value depends on the application and the operating mechanism. Depending on the specific case, either the double motion or the single motion technique can be cheaper. Other considerations, such as rationalization of the circuit breaker range, can also influence the cost.|$|R

The average automobile work-to-home time of 32. 5 minutes in both 1968 and 1988 is, moreover, very consistent with a 1957 survey showing an average time of 33. 5 minutes in metropolitan Washington.

40|$|Speed {{reduction}} measures {{have become an}} increasingly popular way to increase traffic safety especially in urban areas. Recently many cities have converted entire districts into 30 km/h zones. In many European countries the maximum speed of haulage trucks is under discussion or review sometimes in combination with a ban on overtaking. Reducing the maximum speed is perceived and promoted by policy makers as beneficial to the environment because of reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions. These claims however have not been scientifically validated. They stem from the popular believe that the widely used Copert-approach, which is scientifically valid for average <b>trip</b> <b>speeds,</b> {{can be used to}} assess the environmental impact of speed management policies at a local scale.

5000|$|However one may avoid {{use of the}} {{harmonic}} mean for the case of [...] "weighting by distance".

Then take the weighted arithmetic mean of the si's weighted by their respective distances (optionally with the weights normalized so they sum to 1 by dividing them by trip length).

With full consideration of the important factors such as wave velocity, gas influx rate, pressure, temperature, and well depth, a new {{surge pressure}} model has been proposed based on the mass conservation equations and the momentum conservation equations during MPD operations. The finite-difference method, the Newton-Raphson iterative method, and the fourth-order explicit Runge-Kutta method (R-K 4) are adopted to solve the model. Calculation {{results indicate that the}} surge pressure has different values with respect to different drill pipe <b>tripping</b> <b>speeds</b> and well parameters. In general, the surge pressure tends to increase with the increases of drill pipe operating speed and with the decrease of gas influx rate and wellbore diameter. When the gas influx occurs, the surge pressure is weakened obviously.
