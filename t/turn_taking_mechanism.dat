Using the indefinitely repeated common-pool resource assignment game and a perfect stranger experimental design, this paper reports novel evidence that players who have successfully used an efficiency-enhancing <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategy will teach other players in subsequent supergames to adopt this strategy. We find that subjects engage in <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> frequently in both the Low Conflict and the High Conflict treatments. Prior experience with <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> significantly increases <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> in both treatments. Moreover, successful <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> often involves fast learning, and individuals with <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> experience {{are more likely to}} be teachers than inexperienced individuals.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} kinds of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> {{strategies}} used in the three males? chatting. The importance of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies in chatting has motivated the writer to conduct this study. In his study, he wants to figure out about the highest occurrence of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies and how the way males converse and use <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies in chatting. The writer derives <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies from Stenstrom?s classification, that are <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> including starting up, taking over and interrupting, holding the turn containing filled pauses and verbal fillers, silent pauses, repetition and new start, and yielding the turn consisting of prompting, appealing and giving up. The subject {{of this study is}} three males of English Department students including the writer himself and his close friends. This thesis uses qualitative descriptive approach because the writer attempts to calculate and describe the data which he gets from the chatting. To collect the data, the writer records the chatting between the subjects of research in his house to have the chatting as natural as possible. Through the analysis, the writer finds out that the three males? chatting used all kinds of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies classified by Stenstrom. Moreover, <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> was the highest occurrence in the chatting. Hence, the participants produce the <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies by giving signals...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{classroom}} interactions using a conversation analytic approach {{to explore the}} relationship between <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> and silences in classroom interaction. Seventeen mathematics lessons with pupils aged between 12 and 14 years were analysed {{in terms of the}} structure of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> and the length and nature of pauses that occurred during whole class interactions. We show that the <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> structure of classroom interactions remains consistent with that described in the conversation analytic literature. In classroom interactions where different <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> structures apply, silences have a different influence on student and teacher behaviour. We then demonstrate that the pedagogical construct of wait time is structurally built into classrooms with a formal <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> structure and that this structure explains many of the previous research findings relating to the length of wait time. These findings have implications for pedagogic policies and recommendations relating to classroom interactions. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{structural}} phenomena of natural language communication is <b>turn</b> <b>taking,</b> i. e. the communicating agents <b>taking</b> <b>turns</b> in being speaker and hearer. Without <b>turn</b> <b>taking,</b> there is only one-sided monologue as the limiting case. The linguistic framework called Database Semantics (AIJ’ 01) treats the agent’s switching {{back and forth between the}} speaker and the hearer mode as a well-defined and well-motivated computational problem. Its solution is a precondition for modeling natural language communication by programming suitable machines (talking robots). All syntactic and semantic analysis of natural language must be integrated into the <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> underlying communication. <b>Turn</b> <b>taking</b> is modeled as the interaction of three kinds of LA-grammars, called LA-hear, LA-think, and LA-speak. LA-hear interprets natural language signs by reading their content into the hearer’s database. LA-think provides the content to be verbalized by autonomously navigating through the speaker’s database content (conceptualization). LA-speak maps the content traversed by LA-think into natural language surfaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{previous}} studies on language and gender indicate {{that men and}} women are using different languages. This is an interactive study which was conducted in a classroom full of male and female students. Therefore this study aims to evaluate the classroom interaction among primary school students as the main component to view the differences in minimal responses and <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> among male and female students. The main objective {{of this study is to}} identify the frequency of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> and differences in using minimal responses among the primary school students during classroom interactions. The comparisons in the frequency of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> during interactions among the male and female students in the classroom are assessed based on interruptions during conversations and overlapping statements. This study also evaluates and identifying the types of minimal responses during interactions among the male and female students during classes. The primary data was obtained through recorded and transcribed interactions in the classroom. The researcher used qualitative method to gathered data of minimal responses and <b>turn</b> <b>taking.</b> The researcher also used simple calculation method to identify the frequency of minimal responses and <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> by analyzing the obtained data. The study shows that the male students are dominant in <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> during interaction compared to female students who are softer and provide opportunities for male students during interactions. The female students are also found to give more minimal responses during interactions.

These two aspects are essential in classroom discourse whose aspects {{different from those of}} the other types of discourse. The study aims to investigate the nature of classroom interaction patterns and <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> distributions during the classroom activities in two different classes. Besides, it attempts to reveal the implication of classroom interaction patterns and <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> distributions in teaching learning practices. This study uses descriptive qualitative research design which employed two data collection techniques, i. e. observation and voice recording. The data are, then, analyzed by using two models of analysis, i. e. classroom interaction pattern (e. g. Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975) and <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> distribution (e. g.

Second, the researcher discovers that the distribution of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> in class A is not equal, while in class B it is more equal. Third, the implication of class A, based on the research findings, is that the class which is observed is teacher-centered class. Besides, the teacher in class A does not maximize the students’ participation. On the other hand, the results of the findings imply that the teacher gives more opportunities to the students to participate in the interaction in class B...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the emergence of}} <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> in three finitely repeated games: (i) an allocation game, (ii) a low conflict dominant strategy equilibrium (DSE) game and (iii) a high conflict DSE game in an experimental setting. The experiments are run with and without cheap talk communication between participants. In order to develop experimental conjectures and interpret results we develop a theoretical analysis which incorporates the presence of three types of participant: (i) cooperative, (ii) competitive and (iii) self seeking. Based on our theoretical analysis we hypothesize that <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> may be exhibited experimentally in {{all three of the}} games we study when some participants have cooperative preferences. We find experimentally that <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> emerges in all treatments, and its incidence is qualitatively similar in the allocation and DSE games. While cheap talk increased the rate of cooperative behavior and eliminated competitive behaviour, it had at most a small effect on self seeking behavior. The degree of conflict also had a small effect on the prevalence of <b>turn</b> <b>taking.</b> We observed, using a repeated matching experiment for the high conflict DSE games, that a large majority of participants’ behavior can be attributed to one of the three types...|$|R

40|$|A paper {{presented}} at the University of Cambridge, Department of Linguistics.,This paper will demonstrate the extent to which conversation analysis, especially <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> applies in Ndebele. The paper will first test whether conversation analysis is a method or theory. It however, has largely been viewed as a method of analysing linguistic recordings. On the other hand, it has been viewed as an alternative to Griceâ€™s notion of maxims. The paper will, therefore, test whether it is a theory or method. The paper will then test the universal applicability of this method/theory. Tape recording was done to get speech samples. Using extracts of these recordings, the essay will then analyse turn-taking especially the role played by overlaps and silence in Ndebele discourse. The paper will concentrate on the properties of turn-taking called local management, party-administering and interactional control, that is, on the degree of freedom in allocating turns. It is our hypothesis that these properties of <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> are not applicable in Ndebele.

40|$|If a {{conversation}} is held, <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> must take place {{which means that}} there must be changes of the speaker?s turn during the conversation. Strenstrom theory (1994) divides <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies into <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> strategy, holding the turn strategy and yielding the turn strategy. Sometimes, there is a dominant speaker who talks longer than others. However, gender {{can be one of the}} some aspects that can influence someone to be a dominant speaker. Tannen said that men are more dominant than women in the conversation. Recently, there is an issue which states that actually women are more dominant than men in the conversation. Next, the writer chooses the film Pretty Woman as the sources of this research because the story is very popular and also <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> is found in the conversation. Therefore, the writer wants to know the dominant speaker between the main characters based on gender, especially in using the <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies. In this research, the writer uses both qualitative and quantitative research because the result of the quantitative research can support the final result of this research. The source of this research is only the main conversation between the main characters. After analyzing the data by using the Strenstrom?s theory, the writer finds out that <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> is the highest strategy that occurs between the main characters in Pretty Woman. Another finding is the dominant speaker between the main characters is a female. Moreover, some characteristics of using the <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> strategies that are used by a dominant speaker in dominating other speakers in this research are using <b>taking</b> the <b>turn</b> strategy, especially uptake, a clean start, alert. In using those strategies, she usually gives respond and then starts a new topic again with questioning the previous speaker. Sometimes, the dominant speaker here gives her respond by using high intonation, so she tends to interrupt the male speaker who is still talking. Besides, the dominant speaker also uses holding the turn, especially new start. From the findings, the writer can conclude that the Tannen?s theory cannot be applied in this researc...|$|R

40|$|The {{timing of}} <b>turn</b> <b>taking</b> in {{conversation}} is extremely rapid given the cognitive demands on speakers to comprehend, plan and execute turns in real time.

We use the Switchboard corpus of English telephone conversation, already richly annotated for syntactic structure speech act sequences, and segmental alignment.
