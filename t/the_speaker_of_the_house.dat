5|$|In Australia, {{the formal}} {{ceremony}} of granting assent in parliament {{has not been}} regularly used since the early 20th century. Now, the bill {{is sent to the}} governor-general's residence by the house in which it originated.

A similar practice is followed in New Zealand, where the governor-general has not granted the Royal Assent in person in parliament since 1875.|$|E

5|$|As the House of Councillors can veto a {{decision}} made by the House of Representatives, the House of Councillors can cause the House of Representatives to reconsider its decision. The House of Representatives however, can still insist on its decision by overwriting the veto by the House of Councillors with a two-thirds majority of its members present. Each year, and when required, the National Diet is convoked at the House of Councillors, {{on the advice of}} the Cabinet, for an extra or an ordinary session, by the Emperor. A short speech is, however, usually first made by <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Representatives before the Emperor proceeds to convoke the Diet with his Speech from the throne.|$|E
5|$|Canada uses a Westminster-style {{parliamentary}} government, {{in which}} {{the leader of the}} party with the most seats in the House of Commons becomes Prime Minister, even {{if he or she is}} not an elected member of parliament. The leader of the party with the second-most seats in the House becomes the Leader of the Official Opposition, and debate (formally called Oral Questions) between the parties is presided over by <b>the</b> <b>Speaker</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> When the party with the most seats has less than half of the total number of seats, it forms a minority government, which can be voted out of power by the other parties. The Canadian Parliament is located at Parliament Hill in the capital city, Ottawa. The current assembly is the first session of the 42nd Canadian Parliament, since the confederation of Canada in 1867.|$|E
