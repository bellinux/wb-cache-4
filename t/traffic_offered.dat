50|$|In general, {{grade of}} service (GoS) is {{measured}} by looking at traffic carried, <b>traffic</b> <b>offered</b> and calculating the traffic blocked and lost. The proportion of lost calls is the measure of GoS. For cellular circuit groups an acceptable GoS is 0.02. This means that two users of the circuit group out of a hundred will encounter a call refusal during the busy hour {{at the end of}} the planning period. The grade of service standard is thus the acceptable level of traffic that the network can lose. GoS is calculated from the Erlang-B formula, as a function of the number of channels required for the offered traffic intensity.|$|E

In March 1876 he was named the company's vice president, but {{continued}} to hold the vice presidency and superintendency of the company's business operations west of the Missouri River. At this time, the CB&Q was part of the [...] "Iowa Pool," [...] a group of three railroads (the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad ("the Rock"); Omaha and Northwestern Railroad (O&N); and the CB&Q) with major freight facilities in Omaha, Nebraska. At any given time, a single railroad might not have enough freight cars in Omaha to accommodate shippers. So they pooled their resources, and agreed to split the income from freight charges. The Iowa Pool was locked in a struggle with the Union Pacific Railroad. Profits depended on how much freight was handled, and which side could charge more. The Iowa Pool, which had more trains and track, could offer shippers a faster way across the Midwest (and charged higher prices accordingly). The CB&Q was the dominant system in the Pool. CB&Q president James Frederick Joy clashed with Perkins over the CB&Q's operations. Perkins wanted [...] "his" [...] railroad, the B&MR's Nebraska division, to carry <b>traffic</b> <b>offered</b> by the Union Pacific. But Joy would not allow it, wishing to force the Union Pacific to move freight via the Iowa Pool. Moreover, Joy owned a controlling interest in other small railroads which could also route traffic away from the Iowa Pool, and these lines were demanding that Joy stop inhibiting them. Forbes ousted Joy in 1875 and appointed Robert Harris as the CB&Q's new president—a move which led to Perkins' elevation to the road's vice presidency.|$|E

5000|$|In Ontario, the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway (TG&BR) and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway (T&NR), {{were the}} first public {{passenger}} carrying narrow-gauge railways on the continent of North America, coming into service {{in the summer of}} 1871. The gauge of [...] was chosen on the recommendation of Carl Abraham Pihl, Chief Engineer of the Norwegian State Railways, who had adopted this gauge in Norway in the early 1860s. Sir Charles Fox, engineer and constructor of the Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London’s Hyde Park, was largely responsible for adoption of the gauge throughout the former British Empire and Colonies, it becoming commonly known as the ‘Colonial’ gauge. The objective of the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway was to open up the bush country north of Toronto to settlement and commerce. The lines were first surveyed by John Edward Boyd of St. John, New Brunswick who, as Railway Engineer of that colony in the 1860s, had advocated the construction of the New Brunswick Railway on the gauge of 3 ft 6 in. Boyd later became the Chief Engineer of the narrow-gauge Prince Edward Island Railway. The chief Engineer of both the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway and the Toronto and Nipissing Railway was Edmund Wragge, a former pupil and associate of Sir Charles Fox. Wragge returned to Britain between 1895 and 1905 and was honoured by the award of the Telford Gold Medal of the Institution of Civil Engineers for his work on the approach to and construction of the London (Marylebone) terminus of the Great Central Railway. The Ontario lines were of substantial length, over 300 mi in aggregate, and both were built with the objective of connecting with a future Pacific railway, at Lake Nipissing {{in the case of the}} T&NR, and via steamers to the Lakehead in the case of the TG&BR. Only the latter was achieved. Although independent of each other financially, they were promoted and engineered by the same men and were in fact connected by a short length of third rail in the Toronto waterfront trackage of the Grand Trunk Railway. These Ontario railways attempted several innovations in addition to the adoption of the narrow gauge: the use of Clark’s six wheel radial axles for longer stock - a complete failure and never used; the use of four wheel boxcars for economy and flexibility - not entirely successful; the use of large Fairlie articulated 0-6-6-0 freight locomotives (see illustration) - found very powerful and useful initially, but heavy on maintenance and not pursued further; and the early use of powerful Avonside Engine Company 4-6-0 and Baldwin Locomotive Works 2-8-0 locomotives for freight haulage - very successful engines which remained in service with the Canadian Pacific Railway after gauge standardization. Initially very successful in stimulating trade, the two railways had difficulty carrying all the <b>traffic</b> <b>offered</b> in the early 1870s. Then, after they had bought large numbers of additional freight locomotives and boxcars, the traffic fell off due to the economic depression of the mid-1870s and was insufficient to support the heavy financial burden of the capital invested. A case of ‘too much, too late’. Like all smaller railways in central Canada in the early 1880s their financial difficulties made them vulnerable in the battle for feeder routes and traffic between the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). The Toronto and Nipissing Railway was amalgamated into the Midland Railway of Canada in 1881 and made standard gauge as part of the Midland's plan to obtain direct access to Toronto; later the whole enterprise was absorbed by the Grand Trunk Railway. The Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway was first acquired by the Grand Trunk Railway which converted it to standard gauge in 1881, but following its own financial embarrassment it was forced to cede control to the Ontario and Quebec Railway a proxy for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Much of the trackage has been abandoned and lifted but some remains in service. 20 mi of the T&NR from Toronto to Stouffville carries GO Transit commuter trains and a further 12 mi from Stouffville to Uxbridge, Ontario, is operated as a tourist line by the York Durham Heritage Railway. 26 mi of the TG&BR from Toronto to Bolton, Ontario, carries CPR freight trains, and about 3 mi from Melville Junction to Orangeville is operated by the Orangeville-Brampton Railway. Another tourist line, the Portage Flyer, operates at the Muskoka Heritage Place museum complex in Huntsville, and runs on [...]75 mi of [...] narrow-gauge track.|$|E

The latter instead fear that the <b>traffic</b> <b>offered</b> by these applications can grow without control, affecting other services, and possibly causing network congestion and collapse. The “Network-Aware P 2 P-TV Application over Wise Networks” FP 7 project aims at studying and developing a novel P 2 P-TV application offering the chance to broadcast high definition video to broadcasters and to carefully manage the <b>traffic</b> <b>offered</b> by peers to the network, therefore avoiding worries to Internet providers about network overload.

In this paper, we provide some results that show how effective can be a network aware P 2 P-TV system. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} overall telecommunication network with virtual circuits switching, in stationary state, with Poisson input flow, repeated calls, limited number of homogeneous terminals and 8 types of losses. One of the main problems of network dimensioning/redimensioning is estimation of <b>traffic</b> <b>offered</b> in network because it reflects on finding of necessary number of circuit switching lines {{on the basis of}} the consideration of detailed users manners and target Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper we investigate the behaviour of the <b>traffic</b> <b>offered</b> in a network regarding QoS variables: “probability of blocked switching” and “probability of finding B-terminals busy”. Numerical dependencies are shown graphically. A network dimensioning task (NDT) is formulated, solvability of the NDT and the necessary conditions for analytical solution are researched as well.
