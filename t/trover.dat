5|$|The {{advantages}} to this method were that bills were substantially cheaper, and unlike writs did not tie the plaintiff down; once the case came to court the bill could be amended to include any action or actions the plaintiff wanted to enforce. In addition, by avoiding the Chancery writ, {{the case was}} substantially cheaper. The result of this was substantial; between 1560 and 1640, the King's Bench's business rose tenfold. This period also saw a substantial broadening of the remedies available in the common law. The main remedy and method was action on the case, which justices expanded to encompass other things. In 1499 it enabled the enforcement of parol promises, which rendered Chancery subpoenas obsolete; later developments included the recovery of debts, suing for defamatory words (previously an ecclesiastical matter) and action on the case for <b>trover</b> and conversion. Most of this reform took place under Fineux CJ, who never lived {{to see the results}} of his work; it took over 100 years for the reforms to fully reverse the decline in business.|$|E
25|$|In Holdsworth's Case Clayt. 151, pl. 99, 1638, {{an attempt}} {{to bring an action}} in <b>trover</b> for the {{wrongful}} detention of chattels by a bailee failed, because the action sounded in detinue and not <b>trover.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Mitchell v. Georgia & A. R. Co. {{it was noted that}} where action in <b>trover</b> is allowed by statute, and defined by such, it {{necessarily}} includes all three actions of <b>trover,</b> detinue and replevin.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinion in}} this case was that mere damage to a chattel was not a good claim in <b>trover.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similar {{results are}} seen in other cases from the time. The two actions were {{regarded}} as alternative remedies for the same wrong. Often, the plaintiff had a choice of action, although there were differences between the choices. <b>Trover</b> must involve a wrongful detention of goods which had not been wrongfully taken, while trespass would not. The theory of trespass was that the plaintiff remained {{the owner of the}} chattel, with his possession only interrupted or interfered with, so that when it was tendered back to the plaintiff, he must accept it. The damages must be limited to the loss of use, which could be considerably less than its total value. <b>Trover,</b> which involved lost goods or those placed in a bailment, necessitated full replacement damages. Once the damages were paid, the ownership of the chattel passed to the defendant in <b>trover.</b>|$|E
25|$|Asportation of the chattel (illegally {{transporting}} the chattel) {{which was}} followed by the loss of a chattel, was held not to support an action in <b>trover.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of Bishop v Viscountess Montague , the opinion was offered that the {{plaintiff}} could elect between action in <b>trover</b> and action in trespass as a remedy for wrongful taking.|$|E
25|$|Wager of law was a {{possible}} defense, {{at least in}} certain cases of detinue sur <b>trover.</b> Wager of law was a complicated medieval legal procedure which was used when other forms of proof were lacking. It involved the bringing forth of witnesses who would swear under oath, to God that the facts alleged in the writ or bill of complaint were true. Lacking such witnesses, the action would fail. This was locked into the old methods of proof, which were in turn, tied to the old forms of action. The records show a certain hardening of the courts toward this defense in the mid-fourteenth century. Wager of law was not used in debt on a covenant. Wager of law was abolished by statute in 1833. Prosser describes <b>trover</b> and wager of law in this way: <b>Trover,</b> as it developed, had certain definite procedural advantages over the older forms of action, {{not the least of}} which was that it avoided wager of law, a form of licensed perjury which made detinue singularly unattractive to an honest plaintiff suing a dishonest defendant.|$|E
25|$|Blainfield v March , {{allowed a}} plea in defense to <b>trover</b> brought by an {{administrator}} {{based on his}} own possession, {{that there was a}} will and an executor, whose claim would take priority to that of an administrator.|$|E
25|$|Sir William Holdsworth {{described}} <b>trover</b> as {{an extension}} of detinue, which enabled not only a bailor and a dispossessed owner, but also a third person, to whose use goods had been bailed, to get full recognition of their interests.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the seventeenth}} century, the great bulk of {{litigation}} in England was conducted through the various forms of action which had developed from trespass. This remained the case until the nineteenth century, when these kinds of forms of action were abolished in succession by statute. By 1875, all remaining forms had been replaced by a single form uniform writ whereby the plaintiff endorses the statement for a claim. By that time, the change was purely procedural, but it also freed the substantive law from the old medieval forms of action. It permitted the development of broad concepts, such as liability in tort which could never have come about when confined by the old forms of action, such as <b>trover.</b> This served to rationalize the law. Just as forms of assumpsit replaced debt, so in the seventeenth century <b>trover</b> replaced detinue.|$|E
25|$|A case in <b>trover</b> for a {{quantity}} of manure, brought before a {{justice of the peace}} and appealed by the defendant to the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Fairfield, and tried in that court, on the general issue concerning the matter of ownership of the manure before Justice Brewer.|$|E
25|$|The Tennessee Supreme Court {{observed}} it {{is essential}} in cases of <b>trover,</b> that the property must be found; it must {{at the time when}} the finder came upon it, to have been in such a situation as to clearly indicate that it was lost. It cannot have been placed there by the original owner who lost it by carelessness or forgetfulness, where it was later found by someone else. In such cases, the owner of the premises where the property is found is treated as a quasi-bailee (i.e. he holds the property for the original owner), and he may maintain <b>trover</b> against the finder. Since the log was not intentionally laid by the (unknown) owner on the land of the plaintiff (Deaderick), and hence he was not a quasi-bailee for the owner, he cannot hold against the superior right of the defendant (Oulds) arising out of his prior possession and earlier finding of the log. Judgment for ownership of the log was to the defendant Oulds.|$|E
25|$|Trespass and <b>trover</b> {{were both}} actions founded upon possession. For many centuries, they were {{alternative}} remedies for the wrongful taking of, or damage to chattels. There was {{a distinction between}} the actions. In the theory of trespass, the plaintiff remained the owner of the chattel, with the possession or property rights interrupted or interfered with. In this case, the plaintiff must accept the chattel back when it was tendered. Recovery was limited to any damage to the chattel, or from the interruption of property rights.|$|E
25|$|This is a fragmentary {{case from}} Henry VI of England which {{indicates}} that there were sacks of flour left by the plaintiff to be stored and cared for by the defendant. The plaintiff had paid the defendant for this arrangement. The sacks of flour had been carried off by a third party. Counsel for the defence argued that action on the case did not lie, because detinue lay. Judge Prisot opined it was an action on the case. An action similar to <b>trover</b> was allowed.|$|E
25|$|The {{conception}} that {{an action}} for conversion lies only for tangible property {{capable of being}} identified and taken into actual possession {{is based on a}} fiction by which the action of <b>trover</b> was founded, namely, that the defendant had found the property of another, which was lost. This conception has become, in the progress of the law, something without meaning which has been discarded by most courts. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that an action for conversion lies for every species of personal property which is the subject of private ownership, whether animate or inanimate. Intangible property can be the subject of a conversion in the United States. There cannot be an action in conversion for choses in action or mere debt. Computer software can be the subject of a conversion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trover</b> damages {{came to be}} {{measured}} by {{the market value of}} the object, not necessarily its replacement cost if it were new. Sometimes, compensation for deprivation of use and compensation for other losses naturally and proximately caused by the wrongful taking could be added. Case law results are mixed. The plaintiff could also recover interest that would have been earned by the money value of the object and any expense (except attorney's fees) incurred in attempting to recover the object. If the taker sold the object for more than its market value, the plaintiff could receive the higher price. However, selling the chattel could change the action to that of a true conversion which was a form of theft. If the taker had made improvements on the object (e.g., repainted it), the value of such improvements are not deducted from the plaintiff's recovery unless the taking was by mistake.|$|E
2500|$|Judge Ashurst said that, [...] "in {{order to}} {{maintain}} <b>trover</b> the plaintiff must have a right of property in the thing (ownership) and a right of possession, and unless both these rights concur, the action (of <b>trover)</b> will not lie." [...] <b>Trover</b> was not a strictly proprietary remedy.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{actions in}} <b>trover</b> {{can be traced}} to the time of Bracton, and later Edward I of England, it became more clearly defined later during the reign of Henry VI of England, 1422–1461 and 1470–1471. Action in <b>trover</b> [...] became a mature legal {{doctrine}} during the reign of Elizabeth I of England, 1558–1603.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Trover</b> actions {{frequently}} {{concerned the}} finding of lost property. [...] It could also involve cargo on ships, such as those lost at sea and later found. <b>Trover</b> often involved {{cases in which the}} [...] "most correct" [...] owner could be determined. For instance, if an envelope of bank notes or currency were to be found, the court would attempt to identify the true owner. [...] Often this would prove to be impossible. In that case, the finder would be the next best owner and be considered the possessor. <b>Trover</b> cases have been described as [...] "finders keepers, losers weepers" [...] cases.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Trover</b> {{became the}} {{accepted}} action for all wrongs to chattels. In {{the case of}} Cooper v. Chitty (see infra), Lord Mansfield said, [...] "In form, <b>trover</b> is a fiction; in substance a remedy to recover the value of personal chattels wrongly converted by another to his own use. [...] The form supposes a defendant may have come lawfully by the possession of the goods." [...] The fiction was the allegation that the finding in <b>trover</b> was an accident. [...] It was the plaintiff who wanted return of the chattel, which had been converted {{to the use of}} the defendant.|$|E
2500|$|In this case, it {{was said}} that action in <b>trover</b> was in the nature of a {{trespass}} and where goods were taken, it was in the election of the party (plaintiff) whether to bring action in trespass or <b>trover.</b> [...] This rule was followed {{in a long line of}} cases into the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Trover</b> {{is a form}} of {{lawsuit in}} common-law {{countries}} for recovery of damages for wrongful taking of personal property. [...] <b>Trover</b> belongs to a series of remedies for such wrongful taking, its distinctive feature being recovery only for the value of whatever was taken, not for the recovery of the property itself (see replevin).|$|E

2500|$|There {{are a few}} [...] English {{cases where}} <b>trover</b> was applied to trusts. [...] These are rare. [...] In Ex [...] P [...] Pease {{a person who had}} {{received}} a bill of exchange for collection (an indorsee for collection) refused to return the bill to the person who had passed it to him (the indorser). The substitution of <b>trover</b> for equiatable remedy allowed in this case was anomalous.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} a {{conversion}} to occur, it used to need to be lost then found by some other person than the owner. [...] In the process, {{it was possible that}} the property could be converted. Chattels converted have included a dog, money and tax receipts. Land could not be the subject of an action in <b>trover,</b> since it could not be lost, then found and converted. The same was true for sand and gravel, timber, crops and fixtures, so long as they were considered {{as a part of the}} land. [...] No action in <b>trover</b> could be had. Once there was severance from the land, these became personal property, and <b>trover</b> could be entertained because of removal from the land.|$|E
2500|$|Action {{to recover}} {{possession}} which may include <b>trover,</b> detinue and replevin, {{which are now}} statutorily defined and vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
2500|$|In Strafford v. Pell Clayt. 151, pl. 276, 1650, {{a similar}} action in <b>trover</b> as in Holdsworth's Case failed against a carrier of {{chattels}} {{for this was}} a declaration of a <b>trover,</b> and [...] "supposeth a losing of goods, where the carrier hath them by delivery." [...] Neither of these actions had anything to differentiate them from the old action of detinue, because both {{were based on a}} nonfeasance, before the character of conversion had been adequately realized.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ruling and}} opinion of Lord Mansfield became {{permanent}} law with this case. [...] Action in <b>trover</b> {{could be an}} alternative to replevin.|$|E
