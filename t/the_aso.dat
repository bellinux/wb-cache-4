5|$|In mid-1941, just as ASO {{units were}} finding their feet, {{a large number}} of {{personnel}} and aircraft were sent to Malta (and the Desert Air Force) to interdict Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps supplies from Italy to North Africa. Adding to the problem was a shortage of materials and testing facilities. Restocking squadrons and re-equipping them was slow. Not until 1942 did <b>the</b> <b>ASO</b> squadrons get the recognition needed, {{in the wake of the}} German Operation Cerberus. Maintenance was also poor. Each service was to maintain an operational ready rate of 70 to 75 percent. In Coastal Command it was 40, and not much higher in others at that point. Greater emphasis was made and serviceability increased.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2008 Asō {{conceded that}} his family's coal mine, Aso Mining Company, was {{alleged to have}} forced Allied prisoners of war {{to work in the}} mines in 1945 without pay. Western media {{reported}} that 300 prisoners, including 197 Australians, 101 British, and two Dutch, worked in the mine. Two of the Australians, John Watson and Leslie Edgar George Wilkie, died while working in <b>the</b> <b>Aso</b> mine. In addition, 10,000 Korean conscripts worked in the mine between 1939 and 1945 under severe, brutal conditions in which many of them died or were injured while receiving little pay. The company, now known as <b>the</b> <b>Aso</b> Group, is run by Asō's younger brother. Asō's wife serves on its board of directors. Asō headed the company in the 1970s before going into politics.|$|E

40|$|Several {{strategies}} have been pursued {{to increase the}} extent of exon 7 inclusion during splicing of SMN 2 (survival of motor neuron 2) transcripts, for eventual therapeutic use in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic neuromuscular disease. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that target an exon or its flanking splice sites usually promote exon skipping. Here we systematically tested {{a large number of}} ASOs with a 2 ′-O-methoxy-ethyl ribose (MOE) backbone that hybridize to different positions of SMN 2 exon 7, and identified several that promote greater exon inclusion, others that promote exon skipping, and still others with complex effects on the accumulation of the two alternatively spliced products. This approach provides positional information about presumptive exonic elements or secondary structures with positive or negative effects on exon inclusion. <b>The</b> <b>ASOs</b> are effective not only in cell-free splicing assays, but also when transfected into cultured cells, where they affect splicing of endogenous SMN transcripts. <b>The</b> <b>ASOs</b> that promote exon 7 inclusion increase full-length SMN protein levels, demonstrating that they do not interfere with mRNA export or translation, despite hybridizing to an exon. Some of <b>the</b> <b>ASOs</b> we identified are sufficiently active to proceed with experiments in SMA mouse models...|$|R
25|$|Spano, however, {{remains the}} face of the organization, and his profile has {{continued}} to rise. After some troubled years for the orchestra in the 1990s, and despite his would-be gala debut as Music Director being marred by the September 11 attacks just four days earlier, most have judged Spano's tenure to have greatly bolstered the orchestra's morale, and maintained artistic standards. <b>The</b> <b>ASO</b> also has reported increased ticket sales and donations during Spano's tenure.|$|E
25|$|Spano, {{whose work}} was unrepresented on {{recordings}} prior to coming to Atlanta, has particularly {{benefited from the}} orchestra's previously existing relationship with Telarc Records, which {{dates back to the}} ASO's years with Robert Shaw. Spano and <b>the</b> <b>ASO</b> have released several CDs on the Telarc label, ranging from new works to standard repertoire, which have been well received and won several awards (see below). More recently they have also recorded for Deutsche Grammophon.|$|E
25|$|On February 13, 2008, <b>the</b> <b>ASO</b> {{announced}} that the Astana team, despite completely changing its ownership, management, and rider roster since the 2007 scandals, would be barred from the 2008 Tour due to its involvement in the 2007 scandals and its links to Operación Puerto.

25|$|In 1962, {{at the age}} of 80, Stokowski {{founded the}} American Symphony Orchestra.

Stokowski served as Music Director for <b>the</b> <b>ASO</b> until May 1972 when, {{at the age of}} 90, he returned to live in England. On 3 January 1962, still showing his interest in using technological innovation, he was featured in a telecast for WGN-TV conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which has since been recorded on DVD.

The entire route was announced by <b>the</b> <b>ASO</b> on 23 October 2013 at the official presentation at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. At the event, Stephen Roche, winner of the 1987 Tour, described the route as [...] "fairly soft".

500|$|On 8 November 2013, <b>the</b> <b>ASO</b> {{announced}} Utrecht would {{host the}} 2015 edition's opening race stages (known as the Grand Départ).

The previous five were: 1954, in Amsterdam; 1973, in Scheveningen; 1978, in Leiden; 1996, in 's-Hertogenbosch; and 2010, in Rotterdam. Utrecht paid <b>the</b> <b>ASO</b> a reported €4m to host the Grand Départ. The full route of the Tour was unveiled on 22 October 2014 at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. At the event, the race director Christian Prudhomme described it as [...] "atypique" [...] (English: [...] "untypical"), adding [...] "If you do not climb, you will not win the Tour in 2015." [...] The most noticeable differences were the lack of time trial kilometers and the mountainous terrain.|$|E
500|$|On 24 November 2011, <b>the</b> <b>ASO</b> {{announced}} Corsica would {{host the}} 2013 edition's opening race stages (known as the Grand Départ), {{the first time}} the Tour has visited the island. The route of the race was unveiled on 24 October 2012 at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. The Tour was the first to be completed entirely on French soil since 2003 and included ten new start or finish locations. The Grand Départ in Corsica consisted of three stages. <b>The</b> <b>ASO</b> chartered the Mega Smeralda cruiseferry in Porto-Vecchio to house members of the organisation, media and others who work on the Tour and to host press conferences. It featured a final set of stages which were described by journalist William Fotheringham as [...] "brutal", including three Alpine stages in the last week along with a [...] "viciously hard" [...] time trial. As the 100th edition of the race, the race featured some of the famous climbs from the history of the race, Mont Ventoux and Alpe d'Huez, which was climbed twice in a stage for the first time.|$|E

The entire route of the race was accidentally published on <b>the</b> <b>ASO</b> website on 10 October 2011, eight days before the official presentation at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. At the event, the race director, Christian Prudhomme, said, [...] "It's a Tour designed to widen the possibilities". The route was noted as being innovative when compared to recent years, with fewer high altitude stage finishes, and more of a focus on medium mountain stages and individual time trials.
