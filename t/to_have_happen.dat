500|$|Zappa {{stated that}} he tried smoking {{cannabis}} ten times, but without any pleasure or result beyond sleepiness and sore throat, and [...] "never used LSD, never used cocaine, never used heroin {{or any of that}} other stuff." [...] Zappa stated, [...] "Drugs do not become a problem until the person who uses the drugs does something to you, or does something that would affect your life that you don't want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen</b> to you, like an airline pilot who crashes because he was full of drugs." [...] He was a regular tobacco smoker for most of his life, and strongly critical of anti-tobacco campaigns.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick, {{who had not}} served as writers since the season four season finale, wrote the script for the series finale. Regarding the finale, Mutchnick stated: [...] "We wrote {{about what you want}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen</b> with people you love. I think Will and Grace end up very fleshed out. They end up as full adults. All the things that matter in life, they end up having." [...] Three years before the series finale was created, Mutchnick was asked on his opinion regarding how {{he would like to see}} the character's story come to a conclusion, [...] "The truth is that [...] serve each other's dysfunction. And the best way for their story to end is to find love." ...|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen</b> but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a slap on the wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E

500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd {{think it was a}} great thing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen</b> {{at the beginning of the}} show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, we knew the way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bloomberg {{supported}} {{the legalization of}} same-sex marriage in New York. Still, he appealed a decision finding the limiting of same-sex marriage {{in the state of}} New York unconstitutional. [...] "My personal opinion is that anybody should be allowed to marry anybody. I don't happen to think we should put restrictions on who you should marry.... What the city doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen</b> is people getting a marriage license and then six months, or one year later, or two years later, finding out it's meaningless," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|I had my reward; for a {{few yards}} farther on, here was another organ-grinder playing a dance tune, and perhaps a dozen {{children}} all dancing merrily to his music, singly, and by twos and threes, and in pretty little figures together.

If {{it had been a}} horrid old cat nobody would have thought it queer. When Lottie Warren's kitten had its legs cut off by the binder everybody was sorry for her. She cried two days in school and nobody laughed at her, not even Dan Reese. And all her chums went to the kitten's funeral and helped her bury it--only they couldn't bury its poor little paws with it, because they couldn't find them. It was a horrid thing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen,</b> of course, but I don't think it was as dreadful as seeing your pet EATEN UP. Yet everybody laughs at ME." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{the match}} had {{started on the}} tenth tee, the last hole to be {{negotiated}} was, of course, what in the ordinary run of human affairs is the ninth, possibly the trickiest on the course. As you know, {{it is necessary to}} carry with one's initial wallop that combination of stream and lake into which so many well meant drives have flopped. This done, the player proceeds up the face of a steep slope, to find himself ultimately on a green which looks like the sea in the storm scene of a melodrama. It heaves and undulates, and is altogether a nasty thing <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen</b> to one {{at the end of a}} gruelling match. But it is the first shot, the drive, which is the real test, for the water and the trees form a mental hazard of unquestionable toughness.|$|E
60|$|He was not {{behaving}} openly with her; {{but she had}} not behaved openly with him. She owned that to herself, and she {{got what}} comfort she could from his making the affair {{a question of what}} Burnamy had done to Stoller rather than of what Burnamy had said to her, and what she had answered him. If she was not perfectly clear as to what she wanted to do, or wished <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen,</b> there was now time and place in which she could delay and make sure. The accepted theory of such matters is that people know their minds from the beginning, and that they do not change them. But experience seems to contradict this theory, or else people often act contrary to their convictions and impulses. If the statistics were accessible, it might be found that many potential engagements hovered in a doubtful air, and before they touched the earth in actual promise were dissipated by the play of meteorological chances.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{the first}} time that Ludlow had faltered in the notion of going to Cornelia and {{claiming}} to be wholly at fault. In thought he was always doing it, and there were times when he almost did it in reality, but he let these times pass effectless, hoping for some better time when the thing would do itself, waiting for the miracle which love expects, when it is itself the miracle that brings all its desires to fulfilment. He certainly had some excuses for preferring a passive part in what he would have been so glad <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>happen.</b> Cornelia had confessed that she had once cared for him, but at the same time she had implied that she cared for him no longer, and she had practically forbidden him to see her again. Much study of her words could make nothing else of them, and it was not until Ludlow saw his way to going impersonally in his quality of mistaken adviser, from whom explanation and atonement were due, that he went to Cornelia. Even then he did not quite believe that she would see him, and he gladly lost the bet he made himself, at the sound of a descending step on the stairs, that it was the Irish girl coming back to say that Miss Saunders was not at home.|$|E
