25|$|The {{idea came}} to me in a game, when the guy at bat was all tighted up waiting for my fast ball. I knew he'd swing as soon as I just barely moved. So when I stretched, I paused just a little longer with my arms above my head. Then I <b>threw</b> <b>my</b> left foot forward but I didn't come around with my arm right away. I put that foot of mine down, {{stopping}} for a second, before the ball left my hand. When my foot hit the ground that boy started swinging, so by the time I came around with the whip he was way off stride and couldn't get anywhere near the ball. I had me a strikeout.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} these episodes were {{composed}} by Tim Kiefer. To create the song [...] "Prismatic", Kiefer took the song [...] "Lil' Booty Dance", first {{heard in the}} second season episode [...] "Mortal Recoil" [...] and remixed it to fit with the theme of [...] "inter-dimensional travel" [...] present in the episode. Kiefer explained, [...] "I <b>threw</b> <b>my</b> own music from the Season 2 finale 'Mortal Folly / Mortal Recoil' on my turntables and went wild – pitching, reversing, rewinding, scratching and more – transforming Jake’s 'Lil’ Booty Dance' bongo song into a booming, merry-go-round dance celebration." ...|$|E
500|$|Barnes played {{carefully}} on the still suspect pitch the following day and {{late in the afternoon}} Bradman, lower in the order than usual due to a leg injury, joined Barnes with the score at 4/159. Over six and a half hours later, Bradman was out for 234. Barnes was dismissed just four balls later, also for 234, having batted for over ten hours. In his autobiography, Barnes stated that the coincidence of scores was intended. [...] "Lots of people have asked me whether I deliberately <b>threw</b> <b>my</b> wicket away at 234. The answer is yes." [...] He confirmed to an interviewer many years later that [...] "it wouldn't be right for someone to make more runs than Sir Donald Bradman".|$|E

500|$|Goldman's {{circle of}} radicals, socialists, and bohemians was joined in 1912 by a nurse, Margaret Sanger, whose {{mother had been}} through 18 pregnancies in 22 years, and died at age 50 of {{tuberculosis}} and cervical cancer.Engelman, pp. 29–30 (Goldman circle).Cox, p. 4 (pregnancies).Buchanan, p. 121 (tuberculosis and cancer).Chelsler, p. 41 (age 50). In 1913, Sanger worked in New York's Lower East Side, often with poor women who were suffering due to frequent childbirth and self-induced abortions.Kennedy, pp. 16–18. After one particularly tragic medical case, Sanger wrote: [...] "I <b>threw</b> <b>my</b> nursing bag {{in the corner and}} announced... that I would never take another case until I had made it possible for working women in America to have the knowledge to control birth." [...] Sanger visited public libraries, searching for information on contraception, but nothing was available.Cronin, Mary (1996), [...] "The Woman Rebel", in Women's periodicals in the United States: social and political issues, Endres, Kathleen L. (Ed.), Greenwood Press, p. 448.Cronin cites Sanger, An Autobiography, pp. 95–96.Cronin cites Kennedy, p. 19, who points out that some materials on birth control were available in 1913. She became outraged that working-class women could not obtain contraception, yet upper-class women who had access to private physicians could.|$|E

2500|$|Henry {{became known}} as one of the best punt {{blockers}} in the game while playing for Washington & Jefferson. Years later, he cited a blocked punt in 1916 as his greatest thrill as a player.

2500|$|The second period, 1649–56, was {{in exile}} {{at the court}} of his brother-in-law, Alexander III of Imereti, when Teimuraz, in his own words, used poetry as therapy: [...] "Tears flowed mercilessly like the Nile from my eyes. To {{overcome}} I wrote from time to time, I <b>threw</b> <b>my</b> heart into it." [...] In his poems, Teimuraz laments the destruction of his kingdom, condemning the [...] "transient and perfidious world", and mourns the fate {{of his family and}} friends, cursing the cause of his own and his people’s misfortunes, the [...] "bloodthirsty king of Persia." ...|$|E

"We {{were playing}} a Shield game in Queensland and I <b>threw</b> <b>my</b> arm out {{on the day before}} the match," [...] he recalls. “I lost a lot of power, and a lot of things I could do before I wasn’t able to do. So I {{probably}} changed my technique after that to get more side-on, but I probably got more back-on. I was coming in to bowl but I was facing the wrong way. I thought I was doing the right thing by changing things, but it didn’t work... Nowadays I would’ve had a shoulder operation... I got told I could have one, but it was really up to me to organise.” ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the onset}} of her musical career, she was told many times she would not make it. At that time and still today, the genre known as {{regional}} Mexican music was and is dominated by men. In a 2011 interview with Billboard magazine, she stated, [...] "It was hard knocking on those doors to get my music played. One radio programmer in L.A., the meanest {{son of a bitch}} in the world, <b>threw</b> <b>my</b> CD in the trash right in my face." [...] Those were the kind of issues Rivera faced as a female trying to crack the regional Mexican genre. She then released the albums We are Rivera and Farewell to Selena independently, the latter a tribute album to Tejano music singer Selena who was murdered in 1995.|$|E
