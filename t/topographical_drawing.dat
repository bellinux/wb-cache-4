40|$|An {{up-to-date}} topic {{with which}} engineering geology {{can contribute to}} the requirements of practice and research, in particularthe needs of land use planning, state administration, building offices, developers, etc. is an analysis of new possibilities of providingreference information on the engineering-geological conditions by means of geographic information systems. The study in the presentedpaper deals with an evaluation of two geofactors. They are the character of rocks workability and Pre-quaternary bedrock. Workabilityis a significant limiting factor, which affects the used technology and financial demands of earth work. Especially in case of demandingconstructions, the Pre-quaternary bedrock is a geological environment which will have to be interacted with and must be taken intoaccount during selecting engineering foundation. The overall project was divided into five model areas (1 - 5), while this paper evaluatesa partial model area of no. 1, which is defined by <b>topographical</b> map in <b>drawing</b> scale 1 : 10 1000 (topographic sheet No. 15 - 43 - 10).

50|$|Ankeny {{was named}} first {{lieutenant}} of Company B, 46th Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He {{fought with the}} regiment, was wounded at the Battle of Fort Donelson and the Battle of Shiloh. He was named captain of Company B in 1863. His superiors utilized his skills in <b>drawing</b> <b>topographical</b> maps of battlegrounds. When the 142nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment was raised in June 1864, Ankeny was named its colonel. When the war ended, Ankeny was brevetted a brigadier general. After the war, Ankeny returned to Freeport and continued to farm until 1868. He then moved to Des Moines, Iowa, where he purchased a 640 acre plot of land north of the city. He moved to Winterset, Iowa after the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad connected {{to the city and}} traded in lumber. While there, he was named a deputy United States Marshal. He returned to Des Moines in 1882 but was forced to retire soon after following an injury sustained in a train wreck. After a failed enterprise in the Black Hills of South Dakota, he took a job with the United States Department of the Interior. He retired and returned to Des Moines.|$|R
5000|$|Carey {{resigned}} {{from his position}} in October 1881 and soon after, a plan to leave the dilapidated building was made. The start of 1882 brought Professor W. Miller McCaslan to the new Main Street Pickens High School. McCaslan brought many new and exciting changes to the school. Two equal sessions divided the school year that was now to run for 10 months. The school began to flourish, boasting a rising student population, which brought higher tuition and more State money to be used towards the school. In mid-October, attendance was reduced; students were forced to leave school to pick cotton. During the previous interim of 1883, Pickens High School had informally adopted the name “Pickens Institute,” or “Piedmont Institute.” Dedication Day was April 20, 1883 and honored {{the opening of the}} new Victorian-style school building. Many classes offered to students included Latin, Greek and Mental and Moral Sciences, <b>topographical</b> and mechanical <b>drawing,</b> mathematics, military training, and music, along with the traditional courses. During 1884, the enrollment reached 137 pupils. The rules and regulations impended on the students by McCaslan were still in effect, including a rule preventing female students from going out during the week.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to analyze the ways the Roman Underworld was visualized, outlining the possible mental maps of the chthonic realm that constituted the main reference for the literary works and funerary monuments that were created in Rome and Ostia {{between the end of}} the first century BCE and the end of the third century CE. While we have no preserved ancient map of Hades, the artists decorating Roman monuments with otherworldly images, mainly tombs or sarcophagi, repeatedly employed specific natural or architectural elements that were reminiscent of the written descriptions and inspired by the widespread cultural and religious tradition and that highlighted the relations between the human souls, the chthonic divinities, and the space they share. When visualizing the Underworld, the Romans performed an act of mental spatial construction where all landscapes and <b>topographical</b> elements were <b>drawn</b> from a pool of geographical entities that constituted an integral part of their spatial shared knowledge, and where the memorable features that comprised historical, mythological, or religious associations were transformed into primary landmarks of communal value. These chthonic landmarks constituted the backdrop for mythological scenes, guided the viewer in the unfolding of the narrative of the journey to the Underworld, and reassured him on his postmortem fate...|$|R
40|$|Computer {{software}} tools for data management can improve site characterization, planning {{and execution of}} remediation projects. This paper discusses the use of two such products that have primarily been used within the nuclear power industry to enhance the capabilities of radiation protection department operations. Advances in digital imaging, web application development and programming technologies have made development of these tools possible. The Interactive Visual Tour System (IVTS) allows the user to easily create and maintain a comprehensive catalog containing digital pictures of the remediation site. Pictures can be cataloged in groups (termed ''tours'') that can be organized either chronologically or spatially. Spatial organization enables the user to ''walk around'' the site and view desired areas or components instantly. Each photo is linked to a map (floor plan, <b>topographical</b> map, elevation <b>drawing,</b> etc.) with graphics displaying the location on the map and any available tour/component links. Chronological organization enables the user to view the physical results of the remediation efforts over time. Local and remote management teams can view these pictures {{at any time and}} from any location. The Visual Survey Data System (VSDS) allows users to record survey and sample data directly on photos and/or maps of areas and/or components. As survey information is collected for each area, survey data trends can be reviewed for any repetitively measured location or component. All data is stored in a Quality Assurance (Q/A) records database with reference to its physical sampling point on the site as well as other information to support the final closeout report for the site. The ease of use of these web-based products has allowed nuclear power plant clients to plan outage work from their desktop and realize significant savings with respect to dose and cost. These same tools are invaluable for remediation and decommissioning planning of any scale and for recording of survey data related to building or site decontamination, waste shipments and eventual unrestricted release of entire facilities. This presentation will show the utility of these products in a variety of decontamination, decommissioning and environmental remediation settings including a university research reactor decommissioning project...|$|R

50|$|The oldest known map in Japan is a <b>topographical</b> <b>drawing</b> {{discovered}} {{on a stone}} wall inside a tomb {{in the city of}} Kurayoshi, in Tottori Prefecture, dated to the 6th century AD. Depicting a landscape of houses, bridges, and roads, it is thought to have been made not for practical navigational purposes, but rather as a kind of celestial cartography given to the dead to maintain a connection with the world of the living and allow them to orient themselves when moving on to the other world. Similar maps have been found in other kofun burial tombs as well. There is also evidence that at least rudimentary surveying tools were already in use in this era. One of the oldest written references to maps in a Japanese source is found in the Kojiki, the oldest (albeit largely mythological) history of Japan, in which land records are mentioned. The other major ancient history, the Nihon Shoki of 720 AD, describes a map of the ancient city of Naniwa (modern Osaka). The first map of provincial surveys is thought to be in 738, as described in the Shoku Nihongi. The earliest extant maps in Japan date to the 8th century, and depict the ownership of square rice field plots, oriented to the four cardinal directions. Shinto shrines held maps that they used for agrarian reform, differentiation of property, and land holdings. The system by which these maps were measured was called jōri, measured in units called tan and tsubo.|$|E

40|$|By {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century the city of Turin is the {{practice}} field for the cadets of the Theoretical and practical schools of artillery and fortifications, now recognised as a centre of excellence for research and technical-scientific teaching. On the tree-lined avenues of the Valentino future topography engineers will draw lines with the "bojine" and will measure horizontal and diagonal distances; on the batterment between Porta Nuova and the citadel they will practise the use of the square and the measuring of angles, they will start to measure some flat figures on the ground, they will copy the fronts of the fortification with their external works and those "objects" oriented towards S. Salvatore and the river Po. Finally, between Porta di Po and Porta Palazzo they will perform the simplest operations relating to the Praetorian drawing board and execute the designs of the "forts" existing on the town hill. The above text is described in: Progetto delle operazioni da farsi cogli stromenti/ della Geometria pratica in Campagna (Project of the operations to perform with the instruments of practical geometry in the countryside - ASTo, Camerale, Segreteria di Guerra, Carte d'Artiglieria, reg. XXIV, ff. 146 - 149) drafted in Turin, May 21, 1797, by Luigi Gianotti: successor to the famous "painter of battles" Giuseppe Pietro Bagetti chair of the <b>topographical</b> <b>drawing</b> at the Royal Schools. In the margin of the programme are the notes of the Director, Gerolamo Francesco Zino, who recommended to extend the exercise with the Praetorian drawing board at the survey of the rolling hills. The Director's comments prove what is now of paramount importance to know about conducting a geometric survey even in those areas not easily accessible. In the Savoy States, the tools and methods for modern topography are scientifically codified in the Theoretical and practical schools of artillery and fortifications (April 16 th, 1739 to July 1, 1799) and in the Royal office of topography (April 21, 1738 to 1799 approx.); established under the executive body of the Savoy army: the Azienda d'artiglieria fabbriche e fortificazioni. It is, in fact, within these institutions, through training manuals and practice, where the specialisation in topography of military engineers is accomplished. The context in which one places the process of affirmation of military topography takes into account the fact that in the eighteenth century logistics comes to the forefront as a decisive factor in conflicts. Especially with the wars of succession, the role of communications and procurement becomes vital. The growing size of the armies makes the graphic description of the territory essential, without which the planning of a march, a siege or a camp is impossible. Therefore, the military engineers, until now mainly responsible for the fortifications, must extend their skills to the representation of the territory. In times of war they are called upon to draw up plans of sieges and battles and to conduct the military land surveys taking note not only of the works of defence, but also of their surroundings as related to the scheduling of war actions: the military topographer it is required to be able to represent possible geographies for still invisible armies. Fundamental tools of knowledge of the territory and its resources are the written reports or memoirs (ASTo, Archivio Topografico Segreto, Relazioni, memorie, descrizioni topografiche manoscritte); these are necessary for the scheduling of not only military but also economic and political strategies of the State. In the memoirs those man-made features that can not be represented graphically on paper are also described, for example: the conditions of roads and settlements, the demographic situation, the economic and also moral resources of the populations, on which the possibility of housing and supply of an army largely depend. From the second half of the eighteenth century in the Savoy Schools the operational methods of the topographical survey and graphics techniques receive a broader systemization at the level of treaties. The fundamental turning point occurs with the editing (1756 - 1775) by Papacino d'Antoni of the six books Dell'Architettura Militare per le Regie Scuole di Artiglieria, e Fortificazione (On the military architecture for the Royal schools of artillery, and fortifications). In particular, relating to the topography of the first book (Della Fortificazione Regolare [...] . 1756, BRT, Militari 288) and the second book (Dell'Attacco, e Difesa delle Piazze Regolari [...] ., BRT, Militari 288), respectively by Carlo Andrea Rana (teacher of mathematics) and Andrea Ignazio Bozzolino (from 1769 director of the theoretical School), are crucial because they determine two new topics: the colouring of the design with its graphic symbolism, and the topographic survey of a site around a fortification. Bozzolino provides a description, "easy and practical", on how to handily proceed in the general surveying of the "country" around a fortress: the engineer will perform the lap of the "piazza" (fort) taking care to note what he finds on the extensions of the alignments of a "face" of a bastion; he should mark, orography and the nature of the land, roads, homes and chapels and especially those sites that can be used for housing cavalry or infantry. In the part devoted to the Disegno in picciolo Rana offers a systematic description of rules, colours and cartographic signs to be adopted for maps that "in addition to the fortification should contain prominent things in the surroundings of the same". Among the "prominent things" are certainly the populated centres and the religious architecture. The "conspicuous places" surrounded by walls are represented by drawing the plan of their homes; those without walls, on the other hand, are to be reported in the same way as "places not substantial" but with a parish, or rather drawing a small tower placed above a circle coloured in red indicating the centre of the village, the circle must be accompanied by the design of some houses in proportion to the number of existing homes. The roofs of the houses and towers are dark red and black in the shaded part. The chapels are drawn like a single house with a small cross on the front or else, they are represented on the map by a rectangle, coloured all in red, with a black cross. From this textbook the effort is initiated towards the technical definition of a uniform graphical code, which will come to typify the Piemontese military cartograph...|$|E
