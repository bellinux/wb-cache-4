5|$|Prior to 2003, {{the tournament}} format was a Limit Hold'em tournament, but in 2004, No-Limit Hold'em became the standard. The 2006 tournament, with 1,232 entrants, {{was the largest}} field ever for the event. Since its inception, with the {{exception}} of 2008, the Casino Employees event has started {{on the first day of}} the WSOP. Much of the drama encountered at the Casino Championship often involves informal rivaliries between dealers and proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or to ensure that they do not die out. Thus, while both the prop and dealer are casino employees, <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> opposite sides of the table.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off her bike while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E
25|$|In Greenland, {{seal hunting}} is {{conducted}} with rifles – the seals are {{shot in the}} head from a small open boat while <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> an ice floe. The boat rushes up to the seal and hooks the carcass out of the water (where it falls within a few seconds) before it sinks. The economy of certain rural Greenlandic villages, such as Aappilattoq, are highly dependent upon such seal hunting.|$|E

25|$|Some salticid {{species are}} {{continually}} on the move, stopping periodically {{to look around}} for prey, which they then stalk immediately. Others spend more time scanning their surroundings from one position, actively stalking any prey they detect. Members of the genus Phaeacius take that strategy to extremes; <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a tree trunk, facing downwards and rarely do any stalking, but simply lunge down on any prey items that pass close before them.|$|E
25|$|Taylor's {{first case}} before the U.S. Supreme Court was in 1980, when Taylor, Haas and Cunningham {{successfully}} defended the Court of Appeals’ decision in the Fred Hampton case against several petitions for certiorari. In 1985, Taylor successfully argued before the Court that federal prison guards should not be given immunity from civil rights liability when <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> prison disciplinary committees. In 1993, he argued {{a case in which}} the Court created an exception to a prosecutor’s absolute immunity from suit.|$|E
25|$|Every October a National Venture Forum {{is held in}} Larch Hill. Each {{province}} {{is entitled}} to send six Provincial Representatives, who have been elected at their own Provincial Forums. The nine elected Venture Representatives from the previous National Forum also attend and run the weekend. At the forum motions regard Venturing are passed and the NVFC is elected. The NVFC has 9 members (6 Provincial reps and 3 national panel members). The NVFC represent ventures at national and provincial level. <b>They</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> programme teams (NYPC, International, Participation) and {{have the right to}} attend NMC meetings. The NVFC also compile reports for the Programme Commissioners to let them know how Ventures feel.|$|E

25|$|Because {{the cleanup}} of the {{derailment}} area could take 5 years, about 115 businesses were planning to relocate. 40 buildings have already been destroyed but another 160 {{may need to be}} expropriated for demolition because <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> several metres of contaminated soil which must be removed and replaced with clean fill. Subsequent reconstruction on the site may initially be impractical as new buildings would require deeper foundations until the new fill settles. The town was considering making a memorial park in the damaged area and relocating displaced businesses to a proposed Papineau Street extension to cross the Chaudière River to Lévis Street. The new road was to be constructed in October 2013 using federal and provincial infrastructure funding, although insurance coverage for local companies to abandon contaminated sites remained uncertain. For 125 businesses, the move was expected to be permanent.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} stone {{churches in}} Russia featured Byzantine style domes, however by the Early Modern era the onion dome {{had become the}} predominant form in traditional Russian architecture. The onion dome is a dome whose shape resembles an onion, after which they are named. Such domes are often larger in diameter than the drums <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on,</b> and their height usually exceeds their width. The whole bulbous structure tapers smoothly to a point. Though the earliest preserved Russian domes of such type date from the 16th century, illustrations from older chronicles indicate they have existed since the late 13th century. Like tented roofs—which were combined with, and sometimes replaced domes in Russian architecture since the 16th century—onion domes initially were used only in wooden churches. Builders introduced them into stone architecture much later, and continued to make their carcasses of either of wood or metal on top of masonry drums.|$|E
25|$|Field of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, {{and stone}} {{represent}} {{those who lost}} their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. <b>They</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> {{the site where the}} Murrah Building once stood. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The chairs are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or the floor) on which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.|$|E

Grimm states that a [...] can be both norn and a valkyrie, [...] "but their functions are separate and usually the persons. The norns have to pronounce the fatum , <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> their chairs, or they roam through the country among mortals, fastening their threads. Nowhere is it said that they ride. The valkyrs ride to war, decide the issues of fighting, and conduct the fallen to heaven; their riding is like that of heroes and gods".|$|E
500|$|Naomi and Emily {{escape to}} the {{countryside}} later that evening and cycle to one of Emily's favourite places by a lake before sunset. After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire, and share a cannabis joint. An act of blowbacking the joint leads the two to share a kiss and they proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleads with Naomi not to leave her a second time and tells her that she should accept {{that she needs to}} be loved. Naomi goes home to find Kieran in bed with her mother, and leaves for college, devastated. She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't seem to mind, as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying. <b>They</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> opposite sides of the door, and Naomi admits that she does need somebody to love her. Emily offers her hand through the door's cat flap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} administration building {{was designed by}} the firm Russell & Alpaugh and the construction process began in 1923. The style which was chosen recalls the Romanesque of Northern Italy. The administration building once displayed an octagonal tower and a portico, but these features were toppled in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. An original cafeteria building was located where the current cafeteria and theater stand today. Although the gymnasium and a beautiful and widely admired auditorium were condemned following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, the school's original main building from 1924 remains in use. The music building and gym (rebuilt in the early 1980s) have been scheduled to be taken down because <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a fault line and therefore against district policy.

2500|$|... ll New-York {{moves on}} the first of May; not only moves about, as usual, in the {{everlasting}} hurry-scurry of business, but one house empties itself into another, all over the city. The streets are full of loaded drays, on which tables are dancing, and carpets rolling to and fro. Small chairs, which bring up such pretty, cozy images of rolly-pooly mannikens and maidens, eating supper from tilted porringers, and spilling the milk on their night-gowns – these go ricketting along on the tops of beds and bureaus, and not unfrequently pitch into the street, and so fall asunder. Children are driving hither and yon, one with a flower-pot in his hand, another with work-box, band-box, or oil-canakin; each so intent upon his important mission, that all the world seems to him (as it does to many a theologican,) safely locked up within the little walls he carries. Luckily, both boy and bigot are mistaken, or mankind would be in a bad box, sure enough. The dogs seem bewildered with this universal transmigration of bodies; and as for the cats, <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the door-steps, mewing piteously, that they were not born in the middle ages, or at least in the quiet old portion of the world.
