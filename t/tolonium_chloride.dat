40|$|Chemiluminescence was {{evaluated}} as a diagnostic {{aid in the}} detection of oral cancer and potentially malignant epithelial lesions (PMELs) by comparing it against 1 <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> mouth rinse. Forty-six clinically identified lesions 14 primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), 26 PMELs and 6 benign lesions and five cases of normal oral mucosa from 40 subjects (inclusive of 10 previously treated SCC cases) were examined with a commercial chemiluminescent kit (Vizilite (R)) and <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Biopsy and histological verification of 31 lesions disclosed 14 SCC (45. 2 %), 10 epithelial dysplasias (32. 3 %), 5 lichen planus (16. 1 %) and 2 benign lesions (6. 4 %). For the remaining 15 lesions, a biopsy was not performed owing to patient's lack of consent or ill-health. The five cases of normal oral mucosa which tested negative for both tools were also not biopsied for ethical reasons. Sensitivity for Vizilite (R) and <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> was 100 % and 70. 3 %, respectively; and specificity was 14. 2 % for Vizilite (R) and 25 % for <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> Their accuracy was 80. 6 % and 64. 5 %, respectively. Current findings suggest that chemiluminescence is a more reliable diagnostic tool than <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> in the detection of oral cancer and PMELs, and for follow-up of patients treated for the same.

40|$|Water {{pollution}} due to effluents from dyes {{and printing}} industries poses {{a serious problem}} for aquatic life. Photocatalysis has {{attracted the attention of}} chemists all over the world because it is an efficient and ecofriendly process to combat the problem of water pollution. Photocatalytic bleaching of <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> on zirconium phos-phate was carried out in presence of light. The progress of the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically, and it follows pseudo first order kinetics. The effect of variation of different parameters, like concentration of <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> pH, amount of semiconductor and light intensity on the rate of bleaching, was also studied. A tentative mechanism for the photocatalytic bleaching of <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> has been proposed.

40|$|Anatase {{titanium}} dioxide catalyzed photodegradation of <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> at various bufferic pH of 2, 7, 9 and 12 {{in aqueous solution}} is presented. The effect of some physicochemical parameters such as initial concentration of dye, catalyst amount and reaction time on photocatalytic degradation has been investigated in a photo-reactor cell containing high pressure mercury lamp to obtain the optimum conditions in each bufferic pH at constant temperature. A complete spectrophotometric kinetic study of <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> under high pressure irradiation at buffer media was performed. The photocatalytic degradation observed rate constants (kobs) {{were found to be}} 2. 90 × 10 - 3, 3. 30 × 10 - 3, 3. 20 × 10 - 3 and 5. 20 × 10 - 3 min- 1 for buffer pH of 2 - 12 respectively. It was found that a pseudo-first-order kinetic model based on Langmuir-Hinshelwood one is usable to photodegradation of this compound at all considered buffer pH. In addition to these, the Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate constants, kr for the titled compound at various pH are reported...|$|E
40|$|Poster Session: {{abstract}} no. 3508 OBJECTIVE: The aims of {{this study}} were to investigate the effect of Photo-Activatied Disinfection (PAD) on Enterococcus faecalis in a laboratory model to find the relationship between the irradiation energy and bacterial kill. Methods: The experiments were carried out in small glass tubes containing a measured volume of Enterococcus faecalis with high concentration and photosensitizer (<b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> with low concentration). The suspension of Enterococcus faecalis was exposed to a 635 -nm diode laser light, and the range of energy doses (J) was from 0. 5 J to 4. 5 J produced by varying power (mW) and time (T). The treatment were evaluated for bactericidal effect by calculating colony forming units (CFU) from every irradiated and control specimen and comparing the number of viable bacteria remaining. RESULTS: Analysis of linear regression and Student's T test were performed (level of significance set at p≤ 0. 05). The number of Enterococcus faecalis was significantly reduced when energy dose reached 0. 5 J. Energy doses of 4. 5 J produced 100 % kills to 1 E+ 14 cfu/ml Enterococcus faecalis. Conclusion: It is concluded that PAD was shown to have a high bactericidal effect to killed up to 1 E+ 14 cfu/ml Enterococcus faecalis with using irradiated low concentration <b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> and this effect was related to the energy delivered by the diode laser light. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 89 th General Session and Exhibition of IADR/AADR/CADR, San Diego, CA., 16 - 19 March 2011...|$|E
40|$|Squamous cell carcinomas are {{the most}} {{commonly}} diagnosed oral malignancy, accounting for about 90 % of all malignant oral lesions. Detection of the condition at early stages is rare; as a result, the clinical and histological characteristics and prognosis of this tumor have not been extensively investigated. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate clinical and microscopic features of squamous cell carcinomas using immunohistochemical analysis and assessing biological markers of angiogenesis and tumor vascular activity (anti-CD 31, anti-CD 34, Factor VIII), cell proliferation (Ki- 67), and loss of cell suppression (p 53). <b>Tolonium</b> <b>chloride</b> 1 % was used to determine the optimal biopsy site. Six patients seen at the Stomatology Service of a university hospital in Canoas, southern Brazil, with a suspected diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed. All patients were male, with a mean age of 56. 6 years, and four had a white skin color. Lesions were detected in the tongue (4) and tonsillar pillar (2). All diagnoses were confi rmed by microscopy (hematoxylin-eosin staining). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed p 53 expression in 5 of the cases, Ki- 67 in 6, and anti-CD 34 in 1; anti-CD 31 and Factor VIII were not detected in any patient. Our fi ndings suggest an important contribution of tumor markers in the diagnosis and prognosis of these malignancies, as well as in treatment planning...|$|E
40|$|Thecurrent study {{describes}} the interactive role of diethylthiourea on the bleaching of toluidine blue (<b>tolonium</b> <b>chloride)</b> (TB+) in acidic and basic media using the GC Mass Chromatography and Spectrophotometric technique. GC-Mass Spectrophotometric analysis {{was carried out}} to verify the decoloration of dye whether the bleaching of dye owed to leuco dye formation or degradation may also occur in the reaction mixture. The dye redox reaction process followed first order kinetics with respect to TB, DETU showed first order mechanism, first order kinetics with respect to H+. Enhanced decoloration {{in the presence of}} DETU proved that reductant‘s role is pivotal in the redox reaction. Slow decoloration in basic medium with ions was seen compared to acidic media, suggesting that pH of the medium is significant in the oxidation of DETU. The bleaching reaction of dye was investigated at different temperatures. At pH of 1. 0 and 250 C, the order of reaction is found to be second having rate constant value of 15. 81 mol- 1. L s- 1,and rate law is suggested to be -d/dt [TBH] = k 2 [TB+ H+][DETU]. Different reaction energy parameters were evaluated for a TB+-DETU reaction, including the energy of activation (Ea = 60. 786 kJmol- 1 (basic medium), 1. 669 kJmol- 1 (acidic medium)), enthalpy of activation (∆H≠ = - 58. 267 kJ mol- 1 (basic medium), - 12. 6 kJ mol- 1 (acidic medium)), entropy of activation (∆S≠ = - 131. 525 Jmol- 1 K- 1 (basic medium),- 243 Jmol- 1 K- 1 (acidic medium)),and free energy of activation (∆G≠ = - 98. 119 kJmol- 1 (basic medium) and - 86. 55 kJmol- 1 (acidic medium). A mechanism of interaction of involved ions in dye bleaching and a mechanism of oxidation based on the above findings is proposed...|$|E
