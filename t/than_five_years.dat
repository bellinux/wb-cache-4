5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa in 1950, Harvey {{was offered a}} job in captain Lindsay Hassett's sports store. Harvey accepted immediately because sports stores gave more flexible arrangements for leave to play cricket. Harvey was sponsored by Stuart Surridge to use their cricket equipment. He was paid £300 a year, but nevertheless lived at home and shared a bedroom with his brothers Brian and Ray until he married, due to poverty. He used the same cricket uniforms for more <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

Also, a stronger body structure increased crash safety. The locally produced Buick-sourced V6 engine powered the Commodore range, as did the 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, and was replaced in 1999 by the 5.7-litre LS unit.|$|E
5|$|One Hot Minute was {{the only}} album that guitarist Dave Navarro {{recorded}} with the band. His presence altered the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound considerably. It contains fewer sexual themes than previous records and explores darker subject matters, such as drug use, depression, anguish, and grief. It also re-integrated use of heavy metal guitar riffs. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis, who had resumed addictions to cocaine and heroin in 1994 after being sober for more <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> approached his lyricism with a reflective outlook on drugs and their harsh effects.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia terminalis {{grows in}} a bushfire-prone habitat, where fire is {{essential}} for many species to regenerate. P.t.terminalis is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed, which lies dormant in the soil. Large numbers of Persoonia seedlings appear after fire. However, rocky outcrop habitat is vulnerable to fires occurring at too-frequent intervals of less <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> which puts many species that regenerate by seed at risk of local extinction as plants are unable to mature to set seed before the next fire.|$|E

5|$|Richardson {{made his}} {{television}} debut in January 1939, reprising his 1936 stage {{role of the}} chief engineer in Bees on the Boatdeck. His last stage part in the 1930s was Robert Johnson, an Everyman figure, in Priestley's Johnson Over Jordan directed by Basil Dean. It was an experimental piece, using music (by Benjamin Britten) and dance as well as dialogue, and was another production in which Richardson was widely praised but which did not prosper at the box-office. After it closed, in May 1939, he did not act on stage for more <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

5|$|After more <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> at Wells, Wheelwright {{received}} {{an invitation from}} the church and town of Hampton, then {{under the jurisdiction of}} Massachusetts, to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as a pastor of the church there. Without apparent hesitation he went there in the spring of 1647 and entered into a written agreement with a committee of the church and town. He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts, or 24 June 1647 by another. The job afforded the 55-year-old Wheelwright with a larger salary than the parish at Wells did, an important consideration given the large size of his family. No longer in a frontier setting, he was now within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement, more aligned with his educational background.|$|E

5|$|At {{this point}} in 1998, Kiedis and Flea {{decided it was time}} to fire their guitarist. Navarro was furious when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. The Chili Peppers were fighting, and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought it may be necessary to break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E
5|$|Between 1895 and 1914, {{he lived}} in Switzerland (except for one year in Prague, 1911–12), where he {{received}} his academic diploma from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zürich (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in 1900. He later taught there at the same institute {{as a professor of}} theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin. In 1901, after being stateless for more <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years,</b> Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich.

5|$|His {{elevation}} as emperor {{ushered in}} a period of crisis, the most troublesome in Brazil's history. As Pedro II could not exert his constitutional prerogatives as Emperor (Executive and Moderating Power) until he reached majority, a regency was created. The first regency consisted of a triumvirate, and one of its members was the same Brigadier General Francisco de Lima e Silva who had presented the infant Pedro to the Government more <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> previously. Disputes between political factions resulted in an unstable, almost anarchical, regency. The Liberals who had ousted Pedro I soon split into two factions: moderate liberals (constitutional monarchists who would later split into the Liberal Party and Conservative Party) and Republicans (a small minority, but radical and highly rebellious). There were also the Restorationists who had been previously known as Bonifacians.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, {{gastroenteritis}} {{from all}} causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, {{with the majority}} occurring in the developing world. Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by the year 2000, {{largely due to the}} introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy. In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are the second most common infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually, with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of age.|$|E
5|$|In late 1996, {{after more}} <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of {{addiction}} to heroin, Frusciante quit it cold turkey. However, {{months later he}} was still unable to break addictions to crack cocaine and alcohol. In January 1998, urged by longtime friend Bob Forrest, Frusciante checked into Las Encinas, a drug rehabilitation clinic in Pasadena, to begin a full recovery. Upon arrival, {{he was diagnosed with}} a potentially lethal oral infection, which could only be alleviated by removing all of his rotten teeth and replacing them with dental implants. He also received skin grafts to help repair the abscesses on his ravaged arms. About a month later, Frusciante checked out of Las Encinas and re-entered society.|$|E

Cinecittà Studios, a very large motion picture production facility constructed in 1937 {{on the outskirts of}} Rome, was identified early on as the primary shooting location. Zimbalist hired Wyler's long-term production supervisor, Henry Henigson, to oversee the film, and art directors William A. Horning and Edward Carfagno created the overall look of the film, relying on the more <b>than</b> <b>five</b> <b>years</b> of research which had already been completed for the production.
