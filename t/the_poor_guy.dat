2500|$|On August 12 {{against the}} Athletics, Demeter hit {{a grand slam}} and had 7 RBI, tying a career high. However, the great moment couldn't be celebrated long as the next night against the Angels ended with Demeter being carried off the field in a {{stretcher}} and hospitalized overnight after a pitch in the fifth inning from California pitcher Dean Chance struck him in the head, resulting in two missed games. Demeter suffered another injury on August 27 at Los Angeles, damaging his left wrist while {{trying to make a}} diving catch on a line drive hit by Jimmy Piersall. After 12 X-rays, it was finally determined to be a sprain and not a broken wrist as originally diagnosed. It was the same wrist he broke in 1961 during his tenure with the Dodgers. Several key players were injured at the time, leading Demeter to remark, [...] "I really feel sick for Charlie (Dressen). <b>The</b> <b>poor</b> <b>guy</b> gets his team where it can make a move and then injuries hit him." ...|$|E

40|$|Some {{two decades}} ago, I was {{travelling}} {{in a bus}} for a conducted tour of some scenic spot for which organizers of annual conferences of psychiatrists take delegates. Sitting with me was the area manager of the pharmaceutical concern that, if my memory serves me right, had sponsored the tour. As the bus journey took some time, he got talking and {{we came to the}} topic of doctors and rep's visits to them. Well, it was a chastening experience in more ways than one. Doctors always have a rather patronizing attitude towards rep's visits, which the latter know very well. But are ready to play along, nevertheless. It's a great ego massage for some of the docs to smile condescendingly as reps detail products and enjoy their sense of superiority as reps play ball sportingly. <b>The</b> <b>poor</b> <b>guys</b> often wait hours outside non-ac consulting rooms/clinics, uncomfortable behind tie scratchy stiff collars and still manage the easy smile when their turn comes to enter the clinic. And play ball even if some doctors call in three at a time and talk to the other two while the first is detailing his product. There are some who expect reps to come by 9 pm but they can meet the doctor only after 12 midnight, after he has finished all his patients. And one of them tells them to continue detailing their product, while he is busy counting his day's cash collection. As he finishes, the rep is supposed to quietly leave his samples, gifts etc on the table. And his departure is greeted with a gruff 'huh', the only concession the doctor makes to any presence beyond the important task of cash counting at hand. For the cash has to tally and the pretty receptionist has to leave, since it's already so late. And her smile as she leaves {{is more important than the}} smiling rep's detailing, samples, gifts etc. For they are to come on the table, anyway. And his smile is unconditional, hers isn't. What struck the young consultant in me then was that it's not that reps don't understand our patronizing behaviour, but are trained (or have learnt) to ignore it as they have a job at hand. What also struck me was the fact that doctors' idiosyncrasies, their unrealistic demands for gifts and sponsorships are tolerated but discussed in the medical rep community with open glee. Something the docs don't probably know, since the reps are always properly respectful to them. So I decided to behave myself with them always, something that reps who know me will vouch for.
