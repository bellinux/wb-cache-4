5|$|Modules {{and weapons}} are built using a {{resource}} {{represented by a}} lug nut. This resource slowly accrues on its own, but destroyed targets drop varying amounts that can be collected by moving the cursor over them. Each corporation provides a different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo,</b> which must be placed or arranged according to its characteristics. One corporation provides simple cargo crates, {{as well as a}} mechanic module that can produce more cargo crates during the mission in order to increase the mission reward. Another corporation provides passenger modules, which must face outward, limiting space for weapons.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{affect the}} cost to move a bulk cargo by ship. The bulk freight market is very volatile, and it fluctuates, along with the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo,</b> the ship's size, and the route {{traveled}} all affect the final price. Moving a capesize load of coal from South America to Europe cost anywhere from $15 to $25 per ton in 2005. Hauling a panamax-sized load of aggregate materials from the Gulf of Mexico to Japan that year could cost as little as $40 per ton {{to as much as}} $70 per ton.|$|E
5|$|C-17s {{have also}} {{supported}} ADF training. In this role they have moved helicopters {{and other equipment}} between Australian bases, and supported training deployments to the United States. In April 2010, members of the Australian Army's No. 176 (Air Dispatch) Squadron became the first paratroopers to jump from a non-American Globemaster; the type was first used to support training by the Army's Parachute Training School in June that year. A C-17 transported an Army M1 Abrams tank {{for the first time}} during a training exercise conducted on 11 May 2012. To mark the arrival of the RAAF's final Globemaster, four of the aircraft flew over Brisbane together on 22 November 2012. Each of the C-17s involved in the flight carried a different <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> to showcase the type's capabilities; A41-211 was configured for aeromedical evacuation tasks, another C-17 embarked an Abrams tank, one carried two Tiger helicopters and the fourth was loaded with several Bushmasters.|$|E

25|$|Maintaining year-round {{traffic in}} the Northern Sea Route, {{especially}} between Murmansk and Dudinka that {{were the most important}} ports in the Soviet arctic region, had always been a high priority to the Soviet Union due to the economic exploitation of the vast natural resources of the northern regions. Northern Sea Route is also an important link between Europe and Asia as it significantly reduces the transit time in comparison to the route through the Suez Canal. While the Soviet Union had constructed a large fleet of ice-strengthened cargo ships, they could not keep up with the large nuclear-powered icebreakers and were often damaged by ice during towing operations. In order to prevent this, a fundamentally new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> ship was needed.|$|E
500|$|Liberty {{ships were}} a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> ship with a uniform design {{intended}} to be quickly built for wartime needs during World War II. In general, Liberty ships were named after famous Americans, and Timothy Bloodworth was named for Timothy Bloodworth, a teacher and statesman from North Carolina. The ship was the 44th of 188 Liberty ships built by Delta Shipbuilding Company of New Orleans. Timothy Bloodworth ( [...] hull number 1033) was laid down on 2 February 1943 on [...] number 8. She was launched on 17 March after spending 41 days on the ways. Timothy Bloodworth was completed on 22 April, after 36 days fitting out on the water. Her total construction time from keel laying to delivery was 77 days.|$|E

The second day in particular took place mostly on the set for the gravity neutral [...] "sweet spot" [...] first seen in the Enterprise pilot, [...] "". The main cast, with the exception of Montgomery were only required for the first three days. Montgomery meanwhile, filmed his scenes over the course of all seven days alongside the guest cast. Several sets were created on a soundstage to appear as the Horizon. These included the bridge of the cargo ship, a cargo hold, Mayweather's old quarters, a mess hall and a variety of corridors. The Horizon itself was rendered using computer-generated imagery and was to appear as a similar <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> vessel as seen in season one's [...] "".|$|E
2500|$|Canals {{were set}} up as {{commercial}} enterprises. The fee for using the canals was dependent on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> and its weight. Each boat had to have four (or, for some canal companies - Swansea, Glamorganshire, Oxford, six) gauging plates fitted to the hull at the [...] "corners" [...] of the boat - bow and stern at each side - indicating a measurement point and a boat serial number.|$|E
2500|$|Fees {{were set}} in pence per mile, or part. Sometimes empty boats were exempt, or free if {{returning}} loaded, or if water was running over the weirs. Fees depended on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo.</b> Coal, stone and lime were the cheapest, then iron ore, then finished goods, with perishables and packets being the most expensive. Tolls might be refunded for long distance trips to encourage expansion of trade - [...] "drawbacks" [...] - particularly applied to the coal trade.|$|E

40|$|Two {{distinct}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> ports handle French deep-sea cargo: global {{ports of}} Northern Range and Marseilles serve {{a great number}} of overseas regions (forelands) and secondary ports mainly serve niche markets. In this paper we demonstrate that global ports serve also larger hinterlands, but their superiority over secondary ports depends on the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> handled. The results of a spatial interaction model demonstrate that most <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> flows are strongly distance-constrained. This evidence indicates that, despite a deep transformation on forelands, the secondary ports subsist because they partly depend on niche markets and local economies generating substantial amounts <b>of</b> non-containerised <b>cargo</b> flows. Some implications of this finding are suggested...|$|R
