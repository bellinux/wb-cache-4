In the last book Artemis and Holly are in a crisis and Artemis finally realizes his affection for Holly and kisses her on the forehead which seems to be for romantic reasons, however it is later revealed that this is only so Foaly can have Artemis' DNA sample to create a clone and revive him.|$|E

25|$|Extraversion is {{the state}} of {{primarily}} obtaining gratification from outside oneself. Extraverts tend to enjoy human interactions and to be enthusiastic, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. Extraverts are energized and thrive off being around other people. They <b>take</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>in</b> activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and business or political groups. They also tend to work well in groups. An extraverted person is likely to enjoy time spent with people and find less reward in time spent alone. They tend to be energized when around other people, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{possible}} {{impression that}} solo divers are unsociable is often wrong. Most solo divers are normally gregarious {{and want to}} share their enjoyment of diving with others – {{they just want to}} do it when they get to the surface. The solitude they want to enjoy is during the dive. These solo divers <b>take</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>in</b> this solitude and in the feeling of self-sufficiency for this style of diving, that one is not dependent on others, but is relying solely on one's own skills and capabilities. Finally, there is the sense of freedom, of not being impeded by the need to look after anyone but oneself and therefore being able to achieve one's own goal in the dive without compromising.|$|E
25|$|Introverts often <b>take</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>in</b> solitary {{activities}} such as reading, writing, using computers, hiking and fishing. The archetypal artist, writer, sculptor, scientist, engineer, composer and inventor are all highly introverted. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people, though they may enjoy interactions with close friends. Trust is usually an issue of significance: a virtue of utmost importance to introverts is choosing a worthy companion. They prefer to concentrate on a single activity {{at a time and}} like to observe situations before they participate, especially observed in developing children and adolescents. They are more analytical before speaking. Introverts are easily overwhelmed by too much stimulation from social gatherings and engagement, introversion having even been defined by some in terms of a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating external environment.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists such as William James {{initially}} {{used the}} term motivation to refer to intention, in a sense similar {{to the concept of}} will in European philosophy. With the steady rise of Darwinian and Freudian thinking, instinct also came {{to be seen as a}} primary source of motivation. According to drive theory, the forces of instinct combine into a single source of energy which exerts a constant influence. Psychoanalysis, like biology, regarded these forces as physical demands made by the organism on the nervous system. However, they believed that these forces, especially the sexual instincts, could become entangled and transmuted within the psyche. Classical psychoanalysis conceives of a struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle, roughly corresponding to id and ego. Later, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud introduced the concept of the death drive, a compulsion towards aggression, destruction, and psychic repetition of traumatic events. Meanwhile, behaviorist researchers used simple dichotomous models (pleasure/pain, reward/punishment) and well-established principles such as the idea that a thirsty creature will <b>take</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>in</b> drinking. Clark Hull formalized the latter idea with his drive reduction model.|$|E
25|$|Woodwind and harp {{accompany}} a pensive {{version of}} the 'Dmitriy Motif'. The Pretender dreams of an assignation with Marina {{in the garden of}} her father's castle. However, to his annoyance, Rangoni finds him. He brings news that Marina longs for him and wishes to speak with him. The Pretender resolves to throw himself at Marina's feet, begging her to be his wife and Tsaritsa. He entreats Rangoni to lead him to Marina. Rangoni, however, first begs the Pretender to consider him a father, allowing him to follow his every step and thought. Despite his mistrust of Rangoni, the Pretender agrees not to part from him if he will only let him see Marina. Rangoni convinces the Pretender to hide as the Polish nobles emerge from the castle dancing a polonaise (Polonaise). Marina flirts, dancing with an older man. The Poles sing of taking the Muscovite throne, defeating the army of Boris, and capturing him. They return to the castle. The Pretender comes out of hiding, cursing Rangoni. He resolves to abandon wooing Marina and begin his march on Moscow. But then Marina appears and calls to him. He is lovesick. She, however, only wants to know when he will be Tsar, and declares she can only be seduced by a throne and a crown. The Pretender kneels at her feet. She rejects his advances, and, attempting to spur him to action, dismisses him, calling him a lackey. Having reached his limit, he tells her he will depart the next day to lead his army to Moscow and to his father's throne. Furthermore, as Tsar he will <b>take</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>in</b> watching her come crawling back looking for her own lost throne, and will command everyone to laugh at her. She quickly reverses course, tells him she adores him, and they sing a duet ("O Tsarevich, I implore you"). Rangoni observes the amorous couple from afar, and, joining them in a brief trio, cynically rejoices in his victory.|$|E

500|$|Opening night {{reviews of}} the musical were {{strongly}} positive. [...] Richard Watts in the New York Post termed it [...] "nother triumph for the masters". Critic John Mason Brown stated, [...] "They have done it again." [...] The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: [...] "This time Messrs. Rodgers and Hammerstein are not breaking any fresh trails, but they are accomplished artists of song and words in the theater; and The King and I is a beautiful and lovable musical play." [...] Barely less enthusiastic was John Lardner in The New Yorker, who wrote, [...] "Even {{those of us who}} find [...] a little too unremittingly wholesome are bound to <b>take</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>in</b> the high spirits and technical skill that their authors, and producers, have put into them."

500|$|In the 1853 {{legislative}} session, Strang introduced ten bills, five {{of which}} passed. [...] The Detroit Advertiser, on February 10, 1853, wrote of Strang: [...] "Mr. Strang’s course {{as a member}} of the present Legislature, has disarmed much of the prejudices which have previously surrounded him. Whatever may be said or thought of the peculiar sect of which he is the local head, I <b>take</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>in</b> stating that throughout this session he has conducted himself with the degree of decorum and propriety which have been equaled by his industry, sagacity, good temper, apparent regard for the true interests of the people, and the obligations of his official oath." [...] He was reelected in 1855, and did much to organize the upper portion of Michigan's lower peninsula into counties and townships. [...] Strang ardently fought the illegal practice of trading liquor to local Native American tribes due to the common practice of selling them diluted liquor mixed with various contaminants at a high price. [...] This made him many enemies among those non-Strangite residents of Beaver and nearby Mackinac Island who profited mightily from this illicit trade.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{also noted}} the unusual {{situation}} in that [...] "a gang was involved and that two females were the sadistic leaders." [...] Following the convictions of Powell and McNeilly, there was wider press speculation about [...] "girl gangs" [...] {{and the rise}} in violent crime committed by young women, and [...] "the probation service and ex-offender organisations found themselves bombarded with requests from journalists seeking out case histories to illustrate this apparent explosion of LA-style girl-gang culture {{on the streets of}} Britain." [...] Mary Barnish, a senior probation officer at the Inner London Probation Service Women's Centre, dismissed the notion, saying: [...] "One woman does something somewhere and immediately there's a great moral panic. People think there's an epidemic of it." [...] However, statistics and research produced by the National Association of Probation Officers did show [...] "an {{increase in the number of}} women jailed for offences involving violence." [...] The association's assistant general secretary Harry Fletcher said that, like the women involved in the Capper murder, the group is [...] "characterised by neglect, personal abuse, drug or alcohol abuse and low self-esteem. Many have themselves been the victim of violence. The problem needs help rather than incarceration." [...] In one of the [...] "starkest signs of change" [...] there was evidence that [...] "in the 15—17 age group, girls are more likely to <b>take</b> <b>pleasure</b> <b>in</b> violence than boys, an indication we may face far more female violence in the future as these girls grow up." [...] Despite the focus on the female perpetrators around the time of the crime and trial Davis pointed out that, in cases like this which involved female and male sadists, [...] "the female's role is invariably forgotten over time. This was apparent when Dudson's appeals were reported in the national press. Manchester newspapers named all of the killers involved, but most less-localised reports simply referred to the 'violent gang' he belonged to, and it probably wouldn't have occurred to newer readers that this gang included two merciless female sadists who thought that an allegedly stolen duffle coat was an excuse to torture someone to death." ...|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, the Buddha preached that [...] Imose was a place to be avoided and the priests of the law entered this Way as an outlet for their feelings, since their hearts were, after all, made of neither stone nor wood. [...] Like water that plunges from the peak of Tsukubane to form the deep pools of the Minano River, this love has surpassed in depth the love between women and men in these latter days.
