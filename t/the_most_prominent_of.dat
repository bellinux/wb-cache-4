5|$|By {{taking this}} new role, Rainilaiarivony {{became the first}} Hova to {{concurrently}} serve as both Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief. The sociopolitical transformation that had been triggered by the strangling of RadamaII reached its zenith with Rainilaiarivony's consolidation of administrative power. Rasoherina and her successors remained the figureheads of traditional authority, participated in political councils and provided official approval for policies. The Prime Minister issued new policies and laws in the Queen's name. However, the day-to-day governance, security and diplomatic activities of the kingdom principally originated with, and were managed by, Rainilaiarivony and his counselors. This new level of authority enabled the Prime Minister to amass a vast personal fortune, whether through inheritance, gifts or purchase, including 57 houses, large plantations and rice paddies, numerous cattle and thousands of slaves. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>prominent</b> <b>of</b> Rainilaiarivony's properties was the Andafiavaratra Palace, constructed {{for him on the}} slope just below the royal Rova compound by English architect William Pool in 1873.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with this}} {{cultural}} reemergence was {{the establishment of}} the Istanbul Festival, which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and around the world in 1973.

With its focus now solely on music and dance, the Istanbul Festival has been known as the Istanbul International Music Festival since 1994. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>prominent</b> <b>of</b> the festivals that evolved from the original Istanbul Festival is the Istanbul Biennial, held every two years since 1987. Its early incarnations were aimed at showcasing Turkish visual art, and it has since opened to international artists and risen in prestige to join the elite biennales, alongside the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Art Biennial.|$|E
