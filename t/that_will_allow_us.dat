Our pleasure and reward systems in the brain are hyper-activated, which makes us display continuous approach behaviors to the reward in question. Our neuro-circuity is as such that when we stop having access to such pleasurable objects of desire, we then experience negative consequences (withdrawal symptoms). Addictive behaviors then arise to alleviate such negative consequences and the cycle continues.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food.

40|$|Obtaining seismic {{images of}} the {{subsurface}} near and beneath salt is very difcult due to seismic energy that is lost by propagating outside of the survey area or becoming evanescent at salt bound-aries (poor illumination). We demonstrate an iterative regularized least-squares inversion for imaging that helps to compensate for il-lumination problems. We show {{the use of a}} regularization operator that acts to regularize amplitudes along reection angles (or equiva-lent offset ray parameters) to compensate for the sudden, large am-plitude changes caused by poor illumination. This regularization operator has the effect of lling in the gaps created in the reection angle range due to the lost seismic energy. We discuss the use of this regularization operator in an iterative least-squares inversion scheme to improve imaging for a poorly illuminated 3 -D seismic dataset. We introduce a new type of joint inversion problem <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to simultaneously invert two or more datasets. For this iterative inversion scheme, we design a different regularization operator that <b>allows</b> <b>us</b> to share illumination information between images created from the different datasets involved.
