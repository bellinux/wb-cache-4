Transcript levels of the gene PGA 4 encoding a putative GPI-anchored protein were elevated in C. albicians wild-type cells during infection of reconstituted human epithelial and mouse liver tissue, and transiently increased after induction of hyphal formation with serum. The serum-specific increase in PGA 4 transcript was found to be dependent on the transcription factors Ras 1 p, Cyr 1 p, and Tec 1 p. The remaining C. albicans Phr homologues, PHR 3 and PGA 5, showed low expression levels. Unlike PHR 1 and PHR 2, the expression of PHR 3, PGA 4, and PGA 5 was not dependent on the pH of the growth medium. Neither PHR 3 deletion nor PGA 4 disruption resulted in a distinct growth or morphology phenotype.

A randomized placebo-controlled three-way crossover trial was separated by a washout period of more than 3 days. Twenty-one normal healthy volunteers, aged 30 – 61 years old (17 males and 4 females) were selected for this study. The subjects ’ health was assessed as normal by prestudy screening. All subjects received 3 types of test meals (3 rice balls: protein, 14. 4 g; fat, 2. 1 g; and carbohydrate, 111 g: total energy, 522 kcal) with 200 ml water in which 0 mg, 150 mg, or 300 mg of TG was dissolved. Blood samples for estimating plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were collected before and every 30 min after the experiment. As compared to no TG treatment, TG administration tended to prevent a postprandial increase in plasma glucose (p = 0. 069 : 150 mg of TG vs control) but there were no significant difference among three groups. With regard to the 17 subjects who were suggested to have impaired glucose tolerance, TG significantly decreased the postprandial blood glucose (p< 0. 05 : 150 mg and 300 mg of TG vs control) and marginally decreased insulin concentrations (p = 0. 099 : 300 mg of TG vs control).

40|$|The mucosal layers colonized by the {{pathogenic}} fungus Candida albicans differ {{widely in}} ambient pH. Because the properties {{and functions of}} wall proteins are probably pH dependent, we hypothesized that C. albicans adapts its wall proteome to the external pH. We developed an in vitro system that mimics colonization of mucosal surfaces by growing biomats at pH  7 and 4 on semi-solid agarose containing mucin as the sole nitrogen source. The biomats expanded radially for at least 8  days {{at a rate of}} ∼ 30  μm h− 1. At pH  7, hyphal growth predominated and growth was invasive, whereas at pH  4 only yeast and pseudohyphal cells were present and growth was noninvasive. Both qualitative mass spectrometric analysis of the wall proteome by tandem mass spectrometry and relative quantification of individual wall proteins (pH  7 /pH  4), using Fourier transform mass spectrometry (FT-MS) and a reference mixture of 15 N-labelled yeast and hyphal walls, identified similar sets of > 20 covalently linked wall proteins.

Its affinity towards glycogen is particularly noteworthy since glycogen is the best D-glucosyl unit acceptor and the most efficient activator (98 -fold k(cat) increase) known for this enzyme. Glycogen-enzyme interactions were modeled starting from the crystallographic AS: maltoheptaose complex, where two key oligosaccharide binding sites, OB 1 and OB 2, were identified.

Among the various docking positions obtained, four models were chosen based on geometry and energy criteria. Robotics calculations enabled us to describe a {{back and forth motion}} of a hairpin loop of the AS specific B'-domain, a movement that assists the elongation of glycogen branches.

A miniaturized purification protocol was developed and both mutant stability and substrate promiscuity were explored. A range of 8 degrees C between extreme melting temperature values was observed and some variants were able to synthesize series of oligosaccharides with distributions differing from that of the parental enzyme.

No impact on starch content was found in any of the single mutant lines. Moreover, three double mutant combinations were produced (be 1 be 2, be 1 be 3, and be 2 be 3), and the impact of the mutations on starch content and structure was analyzed.

40|$|Starch is an {{important}} plant product widely used as a nutrient, {{as a source of}} renewable energy, and for many technological applications. In plants, starch is the almost ubiquitous storage carbohydrate whereas most heterotrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotes rely on glycogen. Despite close similarities in basic chemical features, starch and glycogen differ in both structural and physicochemical properties. Glycogen is a hydrosoluble macromolecule with evenly distributed branching points. Starch exists as a water-insoluble particle having a defined (and evolutionary conserved) internal structure. The biochemistry of starch requires the co-operation of up to 40 distinct (iso) enzymes whilst approximately 10 (iso) enzymes permit glycogen metabolism. The biosynthesis and degradation of native starch include the transition of carbohydrates from the soluble to the solid phase and vice versa. In this review, two novel aspects of the eukaryotic plastidial starch degradation are discussed: Firstly, biochemical reactions that take place at the surface of particulate glucans and mediate the phase transition of carbohydrates. Secondly, processes that occur downstream of the export of starch-derived sugars into the cytosol. Degradation of transitory starch mainly results in the formation of neutral sugars, such as glucose and maltose, that are transported into the cytosol via the respective translocators.

40|$|Amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea is a {{remarkable}} <b>transglucosidase</b> from family 13 of the glycoside-hydrolases that synthesizes an insoluble amylose-like polymer from sucrose {{in the absence of}} any primer. Amylosucrase shares strong structural similarities with alpha-amylases. Exactly how this enzyme catalyzes the formation of alpha- 1, 4 -glucan and which structural features are involved in this unique functionality existing in family 13 are important questions still not fully answered. Here, we provide evidence that amylosucrase initializes polymer formation by releasing, through sucrose hydrolysis, a glucose molecule that is subsequently used as the first acceptor molecule. Maltooligosaccharides of increasing size were produced and successively elongated at their nonreducing ends until they reached a critical size and concentration, causing precipitation. The ability of amylosucrase to bind and to elongate maltooligosaccharides is notably due to the presence of key residues at the OB 1 acceptor binding site that contribute strongly to the guidance (Arg 415, subsite + 4) and the correct positioning (Asp 394 and Arg 446, subsite + 1) of acceptor molecules. On the other hand, Arg 226 (subsites + 2 /+ 3) limits the binding of maltooligosaccharides, resulting in the accumulation of small products (G to G 3) in the medium.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{production}} of high-purity isomalto-oligosaccharides (IMO) involving the transglucosylation by <b>transglucosidase</b> and yeast fermentation was proposed. The starch of rice crumbs was enzymatically liquefied and saccharified, and then converted to low-purity IMO syrup by transglucosylation. The low-purity IMO produced either from rice crumbs or tapioca flour as the starch source could be effectively converted to high-purity IMO by yeast fermentation to remove the digestible sugars including glucose, maltose, and maltotriose. Both Saccharomyces carlsbergensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were able to ferment glucose in the IMO syrup. Cells of S. carlsbergensis harvested from the medium of malt juice were also able to ferment maltose and maltotriose. A combination of these two yeasts or S. carlsbergensis alone could be used to totally remove the digestible sugars in the IMO, coupled with the production of ethanol. The resultant high-purity IMO, including mainly isomaltose, panose, and isomaltotriose made up more than 98 % w/w of the total sugars after a 3 -day fermentation. When the low-purity IMO was produced from the starch of tapioca flour, 3 -day fermentation under the same conditions resulted in IMO with purity lower than that from rice crumbs. For low-purity IMO from rice crumbs, fermentation with washed S. carlsbergensis cells harvested at log phase was the most effective. However, for the low-purity IMO from tapioca flour, incubation with S. cerevisiae for the first 24 h and then supplementing with an equal amount of S. carlsbergensis cells for further fermentation was the most effective approach for producing high-purity IMO.

A semirational engineering approach was successfully applied to amylosucrase, a <b>transglucosidase</b> that uses a low cost sucrose substrate as a glucosyl donor.

The recombinant protein DSR-E synthesizes both α- 1, 6 and α- 1, 2 glucosidic linkages in transglucosylation reactions using sucrose as the donor and maltose as the acceptor. To investigate the specific roles of CD 1 and CD 2 in the catalytic mechanism, truncated forms of dsrE were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Gene products were then small-scale purified to isolate the various corresponding enzymes. Dextran and oligosaccharide syntheses were performed. Structural characterization by 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance and/or high-performance liquid chromatography showed that enzymes devoid of CD 2 synthesized products containing only α- 1, 6 linkages. On the other hand, enzymes devoid of CD 1 modified α- 1, 6 linear oligosaccharides and dextran acceptors through the formation of α- 1, 2 linkages. Therefore, each domain is highly regiospecific, CD 1 being specific for the synthesis of α- 1, 6 glucosidic bonds and CD 2 only catalyzing the formation of α- 1, 2 linkages.

40|$|Isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs) are non-digestible oligosaccharides, {{considered}} as prebiotics and therefore aim to selectively feed probiotics indigenous {{to the human}} colon. IMOs consists of glucose monomers linked {{by at least one}} α- 1 - 6, or in a lower proportion α - 1 - 3 (nigerose family) or α - 1 - 2 (kojibiose family) glucosidic linkages. In our case they are produced from either corn, tapioca, or rice hydrolyzed starch. The enzymatic reaction is achieved using an Aspergillus niger <b>transglucosidase</b> (EC 2. 4. 1. 24). It results in a very complex mixture with molecules characterized at the same time by their DP value (from 2 to ~ 15), linkages types (α- 1 - 2, 3 or 6) and the proportion and position of each type of linkage (only α - 1 - 6 or combined types). However, the reaction only permits to reach yields between 50 - 75 % in IMOs. Impurities are composed of residual maltooligosaccharides (glucose with exclusively α - 1 - 4 linkages) from the starting vegetal material and glucose released during the transglucosylation step. These digestible saccharides are deleterious for the prebiotic preparation. Therefore, these compounds must be eliminated from the medium or converted in prebiotic species. Residual maltooligosaccharides are thus specifically hydrolyzed by a thermostable α-glucosidase (EC. 3. 2. 1. 20) in order to produce glucose as the only unwanted specie. This glucose can then be converted to gluconic acid and/or its salts using a glucose-oxidase (EC. 1. 1. 3. 4) in combination with a catalase. Gluconic acid (C 6 H 12 O 7) is a saccharide derivative which has been recognized as a prebiotic compound. It is also known for its purgative action and proved to be effective for lipid peroxidation prevention. A first option can then be chosen, leaving gluconic acid in the product in order to obtain an original prebiotic product enjoying new prebiotic potential properties due to the combination of both types of prebiotic compounds (IMO and gluconic acid). The second option is to eliminate the gluconic acid from the prebiotic mixture. This separation doesn’t present the same difficulties than for glucose as gluconic acid is charged and can therefore be separated on anion-exchange resins (Dowex AcO-). This overall process, fulfilling the principles of green chemistry and being applicable to produce organic prebiotic, is an elegant solution, from an economical, an environmental, a nutri-functional and a techno-functional point of view. Indeed, it can lead to original prebiotic preparations, with yields close to 100 %, by avoiding product loss, as the digestible saccharides portion is converted to gluconic acid. Furthermore, the presence of gluconic acid can provide many functional properties to the prebiotic preparations for their incorporation in food products...|$|E
