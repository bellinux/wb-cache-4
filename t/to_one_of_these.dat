5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to the sacraments at all, and {{on the degree of}} importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E
5|$|Between 1945 and 1952, optical {{engineers}} {{built upon}} the earlier work of Rudolph Schindler (1888–1968), developing the first gastrocamera. In 1964, optical fiber technology was applied <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> early gastrocameras {{to produce the}} first flexible fiberoptic endoscope. Initially used in upper GI endoscopy, this device was first used for laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation by Peter Murphy, an English anesthetist, in 1967. The concept of using a stylet for replacing or exchanging orotracheal tubes was introduced by Finucane and Kupshik in 1978, using a central venous catheter.|$|E

5|$|The region {{governed by}} the Celestial Masters was divided into 24 regions for both {{administrative}} and religious reasons. Each of these 24 regions were connected {{with one of the}} Five Phases, one of the 24 periods of the year and with one of the 28 constellations of the zodiac. Depending on their birth signs, each adherent belonged <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> districts. Each of the 24 regions was administered by 24 officials, who had under their command 240 armies of spirits, composed of 2400 generals, 2400 officers and 240000 soldiers. This system of administration reflected the utopian system of governance described in the Zhouli.|$|E
5|$|While {{a direct}} route by sea {{has not been}} {{available}} since {{the sinking of the}} Joola, the traveller from Dakar may use various other means of transportation in order to arrive in Basse Casamance. Some national roads connect to Ziguinchor, down the N1 to Kaolack. The N4 and N5 roads cross the Gambia (both the country and the river), the former running through Nioro du Rip to Farafenni, and the latter crossing the river to Banjul. The two roads merge in Bignona before descending to Ziguinchor. However, traffic is forbidden on both roads between 7p.m. and 10a.m., and the routes are subject to frequent accidents and constant demining operations. Alternatively, it is possible to travel by plane to the airport in Ziguinchor or Cap Skirring, or to travel by boat <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> locations. Reaching Carabane from either town is relatively straightforward.|$|E
5|$|This Amazon {{is famous}} in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; {{some of the}} {{inhabitants}} dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in {{the centre of the}} floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go {{off the side of the}} wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.|$|E

There are numerous irregular verbs in Georgian, but they all belong <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> classes. Each class uses different strategies to build the verb complex, irregular verbs employing somewhat different formations.|$|E

25|$|The Limited Mesoamerican Geography Model {{has been}} critiqued {{by a number}} of scholars, who suggest that it is not an {{adequate}} explanation for Book of Mormon geography and that the locations, events, flora and fauna described in it do not precisely match.

50|$|Although L'Hôpital's rule applies both to 0/0 and <b>to</b> ∞/∞, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> forms may be {{more useful}} than {{the other in a}} {{particular}} case (because of the possibility of algebraic simplification afterwards).

25|$|Glycolysis is a {{determined}} sequence of ten enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The intermediates provide entry points to glycolysis.
