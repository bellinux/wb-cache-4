5|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year <b>traveling</b> <b>and</b> supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E
5|$|To {{conserve}} energy, heterothermic bats during long migrations may {{go into a}} torpid state while roosting in the daytime, {{and flying}} at night. Unlike migratory birds which fly {{during the day and}} feed during the night, nocturnal bats have a conflict between <b>traveling</b> <b>and</b> eating. Using torpor, bats can save around 90% of energy that they would have spent trying to keep their body temperature at a normal level; thereby reducing the need to feed. It also decreases the duration of migration, which may prevent them from spending too much time in unfamiliar places, and decrease predation. Pregnant individuals of some species may not use torpor.|$|E

Of the three random creatures that appear, {{there are three}} types which correspond to the relative difficulty of the monsters in battle mode: a small, weak blob denoting easy enemies, a large, strong biped denoting harder enemies, and a Fairy, which will put Link on a single screen with a free Fairy to refill his health.

Stepping onto particular spots in the overworld map will automatically switch the game to a side-scrolling mode for an enemy encounter or item pickup.|$|E

5|$|Performing live again brought Como a {{new sense}} of enjoyment. In May 1974, he {{embarked}} on his first concert appearance outside of the United States, a show at the London Palladium for the Variety Club of Great Britain to aid children's charities. It was here where he discovered what he had been missing when the audience cheered for ten minutes after he walked onstage. At the show's end, Como sat in a chair, delightedly chatting back and forth with his equally delighted fans. Perry returned to the United Kingdom in November for a Royal Variety Performance to benefit the Entertainment Artistes' Benevolent Fund with the Queen Mother in attendance. Como was invited to visit Buckingham Palace the day after the show. At first, the invitation did not extend to his associates <b>traveling</b> <b>and</b> working with him, and Como politely declined. When word reached the Palace regarding the reason for Perry's turning down the invitation, it was then extended to include all in the Como party and Como accepted this invitation. Soon after, he announced his first concert tour that began in the UK in the spring of 1975.|$|E
