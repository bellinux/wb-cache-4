50|$|Musicology, the {{academic}} {{study of the}} subject of music, is studied in universities and music conservatories. The earliest definitions from the 19th century defined <b>three</b> <b>sub-disciplines</b> of musicology: systematic musicology, historical musicology, and comparative musicology or ethnomusicology. In 2010-era scholarship, one {{is more likely to}} encounter a division of the discipline into music theory, music history, and ethnomusicology. Research in musicology has often been enriched by cross-disciplinary work, for example in the field of psychoacoustics. The study of music of non-Western cultures, and the cultural study of music, is called ethnomusicology. Students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology, ethnomusicology, music history, and music theory through several different types of degrees, including bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and PhD degrees.|$|E

40|$|Language editing - {{theoretically}} {{grounded in}} language practice? This {{article focuses on}} the possibility of formulating a theory of language editing. Research indicates that language editing in practice is sometimes undertaken on a random basis. People tend to think that language editing comes naturally once a person has completed a language course. This is of course not true. Language editing should be implemented on a sound theoretical basis embedded in a strong linguistic framework. This theoretical grounding is based on a thorough knowledge and implementation of linguistic sub-disciplines: a command of language (linguistic competence), text linguistics and normative grammar. These <b>three</b> linguistic <b>sub-disciplines</b> form an integrated basis for a sound theoretical viewpoint on language editing. Furthermore, the term “language editing” is inadequate to describe the editing process as a whole. Language editing should not be simply seen as the correction of language errors, but rather as a complete editing (copy-editing) of the text...|$|R

Rapid technological development is driven by consumer grade applications. On the professional side, RPAS technologies have already been widely used in different fields of environmental resource management, especially in agriculture. Due to the recent price development, technology has become also attainable for less financially productive purposes, such as environmental surveys. By applying RPAS technologies in environmental surveys of forest industry, {{a substantial amount of}} fieldwork can be avoided thus leading to financial savings and possibly to more comparative measurements and results. To test this hypothesis, <b>three</b> different <b>sub-disciplines</b> of forest industry environmental surveys were conducted by both traditional fieldwork and by applying manual and automatic remote sensing methods. Aerial imagery was recorded with a multispectral sensor attached to consumer grade remotely piloted aircraft. Sub-discipline specific attributes were measured and compared to estimates derived from aerial imagery and three dimensional models. It was proved that by using even relatively low-priced instruments the quality of the data was more than adequate for remote sensing purposes. An automated workflows to derive measurements from the subjects of interest did not perform satisfactory, but manual interpretation of imagery gave promising results. It can be assumed that RPAS technologies are able to provide savings for conducting environmental surveys. Manual interpretation was at that moment seen superior to automated workflows...|$|R

The corpus consisted of 90 RAIs drawn {{from a wide range}} of refereed journals in the corresponding sub-disciplines. The results indicate sub-disciplinary variation in the structure of this genre in terms of Move 2 / step 1 B that can be justified through the concepts of ‘established’ versus ‘emerging’ fields. The findings underline the need for further in-depth research into sub-disciplinary variation and generic structure of RAIs.

40|$|Students in {{tertiary}} {{educational institutions}} in South Africa come {{from many different}} backgrounds and have varied educational experiences. Some students, especially those from non-English speaking backgrounds, may encounter linguistic difficulties with various academic tasks. In order for students to be successful at university, they must become academically literate. That is, they must master all the reading, writing, listening and comprehension tasks required by the disciplines {{in which they are}} studying. One such task is presented by the academic lecture which {{is an integral part of}} any course of study. Linguistically, the academic lecture can be seen as a particular genre with unique characteristics. This study investigated some linguistic characteristics of academic lectures. The discipline of Political Science, as a Social Science, was chosen because there is little research that has been done on language in the Social Sciences. The Political Science sub-disciplines of Political Philosophy, South African Politics, and International Relations were used in this research. First year lectures were recorded from each of these <b>three</b> <b>sub-disciplines.</b> The linguistic characteristics of lectures were analysed using techniques drawn from Systemic Functional linguistic theory. The analysis concentrated on the aspects mode and field as they were realised in the lectures. In addition, higher level generic structure was also analysed. The insights gained from the analysis were validated through interviews with the lecturers who gave the lectures. The aim of this research was to develop a linguistic characterisation of the lecture genre as it occurs in the <b>three</b> <b>sub-disciplines</b> of Political Science. The results of this research suggest that although there is a unified academic lecture genre, there is variation according to sub-discipline. The implications of this variation are discussed with reference to their relevance to teaching academic literacy. ...|$|E

In this paper we apply a hybrid clustering method based on Fisher's inverse chi-square to integrate full-text with citations and to provide a mapping of the field of information science. We quantitatively and qualitatively asses the added value of such an integrated analysis and we investigate whether the clustering outcome is a better representation of the field by comparing with a text-only clustering and with another hybrid method based on linear combination of distance matrices. Our dataset consists of almost 1000 articles and notes published in the period 2002 – 2004 in 5 representative journals. The optimal number of clusters for the field is 5, determined by using a combination of distance-based and stability-based methods. Term networks present the cognitive structure of the field and are complemented by the most representative publications. <b>Three</b> large traditional <b>sub-disciplines,</b> particularly, information retrieval, bibliometrics/scientometrics, and more social aspects, and two smaller clusters about patent analysis and webometrics, can be distinguished.

40|$|Surface wear is {{estimated}} to result in upwards of 70 % of material failure in the US with costs of over 300 billion dollars per annum. Tribology {{is defined as the}} study of friction, lubrication, and wear, and while all <b>three</b> of these <b>sub-disciplines</b> stem from interactions at the asperity scale, studies involving the mechanics of industrial interfaces will often ignore their interdependence. This work makes use of a synthesis of in situ tribological data with ex situ surface characterization, in order to elucidate the mechanics of friction and wear in a number of industrial interfaces each with its own objective. Section 1 focuses on using this technique to elucidate the mechanics of protective solid lubricants. Detailed experiments were conducted to study the formation and depletion of self-replenishing powder transfer films in both single component and composite forms. Based on the synthesis of ex situ and in situ findings, the primary wear mechanisms at each interface were described as abrasive and transfer film phenomena were described in a new way using a quasi-hydrodynamic approach. In addition to transfer films, hard tribological coatings were also studied for their ability to mitigate impact damage. Coefficient of restitution results were combined with investigations ex situ of the impact sites and compared to nanoindentation results of coating properties. Through synthesizing these results, it was found that more elastic coatings worked best on stiffer substrates, while harder, more brittle coatings worked best on soft substrates. In Section 2, the Section 1 findings were crucial {{in the development of a}} numerical model which was presented using abrasive formulations for the wear of soft surfaces and preferential patterning. Quantitative agreement for modeling friction and surface evolution, as well as qualitative agreement for wear trends were provided for experimental values from previous studies. In Section 3, this technique was used to study powder rheology as it applies to flows in the additive manufacturing process. Rheological characterization was conducted for stress states akin to spreading and hopper flow on an FT 4 powder rheometer, while morphological characterization was performed in collaboration with the Material Science Department at Carnegie Mellon using scanning electron microscopy. By analyzing the results in concert, it was found that morphology proved to be more important than material type or manufacturing process in governing flow properties. Spreading-like states were found to be most sensitive to factors affecting particle rolling, while hopper-like states were found to be most sensitive to factors affecting particle cohesion. In Section 4, the interactions of single cutters were explored for rock substrates found during drilling for oil, gas, and geothermal heat. Experiments were conducted first for O 1 tool steel buttons on Carthage Marble. Cutting with this type cutter was found to produce rough surfaces which would lead to an increase of friction force in the cut. Experiments for dry and lubricated cutting with industrial polycrystalline diamond compact cutters were performed for Carthage Marble, Nugget Sandstone, and Mancos Shale on a retrofitted UMT- 3 Tribometer from Bruker. Cutting was found to produce smoother topographies and a decrease in friction. Lubricants were found to possess both a lubricating effect which would reduce COF as well as a weakening effect which would enhance rate of penetration and the load at which cutting would commence. Scraping was found to produce a scalloped topography similar to “bit-bounce. ” Industrial drilling fluids or “muds” were also evaluated and ranked using a figure of merit proposed within this work. By normalization with the dry scenario, muds performance in terms of friction and rate of penetration could be combined to provide ranking of a given mud for a given rock type. Overall it was found that implementing both in situ tribological data and ex situ surface metrology was an extremely effective way to recreate the mechanics present in industrial interfaces which are difficult to observe otherwise...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} or {{outer shape}} of a crystal is an important crystal property and has as such received much attention in the literature. The aim of the present thesis is {{to contribute to the}} study of crystal morphology by integrating the methods of <b>three</b> <b>sub-disciplines</b> within the field of crystal growth to come {{to a better understanding of}} the underlying mechanisms that determine the morphology. These are the study of atomistic models, continuum descriptions of growth mechanisms and morphology prediction methods. The thesis can be divided into two parts. The first part discusses classical microscopic models in detail to arrive at a better fundamental understanding of the crystal growth mechanisms and mainly deals with kink densities of growth steps and step free energies. It also discusses the influence that these parameters have on 2 D nucleation, kinetic roughening and spiral growth. The second part studies some particular phenomena encountered in the growth of real crystals. These are studied using Monte Carlo simulations based on crystal graphs as models for these real crystals...|$|E
40|$|Books, articles, opinion texts, {{discussion}} papers, design approaches, … offer – explicitly, {{but mostly}} implicitly – a wide diversity of definitions of ‘spatial quality’. The {{reasons for this}} are multifold and stem from often discipline-bound theoretical debates about the concept of space, the plurality of methods to address the use of space and spatial quality, the lack of rigour in definitional and appreciative practices, etc. This paper seeks to bring some order to defining and operationalising spatial quality, to identify its key-dimensions and develop a shared language to communicate, discuss and implement spatial quality in transdisciplinary contexts. It focuses on the literature and practice in spatial planning, urban research by design and socio-spatial development Starting from epistemological premises {{on the meaning of}} space and its quality for its diversity of uses and users, the paper explains how the combination of concepts and relations between them across these <b>three</b> <b>sub-disciplines</b> of spatial analysis allows to: a) put forward a theoretical framework for the analysis of space and its qualities which incorporates different types of relations between space and its users (experiential, semantic, functional, representational, conceptual …); b) apply this theoretical framework to identify the actual roles of users of space in assessing and steering its quality. The potential of this framework will be illustrated using a few case-studies, one being the exploratory study for a neighbourhood development plan in the Flemish City of Turnhout in which the authors are involved. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Our bibliometric search {{required}} {{criteria for}} selecting {{the types of}} articles {{to be included in}} the analysis. In addition, it needed a search strategy for collecting data, classifying them and analysing their theoretical and empirical content. Given the huge amount of researches on the economics of information asymmetry, the review is focused on articles investigating innovation management under asymmetric information. To search for appropriate literature investigating the above research question, we began by exploring two academic databases: JSTOR (Ithaka) and ScienceDirect (Elsevier) by using the following Boolean phrase: 'Asymmetric information’ or 'Information asymmetry’. In order to refine the search process, we introduced the following additional keywords using the 'AND’ Boolean operator: 'Innovation’, 'Innovation management’ and 'Entrepreneurship’. The foregoing led us to reduce the sample of articles investigating innovation and entrepreneurship under conditions of asymmetric information. Then, we scanned the bibliographies of the most recent articles to ensure that we did not miss seminal articles, limiting our investigation on those articles that have been published in the leading journals in economics and management science. We referred to the 45 th edition of the Journal Quality List (JQL; Harzing 2012) to identify leading journals in financial economics, industrial organisation, entrepreneurship and innovation management (e.g. The American Economic Review, Administrative Science Quarterly, Management Science, The Journal of Industrial Economics, Academy of Management Review, The Journal of Finance).

40|$|This review {{discusses}} some of {{the recent}} developments in genomics and its current and future relevance for veterinary pharmacology and toxicology. With the rapid progress made in this field several new approaches in pharmacological and toxicological research have developed and drug discovery and drug development strategies have changed dramatically. In this review, the term genomics is used to encompass the <b>three</b> <b>sub-disciplines</b> transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics (or metabonomics) to describe the formation and fate of mRNA, proteins and metabolites, respectively. The current status and methods of the technology and some applications are briefly described. Although the DNA sequencing programmes are receiving considerable attention, the real value of genomics for pharmacology and toxicology is brought by the parallel developments in bio-informatics, bio-statistics and the integration of biology with mathematics and information technology. The ultimate level of integration is now mostly called systems biology, where mRNA, proteins and metabolites are being analysed in parallel, using a complete arsenal of analytical techniques (DNA-array, LC-MS/MS, GC-MS/MS, NMR, etc.). The information thus collected is analysed, integrated, linked to database information and translated to pathways and systems. This approach offers an enormous potential to study disease mechanisms and find new drug targets. Thus far, genomics and systems biology have not been introduced significantly in typical veterinary pharmacological and toxicological research programmes. The high costs and complexity connected to these large projects often form major obstacles for research groups with limited budgets. In other veterinary areas and disciplines, including infectious diseases, animal production and food-safety more examples of application are available. Genomics and bio-informatics provide outstanding opportunities to study pharmacology and toxicology in a more holistic way, taking into account the complexity of biological systems and based on the basic principles of physiology and the concept of homeostasis. Knowledge of biology, in vivo and in vitro models, and comparative pharmacology/toxicology is essential here, creating excellent opportunities for the veterinary trained scientist. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, the topic of child {{development}} in a cultural context has received {{a great deal of}} theoretical and empirical investigation. Investigators from the fields of indigenous and cultural psychology have argued that childhood is socially and historically constructed, rather than a universal process with a standard sequence of developmental stages or descriptions. As a result, many psychologists have become doubtful that any stage theory of cognitive or socialemotional development can be found to be valid for all times and places. In placing more theoretical emphasis on contextual processes, they define culture as a complex system of common symbolic action patterns (or scripts) built up through everyday human social interaction by means of which individuals create common meanings and in terms of which they organize experience. Researchers understand culture to be organized and coherent, but not homogenous or static, and realize that the complex dynamic system of culture constantly undergoes transformation as participants (adults and children) negotiate and re-negotiate meanings through social interaction. These negotiations and transactions give rise to unceasing heterogeneity and variability in how different individuals and groups of individuals interpret values and meanings. However, while many psychologists—both inside and outside the fields of indigenous and cultural psychology–are now willing to give up the idea of a universal path of child development and a universal story of parenting, they have not necessarily foreclosed on the possibility of discovering and describing some universal processes that underlie socialization and development-in-context. The roots of such universalities would lie in the biological aspects of child development, in the evolutionary processes of adaptation, and in the unique symbolic and problem-solving capacities of the human organism as a culture-bearing species. For instance, according to functionalist psychological anthropologists, shared (cultural) processes surround the developing child and promote in the long view the survival of families and groups if they are to demonstrate continuity in the face of ecological change and resource competition, (e. g. Edwards 2 ̆ 6 Whiting, 2004; Gallimore, Goldenberg, 2 ̆ 6 Weisner, 1993; LeVine, Dixon, LeVine, Richman, Leiderman, Keefer, 2 ̆ 6 Brazelton, 1994; LeVine, Miller, 2 ̆ 6 West, 1988; Weisner, 1996, 2002; Whiting 2 ̆ 6 Edwards, 1988; Whiting 2 ̆ 6 Whiting, 1980). As LeVine and colleagues (1994) state: A population tends to share an environment, symbol systems for encoding it, and organizations and codes of conduct for adapting to it (emphasis added). It is through the enactment of these population-specific codes of conduct in locally organized practices that human adaptation occurs. Human adaptation, in other words, is largely attributable to the operation of specific social organizations (e. g. families, communities, empires) following culturally prescribed scripts (normative models) in subsistence, reproduction, and other domains [communication and social regulation]. (p. 12) It follows, then, that in seeking to understand child development in a cultural context, psychologists need to support collaborative and interdisciplinary developmental science that crosses international borders. Such research can advance cross-cultural psychology, cultural psychology, and indigenous psychology, understood as <b>three</b> <b>sub-disciplines</b> composed of scientists who frequently communicate and debate with one another and mutually inform one another’s research programs. For example, to turn to parental belief systems, the particular topic of this chapter, it is clear that collaborative international studies are needed to support the goal of crosscultural psychologists for findings that go beyond simply describing cultural differences in parental beliefs. Comparative researchers need to shed light on whether parental beliefs are (or are not) systematically related to differences in child outcomes; and they need meta-analyses and reviews to explore between- and within-culture variations in parental beliefs, with a focus on issues of social change (Saraswathi, 2000). Likewise, collaborative research programs can foster the goals of indigenous psychology and cultural psychology and lay out valid descriptions of individual development in their particular cultural contexts and the processes, principles, and critical concepts needed for defining, analyzing, and predicting outcomes of child development-in-context. The project described in this chapter is based on an approach that integrates elements of comparative methodology to serve the aim of describing particular scenarios of child development in unique contexts. The research team of cultural insiders and outsiders allows for a look at American belief systems based on a dialogue of multiple perspectives...|$|E
