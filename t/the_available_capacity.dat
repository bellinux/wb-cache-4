40|$|We {{developed}} a diffusive load balancing scheme that equalizes <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>capacities</b> of nodes in a peer-to-peer (P 2 P) system. These nodes {{may have different}} resource capacities, geographic locations, or availabilities (i. e., length of time {{being part of the}} peer-to-peer system). The services on these nodes may have different service times and arrival rates of requests. Using the diffusive scheme, the system is able to maintain similar response times for its services. Our scheme is a modification of the diffusive load balancing algorithms proposed for parallel computing systems. This scheme is able to handle services with heterogeneous resource requirements and P 2 P nodes with heterogeneous capacities. We also adapted the diffusive scheme to clustered peer-to-peer system, where a load balancing operation may move services or nodes between clusters. After a literature survey of this field, this thesis investigates the following issues using analytical reasoning and extensive simulation studies. The load balancing operations equalize <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>capacities</b> of <b>the</b> nodes in a neighborhood to their averages. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>capacities</b> of all nodes in the P 2 P system converge to a global average. We found that this convergence is faster when the scheme use...|$|R
2500|$|Out of Europe's {{five major}} {{football}} leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A [...] ), the Bundesliga {{has the lowest}} ticket prices and the highest average attendance. Many club stadia have large terraced areas for standing fans (by comparison, stadia in the English Premier League are all-seaters due to the Taylor Report). Teams {{limit the number of}} season tickets to ensure everyone has a chance to see the games live, and the away club has the right to 10% of <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>capacity.</b> Match tickets often double as free rail passes which encourages supporters to travel and celebrate in a relaxed atmosphere. According to Bundesliga chief executive Christian Seifert, tickets are inexpensive (especially for standing room) as [...] "It is not in the clubs' culture so much [...] They are very fan orientated". Uli Hoeneß, former president of Bayern Munich, was quoted as saying [...] "We do not think the fans are like cows to be milked. Football has got to be for everybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not until 1936 did the Dutch {{government}} {{recognize the}} growing threat of Nazi Germany, but the resultant budget increases {{were too small}} and too late to establish an effective defense of the country. [...] One factor was practical: by that time, many European countries were rearming and had already placed orders taxing <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>capacity</b> of munitions plants, hindering Dutch efforts at procurement. [...] A second factor was continued economic pressure, as Defense Minister Adriaan Dijxhoorn refused to authorize funds for modernizing both main Dutch lines of defense against attack from the east, the Waterline and the Grebbeline. [...] The failure of General Izaak H. Reijnders, leader of the Dutch General Staff, to obtain more funding for these lines led to his replacement on February 6, 1940 by General Henri Winkelman, who opted to concentrate on modernizing the Grebbeline, with its largely wooden bunkers, because German artillery brought up as deep within the country as the Waterline would be within range of Amsterdam. [...] Modernization of the Grebbeline, however, would not be complete or effective {{by the time of}} the invasion, in part because the government balked at the expense of clearing forests and houses blocking lines of sight from many of the fortifications.|$|E
2500|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{problems on the}} roadways, as with elsewhere in Southern California, {{is the result of}} the demand for driving exceeding <b>the</b> <b>available</b> <b>capacity,</b> especially on area freeways. Many of the existing freeways were completed in the late 1970s, with the exception of the segment of the Foothill Freeway, State Route 210 (SR 210) between San Dimas and San Bernardino completed in July 2007. New freeways or highways [...] "fix-ups" [...] are being planned, such as the expansion of the length of the 215 freeway around Inland Center Mall. However, other problems exist, one being the jobs vs. housing imbalance. The Inland Empire population grew as a result of affordable housing, at least relative to the rest of Southern California. But most of the higher paying jobs are located in Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties. Thus, many workers must drive daily from the Inland Empire to their jobs in these counties -sometimes up to two hours each direction, and even longer if by public transportation. As the population increases, the problem is most certainly going to get worse. Forbes magazine recently ranked the area first in its list of most unhealthy commutes in the United States, beating out every other metropolitan area in the country, as Inland area drivers breathe the unhealthiest air and have the highest rate of fatal auto accidents per capita.|$|E
