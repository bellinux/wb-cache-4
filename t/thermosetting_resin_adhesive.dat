50|$|In {{the family}} of dialkyl phosphinic acid salts, {{aluminium}} diethyl phosphinate {{has been found to}} be an excellent flame retardant for use in engineering plastics such as polyamides, polyesters, thermosets and elastomers. It was developed by Hoechst, later by Clariant chemicals and Ticona.In 2004 and 2012, Clariant chemicals opened its first and second commercial production lines respectively in Huerth-Knapsack near Cologne.Aluminium diethyl phosphinate acts as a flame retardant in the condensed phase in contributing to charring of the polymer matrix and thus protecting the substrate against heat and oxygen attack. In parallel it acts in the gas phase by radical reactions removing from the combustion zone the high energy radicals H. and OH., which determine flame propagation and heat release.The phosphinate partly vaporises and partly decomposes to volatile diethyl phosphinic acid and an aluminium phosphate residue, which acts as a barrier for fuel and heat transport.Aluminium diethyl phosphinate is used as a halogen-free flame retardant for polyamides, polyesters, <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> (e.g. epoxies) in electrical engineering and electronics (E&E) applications for switches, plugs, PC fans, and structural and housing components. Smartphones, washing machines, and airplane parts, among others, contain the product. Other applications include <b>thermosetting</b> <b>resins</b> and <b>adhesives</b> as well as cable sheaths and insulation made from thermoplastic elastomers. Aluminium diethyl phosphinate can give these plastics flame retardant properties that are otherwise only achievable with expensive high-performance plastics, which are less easy to work with. Aluminium diethyl phosphinate is often used in combination with other halogen-free flame retardant additives like melamine polyphosphate or melamine cyanurate.|$|R

40|$|In {{our efforts}} {{to create a more}} {{sustainable}} society, several researchers have tried to prepare composites from renewable materials in recent years. The use of natural fibres for reinforcement of composites has been relatively well studied. To date, most studies of natural fibre-reinforced composites have either involved the use of conventional <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> or thermoplastic biopolymers. While there are currently several thermoplastic polymers on the market that are produced from renewable resources, thermosets are inevitably produced from petroleum resources. The development of biobased <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> is therefore of considerable importance. Such resins could be used in future for composite applications, for coating applications or in adhesives. This thesis describes the development of biobased <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> for composite applications. <b>Thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> were synthesised from both epoxidised soybean oils as well as from lactic acid. These resins have been characterised neat as well as together with various reinforcements. The main objective has been to study these biobased resins together with natural fibres for reinforcement, though to some extent nano-reinforcements and glass fibres have also been used as reinforcements. Natural fibre-reinforced composites were prepared from several different biobased <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins.</b> Resins based on soybean oil as well as a resin based on lactic acid were evaluated. The soybean resins were prepared by introducing acrylate or methacrylate groups into the molecules of soybean oil. The second type of <b>thermoset</b> <b>resin</b> used was based on lactic acid. This resin consists of star-shaped methacrylated oligomers of lactic acid. Natural fibres were impregnated by several impregnation techniques. Composites were prepared from the biobased resins together with various natural fibres, such as flax and hemp fibres. The resulting composites were evaluated by tensile testing, flexural testing, impact testing, DMTA and SEM. The results show that composites prepared from biobased resin have relatively good mechanical properties and can be used for indoor applications such as furniture and construction elements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} method to improve the impact damage {{tolerance}} of <b>thermoset</b> <b>resin</b> matrix composites by exploiting thermoplastic material impact resistance properties. Two configurations of thermoplastic/thermoset multilayer composites are considered: (a) thermoplastic material is used on sample surface as shock absorber and (b) thermoplastic film is inserted in between thermoset layers to act as interlayer. We aim at increasing adhesion strength between thermoplastic and <b>thermoset</b> <b>resin</b> matrix. We show that mode I critical strain energy release rate, determined by the wedge double cantilever beam fracture test, increases significantly when a third amorphous polymer interlayer compatible with both thermoplastic and <b>thermoset</b> <b>resin</b> is inserted. The analysis of scanning electron microscope fracture surfaces helps us to clarify the adhesion mechanism involved. The high adhesion between thermoplastic and <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> obtained with this method, together with the ability of thermoplastics to dissipate the impact damage in the first plies ensure the reliability of this stacked configuration.

40|$|A new {{analytical}} model for chemoviscosity variation during cure of <b>thermosetting</b> <b>resins</b> was developed. This model is derived by modifying the widely used WLF (Williams-Landel-Ferry) Theory in polymer rheology. Major assumptions involved {{are that the}} rate of reaction is diffusion controlled and is linearly inversely proportional to the viscosity of the medium over the entire cure cycle. The resultant first order nonlinear differential equation is solved numerically, and the model predictions compare favorably with experimental data of EPON 828 /Agent U obtained on a Rheometrics System 4 Rheometer. The model describes chemoviscosity up to a range of six orders of magnitude under isothermal curing conditions. The extremely non-linear chemoviscosity profile for a dynamic heating cure cycle is predicted as well. The model is also shown to predict changes of glass transition temperature for the <b>thermosetting</b> <b>resin</b> during cure.

50|$|In {{all cases}} the {{anisotropic}} material, for example, a <b>thermosetting</b> <b>resin</b> containing conductive particles, is first deposited {{on the base}} substrate. This may be done using a lamination process for ACF, or either a dispense or printing process for ACP. The device or secondary substrate is then placed in position over the base substrate and {{the two sides are}} pressed together to mount the secondary substrate or device to the base substrate. In many cases this mounting process is done with no heat or a minimal amount of heat that is just sufficient to cause the anisotropic material to become slightly tacky. In the case of using a <b>thermosetting</b> <b>resin</b> containing conductive particles, the particles are trapped between prominent points, such as electrodes, between the substrate and the component, thereby creating an electrical connection therebetween. Other particles are insulated by the <b>thermosetting</b> <b>resin.</b> In some cases this mounting step is skipped and the two sides go directly to the bonding portion of the process.
