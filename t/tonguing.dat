25|$|Webern's {{compositions}} are concise, distilled, and select; just thirty-one of his compositions {{were published}} in his lifetime, and when Pierre Boulez later oversaw a project to record all of his compositions, including some of those without opus numbers, the results fit on just six CDs. Although Webern's music changed over time, {{as is often the}} case over a long career, it is typified by very spartan textures, in which every note can be clearly heard; carefully chosen timbres, often resulting in very detailed instructions to the performers and use of extended instrumental techniques (flutter <b>tonguing,</b> col legno, and so on); wide-ranging melodic lines, often with leaps greater than an octave; and brevity: the Six Bagatelles for string quartet (1913), for instance, last about three minutes in total.|$|E
500|$|Fever is {{considered}} to be a prominent example of Minogue's constant [...] "reinventions". The image she adopted during this period was described by Baker as [...] "slick, minimalist and postmodern", and it was seen as a step forward from the [...] "camp-infused" [...] tone of Light Years. Larissa Dubecki from The Age used the term [...] "nu-disco diva" [...] to describe Minogue during this period. Andy Battaglia from The A.V. Club opined that Minogue's public image and her persona in her music videos [...] "presented herself as a mechanical muse whose every gesture snapped and locked into place with the sound of a vacuum seal". He further remarked that the singer's [...] "hygienic coo summoned a cool sort of cyborg soul, and her videos showed her gliding through sleek futurescapes, <b>tonguing</b> the sweet-and-sour tang of a techno kiss". Adrien Begrand from PopMatters felt that the simplicity of the album made it a [...] "classy piece of work" [...] and commented that Minogue's experience and choice of collaborators resulted in [...] "the thirtysomething Minogue upstaging soulless, brainless music by younger American pop tarts like Britney [...] and Christina [...] ". Robbie Daw from Idolator pointed out that Britney Spear's recording of her 2004 hit [...] "Toxic", Madonna's comeback album Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), Paris Hilton's musical debut Paris (2006), and radio stations' shift towards playing [...] "more groove-oriented sounds" [...] all followed the release of Fever, although he admitted that [...] "we have no way of knowing whether Kylie Minogue's eighth studio album was directly responsible for these pop happenings". Chris True from AllMusic, in his biography of Minogue, commented that the release of the album and lead single [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] cemented her position as an international music icon, saying [...] "Her place in pop music history would be consolidated in 2001, and she would be reintroduced to America after more than a decade as well".|$|E

2500|$|Like {{the trumpet}} {{and all other}} modern brass wind instruments, the cornet makes a sound when the player vibrates ("buzzes") the lips in the mouthpiece, {{creating}} a vibrating column of air in the tubing. The frequency of the air column's vibration can be modified by changing the lip tension and aperture or [...] "embouchure", and by altering the tongue position to change {{the shape of the}} oral cavity, thereby increasing or decreasing the speed of the airstream. In addition, the column of air can be lengthened by engaging one or more valves, thus lowering the pitch. Double and triple <b>tonguing</b> are also possible.|$|E

William Stewart, a Seattle researcher, has proposed that this alternation simulates the exchange of riffs between the wind and brass sections that is common in big bands. Sarah Vaughan, on the other hand, tends to use the fricative consonant [...] "sh" [...] along with the low, back of the mouth [...] "ah" [...] vowel.

40|$|Objective: In this study, optical data on {{color of}} <b>tongue</b> tips were {{collected}} by using a visible reflection spectrum system. Quantitative method of <b>tongue</b> inspection and classification of <b>tongue</b> states including pale, pale red, red and crimson manifestations were investigated. Methods: Chromaticity coordinates of the <b>tongue</b> tips from 98 subjects were calculated {{on the basis of}} the visible reflection spectrum. The <b>tongue</b> color was quantified and classified by the visible reflection spectrum in the range from 590 nm to 780 nm, based on the higher red-band energy distribution on the <b>tongue</b> tip color. Results: It was found that comparison and analysis of <b>tongue</b> tip color from different samples would be well-suited after spectrum vector normalization, and the difference of <b>tongue</b> tip color between different samples could be observed easily when the <b>tongue</b> tip optical data were sited in CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram. The <b>tongue</b> tip colors were analyzed quantitatively and classified by the spectral energy intensity at the wavelength of 670 nm and (or) spectral energy ratio of red bank from 590 nm to 780 nm. The results of classification showed that there was sound corresponding accuracy with the clinical diagnosis of pale <b>tongue,</b> pale red <b>tongue,</b> red <b>tongue</b> and crimson <b>tongue.</b> Conclusion: In this study, based on the collection of the information data on <b>tongue</b> tip characteristics with the visible spectrum from 380 nm to 780 nm, the quantitative analysis of <b>tongue</b> inspection for pale <b>tongue,</b> pale red <b>tongue,</b> red <b>tongue</b> and crimson <b>tongue</b> was established.

Methods: <b>Tongue</b> cleaning was performed using an Oral B 30 (Procter&Gamble, São Paulo, Brasil) toothbrush; a Saude Bucal (Odomed, São Paulo, Brasil) <b>tongue</b> scraper, and a new <b>tongue</b> cleaning technique, consisting of a <b>tongue</b> cleaner with bristles and a scraping edge and a Halitus® (Halitus, Campinas, Brasil) <b>tongue</b> cleaning spray solution. The study design used 15 healthy volunteers who were submitted to each of the <b>tongue</b> cleaning techniques, once every 21 days. The volunteers were instructed to abstain from any procedure to clean their <b>tongues,</b> for 48 hours before the application of each technique. At each scheduled time, a dental professional performed a single standardized <b>tongue</b> cleaning procedure using one of the cleaning methods, and inserted the removed <b>tongue</b> coating into a test tube. Results: The results were obtained by weighing the tube test with <b>tongue</b> coating after the cleaning procedure (final weight) deducting the weight of the empty tube test (initial weight). The findings showed that the new <b>tongue</b> cleaning technique (combination of a <b>tongue</b> cleaner with brush and scraper plus a <b>tongue</b> cleaning spray solution) was statistically superior in removing <b>tongue</b> coating when compared with the <b>tongue</b> scraper or toothbrush, probably due to the technique and materials used.
