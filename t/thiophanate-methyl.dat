5000|$|Botryosphaeria corticola [...] can {{be managed}} in high value trees, {{but there is no}} current {{management}} for forest trees. Carbendazim and <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> have shown to prevent infection in cork oak in Europe, where it is applied after cork has been harvested. Sanitation is the most common management technique for this disease. [...] Branches with diseased tissue are pruned off, and heavily infected trees are removed. This prevents future infections by limiting the amount of spores in the area.|$|E
50|$|Chemical control Fungicides {{that may}} be used to {{effectively}} control N. galligena are limited. Infection by N. galligena often occurs through wounds in the autumn and spring-summer period, therefore, it is recommended that fungicides be applied at these times. The application of fungicides will prevent or decrease the sporulation of existing cankers, which in turn decreases the inoculum available to spread the pathogen. Fungicides may also protect trees from N. galligena through a fungitoxic deposit over favorable infection sites. A mixture of carbendazim and a scab fungicide, such as dithianon, is the suggested treatment in areas with a severe canker problem. In areas with a reduced risk of canker, it is recommended that a scab fungicide be applied in the spring-summer and copper oxychloride applied at leaf-fall to avoid infection. Although scab fungicides are commonly used for managing apple scab, cankers are also controlled when applied at the correct time. <b>Thiophanate-methyl</b> is another fungicide that is highly effective because it protects trees against the pathogen and suppresses sporulation of already infected plants. However, the application of <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> is limited due to its harm on organisms such as mites.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{phase-out}} of vinclozolin, {{farmers are}} faced with fewer options to control gray and white mold. The New York State Agricultural Experiment Station has carried out efficacy trials for gray and white mold. Research has showed potential alternatives to vinclozolin. Trifloxystrobin (Flint), iprodione (Rovral), and cyprodinil plus fludioxonil (Switch) control gray mold. <b>Thiophanate-methyl</b> (Topsin M) was as effective as vinclozolin in controlling white molds. Switch was the most promising alternative to vinclozolin for controlling both gray and white mold on pods and for increasing marketable yield.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{control is}} an option for {{practitioners}} who need to maintain high quality, visually pleasing turfgrass. There are many fungicides labeled for control of Sclerotinia homoeocarpa, including benzimidazoles, carboxamides, nitriles, dicarboxamides, and demethylation inhibitors (DMIs). Some common fungicides used include chlorothalonil (nitrile), propiconazole (DMI), boscalid (carboxamide), <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> (benzamidazole), and iprodione (dicarboxamide). Preventative fungicide programs should be implemented when conditions are favorable for disease development (i.e., in the Spring when nighttime temperatures reach 50 F). While preventative applications are most effective, curative applications are also successful, but often require high rates and short application intervals.|$|E
5000|$|Fungicides, such as <b>thiophanate-methyl,</b> {{are used}} to inhibit the ability of D. earliana to access the host. Therefore, it {{prevents}} {{the growth of the}} fungus on the strawberry leaves. These fungicides are applied a variety of ways, at intervals ranging from one to two weeks when the strawberry plants are in early bloom. The number of applications depends on the extent of the disease the previous year as well as the water conditions during application. An increase in the wetness of the environment would lead to an increase in the amount of applications of the fungicide ...|$|E
5000|$|If {{severe enough}} or on high valued turf (ex. golf greens) summer patch can be {{controlled}} {{with the use of}} fungicides. The application of fungicides is usually done on a curative basis. Apply fungicides at the very first sign of Brown patch symptoms. In traditionally bad areas that cause severe damage to the turf a preventative fungicide application will work best. [...] Fungicides should be applied according to the instructions on the label, the application of fungicides containing <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> and/or chlorothalonil in weather above 90°F have been proven ineffective against Rhizoctonia zeae. Minimize the cost of applying fungicides by selecting fungicdes that will work {{on a wide range of}} turfgrass diseases at the same time.|$|E
50|$|Typhula blight {{and snow}} molds can be {{controlled}} by fungicide applications. However, {{the timing of the}} application is crucial. This chemical treatment {{needs to be done in}} late fall before the first snow fall. If the application is made too soon a second follow up treatment may be needed. Possible chemical applications include: a demethylation inhibitor, or DMI, with a chlorothalonil product, a DMI with a <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> product, or an Iprodione with a chlorothalonil product. Typhula blight can also be controlled culturally. One method would be to plant a less susceptible turfgrass. Bentgrass and annual bluegrass are the two most susceptible turfgrasses to Typhula blight. Another method is to limit heavy late season fertilizer applications. Finally, cutting the grass until dormancy to keep the grass height down can help.|$|E
50|$|Purple-bordered {{leaf spot}} is {{primarily}} cosmetic, especially on mature or vigorous trees. However, the disease can defoliate trees {{early in the}} growing season. Although they often are able to grow new leaves within a few weeks, this strains the tree, so {{it is important to}} water and (if desired) fertilize, so the tree has the nutrients it needs to overcome this stress. If the purple-bordered leaf spot is persistent for several years or adversely affecting a young tree, a fungicide containing copper, neem oil, sulfur, chlorothalonil or <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> can help manage the fungus. The best form of management is planting resistant strains (purple-bordered leaf spot most heavily infects Amur, Japanese, red, silver and sugar maples). Additionally, it is important to remove, burn or bury leaf litter from infected trees in the fall or early spring, as this is where the spores overwinter.|$|E
30|$|Naturally infested {{soil with}} F. solani and F. oxysporum at El-Kantar El-Khairiya, Kalubeiya Governorate, Egypt, {{was chosen for}} {{estimating}} the efficiency of soil treatment with Tricoderma spp. combined with seed coating with <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> for controlling pre- and post-emergence damping-off and root rot/wilt of bean plants under field conditions. Field experiments were conducted during tow growth season of 2015 and 2016. The experiments were conducted with a completely randomized design (CRD) with eight treatments (T. harzianum + <b>thiophanate-methyl,</b> T. viride + <b>thiophanate-methyl,</b> T. virens + <b>thiophanate-methyl,</b> T. harzianum, T. viride, T. virens, <b>thiophanate-methyl,</b> and control) each with four experimental units. Experimental unit consisted of four rows. The dimensions of each row were 2 [*]m in length, 50 [*]cm in length, and 30 [*]cm in height. The inoculum of each Tricoderma spp., freshly prepared, was incorporated to the soil {{at the rate of}} 300 [*]g formulation/m length of the row. Therefore, a cavity of 15 [*]cm in depth was made on the surface of each row. Then the inoculum was added to this cavity and then recovered with the soil and immediately irrigated. One week after incorporation, <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> coated and non-coated bean seeds were sown in holes at the rate of two seeds per hole. Irrigation and fertilization were conducted as generally recommended for bean production regimes.|$|E
40|$|A {{correlation}} {{was found between}} the formation of benzimidazol‐ 2 ‐ylcarbamate esters from the thiophanate fungicides [thiophanate, <b>thiophanate‐methyl</b> and 2 ‐(3 ‐methoxycarbonylthioureido) aniline] and the fungitoxie activity of these fungicides. Fungitoxic activity of the thiophanates is increased by ageing in aqueous media while fungitoxicity as well as conversion rate decrease at lower pH. It is concluded {{that it is not the}} thiophanates themselves but the corresponding benzimidazol‐ 2 ‐ylcarbamate esters that are responsible for the fungitoxic effect. Hence <b>thiophanate‐methyl,</b> like benomyl, is a precursor of the fungitoxic agent methyl benzimidazol‐ 2 ‐ylcarbamate (MBC). Indications were obtained that fungal metabolic activity can increase the rate of conversion of <b>thiophanate‐methyl</b> into MBC...|$|E

Only 1. 5 % of isolates exhibited a differential reaction to the two fungicides. No resistance to benomyl and <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> were detected in isolates collected from banana plantations in the Tamri location which has no known history of benzimidazole use. The mean effective concentrations that reduced growth by 50 % (EC 50) for resistant-isolates of V. theobromae were between 80 and 97 μg mL - 1 for benomyl and between 194 to 233 μg mL - 1 for <b>thiophanate-methyl.</b> In contrast, wild-type isolates exhibited mean EC 50 values for benomyl and <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> of 0. 47 and 0. 91 μg mL - 1, respectively. All 305 isolates from the four locations sampled {{in this study were}} sensitive in vitro to chlorothalonil at 10 μg mL - 1. Conidial germination of sensitive-isolates collected from banana plantations never exposed to benzimidazole fungicides were completely inhibited by 1000 μg mL - 1 of benomyl or <b>thiophanate-methyl.</b> However, conidial germination of resistant-isolates was not affected by both fungicides tested at 1000 μg mL - 1...|$|E
40|$|The maximum {{allowable}} dose level (MADL) for <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> exposure by the oral route is 600 micrograms/day (µg/day). This value was derived as described below, based upon a chronic study in rats (TINS 1993). Background This report describes the derivation of a MADL for <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> (CAS No. 23564 - 05 - 8). <b>Thiophanate-methyl</b> is a fungicide registered and used in California. It was listed under Proposition 65 (the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986) as known to the State to cause reproductive toxicity (male and female reproductive toxicity), effective May 18, 1999. The Proposition 65 listing of <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> was based on formal identification by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA) of <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> as causing reproductive toxicity (U. S. EPA 1994 a, 1994 b). The U. S. EPA is an authoritative body under Proposition 65 for identification of chemicals as causing reproductive toxicity (Title 22, California Code of Regulations, § 12306 (l)). Procedures {{for the development of}} Proposition 65 MADLs are provided in regulations (Title 22, Cal. Code of Regs. § 12801 and 12803). Exposure at a level 1, 000 times greater than the MADL is expected to have no observable effect. As defined in regulations, a MADL is derived from a No Observable Effect Level (NOEL) based on the most sensitive study deemed to be of sufficient quality (Title 22, Cal.

Pepper plants were inoculated with selected V. dahliae isolate in the stage of more than nine fully developed leaves on primary stem. The tested fungicides and SWC were applied three days before inoculation of pepper plants. Carbendazim was the most efficient fungicide among tested substances (69. 64 %). SWC {{proved to be more}} effective when applied at 1. 0 % concentarion (41. 96 %). The use of <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> provided good Verticillium wilt control in pepper (60. 71 %).

30|$|In {{the present}} study, dry bean seeds coated with <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> {{combined}} with Trichoderma spp. soil treatment reduced damping-off and root rot/wilt incidence more than using {{any of them}} individually. Data also reveal that Trichoderma spp. were more effective to reduce damping-off and root rot/wilt than <b>thiophanate-methyl.</b> On the other hand, the combination of <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> + T. virens, <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> + T. harzianum, and <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> + T. viride recorded almost the same protection against {{to any of the}} tested fungi. It was suggested that the addition of Trichoderma spp. to the soil before sowing reduced the inoculums of the pathogens and bean seeds coated with <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> protect them from invasion by such pathogens. In the previous study, we found that Trichoderma spp. were highly compatible with <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> in vitro tests (Elshahawya et al. 2016). Also, the combined treatment of Trichoderma spp. and <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> highly reduced the growth of F. solani and F. oxysporum than individual treatment (Elshahawya et al. 2016). Hefnawy et al. (2014) found that T. harzianum and T. koningii combined with low dose of Rizolex T 50 % increased the inhibition percentages of pathogenic fungi and may be beneficial in controlling soil-borne fungi. Bhale and Rajkonda (2015) reported that T. viride, T. harzianum, T. koningii, and T. virens were compatible to fungicides viz., Mancozeb and Captan at lower concentrations. Also, Wedajo (2015) reported that by increasing the fungicide concentrations to 400 [*]ppm (sancozeb) and 600 [*]ppm (curzate), T. harzianum and T. viride tolerate the fungicides 50 % and slightly incompatible at higher concentrations of 800 and 1000 [*]ppm, and completely inhibited beyond 1000 [*]ppm, compared to the control for both fungicides. The obtained results are in agreement with those obtained by many workers. Chaparro et al. (2011) reported that Trichoderma spp. were able to survive in soils with remnants of fungicide molecules such as fungicides of Captan, thiabendazol, and the mixture Captan-Carboxin. Mahmood et al. (2015) reported that <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> combined with Trichoderma spp. gave adequate disease control of bean seedlings and can protecting bean seedling in the field. The use of Trichoderma spp. combined with some commercial fungicides was applied by many workers to obtain additive effects against soil-borne pathogens. Howell et al. (1997) reported that cotton seeds treated with T. virens plus metalaxyl gave seedling stands significantly greater than the untreated seeds as well as seeds treated with fungicide only. Wang et al. (2005) suggested that Trichoderma combined with fludioxonil could be applied into a disease management program for controlling of Fusarium root rot in coneflower. Howell (2007) indicated that Trichoderma spp. plus chloroneb produce the optimum combination treatment for damping-off control of cotton, followed by T. virens plus chloroneb plus metalaxyl. Khalequzzaman (2016) showed that seed treatment with Provax 200 (2.5 [*]g/kg seed), followed by seed treatment with T. harzianum compost (1 : 5) gave the lowest foot and root rot disease incidence of lentil than the untreated control.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} in vitro {{sensitivity}} of eight isolates of the Fusarium graminearum to the fungicides difenoconazole, prothioconazole and <b>thiophanate-methyl,</b> was undertaken. The isolates were isolated from infected wheat heads collected from 8 different localities in Serbiaover the period 2005 - 2006. Among the tested isolates ZE (RF= 11. 34), RU (RF= 5. 98) and AR (RF= 5. 08) isolates showed moderate resistance to difenoconazole. The EC 50 values of this isolates were 19. 16, 10. 09, and 8. 59 mg l- 1, respectively. The isolates ZE (RF= 5. 38) and RU(RF= 4. 43) also showed the moderate resistance to prothoconazole. The EC 50 values were 9. 69 and 7. 97 mg l- 1, respectively. All the solates tested {{were the least}} sensitive to <b>thiophanate-methyl.</b> The EC 50 values were in range of 12. 1 to 64. 03 mg l- 1. The highest resistancefactor was found for the isolates ZE (RF= 5. 29) ...|$|E

This study evaluated herbicides, acaricide, insecticides and fungicides in water and sediment carried-out from Lageado Tacongava hydrographic basin, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. For analysis, a QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe), and/or SPE (Solid-Phase Extraction) using HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) with MS (Mass Detector) was optimized. As result, the Linearity R 2 > 0. 99; Recuperation between 78 a 117 %; and RSD < 20 % for the 70 compounds simultaneously analyzed. The Acetamiprid, Azoxystrobin, Bendiocarb, Fenamidone, metribuzin, Pendimethalin, pyridaben, <b>Thiophanate-methyl</b> and Truflumizole found in water, and Acetamiprid, Azoxystrobin, Bendiocarb, boscalid and <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> in sediment, at concentrations from 0. 1 µg kg- 1 to 39. 6 µg kg- 1. Standard of pesticide residues in water and sediment studies are needed to evaluate such contamination. Regional samplings standard, as was done here, will be useful in a future water resources contamination mapping...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} several cases of cankers caused by Phoma exigua on ash tree {{seedlings}} {{have been reported}} in Belgian nurseries, leading to a total loss of the affected crops. Similar symptoms have been observed on ash tree seedlings elsewhere in Europe, notably in France and in Great Britain, but the pathogenicity was never established. Inoculation and re-isolation tests were therefore undertaken and demonstrated the phytopathogenic character of P. exigua on ash. Moreover the effectiveness of three fungicides (<b>thiophanate-methyl,</b> trifloxystrobin, vinclozolin) against stem canker of ash tree seedlings was studied. In vitro tests were conducted to evaluate the ability of these fungicides to inhibit mycelium growth and spore germination. The extent to which they reduced the symptoms was estimated in a field trial. The results of this study allowed to get by the Belgian proper authorities the use extension of <b>thiophanate-methyl</b> for the control of canker caused by P. exigua in forest nurseries...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. {{gladioli}} and F. oxysporum f. sp. lilii cause corm rot and yellowing of gladiolus and lilies respectively. Resistance among isolates {{of these}} two pathogens to two benzimidazole (methyl benzimidazole carbamate: MBC) fungicides, benomyl and thiabendazole, has been identified. However, sensitivity to other benzimidazole fungicides among isolates of F. oxysporum f. sp. gladioli and F. oxysporum f. sp. lilii remains unclear. Sensitivity among isolates {{of these two}} pathogens to benomyl, <b>thiophanate-methyl,</b> carbendazim and thiabendazole were evaluated in this study. Results showed that among six F. oxysporum f. sp. gladioli isolates, one was highly resistant, four were moderately resistant and one was highly sensitive to benomyl, five were highly resistant to <b>thiophanate-methyl,</b> four were sensitive and one was highly sensitive to carbendazim and all six isolates were sensitive to thiabendazole. Among the 13 F. oxysporum f. sp. lilii isolates tested, three were moderately resistant and 10 were highly sensitive to benomyl, and five were highly resistant, three were moderately resistant and five were sensitive to <b>thiophanate-methyl.</b> While all isolates were highly sensitive or sensitive to carbendazim and thiabendazole. These results strongly suggest that the mode of fungicide resistance in these two pathogens varies {{among members of the}} benzimidazole fungicide group and that cross resistance does not always occur. Sequence analysis of the partially amplified beta-tubulin gene indicated that mutation in codons 198 and 200 had not occurred in the benzimidazole resistant isolates. It was concluded that resistance found in Taiwan isolates of F. oxysporum f. sp. gladioli and F. oxysporum f. sp. lilii to these fungicides may be due to some other mechanism...|$|E
