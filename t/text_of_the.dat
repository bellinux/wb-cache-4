5|$|By early July 1724 Bach {{was more}} than a month into his second year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. BWV10 is the fifth of 40 chorale cantatas he started that year. The outer {{movements}} of the cantata are set for mixed choir and an orchestra consisting of trumpet, two oboes, strings and continuo. Luther's translation of Luke1:46–48 is the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first movement. The canticle's doxology is the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> last movement. The five middle movements are a succession of arias and recitatives, with, between the fourth and sixth movement, a duet for alto and tenor. Soprano and bass each have one aria, and the two recitatives are sung by the tenor. The <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arias and recitatives is paraphrased and expanded from Luke1:49–53 and 55. The <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duet is Luther's translation of Luke1:54. The melody associated with Luther's German Magnificat appears in movements 1, 5 and 7.|$|E

5|$|Textual {{critics have}} had a {{challenging}} task in classifying the Codex, the exact relationship to other known texts and families is still disputed. The Greek <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> codex is of mixed text-types. It is {{a representative of the}} Byzantine text-type in the Gospels - the oldest examples of the type - {{and the rest of the}} New Testament books are of the Alexandrian text-type, with some Western readings. Kurt Aland placed it in Category III in the Gospels, and in Category I in rest of the books of the New Testament. The Byzantine <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gospels has a number of Alexandrian features, it has some affinities to the textual Family Π. Soden associated the <b>text</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gospels with Family Π, though it is not a pure member of this family. According to Streeter, it is the earliest Greek manuscript which gives us approximately the text of Lucian the Martyr, but a small proportion of the readings seem to be earlier.|$|E
