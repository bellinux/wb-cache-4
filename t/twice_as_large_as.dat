5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, {{the human brain}} is almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> that of a bottlenose dolphin, and three times as large {{as that of a}} chimpanzee. However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small animals have high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E
5|$|The {{attendance}} for {{the event}} was 6,500 fans, who paid a total of $80,000 in admission. This is the lowest attendance figure for a King of the Ring event. The attendance the following year was almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>large,</b> <b>as</b> 12,000 fans attended King of the Ring 1994. The PPV buyrate was 1.1, which was the highest buyrate in King of the Ring history until the 1999 event.|$|E
30|$|The {{efficacy}} of sampling and isolation of airborne wood-decay fungi was firstly checked. As mentioned previously, we identified 11 taxa from 110 disks, despite using 201 disks for the sampling. Presumably, {{part of the}} important fungi may be lost during the subculturing processes on a PDA medium containing biocides. To check this hypothesis, mass losses of the Japanese cedar disks were compared between the disks from which the identified taxa were selected and those not selected. The mean mass loss of the disks from which the taxa were identified was about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>larger</b> <b>as</b> that of the disks from which no taxa were isolated. Statistical analysis using T test revealed {{a significant difference between}} these two groups. In conclusion, important taxa that influence decay risk can be successfully identified in this experimental procedure even though some unimportant fungi might be missed during the subculturing processes.|$|R

5|$|The bobcat (Lynx rufus) is a North American {{cat that}} {{appeared}} during the Irvingtonian stage of around 1.8 million years ago (AEO). Containing 12 recognized subspecies, it ranges from southern Canada to central Mexico, including most of the contiguous United States. The bobcat is an adaptable predator that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edge, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but populations are vulnerable to local extinction ("extirpation") by coyotes and domestic animals. With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the midsized Lynx genus. It is smaller on average than the Canada lynx, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> the domestic cat. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.|$|E

40|$|Since 1994, the European Community Household Panel {{provides}} information on changes in the French households income and on household situation vis-Ã -vis the labour market month after month. Using the five available waves, this paper investigates the impact of some family events {{and changes in the}} job market situation on poverty exits and entries. The analysis focuses on working age households. Poor households are defined as those with a living standard lower than 60 % of the median equivalent income. Five years poverty incidence is found to be 31 %, that is <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>larger</b> <b>as</b> one year incidence. One third of poor households exit from poverty in the year after while 6 % of non-poor fall into. Labour income has a major contribution to changes in living standard level. An econometric estimation of poverty flows leads to the following results: Changes in employment situations {{have a major impact on}} poverty entries and exits. Probability of poverty exit increases with the number of working months while the risk of entering poverty increases when the number of working months decreases. For couples, child births increase the risk of poverty entry, but do not modify the probability of poverty exit. After a child departure the household is more likely to exit poverty, but the risk of poverty entry is not significantly affected. A high education level protects against poverty entry, but does not increase the chances of living poverty. Low Income Dynamics, Poverty, Probit Model, Panel...|$|R

5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E
5|$|Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure {{game with}} stealth {{elements}} and played from a third-person perspective as protagonist Marcus Holloway, a young hacker, the game features an open world environment {{set in a}} fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>large</b> <b>as</b> the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. The Bay Area consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley, {{all of which have}} different characteristics and aesthetics. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The players can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. Players can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, players can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Players can also complete the game through hacking alone. When players commit too many crimes, the police officers will become alerted and will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Players can choose their upgrades in accordance with their own playstyle.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the Swedish 1 -m Solar Telescope (SST) on La Palma which has <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>large</b> aperture <b>as</b> the previous SVST. The un-obscured optics {{consists of a}} singlet lens used as vacuum window and secondary optics. The secondary optics uses a field mirror to re-image the pupil on a 25 cm corrector which provides a perfectly achromatic image, compensated also for atmospheric dispersion. The adaptive optics system consists of a low-order bimorph modal mirror with 37 electrodes, allowing near-diffraction-limited imaging a reasonable fraction of the observing time on La Palma. The new telescope became operational on 21 May 2002 and has quickly proven {{to be the most}} highly resolving solar telescope ever built. In this paper, we describe its design, the instrumentation in use or planned for this telescope and present first results based on observations made in May-July 2002...|$|R
30|$|For {{households}} without children, {{only the}} intercepts are significant, which {{turns out to}} be the case for both men and women. On the other hand, for households with children, several significant effects are found. An interesting result is related to the estimated effect of the number of children aged 1 â 5 years. An increase in the number of young children in the household reduces the household utility of hours of work for both men and women; in terms of household utility, this effect is <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>large</b> for women <b>as</b> it is for men.|$|R

30|$|Moreover, SYN-MAC offers {{relatively}} constant delays {{with different}} packet sizes and approaches G-McMAC {{when we get}} closer to the stability point of G-McMAC. However, with small packets the difference is remarkable and SYN-MAC introduces over <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>large</b> delays <b>as</b> G-McMAC. Furthermore, performance of MMAC is significantly worse already with small packet sizes and access delay increases linearly when the packet size grows. As the packet size is increased, delay of MMAC grows constantly and the difference compared with other protocols enhances. In this case, the number of channels does not have any impact on the delay of MMAC since Tatim â¤ 2 Ï. As the results imply, delay of MMAC is heavily affected by the chosen packet size whereas G-McMAC and SYN-MAC offer relatively constant delays with different packet sizes. To summarize, G-McMAC achieves the best performance in general while SYN-MAC performs better with large packet sizes since it does not suffer from stability problems as quickly.|$|R
