50|$|Mayonnaise is an oil {{in water}} {{emulsion}} which is stable {{at room temperature}} because it reaches phase equilibrium. At freezing temperatures, the structures inside of mayonnaise undergo crystallization depending on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>emulsion.</b> Butter is a water in oil emulsion with the water phase having a higher freezing point than oil.

When the butter is needed, one only needs to take it out of the freezer and thaw it for the general properties of butter return as the water droplets melt in their respective locations. Mayonnaise is different; when oil in water emulsions are frozen, the continuous phase is water which freezes and allows the oil droplets to flocculate.

5000|$|Emulsion {{polymerization}} {{is a type}} {{of radical}} polymerization that usually starts with an emulsion incorporating water, monomer, and surfactant. The most common <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>emulsion</b> polymerization is an oil-in-water emulsion, in which droplets of monomer (the oil) are emulsified (with surfactants) in a continuous phase of water. Water-soluble polymers, such as certain polyvinyl alcohols or hydroxyethyl celluloses, {{can also be used to}} act as emulsifiers/stabilizers. The name [...] "emulsion polymerization" [...] is a misnomer that arises from a historical misconception. Rather than occurring in emulsion droplets, polymerization takes place in the latex particles that form spontaneously in the first few minutes of the process. These latex particles are typically 100 nm in size, and are made of many individual polymer chains. The particles are stopped from coagulating with each other because each particle is surrounded by the surfactant ('soap'); the charge on the surfactant repels other particles electrostatically. When water-soluble polymers are used as stabilizers instead of soap, the repulsion between particles arises because these water-soluble polymers form a 'hairy layer' around a particle that repels other particles, because pushing particles together would involve compressing these chains.|$|E
5000|$|Macroemulsions are kinetically {{stabilized}} {{mixtures of}} at least two immiscible liquids where one of the liquids has droplets with a diameter greater than 0.1 μm. Macroemulsions scatter light effectively and therefore appear milky, because their droplets are greater than a wavelength of light. [...] They are part of a larger family of emulsions along with microemulsions. As with all emulsions, one phase serves as the dispersing agent. It is often called the continuous or outer phase. The remaining phase(s) are disperse or inner phase(s), because the liquid droplets are finely distributed amongst the larger continuous phase droplets. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>emulsion</b> is thermodynamically unstable, but can be stabilized {{for a period of time}} with applications of kinetic energy. Surfactants (emulsifiers) are used to reduce the interfacial tension between the two layers, and induce macroemulsion stability for a useful amount of time. Emulsion in which the particles of the dispersed phase have diameters from approximately 1 to 100 μm.Note 1: Macro-emulsions comprise large droplets and thus are [...] "unstable" [...] in the sense that the droplets sediment or float, depending on the densities of the dispersed phase and dispersion medium. Separation of the dispersed and continuous phases usually occurs within time periods from a few seconds to a few hours, depending upon the viscosity of the fluid medium and the size and density of the droplets.Note 2: Macro-emulsions usually contain low-molecular-weight or polymeric surfactants that decrease the rates of coalescence of dispersed droplets. Droplets of the dispersed phase may be also stabilized by adsorption of solid particles onto their surface (so-called Pickering stabilization).|$|E

40|$|Entropy generation, {{and hence}} exergy destruction, in {{adiabatic}} flow of unstable and surfactant-stabilized emulsions was investigated experimentally in different diameter pipes. Four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>emulsion</b> systems are investigated covering {{a broad range}} of the dispersed-phase concentration: (a) unstable oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions without surfactant; (b) surfactant-stabilized O/W emulsions; (c) unstable water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions without surfactant; and (d) surfactant-stabilized W/O emulsions. The entropy generation rate per unit pipe length is affected by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> the <b>emulsion</b> as well as its stability. Unstable emulsions without any surfactant present at the interface generate less entropy in the turbulent regime as compared with the surfactant-stabilized <b>emulsions</b> <b>of</b> the same viscosity and density.

The traditional ways <b>of</b> breaking <b>emulsion</b> using heat and chemicals are disadvantageous from both economic and environmental prospective. In this thesis, a new natural demulsifier knowing as “Cocamine MEA” {{in addition to an}} alternative energy potentials of microwave-assisted chemical approach were utilized and investigated in the demulsification <b>of</b> water-in-crude oil <b>emulsion.</b> Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> crude oils were used, namely; crude oils A, and B. The study begun with some characterization studies to provide understanding of fundamental issues such as formation and characterization <b>of</b> the <b>emulsion</b> upon which further development on demulsification process could be achieved. The aim was to evaluate the performance of the new natural demulsifier compare with the existing demulsfiers as well as to obtain an optimized operating conditions of the demulsification process. For the stability performance test, three non-ionic emulsifiers were used, namely; Triton X- 100, Span 80, and Cocamide DEA. Among these emulsifiers, Span 80 and Cocamide DEA permit the highest stability for the prepared emulsion. For the chemical demulsification performance test, six emulsifiers having different properties were utilized, namely: Octylamine, Hexylamine, Dioctylamine, Cocamine MEA, Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 600), and Polyethylene Glycol (PEG 1000). Among these demulsifiers, Octylamine was found to be the best in separating water and oil phases (90 - 100 %) followed by Hexylamine (80 - 90 %) for emulsion based on Span 80 at different phase ratios, respectively. Meanwhile, Cocamine MEA at the dose of 1 vol. % was found to be the best in separating water and oil phases (90 - 100 %) followed by Octylamine and Hexylamine (90 - 100 %) at the dose of 1. 5 vol. % for emulsion based on Cocamide DEA at different phase ratios. However, Dioctylamine, PEG 1000, and PEG 600 promote the monophase separation in separating the <b>emulsion.</b> Optimization <b>of</b> the microwave-assisted chemical demulsification using Face Centered Central Composite Design (FCCCD) under Response Surface Methodology found that Octylamine (1. 5 vol. %) promotes a superior effect on demulsification rate <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>emulsion,</b> the exposure time (0. 5 - 8) minutes and the MW power (270 - 360) watt were the most significant factors at different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>emulsion</b> that consist with lower demulsifier utility, crude oil A emulsions needed higher MW power to separate the two phases.
