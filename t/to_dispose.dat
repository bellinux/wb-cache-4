In September 2000, the United States and the Russian Federation signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement by which each agreed <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of 34tonnes of weapons-grade {{plutonium}}. The U.S. Department of Energy plans <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of 34tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium in the United States {{before the end of}} 2019 by converting the plutonium to a MOX fuel to be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.|$|E
5|$|Girls had equal {{inheritance}} {{rights with}} boys if their father died without leaving a will. A Roman mother's {{right to own}} property and <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of it as she saw fit, including setting the terms of her own will, gave her enormous influence over her sons even when they were adults.|$|E
5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of large sums of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E

5|$|Gaza was {{culturally}} {{dominated by}} neighboring Egypt {{from the early}} 19th century; Muhammad Ali of Egypt conquered it and most of Palestine in 1832. Strangely, in 1833, Muhammad Ali instructed his son Ibrahim Pasha not to purchase Gaza's cotton harvest (cotton production was Ali's main source of wealth and Egypt's production was low that year), instead allowing its residents <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of it how they wished.|$|E

50|$|The {{two most}} {{traditional}} approaches <b>to</b> <b>disposing</b> of {{municipal solid waste}} are a flat-rate system or municipal taxes.

5|$|In 2005, after Rick Wurpel re-opened his {{production}} business, he realised that {{neither he nor}} TTS had the master tapes in their inventory and feared {{that they had been}} lost. He discovered the Denver City Council possessed the tapes among an inventory of 164 recordings. A former employee of Wurpel had been storing the tapes and intended <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of them unless the city was interested. The city had paid her $3,000 for the storage costs and took possession of the tapes. Legal proceedings subsequently ensued to return the tapes to Wurpel and U2.|$|E
5|$|In May 1949, it was {{reported}} that Lympne had made a loss of £17,000 and that the Air Ministry was looking <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of it, although it was thought that should a sale not materialise it would continue in operation. In August 1950, Air Kruise started a scheduled service between Lympne and Le Touquet using Dragon Rapides. This service was operated under an associate airline agreement with British European Airways.|$|E
5|$|Mosley {{came up with}} an {{innovative}} way <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of the FIA's involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One. In order to maintain Ecclestone's investment to deliver digital television, he proposed extending Ecclestone's rights for F1 coverage to 100 years from the initial 15, arguing that a deal of such length could not be anti-competition as it was effectively the same as an outright sale. The Commission agreed with his assessment and in the interest of impartiality, Mosley removed himself from the negotiations, which eventually returned around $300 million (£150 million).|$|E

An editor for the libertarian monthly Reason also speculated about the usefulness of the detailed information to government investigators. The original Ars Technica blog posting, on the other hand, dismissed privacy concerns, showing that the detail pages do not contain sensitive information.|$|E

She was badly damaged by Allied air attacks on Kiel and was not operational again until late 1944. She {{spent most of}} the rest of the war escorting ships as the Germans evacuated East Prussia and bombarding Soviet forces. The ship was captured by the Allies in May 1945 and spent the rest of the year under British control as the Allies decided how <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of the captured German ships.|$|E

She became operational later that year, but she was reconstructed and modernized in Cherbourg in 1948–51. After its completion, the ship was assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron for several years. Kléber was placed in reserve in late 1953, but was not condemned until 1957 and scrapped the next year.|$|E

5|$|Three of the {{surviving}} ships, Lübeck, München, and Danzig, were seized by Britain as war prizes {{after the end of}} the war and sold for scrapping. The other two ships, Hamburg and Berlin, were used as training cruisers through the 1920s. They were converted into barracks ships in the mid-1930s, a role they filled for a decade; in 1944, Hamburg was sunk by British bombers and later broken up for scrap, while Berlin was scuttled in deep water after the end of World War II <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of a load of chemical weapons.|$|E
5|$|Trading in BIH shares was {{suspended}} in June 2011 after Yeung's arrest {{on charges of}} money-laundering. Publication of financial results was repeatedly delayed, which led the Football League to impose a transfer embargo, and offers for the club were entertained from 2012 onwards. After Yeung resigned his positions with both club and company in early 2014, share trading resumed, and following his conviction, efforts intensified <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of the club, {{which had to be}} done piecemeal in order to retain BIH's share listing.|$|E

5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair and that the two had planned the murder <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E
5|$|By December, {{the bottom}} {{had dropped out}} of the {{commemorative}} coin market, and dealers who had purchased quantities found themselves unable <b>to</b> <b>dispose</b> of them at a profit. By 1940 the coin sets were selling for $15 per set. They thereafter recovered, and by the early 1960s had reached $100 a set, and by 1975 $550 per set of three. At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $2,250 a set. R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins, published in 2015, lists the sets at between $875 and $2,700 depending on condition.
