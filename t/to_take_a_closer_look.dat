25|$|The general {{analysis}} strategy begins with high resolution cameras {{to look for}} features of interest. If a particular surface is of interest, Curiosity can vaporize {{a small portion of}} it with an infrared laser and examine the resulting spectra signature to query the rock's elemental composition. If that signature intrigues, the rover will use its long arm to swing over a microscope and an X-ray spectrometer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look.</b> If the specimen warrants further analysis, Curiosity can drill into the boulder and deliver a powdered sample to either the SAM or the CheMin analytical laboratories inside the rover.|$|E
25|$|Timekeeper {{announced}} that guests were {{just in time}} for a meeting between H.G. Wells and Jules Verne. Nine-Eye hid from the fair-goers but not so that Verne and Wells were hidden. After a brief conversation about their conflicting visions of the Future, Wells walked away, leaving Verne with a model of his Time Machine, which Verne had just criticized as impossible. After a sarcastic comment about time travel from Verne, Nine-Eye rebutted his claim and appeared to the author. Jules Verne decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> at her and tried to grab her. Timekeeper, seeing this, tried to bring her back to the present, but accidentally took Verne as well.|$|E

He quickly assembled two companies of grenadiers to lead toward the North Bridge himself. As these troops marched, they met the shattered remnants of the three light infantry companies running towards them.

When he saw the Minutemen in the distance behind their wall, he halted his two companies and moved forward with only his officers <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look.</b> [...] One of the Minutemen behind that wall observed, [...] "If we had fired, I believe we could have killed almost every officer there was in the front, but we had no orders to fire and there wasn't a gun fired." [...] During a tense standoff lasting about 10 minutes, a mentally ill local man named Elias Brown wandered through both sides selling hard cider.|$|E

2500|$|The {{feminine}} {{categorization of}} Egypt, and subsequently Cleopatra, was negatively portrayed throughout early criticism. The story of Antony and Cleopatra was often summarised as either [...] "the fall {{of a great}} general, betrayed in his dotage by a treacherous strumpet, or else it {{can be viewed as}} a celebration of transcendental love." [...] In both reduced summaries, Egypt and Cleopatra are presented as either the destruction of Antony's masculinity and greatness or as agents in a love story. Once the Women's Liberation Movement grew between the 1960s and 1980s, however, critics began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> at both Shakespeare's characterization of Egypt and Cleopatra and the work and opinions of other critics on the same matter.|$|E

A fight broke out, and when Montgomery went <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look,</b> he discovered that:two or three men were {{on the floor and}} he [...] had another by the throat, slapping his face and shouting what I learned afterward was: [...] "So you would betray your country, would you?" [...] The Regent was alone, but he had the situation in hand.... The whole incident was typical not only of the Regent's deep hatred of alien doctrine, but of the kind of man he is. Although he was around seventy two years of age, it did not occur to him to ask for help; he went right ahead like a skipper with a mutiny on his hands.|$|E
