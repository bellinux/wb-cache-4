25|$|Also in 1799, Gauss {{provided}} the first generally accepted {{proof of the}} fundamental theorem of algebra, showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has {{a full set of}} solutions in that realm. The general acceptance of the theory of complex numbers is due to the labors of Augustin Louis Cauchy and Niels Henrik Abel, and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex numbers with a success <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> known.|$|E
25|$|Unburned {{hydrocarbon}} (UHC) {{and carbon}} monoxide (CO) emissions are highly related. UHCs are essentially fuel {{that was not}} completely combusted, and UHCs are mostly produced at low power levels (where the engine is not burning all the fuel). Much of the UHC content reacts and forms CO within the combustor, {{which is why the}} two types of emissions are heavily related. As a result of this close relation, a combustor <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> optimized for CO emissions is inherently well optimized for UHC emissions, so most design work focuses on CO emissions.|$|E
25|$|Representation {{theory is}} a useful method because it reduces {{problems}} in abstract algebra to problems in linear algebra, a subject <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> understood. Furthermore, the vector space on which a group (for example) is represented can be infinite-dimensional, and by allowing it to be, for instance, a Hilbert space, methods of analysis {{can be applied to}} the theory of groups. Representation theory is also important in physics because, for example, it describes how the symmetry group of a physical system affects the solutions of equations describing that system.|$|E

In this practice, the brokerage firm generally acquires the block of stock by purchasing a large block of the securities (usually from a large shareholder who is not affiliated with the underlying company) at a negotiated price <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> below the current market price (generally 40% to 50% below the then-current quoted offer/ask price) or it acquires the stock as payment for a consulting agreement.|$|E
25|$|Located {{south of}} the Isonzo zone, {{near the city of}} Trieste, is the Carso zone.

Wines made from this grape are known for their high acidity and good food pairing with Slavic cuisine. The white wines made from the Malvasia Istriana are highly regarded for their honey-almond notes. Other Carso wines can be made from the following grapes; Vitovska, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot grigio, Sauvignon blanc, Traminer and Piccola nera.|$|E
25|$|The {{events of}} the novel take place a full century after the {{beginning}} of the Butlerian Jihad, and are divided into two parts, the first beginning in the year 108 B.G. (before Guild) and detailing a biological war waged by the thinking machines on the humans. The second part of the novel begins in 88 B.G. and covers the events after the Great Purge, leading up to the fateful Battle of Corrin.

Its charred remains have been excavated at Kintampo and was valuable to people living in west Africa because it could be stored after harvest to be used at a later date. There is evidence of trade of foods with other people throughout the region; one item of evidence is that the millet has been found with shell beads that would have been imported from the ocean.|$|E
25|$|Creise {{along with}} Meall a' Bhuiridh, Stob Ghabhar and Stob a' Choire Odhair {{is one of}} the four Black Mount Munros, it reaches a height of 1100 metres (3609feet) and is a hill <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> known to skiers as well as walkers being {{situated}} next to the White Corries ski area from where it is often climbed along with adjoining Meall a' Bhuiridh. The two mountains are a popular traverse with cross-country skiers. The mountain is well seen from the A82 road and the Kings House Hotel, showing its steep and craggy northern buttress of Sròn na Creise. For many years the translated meaning of the mountains name from the Gaelic was unknown, however Irvine Butterfield now says that “creis” means grease or fat and refers to the rich grazing land around the hill which was used in the past by Glen Coe herdsman to fatten their cattle.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes, schools simply {{lack the}} {{resources}} to create an optimal classroom setting for those in need of special education. In the United States, it can cost between $6595 to $10,421 extra to educate a child with autism. In the 2011-2012 school year, {{the average cost of}} education for a public school student was $12,401. In some cases, the extra cost required to educate a child with autism nearly doubles the average cost to educate the average public school student. As the range of those with autism can widely vary, {{it is very difficult to}} create an autism program <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> suited to the entire population of autistics as well as those with other disabilities. In the United States, many school districts are requiring schools to meet the needs of disabled students, regardless of the number of children with disabilities there are in the school. This combined with a shortage of licensed special education teachers has created a deficiency in the special education system. The shortage has caused some states to give temporary special education licenses to teachers with the caveat that they receive a license within a few years.|$|E

500|$|Beryllium is a p-type dopant in III-V {{compound}} semiconductors. It {{is widely}} used in materials such as GaAs, AlGaAs, InGaAs and InAlAs grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Cross-rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for printed circuit boards in surface-mount technology. In critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and heat sink. The application also requires a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> matched to the alumina and polyimide-glass substrates.

The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other. The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used {{is called the}} Singkil.

500|$|The same {{paper had}} {{received}} Keable's second novel, 1922's The Mother of All Living, favourably; reviewer Louise Maundell Fields called it [...] "Not only...better from an artistic {{point of view}} ... its general outlook is both steadier and more mature. [...] the book has in it so much <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> done and worth while that one does not feel inclined to carp at its comparatively few weaknesses." [...] On the whole, other reviews were less favourable. The characters in both Peradventure and Recompense were criticised for lacking depth: reviewers said they served only as vehicles for conveying different theoretical points of view. A later book, 1927's Ann Decides, was dismissed succinctly by the Chicago Daily Tribune as [...] "tosh".|$|E
500|$|The {{novel was}} well {{received}} by most readers and critics. Two months after publication, all 210,000 {{copies of the}} first printing had been sold. The New York Times published two positive reviews of the book: Basil Davenport compared Clarke to Olaf Stapledon, C. S. Lewis, and H. G. Wells, a [...] "very small group of writers who have used science fiction as the vehicle of philosophic ideas." [...] William DuBois called the book [...] "a first rate tour de force <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> worth the attention of every thoughtful citizen {{in this age of}} anxiety." [...] Don Guzman of the Los Angeles Times admired the novel for its suspense, wisdom, and beauty. He compared Clarke's role as a writer to that of an artist, [...] "a master of sonorous language, a painter of pictures in futuristic colors, a Chesley Bonestell with words". Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin called the novel [...] "a formidably impressive job...a continuous kaleidoscope of the unexpected." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{an often}} laid back and sarcastic demeanor, Raynor is {{described}} in the novel Liberty's Crusade as a decent and honorable man <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> liked by those under his command. Robert Clotworthy noted that as such, Raynor is always {{willing to do the}} right thing, no matter how difficult it may be. His assertion to kill Sarah Kerrigan—the series' main antagonist—despite his former love for her early in the story arc is one of the sacrifices that in Clotworthy's eyes makes Raynor a [...] "true hero in the purest sense of the word". He is also described as being fiercely loyal to his friends and his cause, willing to put it all at risk for the protection of those who cannot defend themselves. It is this loyalty that causes deep resentment in Raynor when he is betrayed by those he had once trusted. Although often displaying an overzealous attitude, Raynor is well respected by his men as a dynamic and reliable leader who always tries to ensure his troops survive the day, even when Raynor is responsible for getting them into a bad situation. Raynor himself acknowledges that he is not the most intelligent man there is, but is shown as being extremely resourceful and persistent in the face of unfavorable odds.|$|E
