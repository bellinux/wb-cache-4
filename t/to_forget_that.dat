5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to dress like them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E
25|$|The text {{gives no}} {{apparent}} reason for the name in its literal meaning. Adam and his colleagues themselves seem to have thought the name to derive from the legendary Amazons taken from classical Greek mythology. This is clearly said in the text itself to be their own thinking, even though Adam later in his publication seems <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> and presents it as a common rumor originating from bishop Adalvard.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the musical}} views of The Five {{tended to be}} anti-German, it is easy <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> Balakirev was {{actually}} well-grounded in German symphonic style—all the more impressive when it is remembered that Balakirev was essentially self-taught as a composer. His King Lear overture, written when he was 22, is not a symphonic poem in the vein of Liszt but actually more {{along the lines of}} Beethoven's concert overtures, relying more on the dramatic qualities of sonata form than on extramusical content.|$|E

25|$|Looking at Head's {{life and}} the clearly {{scientific}} route that it took, it is often easy <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> he was also to become a poet. Through his mother he had gained a love of literature and this would do much to direct his choice of acquaintances in later life when he was to become firm friends with authors (most notably to Thomas Hardy) and a mentor to the poet Siegfried Sassoon. This passion was also to initiate another, as in literature he and his future wife Ruth (a writer in her own right) were to find common ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of Guizot’s oration was his straightforward style of speaking. He {{was essentially a}} ministerial speaker, far more powerful in defence than in opposition. Nor was he less a master of parliamentary tactics and of those sudden changes and movements in debate which, as in a battle, sometimes change the fortune of the day. His confidence in himself, and {{in the majority of}} the chamber which he had moulded to his will, was unbounded; and long success and the habit of authority led him <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> in a country like France there was a people outside the chamber elected by a small constituency, to which the minister and the king himself were held responsible.|$|E
25|$|According to Michel Christol though, this {{interpretation}} overly restricts {{the meaning of}} the word libertas. In Christol’s view, it is important not <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> the emperor’s decision in 205 must have been taken in response to a request made by the civitas and must have taken account of the relations that already existed between it and the pagus. It was the autonomy that the civitas had achieved during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the granting of Roman law that raised the spectre of a fusion of the two communities, which would without a doubt have provoked a certain unease in the pagus. The inhabitants of the pagus would have expressed “concern or even refusal when faced with the pretensions of their closest neighbours”. This would explain the honour that the pagus attributed to Commodus (conservator pagi, protector of the pagus) '.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{overwhelming}} impact, influence and enduring legacy of The Grammar of Ornament, {{it can be}} easy <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> Jones was, during his lifetime, well known {{to the public for}} his work as an architect. This skew in our contemporary perception of Jones's work is made particularly acute because many of Jones's built projects have since been demolished or otherwise destroyed – most notably the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, which was lost forever due to a fire in 1936. His most important building was St James's Hall, which was located between Piccadilly and Regent Street and for almost fifty years was London's principal concert hall. Jones was also responsible for two grand shopping emporiums: the Crystal Palace Bazaar and a showroom for Osler’s, the glassware manufacturer, both in the West End. These three buildings all opened within a few years of each other, between 1858 and 1860, but had all been demolished by 1926. Their sumptuous polychromed interiors of cast iron, plaster and stained glass were breathtaking monuments to leisure and consumption.|$|E

[...] Anderson later stated that, {{because many of the}} lines were written in a tongue-in-cheek style, she and David Duchovny said them in a humorous style; the two had to keep reminding themselves that the story revolved around a murder.|$|E

During a press conference following the semi-final, Mukuchyan responded to the incident by stating that [...] "You don't have <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> I am representing my country in my heart, my thoughts, my feelings, and all my emotions.

500|$|As a {{choreographer}} at Warner Brothers, Prinz had {{a different}} approach than Busby Berkeley, whose choreography for early 1930s movies included elaborate production numbers that were photographed using imaginative camera angles, often from above. Berkeley's numbers [...] "broke {{the boundaries of the}} stage," [...] while Prinz took a completely opposite approach, with the audience never able <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> it was watching a stage performance. Prinz's style is evident in the Little Johnny Jones number in Yankee Doodle Dandy, which featured a stationary camera and included features of the stage, such as the orchestra pit, in the dance number.

Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine had initially considered it as the least memorable song among the six tracks released for pre-order, however in another review for the album he explained, [...] "A decade of disco-Madonna makes it easy <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> she's a skilled balladeer, and the post-apocalyptic 'Ghosttown' takes a generic, contemporary-pop template (think 'Halo') and stamps it with her singular style a la 1994's Babyface-penned 'Take a Bow'." [...] Saeed Saeed of The National described the song as a [...] "streamlined power ballad", and complimented Madonna's pop music instincts.

The Doctor is furious, not only at having to choose between saving humanity or the Whale, but also at Amy for trying to keep him from making that choice. The Doctor decides to make the Whale brain-dead, allowing it to continuing travelling. As the Doctor starts the process, Amy observes Mandy has found her friend, unharmed. She forces Liz 10 to hit the abdicate control; to everyone's surprise, the Whale continues travelling, at a faster speed. Amy posits that like the Doctor, the Whale had come to Earth willingly to help save the remaining children, and is helping Starship UK.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{to be released}} in summer 1977, but was pushed back to November because of the various problems during production. Upon its release, Close Encounters had a huge impact on society and became a certified box office success, grossing $116.39million in North America and $171.7million in foreign countries, totaling $288million. It became Columbia Pictures' most successful film at that time. Jonathan Rosenbaum refers to the film as [...] "the best expression of Spielberg's benign, dreamy-eyed vision." [...] A.D. Murphy of Variety gave a positive review but felt [...] "Close Encounters lacks the warmth and humanity of George Lucas's Star Wars". Murphy found most of the film slow-paced, but praised the film's climax. Pauline Kael called it [...] "a kid's film in the best sense." [...] Jean Renoir compared Spielberg's storytelling to Jules Verne and Georges Méliès. Ray Bradbury declared it the greatest science fiction film ever made. Based on 46 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 96% ("Certified Fresh") of the reviewers have enjoyed the film and the site's consensus states [...] "Close Encounters most iconic bits (the theme, the mashed-potato sculpture, etc.) have been so thoroughly absorbed into the culture that it's easy <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> its treatment of aliens as peaceful beings rather than warmongering monsters was somewhat groundbreaking in 1977." ...|$|E
500|$|Sylvia and Adela, meanwhile, did {{not share}} their mother's enthusiasm for the war. As {{committed}} pacifists, they rejected the WSPU's support for the government. Sylvia's socialist perspective convinced her {{that the war was}} another example of capitalist oligarchs exploiting poor soldiers and workers. Adela, meanwhile, spoke against the war in Australia and made public her opposition to conscription. In a short letter, Emmeline told Sylvia: [...] "I am ashamed to know where you and Adela stand." [...] She had a similar impatience for dissent within the WSPU; when long-time member Mary Leigh asked a question during a meeting in October 1915, Pankhurst replied: [...] "hat woman is a pro German and should leave the hall.... I denounce you as a pro German and wish <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> such a person ever existed." [...] Some WSPU members were outraged by this sudden rigid devotion to the government, the leadership's perceived abandonment of efforts to win the vote for women, and questions about how funds collected on behalf of suffrage were being managed with regard to the organisation's new focus. Two groups split from the WSPU: The Suffragettes of the Women's Social and Political Union (SWSPU) and the Independent Women's Social and Political Union (IWSPU), each dedicated to maintaining pressure toward women's suffrage.|$|E

500|$|Some {{points of}} the work were {{inspired}} by Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, and other [...] "hip-hop style eccentrics". The songs on the album have heavy lyrical underlies, noted by several critics. The comic-esque [...] "Way 2 Many Chickz" [...] described as talking about [...] "a string of almost-conquests better left unvanquished": [...] "Chick had a cold sore that looked like John McCain." [...] On [...] "Cashmere", Ben J and Legacy [...] "try to outdo each other to win {{the attention of a}} young woman, but, predictably, she spurns them both". The lyrics also cover their difference in style, as seen in [...] "Cricketz", as Legacy raps, [...] "Jeans stay skinny like I starve my fabric, Another damn thing/You’ll never see me care about another man’s jeans." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times responded, [...] "Baggy has been de rigueur in hip-hop for so long it’s easy <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> 25 years ago, rappers gladly wore tight denim. Now it’s cause for a fight." [...] Some of the lyrics use double entendre, with the duo referring to themselves as [...] "rejects" [...] and [...] "jerks" [...] on [...] "Dot Com", which The Los Angeles Times called [...] "both a double-entendre for the dance moves spurring the craze, and illustrative of their generation’s reclamation of formerly nerdy archetypes." ...|$|E
500|$|Rachel is the {{daughter}} of an interracial same-sex couple, and is Jewish. Her fathers named her after Rachel Green from Friends. She joins the newly reconstituted glee club hoping that fame will increase her popularity and help her find a boyfriend. She is bullied by members of the school cheerleading and football teams, but is pleased when quarterback Finn Hudson joins the club, developing a crush on him. The two share a kiss in the episode [...] "Showmance", although he tells her <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> it happened and continues dating his girlfriend, cheerleader Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron). Rachel quits the glee club when she is not assigned a solo she wanted, and is awarded the lead role in the school musical, Cabaret. However, she later quits the musical and rejoins the glee club when she realizes that she would rather be in a group in which she has friends. She has a brief relationship with another glee club member, Puck (Mark Salling), who is also Jewish, and is a football player who used to bully her, but she breaks up with him due to her continuing feelings for Finn. She later discovers and reveals to Finn that Quinn's pregnancy was not caused by him, but that Puck is the father; furious, Finn attacks Puck, breaks up with Quinn, and drops out of New Directions. He returns the day of the group's first major competition, the Sectionals, to undo sabotage by cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch); the group makes up a completely new set list, which Rachel opens with a solo of [...] "Don't Rain on My Parade", and New Directions wins by unanimous decision.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed {{by a lot of}} people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going <b>to</b> <b>forget</b> <b>that</b> we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E
