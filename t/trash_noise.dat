His department handles various issues like <b>trash,</b> <b>noise,</b> and public safety. Dae-hee isn't married, nor {{does he have a}} girlfriend at the moment. He also doesn't have many hobbies. Dae-hee enjoys memorizing facts from books to impress his colleagues and watching television until falling asleep. You can say he is conservative and his job at the city government office suits him well.|$|E
50|$|The {{influx of}} new people and {{business}} also brought in some negative {{elements such as}} parking problems, <b>trash,</b> transients, <b>noise,</b> crime and overload of the areas drainage and other infrastructure. It also created a demand for street food stalls, which never existed in the area before and bother old-time residents. Over the years, many of the buildings’ uses were changed without regulation which put strains on the drainage, electrical system and water in some places.|$|R
5000|$|This station {{underwent}} reconstruction from September 2009 to December 2011. Both platforms were rebuilt {{with new}} windscreens, canopies, and tactile strip edges. A temporary platform over the express tracks {{was used to}} provide service on the side that was under rebuilding. [...] The new windscreens were controversial with nearby community members, since the windscreens contained gaps that allowed <b>trash</b> and <b>noise</b> through while causing privacy issues for residents whose backyards faced the station.|$|R
50|$|Shida night {{market was}} {{formerly}} {{a very popular}} night market given its unique shops, restaurants and fashionable clothing stores. However, as the area Shida night market occupied was close to Taiwan Normal University, {{it has always been}} a place that many intellectuals called home. As a result, the neighborhood is decidedly more cultured than your typical neighborhood in Taipei. Due to resident complaints regarding the <b>noise,</b> <b>trash</b> and people the night market attracted to the area, as well as government rezoning efforts, Shida night market is now much smaller than it used to be.|$|R
40|$|Genomic {{nomenclature}} has {{not kept}} pace with the levels and depth of analyzing and understanding genomic structure, function, and evolution. We wish to propose a general terminology that might aid the integrated study of evolution and molecular biology. Here we designate as a "nuon" any stretch of nucleic acid sequence that may be identifiable by any criterion. We show how such a general term will facilitate contemplation of the structural and functional contributions of such elements to the genome in its past, current, or future state. We focus in this paper on pseudogenes and dispersed repetitive elements, since their current names reflect the prevalent view that they constitute dispensable genomic <b>noise</b> (<b>trash),</b> rather than a vast repertoire of sequences with the capacity to shape an organism during evolution. This potential to contribute sequences for future use {{is reflected in the}} suggested terms "potonuons" or "potogenes. " If such a potonuon has been coopted into a variant or novel function, an evolutionary process termed "exaptation," we employ the term "xaptonuon. " If a potonuon remains without function (nonaptive nuon), it is a "nonaptation" and we term it "naptonuon. " A number of examples for potonuons and xaptonuons are given...|$|R
5000|$|The {{project was}} not without controversy, however, {{particularly}} among the local residents of Fairfax, who {{were concerned about the}} potential traffic, <b>noise,</b> <b>trash,</b> loitering, vagrancy, crime, and drugs that the venue might bring to the small, quiet town of about 7300 people (as of 2011). A Fairfax town council meeting whose agenda was to include a discussion about the venue, including a proposal for a traffic study, was scheduled for Wednesday, August 17, 2011. However, the Leshes pulled the topic from the agenda after someone anonymously posted signs reading, [...] "No Terrapin, Please", along Phil's normal morning walking route in his home town of Ross a day or two earlier. The Fairfax Chamber of Commerce hosted a Town Hall meeting on the Terrapin Crossroads project on September 1. Town Manager Michael Rock, Planning Director Jim Moore and Bruce Burman of Jazz Builders, the project manager for the proposed Phil Lesh-backed music venue, made presentations and answered questions. Given the ongoing controversy about siting the venue in Fairfax, the Leshes decided to ponder the situation during the month of September, and announce their ultimate decision sometime in October.|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} a thematic summary of an ethnographic study addressing {{the effects of}} cruise ships within Glacier Bay proper on the people known as the Huna Tlingit. Occupying the heart of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Glacier Bay proper {{is considered to be}} the core homeland of Huna Tlingit. The Huna occupied the Bay prior to its most recent glaciation and, though they now live nearby in Hoonah and other communities, they have continued to use, occupy, and value the lands and waters within the Bay since the glaciers began to retreat over two centuries ago. Simultaneously, since the designation of Glacier Bay as a unit of the National Park Service, Glacier Bay proper has become the focal point of a thriving tourist industry, with most park visitors arriving in the Bay by cruise ship. In past consultation, Huna representatives have expressed to NPS staff that cruise ships have various adverse effects on lands, resources, and values that are of concern to Huna people. Also, in recent years, the NPS has identified locations within Glacier Bay proper that appear to be eligible for designation as “Traditional Cultural Properties” (TCPs), a type of property that is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places by virtue of its cultural and historical importance to the Huna Tlingit. In light of the presence of these TCPs, as well as a variety of other federal mandates, the NPS must assess the potential adverse effects of park operations on lands and resources of importance to Huna Tlingit— including park specific vessel quotas and operating requirements that set limits on the number and operation of cruise ships. Recognizing this, the NPS initiated the current study to systematically identify the scope and nature of the impacts of cruise ship traffic on lands and resources of importance to Huna people, to illuminate the cultural context of those impacts, and to recommend potential avenues for minimizing or mitigating any adverse effects. No fewer than 50 Huna Tlingit served as formal interviewees for this study, and many others contributed informally to the project’s success. Through interviews with these people, as well as repeat visits to Glacier Bay proper with Huna Tlingit interviewees, the researchers systematically documented {{the nature and extent of}} cruise ship effects, as described and understood by Huna people. Interviewees identified a number of “tangible” adverse effects, some historical and some ongoing: air and water pollution, <b>trash</b> dispersal, <b>noise</b> pollution, wakes, fish and wildlife disturbances, various impacts on Tlingit boaters, and increased region-wide exposure to shipborne diseases. Interviewees also identified “intangible” adverse effects: displays of “disrespect” by people on ships, the disruption of Huna connections to Glacier Bay, inappropriate public interpretation, and the effects of outside observers on the character of traditional activities. While particular attention is directed here to the effects of cruise ships on TCPs, most of the effects are understood to have broader effects, throughout large portions of Glacier Bay proper and beyond. Positive effects were also noted, especially economic advantages. Seeking to illuminate some of the challenges and potentials of cruise ship tourism from a Huna perspective, interviews also contrasted cruise ship tourism in Glacier Bay with the Icy Strait Point facility, a cruise ship port with tourist facilities that is run by Huna Totem Corporation. Certain key cultural issues required to conceptualize these effects are also addressed, such as Huna protocols for “respecting” Glacier Bay, traditional Huna concepts of Glacier Bay as uniquely “clean” and spiritually potent, as well as Huna discomfort with the loss of their traditional role as “host” to visitors in their homeland. These elements represent key context for discussions of Huna perceptions of cruise ships, we suggest, and Huna discussions of specific impacts are often only understandable with reference to them. Interviewees recommend a variety of opportunities for minimizing or mitigating these adverse effects of cruise ships in the future management of TCPs and other park lands, waters, and resources. The document advances both specific recommendations and general principles that may be of value in future consultation and communication between Huna and the NPS on matters relating to the future of Glacier Bay...|$|R
