5000|$|Along {{with this}} method of {{reconstruction}} by analogy, we find the idea of myth and epics ... so when narrating the history of Christ, I did not reconstruct Christ such as he actually was. If I had reconstructed Christ's history as it actually was, I {{would not have made}} a religious film, since I am not a believer. I do not think Christ was God's son. I would have made a positivist or Marxist reconstruction if any, so at the best of cases, a life of one of the five or six thousands saints preaching at that moment in Palestine. However, I did not want to do that, I am not interested in profanations: that is just a fashion I loath, it is petit bourgeois. I want to consecrate things again, because that is possible, I want to re-mythologize them. I did not want to reconstruct the life of Christ as it really was, I wanted to make the history of Christ <b>two</b> <b>thousands</b> years of Christian version on, since it is the <b>two</b> <b>thousands</b> years of Christian history that have mythologized this biography, one that as such would have been virtually insignificant otherwise. My film is the life of Christ after <b>two</b> <b>thousands</b> years of stories on the life of Christ. That is what I had in mind.|$|R
