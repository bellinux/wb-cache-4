Trials with stuck fermentation could show the potential of compensating glucose / fructose imbalances by adding dextrose. Trials on sparkling wine production showed that under stressful conditions the second fermentation started earlier and finished more complete, when dextrose was used instead of sucrose in the <b>tirage</b> <b>liqueur.</b> In general the sensory property of the later product was not changed when dextrose was used as alternative to sucrose. Several trials on must chaptalization showed in general no clear differences in terms of fermentation kinetics. The aroma analysis showed as well, that the fermentation aroma was not clearly different when dextrose used as sugar source...|$|E
