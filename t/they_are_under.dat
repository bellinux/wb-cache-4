5|$|As of August 2015, {{access to}} see his white {{rectangular}} marble tomb slab is denied. His remains are not under the white slab, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>under</b> a grey circular stone near his slab. Under this grey stone is a red brick staircase which leads to an underground burial chamber that was studied {{for the first time}} ever in 2004. In the chamber are many family members. Gian Gastone had a lead coffin in a wooden frame. It was replaced with a modern coffin. Near him are the remains of many De Medici children who were buried in unmarked graves. Some of them still have their garments.|$|E
5|$|Military {{downsizing}} {{through the}} Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process removed the wing's F-15C Eagles beginning in 2007, leaving the 102d with an intelligence gathering mission. If activated to federal service, the Wing is gained by the United States Air Force Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency, {{and is one}} of three Air National Guard wings under this agency. As commonwealth militia units, the units in the 102d Intelligence Wing are not in the normal United States Air Force chain of command. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts National Guard unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments, {{some of which}} may be obscured by a large pair of operculate gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of gills arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the abdomen, and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E

5|$|The {{police have}} little success with street-level arrests or with {{securing}} informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes {{the direction of}} electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation to wrap up the case. Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response {{from the rest of}} the department. This causes the detail's targets to suspect that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>under</b> investigation.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, the Tower of London {{has been}} {{cared for by}} an {{independent}} charity, Historic Royal Palaces, which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. In 1988, the Tower of London {{was added to the}} UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites, in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations' Heritage in Danger List. The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006. Visitors can explore the chambers restored to their former glory, once used by past kings and queens. Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, the responsibility of day-to-day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor. At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance with the belief that if they are absent, the kingdom will fall. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>under</b> the care of the Yeomen Warders. The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture from 1883. As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower. Just over 2.7 million people visited the Tower of London in 2016.|$|E
