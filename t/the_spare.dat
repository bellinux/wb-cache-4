5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the restoration, <b>the</b> <b>spare</b> A3 boiler had been dispatched in June 2005 to Riley & Son to be completely rebuilt. It was to be used instead of the A4 boiler both out of the desire to restore the locomotive to original condition, {{and because it was}} deemed that the A4 boiler had deteriorated into a worse state than <b>the</b> <b>spare</b> due to the higher operating pressures the locomotive had experienced following the up-rating of the locomotive to 250psi during its last private overhaul.

5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by <b>the</b> <b>spare</b> pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E

Panis, who started from tenthposition in a Ligier, spun at the firstcorner after a nudge from Katayama, hitting {{the wall in the}} process and retiring from the race. Herbert, racing <b>the</b> <b>spare</b> Benetton chassis, dropped three places by the end of lapone, dropping behind Häkkinen and the two Ferrari cars. Blundell also made a poor start, dropping to fourteenth position after his gearbox changed from first to third gear as he accelerated away from the grid. At {{the end of the first}} lap, the race order was Schumacher leading Hill, from Coulthard, Häkkinen, Berger, Alesi, Herbert, Irvine, Katayama and Salo, with the two Tyrrell drivers switching places on the next lap. At the start of lapthree, Hill attempted to overtake Schumacher heading into turnfive, but Schumacher closed the door on Hill. Hill lost the advantage for a moment, with teammate Coulthard drawing alongside, but unable to get past with Hill on the inside line into turnsix. Henceforth, Schumacher and Hill began to gradually pull away from Coulthard, who realised that he could not match the pace of the leaders and settled into his own rhythm, albeit one that was still comfortably faster than the cars behind him. By lapfive, Herbert had dropped down to tenthposition, unhappy with the handling of <b>the</b> <b>spare</b> car and having been overtaken by Irvine, Salo and Katayama. On lapten, Schumacher lapped last-placed Diniz for the first time; the presence of slower cars a constant factor for the front-runners thereafter. On the same lap Frentzen retired from 12thposition with electrical failure. He was joined by Schiattarella two laps later after his Simtek car developed a steering problem. Irvine made a pit stop earlier than expected on lapfifteen, retiring from the race with a gearbox actuator problem. On the same lap, Katayama spun at the fourthcorner, stalled his car in the process and retired from the race. The two retirements meant Herbert moved back up to eighth position. Alesi was the first of the leading drivers to make a scheduled pit stop on lap17, rejoining the track in eleventh place. Barrichello, Irvine's teammate, retired a lap later, driving into the pit lane slowly with a gearbox problem. On the same lap, Verstappen retired his Simtek car with a clutch problem.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} (1) parotid function, (2) subjective xerostomia and (3) {{pattern of}} relapses after conformal parotid-sparing radiotherapy (RT) for {{head and neck}} cancer. (4) To study dose-response curves of parotid glands. MATERIAL AND METHODS: From September 1999 to November 2000, 39 head and neck cancer patients requiring bilateral neck RT were treated with a fairly simple conformal RT technique (three-field set-up+anterior lower neck field; two opposed oblique boost fields). The contralateral parotid was spared. Parotid function was assessed by salivary gland scintigraphies performed before, early (median 4 weeks) and late (median 28 weeks) after RT. Xerostomia was monitored by visual analogue scales (VAS) and LENT SOMA scores. Location of locoregional recurrences was studied {{in relation to the}} radiation fields. A dose-response curve of parotids was created using logistic regression. RESULTS: (1) Early after RT, on salivary gland scintigraphy, the mean loss of secretion function in <b>the</b> <b>spared</b> parotid was 67 % and total in the non-spared. Late after RT, the mean loss remained 19 % in <b>the</b> <b>spared</b> and total in the non-spared parotid. Normal excretion function was regained in 75 % of <b>the</b> <b>spared</b> parotids. (2) Late after RT, 78 % of patients had no, minimal or acceptable subjective xerostomia. (3) No recurrence was seen near <b>the</b> <b>spared</b> parotid (11 / 39 locoregional recurrences). (4) The dose-response curve of parotids showed that the mean parotid dose should preferentially be or = 70 %) for preservation of its function on scintigraphy. CONCLUSIONS: An easy conformal parotid-sparing RT technique prevents moderate or severe subjective xerostomia in 78 % of patients. In <b>the</b> <b>spared</b> parotids, nearly complete to complete recovery is obtained after 6 - 12 months. status: publishe...|$|R
