5|$|Ford {{returned}} to Australia in March 1942, and {{was promoted to}} lieutenant colonel in August. He was appointed Assistant Director of Pathology, I Corps and New Guinea Force. To combat the danger of dysentery, Ford had all available supplies of sulphaguanidine in Australia shipped up to New Guinea, where Australian forces were fighting a desperate campaign against the Japanese. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> drug that Neil Hamilton Fairley had tested in the Middle East, and found to be effective. An initial dose of 4g followed by 2g doses at four hourly intervals was found to rapidly relieve the symptoms and permit the sufferers to travel.|$|E

5|$|Roger got {{drawn into}} the {{controversy}} with Becket because Henry II wanted to have his eldest living son crowned as king during Henry's lifetime.(Traditionally, the ceremony is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury) <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> practice for England, but was a custom of the Capetian kings of France, which Henry decided to imitate. Henry II insisted that his son, Henry be crowned at Westminster Abbey on 14 June 1170 by Archbishop Roger of York. Also present at the coronation were the bishops of London, Salisbury, Exeter, Chester, Rochester, St Aspah, Llandaff, Durham, Bayeux, Évreux and Sées. The only English bishops absent {{seem to have been}} Winchester, Norwich, Worcester, and of course Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, who was in exile. The remaining English sees were vacant. This overstepped a long tradition which reserved coronations to the Archbishop of Canterbury, a reservation confirmed as recently as 1166 by Pope Alexander III. In 1170, however, Henry II received papal permission to have Roger crown the younger Henry, a permission which Alexander later revoked.|$|E
5|$|Sierra composers Mark Seibert and Jay User {{created the}} musical score for Phantasmagoria, with Neal Grandstaf {{providing}} additional music. Most {{of the music}} {{is a mixture of}} real instruments with synthesized and sampled sounds, and unlike previous Sierra games, the score was recorded live, rather than created in the computer. Themes for the music ranged from rock and roll to opera. The composers observed the game and various scenes to prepare their score, trying to create an ambiance and identify spots to build the tension with music, creating stingers as needed. For cinematic scenes, they watched tapes after the scenes were shot and composed the music afterward. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> process for Sierra and the computer game industry in general, but the same concept was regularly followed in the film industry.|$|E

This was re-released on VHS by Paradox Films, Total Home Entertainment and Revelation Films in 1995, and subsequently on DVD by Revelation Films in 2000. The full, unedited, episodic version of the serial was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide in 2005, as part of The Quatermass Collection box set. Also included were the surviving two episodes of The Quatermass Experiment, all of Quatermass II and various extra features.|$|E

5|$|World War I {{memorials}} {{commemorate the}} events and the casualties of World War I. These war memorials include civic memorials, larger national monuments, war cemeteries, private memorials {{and a range of}} utilitarian designs such as halls and parks, dedicated to remembering those involved in the conflict. Huge numbers of memorials were built in the 1920s and 1930s, with around 176,000 erected in France alone. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> social phenomenon and marked a major cultural shift in how nations commemorated conflicts. Interest in World War I and its memorials faded after World War II, and did not increase again until the 1980s and 1990s, which saw the renovation of many existing memorials and the opening of new sites. Visitor numbers at many memorials increased significantly, while major national and civic memorials continue to be used for annual ceremonies remembering the war.|$|E

25|$|A {{new name}} in Roman times is Toxandria the {{district}} of the Toxandri, which {{appears to have been}} in the large part of the civitas containing the sandy Campine region in the north, but possibly overlapping into the country of the Nervii, because some Toxandri also appear in cohorts of the Nervian civitas to the west. As with the Tungri more generally, whose name also appears for the first time under the Romans, either <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Germanic tribe entering the region, or it has alternatively been suggested that it could be a Latin translation of the name Eburones, whose name had been annihilated by Caesar. Both names apparently refer to the yew tree (Latin taxus).|$|E
25|$|As {{a junior}} athlete she competed in two World Junior Championships. At the 2000 edition in Santiago, Chile she {{finished}} eleventh in the triple jump. Her personal best {{at the time}} was 13.23 metres. In 2001, she broke the 14-metre barrier as she improved to 14.00 metres at a meet in São Caetano do Sul. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> South American junior record. In 2002 the World Junior Championships were held in Kingston, Jamaica. Here she finished ninth in the long jump and won the bronze medal in the triple jump. She was the first Brazilian to win a medal at the World Junior Championships. She had not improved in the latter event, but her personal best in the long jump was 6.46 metres, achieved in September 2002 in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
25|$|Vereen's {{professional}} track career {{reached its}} peak in 1993. She achieved a best of 23.07 seconds indoors and gained her first individual international selection for the United States. At the 1993 IAAF World Indoor Championships she came fifth in the 200m and also {{won a gold medal}} with the 1600-meter medley relay event. The team's winning time of 3:45.90 minutes was a world record for the non-IAAF-standard distance. She was chosen for the 4 × 100 m relay team for the 1993 World Championships in Athletics and the quartet of Michelle Finn-Burrell, Gwen Torrence, Vereen, and Gail Devers completed the race in 41.49 seconds. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> championship record, although the Russian women's team finished with the same time. Further analysis revealed the Russians as the winners and Vereen was awarded a silver medal with the American team. Vereen closed the season with a seventh-place finish in the 100m at the 1993 IAAF Grand Prix Final.|$|E

25|$|Victoria {{was founded}} in 1906 as a planned {{community}} on what had been largely undeveloped land during {{the construction of the}} Tidewater Railway. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> east-west railroad chartered in 1904 with its right of way quietly secured in 1904 and 1905, so as to not alert the competition regarding plans to transport coal originated by its sister Deepwater Railway operating in southern West Virginia. The Tidewater Railway was chartered to cross Virginia from the West Virginia border near Glen Lyn, Virginia in Giles County by way of Roanoke and Suffolk to port at Sewell's Point on Hampton Roads near Norfolk, Virginia. Both railroads were planned and built by the team of mining manager and civil engineer William Nelson Page and industrialist and financier Henry Huttleston Rogers, and added a third Hampton Roads coal exporting railhead to the existing Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (with coal piers at Newport News) and the Norfolk and Western Railway's similar facilities at Norfolk's Lambert's Point.|$|E

A third NCAA Indoor title came two months later with a winning score of 4536 points, which included a 60m hurdles best of 8.25 seconds.
