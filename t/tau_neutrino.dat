25|$|Neutrinos {{oscillate}} {{between different}} flavors in flight. For example, an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction may interact {{in a distant}} detector as a muon or <b>tau</b> <b>neutrino.</b> This oscillation occurs because the three mass state components of the produced flavor travel at slightly different speeds, so that their quantum mechanical wave packets develop relative phase shifts that change how they combine to produce a varying superposition of three flavors.|$|E
25|$|There have been, and {{continue}} to be, various reasons for researching non-standard BBN. The first, which is largely of historical interest, is to resolve inconsistencies between BBN predictions and observations. This {{has proved to be}} of limited usefulness in that the inconsistencies were resolved by better observations, and in most cases trying to change BBN resulted in abundances that were more inconsistent with observations rather than less. The second reason for researching non-standard BBN, and largely the focus of non-standard BBN in the early 21st century, is to use BBN to place limits on unknown or speculative physics. For example, standard BBN assumes that no exotic hypothetical particles were involved in BBN. One can insert a hypothetical particle (such as a massive neutrino) and see what has to happen before BBN predicts abundances that are very different from observations. This has been done to put limits on the mass of a stable <b>tau</b> <b>neutrino.</b>|$|E
25|$|Neutrino {{oscillation}} {{arises from}} a mixture between the flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos. That is, the three neutrino states that {{interact with the}} charged leptons in weak interactions are each a different superposition of the three neutrino states of definite mass. Neutrinos are created in weak processes in their flavor eigenstates. As a neutrino propagates through space, the quantum mechanical phases of the three mass states advance at slightly different rates due to the slight differences in the neutrino masses. This results in a changing mixture of mass states as the neutrino travels, but a different mixture of mass states corresponds to a different mixture of flavor states. So a neutrino born as, say, an electron neutrino will be some mixture of electron, mu, and <b>tau</b> <b>neutrino</b> after traveling some distance. Since the quantum mechanical phase advances in a periodic fashion, after some distance the state will nearly return to the original mixture, and the neutrino will be again mostly electron neutrino. The electron flavor content of the neutrino will then continue to oscillate {{as long as the}} quantum mechanical state maintains coherence. Since mass differences between neutrino flavors are small in comparison with long coherence length for neutrino oscillations this microscopic quantum effect becomes observable over macroscopic distances.|$|E

2500|$|There are six {{types of}} leptons, known as flavours, forming three {{generation}}s. [...] The first generation is the electronic leptons, comprising the electron (...) and electron neutrino (...) {{the second is}} the muonic leptons, comprising the muon (...) and muon neutrino (...) and the third is the tauonic leptons, comprising the tau (...) and the <b>tau</b> <b>neutrino</b> (...) [...] Electrons have the least mass of all the charged leptons. The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of particle decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the universe, whereas muons and taus can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and those carried out in particle accelerators).|$|E
2500|$|Neutrinos {{oscillate}} {{between different}} flavors in flight. For example, an electron neutrino produced in a beta decay reaction may interact {{in a distant}} detector as a muon or <b>tau</b> <b>neutrino,</b> {{as defined by the}} flavor of the charged lepton produced in the detector. This oscillation occurs because the three mass state components of the produced flavor travel at slightly different speeds, so that their quantum mechanical wave packets develop relative phase shifts that change how they combine to produce a varying superposition of three flavors. Each flavor component thereby oscillates sinusoidally as the neutrino travels, with the flavors varying in relative strengths. [...] The relative flavor proportions when the neutrino interacts represent the relative probabilities for that flavor of interaction to produce the corresponding flavor of charged lepton.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are three}} known types (flavors) of neutrinos: {{electron}} neutrino , muon neutrino [...] and <b>tau</b> <b>neutrino</b> , named after their partner leptons in the Standard Model (see table at right). The current best {{measurement of the}} number of neutrino types comes from observing the decay of the Z boson. This particle can decay into any light neutrino and its antineutrino, and the more types of light neutrinos available, the shorter the lifetime of the Z boson. Measurements of the Z lifetime have shown that the number of light neutrino flavors that couple to the Z is 3. The correspondence between the six quarks in the Standard Model and the six leptons, among them the three neutrinos, suggests to physicists' intuition that there should be exactly three types of neutrino. However, actual proof that there are only three kinds of neutrinos remains an elusive goal of particle physics.|$|E
50|$|Strong {{evidence}} for neutrino oscillation came in 1998 from the Super-Kamiokande collaboration in Japan.

These observations only concerned muon <b>neutrinos.</b> No <b>tau</b> <b>neutrinos</b> were observed at Super-Kamiokande. The result made it, however, more plausible that the deficit in the electron-flavor neutrinos observed in the (relatively low-energy) Homestake experiment has also to do with neutrino mass.|$|R

Atmospheric neutrino oscillations occur between the mu and <b>tau</b> <b>neutrinos</b> as pseudo-Dirac partners; whereas solar neutrino oscillations occur between the electron and singlet neutrinos, a linear combination of which is massless.

2500|$|The first charged lepton, the electron, was theorized in {{the mid-19th}} century by several {{scientists}} and was discovered in 1897 by J. J. Thomson. The next lepton to be observed was the muon, discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1936, which was classified as a meson at the time. After investigation, it was realized that the muon {{did not have the}} expected properties of a meson, but rather behaved like an electron, only with higher mass. It took until 1947 for the concept of [...] "leptons" [...] as a family of particle to be proposed. The first neutrino, the electron neutrino, was proposed by Wolfgang Pauli in 1930 to explain certain characteristics of beta decay. It was first observed in the Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment conducted by Clyde Cowan and Frederick Reines in 1956. The muon neutrino was discovered in 1962 by Leon M. Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger, and the tau discovered between 1974 and 1977 by Martin Lewis Perl and his colleagues from the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
