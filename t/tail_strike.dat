Because of the length and additional <b>tail</b> <b>strike</b> protection needed, a semilevered landing gear enables rotation over the aft wheels {{rather than at the}} bogie center, like the 777-300ER, and the cabin air conditioning system has 15% more capacity. The first and third -10s have Rolls-Royce's new Trent 1000 TEN engines, while the second is powered by the competing General Electric GEnx-1B engine.|$|E

[...] This was not their usual routine. Sixty feet from the runway, the captain began to reduce power in preparation for the flare and said, [...] "Okay" [...] to the first officer. The first officer immediately deployed the spoilers on the flare, instead of just arming them. The aircraft began to sink heavily and the captain, realizing what had happened, pulled back on the control column and applied full thrust to all four engines. The nose lifted, but the aircraft still continued to sink, hitting the runway with enough force that the number four engine and pylon broke off the wing. There was also a <b>tail</b> <b>strike</b> at this time. Realizing what he had done, the first officer began apologizing to the captain. Apparently unaware of the severity of the damage inflicted on the aircraft, the crew managed to lift off for a go-around, but the lost fourth engine had torn off a piece of the lower wing plating and the aircraft was now trailing fuel, which ignited. The first officer requested a second landing attempt on the same runway but was told it was closed due to debris and was directed to another runway.|$|E

5000|$|On October 16, 2001, an EMB 145 was {{on final}} {{approach}} to Roanoke, Virginia. The captain had briefed a [...] "no go-around" [...] {{for a night}} visual approach to a [...] "Special Airport". The approach was not stabilized, and the airspeed decreased {{to the point of}} a stall. The airplane struck the runway in a nose high pitch attitude, the aft fuselage struck the runway first then settled on the landing gear. The first officer made initial call-outs of slow airspeed and then stopped when the captain failed to respond to her callouts. After landing, the airplane was taxied to the gate where a post-flight inspection limited to the main landing gear did not find the damage to the tail section. The incident was not reported by either pilot to the company and the airplane was allowed to be flown by the next crew the following morning on its scheduled service back to Charlotte, North Carolina, where a post flight inspection revealed the <b>tail</b> <b>strike.</b> When interviewed, the captain first denied having been involved in a hard landing and speculated that the <b>tail</b> <b>strike</b> must have been the result of an over rotation on takeoff from the morning crew. When faced with the CVR and FDR data, she eventually admitted to the incident. She reported that she briefed [...] "no go-around" [...] because no takeoffs were authorized on the runway at night or in IMC conditions; however, the first officer knew this was incorrect, but did not challenge the captain. Both pilots had received CRM training, which included crew member assertiveness, methods of fostering crew input, and situational awareness, and training on special use airports; however it was not followed by either pilot. The captain said the first officer was passive and quiet. The first officer reported the captain was defensive and did not take criticism very well. It is remarkable that the damage to the tail section was not discovered during the preflight visual inspection performed by the morning flight or ground crews. The aircraft had an MELed APU and needed the engines to be started with the assistance of an external air cart. The connection for the air cart is located at the aft bottom fuselage section where the damages were visible. The access panel was bent. Yet the ground crew did not notify the flight deck crew. When the walk-around visual inspection was performed by the morning crew's first officer, it was performed during the hours of darkness {{with the help of a}} flashlight. The air cart was already connected and forced the first officer to walk around the cart and away from the aircraft, missing the <b>tail</b> <b>strike</b> damages. [...] Both crews were terminated from employment; however, the first officer of the accident flight and the captain of the morning flight were eventually reinstated with help of their union (ALPA). The accident captain was able to recover her certificates and privileges but was not reinstated. The first officer from the morning crew died from illness prior to being reinstated.|$|E

50|$|The final {{investigation}} {{report found that}} the accident {{was the result of}} metal fatigue caused by inadequate maintenance after a much earlier tailstrike incident. On 7 February 1980, the aircraft was flying from Stockholm Arlanda Airport to Taoyuan International Airport via King Abdulaziz International Airport and Kai Tak International Airport on China Airlines Flight 009. While landing in Hong Kong, part of the plane's tail had scraped along the runway. The aircraft was depressurized, ferried back to Taiwan on the same day, and a temporary repair done the day after. A more permanent repair was conducted by a team from China Airlines from 23 May through 26 May 1980. However, the permanent repair of the <b>tail</b> <b>strike</b> was not carried out in accordance with the Boeing Structural Repair Manual (SRM). According to the manual, repairs could be made by replacing the entire affected skin or by cutting out the damaged portion and installing a reinforcing doubler to restore the structural strength. These two acceptable options were set aside in favor of a third, improvised option, which entailed installing a doubler over the scratched skin. This external doubler did not effectively cover the damaged area in its entirety, as scratches were found at, and outside, the outer row of fasteners securing the doubler. The doubler having been installed with scratches remaining outside the rivets meant that there was no protection against the propagation of a concealed crack in the area between the rivets and the perimeter of the doubler.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of representative ship motion in various sea {{states on the}} aeroelastic response of a Froude-scaled, flap articulated, maritime rotor system is experimentally and numerically investigated. The design and construction of the rotor system are briefly presented. The rotor system was attached to a 6 degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) Stewart motion platform, which was programmed to produce Froude-scaled ship motion representative of a generic frigate. The experimental setup and runs are described and discussed. From the experimental and numerical results, it is demonstrated that {{in the absence of}} a ship airwake, certain combinations of ship roll/pitch frequencies and rotor hub frequencies are capable of producing elastic rotor tip displacements outside the acceptable safe operating range resulting in the possibility of tunnel or <b>tail</b> <b>strikes.</b> The experimental aeroelastic response of the rotor system throughout its operation envelope on a Froude-scaled moving ship is used to validate two geometrically exact multibody dynamics models of maritime rotors, which proves their validity for studying the problem of Helicopter Ship Dynamic Interface (HSDI). The relevance of this investigation and planned future investigations to the projected increase in maritime operation of rotorcraft is also discussed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: N...|$|R
