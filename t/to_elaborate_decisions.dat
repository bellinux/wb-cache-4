Soils {{degraded}} by excessive moisture {{are characterized}} by the content on surface and in the mass of water which prevents normal function of plants and bring soil in poor condition of tillage and cultivation. A special case of excess water are the floods caused by overflowing rivers. The paper addresses a current topic both nationally and internationally, because often the effect of excess moisture in soil is neglected to be studied in detail, although it is mandatory to assess and monitor closely the phenomenon of soil degradation in European countries. The main objective of the paper is to present the influence of climatic conditions on excess moisture at surface and in soil from Someș Mic meadow. Using rainfall values recorded for the period 2011 - 2012 at the weather stations in Cluj-Napoca, Salatiu and Apahida could create a database necessary to achieve the mean annual precipitation map for Somes Mic floodplain between Cluj-Napoca and Dej, using GIS techniques.

40|$|Most authors {{assume that}} the natural {{behaviour}} of the decision-maker is being inconsistent. This paper investigates the main sources of inconsistency and analyses methods for reducing or eliminating inconsistency. Decision support systems can contain interactive modules for that purpose. In a system with consistency control, there are three stages. First, consistency should be checked: a consistency measure is needed. Secondly, approval or rejection has to be decided: a threshold value of inconsistency measure is needed. Finally, if inconsistency is ‘high’, corrections have to be made: an inconsistency reducing method is needed. This paper reviews the difficulties in all stages. An entirely different approach is <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> a <b>decision</b> support system in order to force the decision-maker to give consistent values in each step of answering pair-wise comparison questions. An interactive questioning procedure resulting in consistent (sub) matrices has been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{container}} storage {{problem is}} one of the most studied issues regarding seaports. It is a relevant problem due to the fact that the effectiveness of a storage yard management affects the global productivity of the port. Therefore, various attempts were done in order <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> efficient <b>decision</b> support systems, which concern specific container terminals and specific transfer and handing equipments. Most of the existing proposed methods use heuristic or meta-heuristic algorithms because the NP-hardness of the container storage problem makes it difficult to solve using exact optimization methods mainly when there are a lot of containers. In this paper, we combine an exact resolution method (branch-and-cut) and a meta-heuristic algorithm (ant colony) in a hybrid ant colony and branch-and-cut algorithm (HACBC). Numerical simulations prove the efficiency and the effectiveness of our algorithm. Keywords–Ant colony algorithm; Branch-and-cut; Container storage problem; Hybridization; Mathematical modelling.

This special supplement presents the proceedings of a symposium focusing on advances in scientific understanding of the development of healthy food portion sizes in children and their families. Recent basic research highlights individual differences in children's responsiveness to portion size as well as potential mechanisms of portion size effects. Quantitative approaches highlight the influence of maternal serving in determining intake, while qualitative approaches seek <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> caregiver <b>decisions</b> around child portion sizes at meals and snacks. Family-based environmental interventions for child weight control involving food portion size are outlined. An overview of the overarching issues and roundtable discussion on the forefronts of portion size research are presented as well as policy considerations to promote healthy portion control...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to provide a}} support to {{evaluation}} in planning through an application based on the proposal of the Municipal Urban Plan of Cava De’ Tirreni (Province of Salerno, Italy). The goal is <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> a <b>Decision</b> Support System to evaluate the landscape and territorial integration of possible alternatives of Operational Plans, which are usually formed after public announcements to select, in a competitive way, the interventions to be implemented in transformation areas. Starting from the concept of landscape areas that divide the municipal territory, the proposed procedure helps the selection of the first Operational Plan, choosing three different urban areas for the experimentation application. The study is articulated in tree steps: 1) check of conformity; 2) economic and financial feasibility, and 3) performance of the plan actions, considering a suitable system of indicators through which verify the goals achievement.

40|$|A {{fuzzy logic}} {{controller}} - WNC (Water Network Control) {{was developed for}} control of urban drainage systems. The objectives are to avoid accidents, flooding, pollutions through combined sewer overflows and excessive operation and maintenance costs. Fuzzy logic was {{proved to be a}} promising approach, flexible and easy accepted, because it includes the expert knowledge. Fuzzy control system proposed is robust and also easy to understand and modified. It offers to the operator the possibility to participate directly in the system control, combining the results of the modern optimization techniques with the experience and knowledge accumulated in time by experts. Thus, the control of urban sewer system can be well solved by implementing an intelligent control system, based on available information (fuzzy) and on expert's experience. An important feature of this fuzzy logic system is its capability <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> a control <b>decision</b> even in situations that were not considered in the design phase of the urban network...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} {{need for}} continuously available software systems has raised two key-issues: self-adaptation and design evolution. The former one requires software systems {{to monitor their}} execution platform and automatically adapt their configuration and/or architecture to adjust their quality of service (optimization, fault-handling). The later one requires new design decisions to be reflected on the fly on the running system to ensure the needed high availability (new requirements, corrective and preventive maintenance). However, design evolution and selfadaptation are not independent and reflecting a design evolution on a running self-adaptative system is not always safe. We propose to unify run-time adaptation and run-time evolution by monitoring both the run-time platform and the design models. Thus, it becomes possible to correlate those heterogeneous events and to use pattern matching on events <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> a pertinent <b>decision</b> for run-time adaptation. A flood prediction system deployed along the Ribble river (Yorkshire, England) is used to illustrate how to unify design evolution and run-time adaptation and to safely perform runtime evolution on adaptive systems...|$|R

The {{main focus of}} this manuscript is <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> the managerial <b>decision</b> model of perfectly competitive market structures which have a say to the ensuring economic and allocative efficiency and maximizing profit in the perfectly competitive industries. Accordingly, the main decision tools that firms use in the perfectly market competitive market structure are Marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) between any pair of inputs must be equal for all producers, marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between any pair of goods must {{be the same for}} all consumers and marginal rate of product transformation (MRPT) must be equal to the marginal rate of substitution for each pair of goods so that the firm is economically efficient. To be allocatively efficient firms in the perfectly competitive industry should operate {{at the point where the}} demand curve and the supply curve intersect. Marginal revenue and marginal cost (MC) are compared to decide the profit-maximizing output. If MR> MC, then the firm should continue to produce. If MR = MC, then the firm should stop producing the additional unit...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{teaching}} experience has been acknowledged {{in the development of}} pedagogical expertise, however, past research has failed to specify the relationship between experience and expertise. The ill-defined nature of the teaching task has led researchers to inadequately define pedagogical expertise directly in terms of years {{of teaching}} experience. Moreover, the literature on pedagogical expertise is primarily based on data from school teachers, who typically are not subject matter experts in the topics they teach. This study attempted to establish the differences and similarities between experienced and inexperienced university professors in the planning and delivery of teaching {{and the extent to which}} these activities and processes resembled expert characteristics. Indices of teaching effectiveness were derived from both theoretical and empirical sources and applied to the practices of 11 university professors, ranging in experience from 1 to 30 years. After the conduction of a lecture, subjects were interviewed and asked <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> on planning <b>decisions</b> made prior to teaching and to trace the events of the class. Protocols were then analyzed for the presence of characteristics of pedagogical expertise as defined above. Important differences were revealed between the teaching practices of experienced and less experienced professors which involved: (1) automaticity of activities, (2) teaching a lecture as part of the global task of teaching, (3) knowledge integration, (4) flexibility of plan implementation, (5) use of planning notes, (6) time management, and (7) reflections. Important group similarities were also revealed. Implications for the development of pedagogical expertise are discussed...|$|R

Prior to the telecast, the station was swamped with numerous phone calls and e-mails against the station showing the program. After the program ended, the station logged hundreds of phone calls and over 1000 e-mails, all in protest against the show. General Manager Mike Pumo refused <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> on the <b>decision,</b> other than saying that the show's content did not [...] "raise the red flag" [...] during pre-screening.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} whether college {{women have a}} preference for selecting dating partners who provide self-verifying versus self-enhancing feedback about their bodies. Research literature on self-evaluation has shown that people are motivated to both confirm their sense of self while also trying to enhance their self-concept. In recognition of these dual motives, the present study attempted to explore how these self-evaluation processes were influenced by body-concept considerations and variations in feedback from potential dating partners. A sample of 83 undergraduate women were given hypothetical feedback that varied in {{the degree to which}} evaluations of their bodies were either self-verifying, self-enhancing, or self-deprecating. Participants were asked to rate how much interest they had in pursuing both a short-term and long-term relationship with the dating partners who provided the feedback. The study also explored how interest in dating partners varied based on different types of feedback for three components of body esteem: sexual attractiveness, physical condition, and weight concern. Results of the study suggested that regardless of which dimension of the body was being evaluated, women generally preferred self-verifying and slightly-enhancing feedback about their bodies in both short-term and long-term relationships. This study also explored motives that may guide college women in selecting dating partners based on the feedback they receive about their bodies. In this regard, participants were asked <b>to</b> <b>elaborate</b> on their <b>decision</b> making process, and judges independently coded their responses to understand the motives behind their selections of dating partners. Results suggested that women who preferred self-verifying dating partners were most clearly motivated by the need for a reassurance of self-view and by the need to feel as if their partner is similar to them. Women who selected self-enhancing dating partners were found to be most clearly motivated by positivity strivings. The results of the study were discussed within the context of existing body-concept and self-evaluation literature...|$|R
