25|$|The {{risk for}} supply interruptions {{aimed at the}} states of the Former Soviet Union is present today. Depending on {{bilateral}} relations and the present context, the risk for partial and/or short-duration cut-offs is high. Since 1991, the energy lever has been used for putting political or economic pressure on Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia that subsequently affected most of Europe. The number of incidents, i.e. cut-offs, take-overs, coercive price policy, blackmail or threats, is over fifty in <b>total</b> (<b>of</b> <b>which</b> about forty are cut-offs). Incidents appear to be equally divided between the Yeltsin and Putin eras, but the number of cut-offs has decreased by half during Putin. The immediate reasons for Russia’s coercive policy appear to be political concession in ongoing negotiations, infrastructure take-over, and execution of economically favorable deals or to make political statements. There are economic underpinnings in the majority of the cases and Russian demands for payments of debts are legitimate. However, there are also political underpinnings in {{more than half of the}} incidents, and in a few cases explicit political demands are evident.|$|E

An {{official}} tabulation established that there were 51,626 officers and men missing on 11 July 1809, compared to the overall complements on 5 July 1809.

Many of these men were simply missing in action and many were subsequently able to return to the colours. Nevertheless, conservative estimates of the Austrian losses at Wagram numbered some 30,000 men, of whom 24,000 were killed or wounded, with the rest taken prisoner. According to I.
