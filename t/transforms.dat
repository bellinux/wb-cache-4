40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} a novel image watermarking technique using Kekre’s algorithm to generate hybrid wavelet <b>transform</b> DKT_DCT from Kekre <b>transform</b> and Discrete Cosine <b>Transform.</b> In the proposed technique, 256 x 256 hybrid <b>transform</b> is generated using 16 x 16 Kekre <b>transform</b> and 16 x 16 DCT whereas, 128 x 128 hybrid wavelet <b>transform</b> is generated using 32 x 32 Kekre <b>transform</b> and 4 x 4 DCT matrix. Generated DKT_DCT <b>transform</b> {{is applied to}} host and watermark in three different ways: column wise, row wise and full <b>transform.</b> Performances of these three ways of applying <b>transform</b> are compared against various image processing attacks namely image cropping, image compression, adding noise and image resizing attacks. Column DKT_DCT <b>transform</b> is most robust for compression and resizing attack whereas row DKT_DCT wavelet <b>transform</b> is most robust for cropping, JPEG compression attack and binary distributed run length noise attack for increased run length. Column and row DKT_DCT <b>transform</b> show exceptionally better performance than full DKT_DCT wavelet <b>transform.</b> Also column DKT_DCT <b>transform</b> is observed {{to be better than}} column DCT wavelet <b>transform</b> for above mentioned attacks and row DKT_DCT wavelet is better than row DCT wavelet for binary distributed run length noise attack showing the strength of hybrid wavelet <b>transform</b> over wavelet <b>transform</b> generated from same component orthogonal <b>transform</b> matrices.
