25|$|For the {{remainder}} of Presley's life, Parker would see very little of him. The two had become almost strangers to each other, and false reports in the media suggested that Presley's contract was up for sale. Although Parker publicly denied these claims, {{he had been in}} talks with Peter Grant, manager of Led Zeppelin, about the possibility of him overseeing a European tour for Presley. As with all <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Presley touring overseas, Parker never followed through with the deal.|$|E
500|$|Lydon, in turn, would dismiss McLaren's influence: [...] "We {{made our}} own scandal {{just by being}} ourselves. Maybe {{it was that he}} knew he was redundant, so he overcompensated. All <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the French Situationists being {{associated}} with punk is bollocks. It's nonsense!" [...] Cook concurs: [...] "Situationism {{had nothing to do with}} us. The Jamie Reids and Malcolms were excited because we were the real thing. I suppose we were what they were dreaming of." [...] According to Lydon, [...] "If we had an aim, it was to force our own, working-class opinions into the mainstream, which was unheard of in pop music at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Barcelona {{under the}} Anarchists would remain with Orwell. [...] "No {{one who was}} in Spain during the months when people still {{believed}} in the revolution will ever forget that strange and moving experience. It has left something behind that no dictatorship, not even Franco's, {{will be able to}} efface." [...] In the words of a recent biographer, Gordon Bowker, [...] "the people that had effaced that reality, the Soviet Communists, now had an implacable enemy they would come to regret having made." [...] Christopher Hitchens: [...] "The narrative core of Homage to Catalonia, it might be argued, is a series of events that occurred in and around the Barcelona telephone exchange in early May 1937. Orwell was a witness to these events, by the relative accident of his having signed up with the militia of the anti-Stalinist POUM upon arriving in Spain ... he became convinced that he had been the spectator of a full-blown Stalinist putsch ... Moreover, he came to understand that much of <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> discipline and unity was a rhetorical shield for the covert Stalinization of the Spanish Republic." ...|$|E
