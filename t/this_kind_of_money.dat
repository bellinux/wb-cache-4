50|$|One can {{say that}} a hard money policy {{is one in which}} the {{government}} recognizes currency which is based on an actual, fixed item which is considered valuable.

When they finally do find jobs they usually consist of hard manual labour along with unfair pay. In the article [...] "Migrant Farmworkers: Is government doing enough to protect them?” by William Triplett, Triplett describes that the “median annual income was $7,500, and 61 percent had income below the poverty level” (Triplett). After losing their cultural identity immigrants {{try to find the}} way to feed their families and end up being exploited. The study by William Triplett describes the annual income to be about 7,500 dollars, or about 625 dollars a month. Triplett also mentions that since 1989, “their average real hourly wages (in 1998 dollars) had dropped from $6.89 to $6.18” One cannot expect to live a healthy life making <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> The pursuit of happiness must not apply to all humans as stated in the constitution. Without help immigrants will constantly be forced to work horrible labour jobs for little to no money. Although battles have been fought for betting the wages researchers found that they have actually decreased. As the cost of living has increased the average pay for a migrant farm worker has actually decreased. Along with economic exploitation in the work place immigrants also suffer from physical exploitation in the work place.|$|E
30|$|Islamic {{insurance}} has {{to deposit}} {{a large amount}} of money with the Central Bank of Bangladesh as security to operate whereas the Bangladesh Bank operates based on interest (Riba). Bangladesh Bank provides interest against this deposit, but Islamic insurance cannot receive <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> as a profit (Kalil 2011, pp. 218 – 220). Another obstacle of Islamic insurance is lack of Islamic capital market (Azad et al. 2013). Islamic insurance companies do not have any alternative for investment as without Islamic banks all bonds and certificates are based on interest. Islamic insurance companies cannot participate in this kind of investment or capital market. As a result, Islamic insurance companies lag behind conventional insurance (Kalil 2011, pp. 218 – 220).|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} study of {{monetary}} economy is money, its forms and functions and its economic and reproductive role. Since modern {{money is a}} very heterogeneous category, an adequate money issue policy makes it possible with particular forms of money to achieve some additional effects. This primarily refers to commemorative coins, the issue of which may bring significant economic effects based on numismatic designs. In this way, <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> may get another role in monetary economy. Such approach does not lessen the basic functions of commemorative money, such as the function of preserving value, the function of a means of transaction, the function of a means of payment or its commercial function. Planned activities {{in relation to the}} introduction of cash money, including commemorative coinage, iil most European Union countries in the year 2002, among other things, will also have important influence on Croatian money issue policy regarding commemorative coinage. The reasons for this are the development of money issue activities in the sphere of coinage, especially in the segment of commemorative coins in the European Union countries, and the readiness of Croatia to participate in that association. It will therefore be necessary to harmonize Croatian money issue policy in the sphere of commemorative coinage with the unified policy of these countries that is now being profiled. ...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades there were deep technology-driven changes in {{financial}} systems of many countries. The result was the decreasing demand for cash and commercial banks’ liquid reserves. The decreasing demand for central bank money has changed the operational side of the monetary policy. The maturities of open market operations have been shortened substantially. The reserve requirements were lowered or eliminated. The changes lead to {{a decrease in the}} volume of the monetary base, but the demand for central bank money will not vanish. Even with zero reserve ratio commercial banks will keep cash balances with central banks to settle their transactions. Thus, there will be a demand for banks’ liquid reserves and cash. Despite the decreasing demand for the monetary base, the central banks ability to influence the level of short-term interest rates will not be impaired, because central banks will continue {{to play the role of}} clearing houses for the banking systems. The central bank ability to conduct monetary policy does not depend on the volume of the monetary base, but on the demand for interbank settlements made by central bank. This is not the size of the monetary base either, that decides about the effectiveness of the monetary policy. Monetary authorities can influence interest rates via the payment system, which is typically based in central bank. The consequence of the decrease in the monetary base will be a fall in seigniorage income, but this will not impair central banks ability to conduct monetary policy. Interbank settlements must be located in central banks due to their reliability and the ability to play the role of lenders of last resort. As the central banks will stay as the institutions refinancing the payment system, they will decide about the level of short-term interest rates. Electronic money will not change the situation, because if <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> is to be widely accepted, it has to be exchanged into central bank money. monetary policy, monetary base, interbank settlements...|$|E

She remembers that she attended up to second grade in school, since {{she did not have}} time to do homework because she was the one that helped her mother gathering wood so her mother could make tortillas and sell them to people in town that had helpers at their houses. Both of her parents did not go to school since they never had time to attend. Her mother contributed to the family income also by selling onions during the Sunday market in their town and her older sisters also worked taking care of children of some of their relatives. María Andrés Ramíres mentions that her father did not earn that much money when he went to work to the U. S. and recounts that he sent between $ 50. 00 and $ 70. 00 dollars a month, and that her mother had the impression that it was not worth it for <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> She explains that her mother continued to work while her father {{was in and out of}} the country and that the money that her father made in the U. S. allowed him to plant corn on his own land and feed his animals like sheep, pigs, and chickens allowing them to always have food on their table. She comments that it was common that neighbors had somehow the same family dynamic, that is, the women worked while their husbands went to the harvest in the U. S. allowing them to have some money and buy a property. She also recalls that it was common that her uncles went together to work at this activity up north and communicated among themselves so they knew when hiring opportunities were available, and that they also went together to work to several places when the harvest ended and they returned to Mexico to their hometowns to work as peasants. María Andrés Ramíres remembers details about her father returning to Mexico to work on his land and at other people’s land and that one time he worked in the highway installing light poles that brought this service to her town. To conclude, she discusses several issues like the kind of communication her mother and father had while he was in the U. S.; the things her father used to bring to them when he came back to Mexico; the time his father stopped going to the U. S.; the experiences that people of her hometown talked about the Bracero Program; when she got married and eventually came to live to Los Angeles with her daughters and how her father disagreed with her about this decision since he had another impression about crossing the border and living in the U.

40|$|The {{government}} 2 ̆ 7 s {{economic stimulus}} package starts to bring Australia into line with its international counterparts, writes ADAM RORRIS   UNTIL A DEAL was struck with the small party and independent senators, Malcolm Turnbull’s decision to oppose the federal government’s {{economic stimulus package}} was putting at risk a {{once in a lifetime}} opportunity to improve education in Australia. Why? Because this is a moment when we can begin to re-imagine and then build the schools that we want for our children and grandchildren in this century. These new public facilities will {{stand the test of time}} and will be seen in fifty or even a hundred years as evidence of our dedication to the education of all our children. The federal government announcement to inject nearly 15 billion into the rebuilding of Australian schools is much more than a major renovation job. Yes, investment will save thousands of jobs. It will help many builders and suppliers right across the country keep their heads above the rising waters of insolvency. Every community has a school and this money (and therefore the jobs that will be created by it) will be spread widely across the country. These are no mean achievements when we need to do all we can to ward off the effects of recession in all of our communities. But the true significance of this initiative for our country is that it begins to rectify in a serious manner the massive under-investment by governments in Australian public schools. In the broader sweep of our country’s social development, this massive investment may well be remembered as the first big step towards a renaissance in Australian schooling. I have built a career out of deciphering millions and billions of dollars and what they really mean when it comes to education. It is all too easy for ministers and governments to talk of billions and sound impressive when it comes to elections or budgets or quadrennial agreements. But in reality, and all too often, they offer very little that is either new or above what is already spent. So let me assure you, this investment is the mother of all school investment programs. Yes, it really is new money and it is very big. What is important to know is this - it needs to be. The under-investment in our public schools has been accumulating for at least a couple of decades. A great many schools have been allowed to run down. Emblematic for many parents and teachers have been the dreaded demountables. Research I conducted last year confirmed that public schools had a legitimate gripe when they compared themselves with their private counterparts. Data analysis spanning five years showed the average public school to be receiving a little over a third of what the average private school was allocating for capital expenditures. Not good for kids and not exactly a level playing field. This year I compared Australian public schools with their public school counterparts in Britain and the United States. The key finding (presented in a forthcoming Centre for Policy Development publication) is that over the same five year period (2002 - 06) public schools in both of those countries received the equivalent of nearly 1000 extra per student to invest in capital improvements. In fact, the per student amount these countries were spending was very close to the average capital expenditure per private school student in Australia. If Australian public schools had received the same level of funding per student as American and British public schools, they would have received more than 10 billion extra in additional funds over that same five year period. It just so happens that public schools stand to gain approximately 11 billion of the new money being promised by the Federal government. This is one very big hit of additional funding to rectify five years of relative neglect. This is not substantially different from the 2004 Blair government promise to spend 110 billion over 15 years in rebuilding every secondary school in Britain. Similarly, Barack Obama has pledged the equivalent of 33 billion in additional federal money for urgent capital improvements to American schools. The federal opposition leader seems to think that Australian schools are too high on the priority list of the government. In his speech to parliament he even suggested that perhaps 1 billion a year for schools would be enough. My research over the past year makes very clear that <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> would not be anywhere near enough for our public schools, let alone the private sector. We need first rate schools, for children to be capable in meeting the formidable challenges of the new century and to operate from a position of advantage in the global marketplace. Our schools really couldn’t keep on doing more with less. • Adam Rorris, is an economist and research fellow with the Centre for Policy Development.
