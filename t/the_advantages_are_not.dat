5000|$|Westbury's poetry was Romantic {{in style}} while his fiction writing {{appears to have}} drawn {{inspiration}} from popular 19th century romances as well as mystery adventure novels, particularly those of Alexandre Dumas. His best known book, “The Shadow of Hilton Fernbrook”, is {{the tale of a}} murderer who assumes the identity of a wealthy New Zealander in order to steal his estate and escape justice. Set in New Zealand, Venice and London, it has much intrigue and double dealing and features a sinister French “mesmerist” (hypnotist) named Gaston de Roal. The novel was well received at its time of publication. A review in the Adelaide Advertiser of January 1897 states: “The Shadow of Hilton Fernbrook is...an admirable story of adventure of the Fin de siècle kind. There is villainy enough to supply more than a dozen sensational novels. Mr Westbury handles his perhaps too abundant material with the deftness of an old hand and is equally at home when the sensation of the moment is an exhibition of hypnotism, a description of the Maori War or an earthquake.”Much of Westbury’s writing explores the quest for justice and is often in sympathy with the indigenous New Zealanders, the Maoris. As the Adelaide reviewer noted: “Mr Westbury has evidently a liking for the natives... and pictures them as both physically and mentally, a magnificent race... He shows that in the contrast between barbarism and civilisation <b>the</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> all on the one side. Te Coro, the Maori girl, is a more than presentable heroine and the author proves by more than one example a distinct gift of characterisation.” ...|$|E

I improve upon the existing measures of incumbency by using a quasi-experimental research design that isolates the effect due to incumbency from other contemporaneous factors such as candidate quality. I find that incumbency bestows a significant advantage on incumbents compared with their challengers.

50|$|The {{interline}} architecture extends {{this concept}} {{one step further}} and masks every other column of the image sensor for storage. In this device, only one pixel shift has to occur to transfer from image area to storage area; thus, shutter times can be less than a microsecond and smear <b>is</b> essentially eliminated. <b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> free, however, as the imaging area is now covered by opaque strips dropping the fill factor to approximately 50 percent and the effective quantum efficiency by an equivalent amount. Modern designs have addressed this deleterious characteristic by adding microlenses {{on the surface of}} the device to direct light away from the opaque regions and on the active area. Microlenses can bring the fill factor back up to 90 percent or more depending on pixel size and the overall system's optical design.|$|R

Out of the eight games, four were blitz games (five minutes plus five seconds Fischer delay (see time control) for each move); these Rebel won 3-1. Two were semi-blitz games (fifteen minutes for each side) that Rebel won as well (1½-½). Finally, two games were played as regular tournament games (forty moves in two hours, one hour sudden death); here it was Anand who won ½-1½.

This process is based on the new FSI security standards. This process carries a development price which has prevailed for some time.

On the other hand, comparatively slight attention was paid to private crime. Assassinations were of frequent occurrence, and unless the victim happened to be very powerfully connected, no notice was taken when a man was found to be missing from his usual place, and his corpse was discovered floating in the lagoon. Consequently crimes of this kind were, in the great majority of cases, committed with impunity, and even when traced, the authors, if possessed of powerful protectors, seldom suffered any greater punishment than temporary banishment.|$|R
