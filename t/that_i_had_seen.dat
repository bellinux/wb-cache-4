The interrogation room at the homicide division, colloquially referred to by detectives as [...] "The Box", is a setting that appears in almost every episode of Homicide: Life on the Street. While filming an interrogation scene there in [...] "Gone for Goode", the first episode of the , director Barry Levinson commented to Fontana that the acting from Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor was so effective, an entire episode could be filmed revolving strictly around an interrogation. The comments partially inspired Fontana to write [...] "Three Men and Adena". Fontana said, [...] "I only {{had the courage to}} write that episode based on the fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> what (Braugher and Secor) could do in the pilot episode". Almost the entire episode of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] takes place {{within the confines of the}} police interrogation room with Braugher, Secor and Moses Gunn, the actor who guest starred as Risley Tucker. It was Gunn's final acting role before his death in December 1993. Fontana acknowledged a certain amount of risk in producing such an unusual episode in only the fifth week of the show, but he said, [...] "It was important for Barry Levinson and I to establish that we weren't going to do the same old show every week." ...|$|E

The fact <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> chronophotographs of fencers in action and horse galloping (what we today call stroboscopic photography) gave me {{the idea for the}} Nude. It doesn't mean that I copied these photographs. The Futurists were also interested in somewhat the same idea, though I was never a Futurist. And of course the motion picture with its cinematic techniques was developing then too. The whole idea of movement, of speed, was in the air." ...|$|E

Visiting the hothouses on 30 March 1822, the Quaker pharmacist William Allen, his Cousin Emily Birkbeck and Anna Hanbury noted: We all went to Loddiges Nursery to see the camellias which are now in full bloom and very beautiful ! There is quite a forest of them: his hot-houses are, perhaps, the most capricious in the world: one off them is forty feet high: in this there is a banana tree which nearly reaches the top. A few years later, in 1829, Jacob Rinz (a visitor from a Frankfurt nursery) commented: never shall I forget the sensation produced by this establishment. I cannot describe the raptures I experienced on seeing that immense palm house. All <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> before of the kind appeared nothing to me compared with this. I fancied myself in the and especially at that moment when Mr Loddiges had the kindness to produce, in my presence, a shower of artificial rain. Such conditions were ideal for tropical orchids, several of which were named in honour of George Loddiges, including Loddiges' dendrobium.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{accounts}} of the attack state that the defenders [...] "failed to safeguard the perimeter" [...] of the FSB. The only single volume study written about the attack contests this position, pointing out that [...] "historians [...] got it wrong." [...] Even with this new perspective, {{there are indications that}} alertness at Mary Ann was not as good as it could have been. Many accounts by men stationed at Mary Ann mention that perimeter security was uneven at best. One member of the 1-46th Headquarters Company stated that [...] "I don't think Captain Knight [...] had a clue as to how lax the security was...because in that area, and only that area, Knight wasn't diligent. He left it up to his lieutenants and sergeants to check the bunker line." [...] In many cases they failed to do so, and the failure was compounded by Charlie Company being understrength and unable to man all the perimeter bunkers. Manning bunkers was not the only problem. Trip flares located in the concertina wire around the base were not always reset or replaced when they went off, a common occurrence caused in some cases by the rotor wash created by large CH-47 Chinook helicopters bringing in supplies or backhauling material as 1-46th Inf prepared to hand the base over to the ARVN. This lax attitude, combined with the skill of the attacking sappers, had fatal consequences for many in Charlie Company. Although not [...] "cringing in their bunkers", the defenders of Mary Ann were not prepared for a ground attack. This lack of readiness was not noted by the 196th LIB commander, Colonel William S. Hathaway during a visit to the base on 27 March, the day before the attack. He later stated that what he'd seen at Mary Ann that day [...] "was a big improvement over <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> before...the troops were alert." ...|$|E
