Although the first demonstrations by Bessemer in 1856 had been successful, later attempts to reproduce this were infamously failures. Work by the metallurgist Robert Forester Mushet discovered {{that the reason for}} this was the nature of the Swedish ores that Bessemer had innocently used, being very low in phosphorus. Using a typical European high-phosphorus ore in Bessemer's converter gave a poor quality steel. To produce high quality steel from a high-phosphorus ore, Mushet realised that he could operate the Bessemer converter for longer, burning off all the steel's impurities including the unwanted phosphorus and the essential carbon, but then re-adding carbon, with manganese, {{in the form of a}} previously obscure ferromanganese ore with no phosphorus, spiegeleisen. This created a sudden demand for spiegeleisen. Although it was not available in sufficient quantity as a mineral, steelworks such as that at Ebbw Vale in South Wales soon learned to make it from the spathic siderite ores. For a few decades, spathic ores were now in demand and this encouraged their mining. In time though, the original 'acidic' liner, made from siliceous sandstone or ganister, of the Bessemer converter was replaced by a 'basic' liner in the developed Gilchrist <b>Thomas</b> <b>process.</b> This removed the phosphorus impurities as slag, produced by chemical reaction with the liner, and no longer required spiegeleisen. From the 1880s demand for the ores fell once again and many of their mines, including those of the Brendon Hills, closed soon after.|$|E

This model captures {{the fact that the}} devices engaged in D 2 D communications need to be in close proximity of each other. For this model, we derive easy-to-use expressions for both coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE) assuming that the content of interest is available at a device chosen uniformly at random from the same cluster. One of the important consequences of this analysis is that there exists an optimal number of simultaneously active D 2 D-Txs that maximizes the ASE. This can be interpreted as the classical tradeoff between more aggressive frequency reuse and higher interference power. Our analysis also provides insights into the effect of scattering variance of each cluster and the density of cluster centers on coverage probability and ASE.

Our objective was to determine the spatial structure and identify the processes that may generate spatial patterns of trees in a tropical lowland rain forest community on Hainan Island of SouthChina. Methods Based on four models of point pattern analysis (homogenous Poisson process, inhomogenous Poisson process, homogenous <b>Thomas</b> <b>process</b> and inhomogenous <b>Thomas</b> <b>process),</b> we evaluated the potential contribution of habitat heterogeneity and dispersal limitation to the formation of spatial patterns of tree species in two 1 -hm 2 stem-mapped forest dynamic plots. The relative importance of each process was assessed at six different spatial scales (< 2 m, 2 – 5 m, 5 – 10 m, 10 – 15 m, 15 – 20 m and 20 – 25 m). Important findings All stems combined revealed a strong aggregation at short distance (≤ 2 m), and the degree of aggregation decreased with increasing distance. Among the four models simulating tree distribution and patterning, the homogeneous <b>Thomas</b> <b>process</b> was the best-fit model. This result suggested that spatial patterns of tree species in tropical lowland rain forest might be formed by dispersal limitation. The homogeneous Poisson process that models the effect of spatial complete randomness was the second-best model. The inhomogeneous <b>Thomas</b> <b>process</b> and inhomogeneous Poisson process were equally important to forming spatial patterns of trees; they simulated the joint effects of habitat associations and dispersal limitation and modeled heterogeneity, respectively. The proportion of best-fit models differed across different scales. The dispersal limitation was a most important mechanism in spatial patterning of tree species at most scales, while complete randomness process wassecond in importance. The joint effects of habitat associations and dispersal limitation mainly influenced tree distribution at small scales (0 – 5 m). However, habitat heterogeneity only affected the distribution at larger scales (15 – 25 m) ...|$|E
40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} of tropical tree populations {{may contribute to}} the identification of underlying ecological mechanisms such as dispersal, competition and pest and pathogen pressure. Classical structure functions for quantifying spatial patterns have limitations, for example, although Ripley’s K function is useful for identifying differences in spatial patterns through space, this makes it difficult to identify differences in spatial patterns through time. To complement Ripley’s K function, we use the <b>Thomas</b> <b>process,</b> a point pattern model, to quantify temporal changes in spatial patterns for five tropical tree species known to have density-dependent mortality from species-specific pests and/or pathogens on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We fit the data of each species to the model to estimate the cluster size (σ) and density of cluster centres (ρ). We compared spatial patterns based on the pair correlation function of the <b>Thomas</b> <b>process</b> determined from σ and ρ. We found reduced clustering over the past 20 years for Ocotea whitei (Lauraceae) and Quararibea asterolepis (Bombacaceae), the two species with the best-documented cases of pathogen and pest outbreaks on BCI, suggesting support for the Janzen-Connell Hypothesis; however, we reject the hypothesis because neither species showed spatial regularity throughout the census period.

40|$|Understanding spatial {{distribution}} patterns {{has been a}} central focus of plant ecology since its inception. Spatial patterns of individuals within populations are closely linked to processes; determining these underlying processes remains a major objective of ecological research. Spatial patterns are often determined using a point pattern, a data set consisting {{of a series of}} mapped point locations within a study area. The simplest and most widely used null model for analyzing point patterns is the complete spatial randomness (CSR) model. In fact, other null models are rarely used. This paper aims to provide guidance to ecologists when quantifying the underlying processes responsible for spatial patterns of ecological phenomena using point patterns and null models. Photography orientation was used to estimate the point pattern of Leymus chinensis in different restored successional stages in a typical steppe, and complete spatial randomness, Poisson and double-cluster processes were used to analyze spatial patterns of L. chinensis based on this data set. In the early stages of succession, the distribution of L. chinensis fit well with the nested double-cluster process for all scales in the community block of 10 m× 10 m. Over time, the distribution fits better with the <b>Thomas</b> <b>process</b> at all scales. This ecological succession phenomenon may be induced by intra-specific competition, but cannot be explained by density interactions. Population territory density could possibly explain the phenomenon.

40|$|The {{measurement}} and prediction of species' populations at different spatial scales {{is crucial to}} spatial ecology as well as conservation biology. An efficient yet challenging goal to achieve such population estimates consists of recording empirical species' presence and absence at a specific regional scale {{and then trying to}} predict occupancies at finer scales. So far the majority of the methods have been based on particular species' distributional features deemed to be crucial for downscaling occupancy. However, only a minority of them have dealt explicitly with specific spatial features. Here we employ a wide class of spatial point processes, the shot noise Cox processes (SNCP), to model species occupancies at different spatial scales and show that species' spatial aggregation is crucial for predicting population estimates at fine scales starting from coarser ones. These models are formulated in continuous space and locate points regardless of the arbitrary resolution that one employs to study the spatial pattern. We compare the performances of nine models, calibrated at regional scales and demonstrate that a very simple class of SNCP, the <b>Thomas</b> <b>process,</b> is able to outperform other published models in predicting occupancies down to areas four orders of magnitude smaller than the ones employed for the parameterization.

Spatial distribution patterns are simulated using a homogeneous Poisson process (HomP) and a homogeneous <b>Thomas</b> <b>process</b> (HomT). The simulated distributions are compared with the observed ones to explore correlations between certain tree species and several soil elements. The HomP model shows that all tested tree species are significantly correlated {{with at least one}} principal component in the upper-layer soil elements. The HomT model shows that only 36. 4 % of tree species are significantly correlated with the principal component of at least one upper-layer soil element. This result shows that the impact of dispersal limitation is greater than impact of environmental heterogeneity on species spatial distributions. The spatial autocorrelation of species induced by the dispersal limitation will largely conceal the plant-soil relationships caused by the heterogeneity of soil elements. An additional analysis shows that the elements in the upper soil layer which have the greatest impact on community niche structure are Pb, total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), Cu, Cr, Zn and available nitrogen (AN). The corresponding elements in the lower soil layers are Pb, TP, Cu, organic carbon (OC), Mn, total potassium (TK) and AN.

However, logistical and analytical limitations have curtailed our understanding concerning the mechanisms and resulting spatial patterns of contagious seed dispersal in most systems and, especially, in complex seed-disperser networks. We investigated mechanisms of seed aggregation using techniques of spatial point pattern analysis and extensive data sets on mutispecific endozoochorous seed rain generated by five frugivorous mammals in three Mediterranean shrublands over two seasons. Our novel analytical approach revealed three hierarchical and complementary mechanisms of seed aggregation acting {{at different levels}} (fecal samples, seeds, pairs of seed species) and spatial scales. First, the three local guilds of frugivores tended to deliver their feces highly aggregated at small and intermediate spatial scales, and the overall pattern of fecal delivery could be described well by a nested doublecluster <b>Thomas</b> <b>process.</b> Second, once the strong observed fecal aggregation was accounted for, the distribution of mammal feces containing seeds was clustered within the pattern of all feces (i. e., with and without seeds), and the density of fecal samples containing seeds was higher than expected around other feces containing seeds in two out of the three studied seeddisperser networks. Finally, at a finer level, mark correlation analyses revealed that for some plant species pairs, the number of dispersed seeds was positively associated either at small or large spatial scales. Despite the relatively invariant patterning of nested double-clustering, some attributes of endozoochorous seed rain (e. g., intensity, scales of aggregation) were variable among study sites due {{to changes in the}} ecological context in which seeds and their dispersers interact.
