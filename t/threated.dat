40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt to better {{understand}} the relationship between Finns and Russian minorities living in Finland. This study considers the role of perceived <b>threats</b> to the attitudes of Finnish adolescents towards Russian minorities. The theoretical framework for this study was the integrated <b>threat</b> theory (ITT). Even though ITT has been revised and <b>threats</b> have been reduced to two major <b>threats</b> (realistic and symbolic <b>threats)</b> (Stephan et al., 2015), this study utilized the original conceptualization of ITT which stipulates that prejudice and negative attitudes towards minorities can be explained by four types of <b>threats</b> that are: realistic <b>threats,</b> symbolic <b>threats,</b> negative stereotypes, and intergroup anxiety. Realistic <b>threats</b> are <b>threats</b> to the physical and economic wellbeing and political power of the in-group; symbolic <b>threats</b> are <b>threats</b> that arise because of differences in norms, values and morals with the out-group; negative stereotypes are implied <b>threats</b> to the in-group; and intergroup anxiety refers to the anxiety the in-group might experience in the process of interaction with members of the out-group especially when both groups have had a history of antagonism (Stephan & Stephan, 1996, 1998, 2000). First, this study showed Finns in general do percieve Russian minorities as a <b>threat</b> (realistic <b>threat,</b> symbolic <b>threat,</b> and negative stereotypes) and that among the different types of <b>threat,</b> realistic <b>threat</b> and symobolic <b>threat</b> were more prevalent among older Finns than among younger Finns. No significant difference was found between both groups for negative stereotypes. This study also showed perceived <b>threat</b> to be a significant predictor of prejudice, and that among the different types of <b>threat,</b> negative stereotyping was the strongest predictor of negative attitudes towards Russian minorities. This study also revealed that Finnish adolescents generally perceive immigrants as a <b>threat</b> and that among the different types of <b>threats,</b> realistic <b>threat</b> and symbolic <b>threat</b> were the most perceived <b>threats</b> from immigrants in Finland. This is especially important because realistic <b>threat</b> and symbolic <b>threat</b> were found to be positively related to prejudice or negative attitudes towards immigrants and this positive relationship between <b>threat</b> and prejudice was the same among early, middle, and late adolescents...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Psychology: Academic Research, 2011 This study {{investigated}} the relationship between perceptions of <b>threat</b> and attitudes toward same-sex marriage from the framework of intergroup <b>threat</b> theory (ITT). Intergroup <b>threat</b> theory postulates that outgroup prejudice and discrimination are driven by <b>threats</b> to the ingroup. <b>Threats</b> in ITT include realistic <b>threat</b> (i. e., perceived impediments to ingroup welfare), symbolic <b>threat</b> (i. e., <b>threats</b> {{to the integrity of}} ingroup worldview), and intergroup anxiety. As a set, <b>threats</b> explained 84 % of the variance in policy attitudes and 67 % of the variance in beneficiary attitudes. Symbolic <b>threat</b> was most strongly tied to policy opposition, followed by intergroup anxiety and realistic <b>threat.</b> Prejudice toward beneficiaries of same-sex marriage was predicted by symbolic <b>threat</b> and intergroup anxiety, but not realistic <b>threat.</b> This work supported the prediction that stronger perceptions of intergroup <b>threat</b> are associated with greater resistance to same-sex marriage and more prejudiced attitudes toward its beneficiaries.

40|$|Objective Previous {{studies on}} the {{relationship}} between <b>threat</b> and right-wing attitudes have tended to focus on either internal <b>threat,</b> emanating from one's private life, or external <b>threat,</b> originating from society. However, these studies failed to examine whether these types of <b>threats</b> constitute two distinctive dimensions and which of these <b>threats</b> is most closely related to right-wing attitudes. Method In order to explore the dimensions underlying <b>threat,</b> a factor analysis on a variety of <b>threat</b> scales was conducted (Study 1; N[*]=[*] 300). Furthermore, in a meta-analysis (Study 2; total N[*]=[*] 22, 086) and a questionnaire study in a large representative sample (Study 3, N[*]=[*] 800) the strength of the relationships of internal and external <b>threat</b> with right-wing attitudes were investigated. Results The present studies revealed that internal and external <b>threat</b> can be considered as two distinct dimensions underlying <b>threat.</b> Moreover, whereas external <b>threat</b> yielded strong relationships with right-wing attitudes, internal <b>threat</b> only explained a minor part of the variance in these attitudes.

Because large systems have many possible <b>threats</b> that may be interdependent, {{it is crucial that}} such <b>threats</b> be cataloged in a manner that allows for efficient representation and ease of analysis to identify the most critical <b>threats.</b> To address this problem, we model large system <b>threats</b> by conceptually representing them as a Cyber <b>Threat</b> Tree implemented as a directed graph known as a Multiple-Valued Decision Diagram (MDD). The cyber <b>threat</b> tree structure improves upon both the classical fault tree and attack tree structures by expanding the representation of possible system <b>threats.</b> This cyber <b>threat</b> tree model is incorporated into an existing MDD software package to help identify and catalog possible system <b>threats.</b> We have also developed a new formal language, CyTML, which is used to represent cyber <b>threat</b> trees.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} {{dissertation}} is to examine how <b>threats</b> influence creativity. Notwithstanding the value of creative solutions in response to <b>threats,</b> the effects of <b>threats</b> on creativity remain poorly understood. Past work has shown that <b>threats</b> can both increase and decrease creativity, without providing convincing reasons why. In this dissertation, it is proposed that creativity is about being motivated to realize goals that matter. Integrating the motivated focus account of creativity and theories on human <b>threat</b> management systems, the current work predicted that 1) people facing <b>threats</b> can be creative in threat-relevant domain through threat-induced motivated focus; and that 2) creativity under <b>threats</b> is highly specific and responsive to the particular features of <b>threats</b> (e. g., the direction of <b>threats),</b> situation resources (e. g., available time to react), and dispositional variables (e. g., dispositional <b>threat</b> sensitivity). In four empirical chapters, this general principle was tested using both intrapersonal (e. g., health <b>threats)</b> and interpersonal <b>threats</b> (e. g., violent assaults) {{with regards to the}} full cycle of creative problem solving, from the inclusive processing of information, through the generation of defense tactics, to the evaluation and selection of <b>threat</b> responses for implementation. Results show that <b>threats</b> do not have a generalized impact on creativity. Rather, they selectively enhance creativity that is relevant and functional in managing the specific <b>threat</b> at hand. Moreover, it is the motivated focus on coping with the specific <b>threat</b> that drives the enhancing effect of <b>threats</b> on threat-relevant creativity...|$|R
