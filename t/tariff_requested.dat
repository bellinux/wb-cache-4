25|$|The {{water and}} {{sanitation}} regulatory system in Chile is considered by the WHO {{to be a model}} not only for Latin America, but also for Europe.

50|$|The {{administrative}} procedure for ground-mounted PV systems was significantly modified in late 2009. The distinction between segments was essentially based on capacity, which determines {{the complexity of}} the administrative process. A call for tenders for PV projects above 250 kWp was launched on 15 September 2011. The projects were to be analysed on multiple criteria, including the <b>tariff</b> rate <b>requested</b> by the applicant.|$|R
25|$|The {{regulatory}} agency, the National Water and Sewerage Institute - Instituto Nicaragüense de Acueductos y Alcantarillados, INAA - is {{in charge}} of sector regulation. It handles customer complaints, approves tariff increases and can provide concessions for service providers. However, there were no <b>tariff</b> increase <b>requests</b> between August 2002 and February 2008 and no requests for concessions, so that the regulator has been condemned to inactivity.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Romania’s {{accession to}} the EU {{in relation to}} WTO commitments and adoption of the CAP. Projections are generated for 2006, assumed as a notional year for accession. Romania will not create {{a problem for the}} EU in relation to harmonisation of <b>tariff</b> bindings. <b>Requests</b> for compensation for decreased market access will be only for a few products and the amounts are insignificant. However, domestic support and export subsidy commitments might create problems for several main agricultural products. Consequently, Romania must employ policy measures that do not affect farmers’ prices and do not rely on high tariff protection...|$|R

25|$|An {{important}} element of the urban sector reform was that the government refrained from political interference and established tools to objectively and independently monitor the performance of ONEA. In the crucial field of cost recovery, a financial model of ONEA was developed in a participatory manner and applied, allowing the government to assess progress towards financial equilibrium of ONEA and providing an objective basis for further <b>tariff</b> revision <b>requests.</b> The government then approved <b>requests</b> for <b>tariff</b> increases submitted by the utility and justified by {{the outcome of the}} model’s calculations in a timely fashion, which was crucial to maintain the utility in good financial health. The Government also helped to strengthen the utility by not interfering with investment and staffing decisions and paying its water bills on time.|$|R

25|$|There are no {{autonomous}} {{regulatory agencies}} {{for water and}} sanitation in Germany at the state or federal level. The recently created federal regulatory agency for network industries (Bundesnetzagentur) covers telecommunications, postal services, electricity, gas and rail. It does not cover water supply and sanitation, since it is a responsibility of the states. Water and sanitation tariffs are approved through different procedures in each state, usually by a department in the state Ministry of Economy after {{a review of the}} <b>tariff</b> increase <b>request</b> by an independent auditor. In city-states (Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen) this means that the Minister (called Senator) of Economy both <b>requests</b> the <b>tariff</b> increase in his capacity as {{chairman of the board of}} the utility and also approves it, which constitutes a conflict of interest. In the case of some private utilities, tariffs are set by a mutually agreed arbitrator based on the professional opinion of an auditor.|$|R

The CAISO describes a RSSR as an import into the CAISO Balancing Authority Area for which the resource owner identifies the specific resource that will provide the services it is bidding into the CAISO markets. The CAISO notes that during the development of the MRTU <b>Tariff,</b> stakeholders <b>requested</b> the ability for RSSR owners to be eligible for Bid Cost Recovery, similar to owners of resources internal to the CAISO Balancing Authority Area (i. e., Participating Generators). The CAISO states that it supports permitting resources that provide imports to be eligible for Bid Cost Recovery, provided that there is an appropriate mechanism to enforce the requirements associated with eligibility for payment. According to the CAISO, this proposed 1 The CAISO states that the pro forma Agreement will be designated as Appendi...|$|R
25|$|Water {{and sewer}} tariffs in Costa Rica are {{approved}} by the regulatory agency ARESEP and instituted by AyA, the water and sewer agency for Costa Rica. Revenues from user fees do not cover {{operation and maintenance costs}} and the financial situation of the sector is weak. Furthermore, tariff levels do not allow for full cost recovery. In the case of AyA, there are cross-subsidies from San José to the other urban and rural areas of the country. The tariff is set based on short term cash flow needs rather than on real economic costs of service provision. AyA <b>requests</b> <b>tariff</b> increases when its financial situation is precarious and not a result of long-term investment planning.

40|$|The Millennium Round of the World Trade Organization will be {{critical}} in continuing the process of market expansion begun in the Uruguay Round of the GATT. Greater access to international markets {{is important to the}} continued growth and prosperity of U. S. agriculture. Trade growth is considered by some analysts to be crucial as U. S. farm programs change and producers become more dependent on commercial markets to maintain the size and scale of their farm and ranch operations. Some of the most likely areas to be considered for negotiation are: 1. Market Access- TRQ administration, transparency, and guaranteed minimum access will be major issues. Dirty tariffication, methods of tariff reduction, and specific <b>request</b> <b>tariff</b> reductions also will be key issues for market access negotiations. Minimum domestic purchase requirements used by some Latin American countries for grains may emerge as significant impediments to U. S. market access. Beef, pork, poultry, dairy products, grains, fruits and vegetables, oilseeds, sugar, and cotton may be most affected. 2. Export Subsidies- Export subsidy issues will relate to the need to develop a broader and clearer definition of subsidies, the possible inclusion of export credit as an export subsidy, and EU reform of the CAP and its impact on subsidy use. Beef and poultry, dairy products, wheat, rice, fruits an...|$|R
40|$|At {{the request}} of the Coalition for Affordable Solar Energy (CASE), The Brattle Group has studied the {{employment}} impacts of a proposed trade restriction on Chinese-manufactured crystalline photovoltaic cells and modules. This topic is timely, because the U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC) is currently reviewing a petition that would lead to substantial tariffs on Chinese-produced photovoltaic cells and modules. Petitioners have <b>requested</b> <b>tariffs</b> up to 250 % on Chinese-manufactured products in response to alleged government subsidies and below cost pricing. In brief, we estimate that tariffs will slow the growth in domestic demand for photovoltaic systems by homeowners, commercial establishments and utilities, resulting in substantial job losses. We estimate jobs at risk under two tariff levels – 50 % or 100 %. We find that a 50 % tariff will shut the vast majority of Chinese imports out of the U. S. market, and a 100 % tariff will effectively block them altogether. We also estimate employment impacts accounting for two scenarios, a low scenario which assumes low demand elasticity and high supply elasticity, and a high scenario which reflects a high demand elasticity and a low supply elasticity. We expect that on average module prices would be higher than currently projected {{over the next three years}} by roughly 25 - 30 %. Price increases of this magnitude may provide some assistance t...|$|R
