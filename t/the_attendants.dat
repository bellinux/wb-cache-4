5|$|Both of the attendants– Dakini to {{her left}} and Varnini to her right– are {{depicted}} nude, with matted or dishevelled hair, three-eyed, full-breasted, wearing the serpentine sacred thread and the mundamala, and carrying the skull-bowl in the left hand and the knife in the right. Sometimes, <b>the</b> <b>attendants</b> also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both are depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and drinking the dripping blood from Chhinnamasta's severed head, rather than her neck. <b>The</b> <b>attendants</b> are absent in some depictions.|$|E
5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of <b>the</b> <b>attendants</b> placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a ladle. The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests <b>the</b> <b>attendants,</b> the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, the negotiators slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E
5000|$|In larger PBXs <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> console {{may also}} be used to perform certain {{administrative}} tasks. Smaller systems may have all programming of the phone system done from <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> console. As <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> typically knows more about the phone system than other users, <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> console may be used to alert users to a problem with the phone system. As an example should a Definity ECS PBX have a problem, such as a hardware failure, it may activate an alarm light on the console so <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> can call for repair.|$|R
50|$|Trunk {{groups may}} also be {{assigned}} a button with an indicator light so <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> can monitor their use. If {{nearly all of the}} trunks in a trunk group are in use, the light illuminates. <b>The</b> <b>attendant</b> may push <b>the</b> button forcing all calls that would normally use the trunk to be routed to <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> console, thus allowing <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> to decide how to ration the remaining free trunks.|$|R

5|$|While {{the goddess}} is a mature sixteen-year old who has conquered her ego and awakened her kundalini, <b>the</b> <b>attendants</b> are {{described}} as spiritually immature twelve-year olds who are sustained on the goddess's blood and have not become liberated from the delusion of duality. In portrayals where the goddess's hair is tied like a matron and her attendants have free-flowing hair like young girls, the goddess is treated as a motherly figure of regal authority and power; the tied hair and headlessness represent contrasting ideas of controlled and uncontrolled nature, respectively.|$|E
5|$|In late July, the French {{escalated}} their {{push into}} Syria's major inland cities. On 23 July, French troops led by General Fernand Goubeau, {{commander of the}} Army of the Levant's Fourth Division, captured Aleppo without resistance. The lack of resistance was criticized by commander al-Sa'dun in his memoirs. In the aftermath of Aleppo's occupation, he organized 750 rebels to oust the French from the city, a plan that did not materialize. The consequent flight of Aleppo's Arab nationalist leaders to the countryside and the French forces' military superiority managed to stymie a potential revolt in the city. On 25 July, French forces captured Damascus a day after routing a small Arab Army contingent and armed volunteers led by Yusuf al-'Azma at the Battle of Maysalun. Following the loss of Aleppo and Damascus, Barakat arranged a meeting of Antiochian rebel leaders in al-Qusayr, in which <b>the</b> <b>attendants</b> were divided between those who advocated either of the following: continuing the revolt, surrendering to the French or approaching the Turks for support. After the meeting, Barakat chose to defect to the French. Afterward, al-Sa'dun and his fighters continued the revolt in Barakat's former area of operations.|$|E
5|$|Often the Matrikas are {{confused}} with the Yoginis, a group of sixty-four or eighty-one Tantric goddesses. In Sanskrit literature the Yoginis have been represented as <b>the</b> <b>attendants</b> or various manifestations of goddess Durga engaged in fighting with the demons Shumbha and Nishumbha, and the principal Yoginis are identified with the Matrikas. Other Yoginis are described as born from one or more Matrikas. The derivation of sixty-four Yoginis from eight Matrikas became a common tradition, by mid- 11th century. The Mandala (circle) and chakra of Yoginis were used alternatively. The eighty-one Yoginis evolve {{from a group of}} nine Matrikas, instead of seven or eight. The Saptamatrika (Brahmi, Maheshvari, Kumari, Vaishnavi, Varahi, Indrani and Chamunda) joined by Chandika and Mahalakshmi form the nine Matrika cluster. Each Matrika {{is considered to be a}} Yogini and is associated with eight other Yoginis resulting in the troupe of eighty-one (nine times nine). Thus, Yoginis are considered as manifestations or daughters of the Matrikas.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>attendant</b> console {{may also}} be sent other calls that the PBX may not {{otherwise}} know how to handle, such as direct inward dialed calls that are not associated with a valid extension. <b>The</b> <b>attendant</b> console typically has no restrictions about the types of calls that may be made from it so <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> may complete calls for restricted extensions. This is typically the case where a phone is placed in a public location, such as a lobby, but is set up so that it cannot dial long distance or international calls. Callers using the public phone must dial <b>the</b> <b>attendant,</b> who can complete the call for them.|$|R

25|$|The CST {{railway station}} was {{upgraded}} with metal detectors, but reports {{say that these}} are ineffective because <b>the</b> <b>attendants</b> cannot hear their beeps in the crowd. Civilians have tested these using their own licensed weapons.|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} attendants currently {{serve as}} a way to reassure passengers as the elevators are the primary entrance to the platforms, and passengers often wait for the elevators with an attendant. <b>The</b> <b>attendants</b> at the five stations are primarily maintenance and cleaning workers who suffered injuries that made it hard for them to continue doing their original jobs.|$|E
25|$|The mourners faces show strong emotions, {{but rather}} than despair, the mood is of grief and quite reflection. <b>The</b> <b>attendants</b> clothes are painted with highly {{saturated}} colors. St. John is dressed in scarlet, Mary in a blue dress, Mary Cleophas in olive and yellow. The {{lower part of the}} image is built from shades of gray and shows rock and small fragments of a landscape scene.|$|E
50|$|The {{story is}} often told with a moral. <b>The</b> <b>attendant</b> {{is often a}} lumberjack, a trucker, or a scary-looking man: someone the driver mistrusts without reason. She assumes it is <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> who wants to do her harm, when in reality it is he who saves her life.|$|R

25|$|Negotiations with attendants {{had been}} ongoing and {{contentious}} for several years. The flight attendants {{were unable to}} strike during negotiations because of a court injunction and the refusal of the mediation board to release them from bargaining which would have allowed the setting of a strike deadline. <b>The</b> <b>attendants</b> had been working under imposed pay cuts and work rules since July 2006 when a previous tentative agreement was rejected by 55 percent of the voting members.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the May 2007 agreement, {{union leaders}} had {{expressed}} concern that its defeat could prompt the National Mediation Board to recess talks indefinitely, resulting {{in the loss of}} a $182million bankruptcy claim <b>the</b> <b>attendants</b> had against Northwest. With the new agreement, the $182million claim was to eventually be sold for cash with an estimated pre-tax value of $15,000 to $18,000 per flight attendant. Other labor unions at Northwest received similar claims as part of their concessionary agreements.|$|E

In 1912, St. Vincent's received and treated victims after {{the sinking of the}} , while mourning the loss of attending physician Francis Norman O'Loughlin, who died in the disaster. A plaque honoring his memory stood in the hospital's main entrance as a reminder of his dedication and sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|Many {{churches in}} the American South still hold {{traditional}} sunrise services in cemeteries {{as a sign of}} recognition that Jesus no longer lay in the tomb on Easter morning. The service starts {{early in the morning and}} is timed so that <b>the</b> <b>attendants</b> can see the sun rise when the service is going. Services usually loosely follow the format of the church's normal service and can include music (hymns or praise band), dramatic scenes and the Easter message. After the service, the church may serve a breakfast for the attendees.|$|E

25|$|Connection is then {{established}} between the attenuated rovings and the spindles. When {{the latter are}} bare, as in a new mule, the spindle-driving motion is put into gear, and <b>the</b> <b>attendants</b> wind upon each spindle a short length of yarn from a cop held in the hand. The drawing-roller motion is placed in gear, and the rollers soon present lengths of attenuated roving. These {{are attached to the}} threads on the spindles, by simply placing the threads in contact with the un-twisted roving. The different parts of the machine are next simultaneously started, when the whole works in harmony together.|$|E

The film shows <b>the</b> <b>attendant's</b> various stops including the California Gold Rush, the Comstock Lode, and various other short appearances that never (literally) pan out. Yet as <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> finishes his story, a passerby spreads the news that there has indeed been gold found in the hills, to which <b>the</b> <b>attendant</b> steals <b>the</b> prospector's car to get back in on the gold rush and hands the prospector the gas station.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Simeon {{taught that}} Nadab and Abihu died {{only because they}} entered the Tent of Meeting drunk with wine.

The king did not say why he killed <b>the</b> first <b>attendant,</b> except that he told <b>the</b> second <b>attendant</b> not to enter the doorway of taverns, and thus the king indicated that he put <b>the</b> first <b>attendant</b> to death for such a reason. And thus God's command to Aaron in [...] to [...] "drink no wine nor strong drink" [...] indicates that Nadab and Abihu died precisely because of wine.|$|R
