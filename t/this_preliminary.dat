The battle opened when Union tug Zouave fired on the advancing enemy, and Beaufort replied. <b>This</b> <b>preliminary</b> skirmishing had no effect.

Return fire from Cumberland and Congress bounced off the iron plates without penetrating, although later some of Cumberlands payload lightly damaged Virginia.|$|E

In <b>this</b> <b>preliminary</b> sketch he is not on his knees, but thrusts his leg out to brace himself. He has an expression of defiance and determination, rather than the plea for mercy and posture of total defeat shown in the final work.|$|E
5|$|Aldona (baptized as Ona or Anna; her pagan name {{is known}} {{only from the}} {{writings}} of the 16th century chronicler Maciej Stryjkowski) married Casimir III of Poland, son of Władysław I of Poland, when he was 15 or 16 years old. The marriage took place on either 30 April or 16 October 1325, and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish–Lithuanian coalition against the Teutonic Knights (an alliance foreshadowing the Union of Krewo in 1385 and the Union of Lublin in 1569, with the latter resulting in a stable and powerful new state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). <b>This</b> <b>preliminary</b> coalition was short-lived, collapsing in about 1330, but {{there is no evidence of}} military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.|$|E

5|$|At {{the court}} in Ferrara, a {{collection}} of ladies skilled in music inspired the composer Luzzasco Luzzaschi and caught the Duke's interest. This group, {{which led to the}} formation of the concerto delle donne, performed within the context of the Duke's musica secreta, a regular series of chamber music concerts performed for an exclusive audience. <b>This</b> <b>preliminary</b> group was originally made up of talented but amateur members of the court: the sisters Lucrezia and Isabella Bendidio, Leonora Sanvitale, and Vittoria Bentivoglio. They were joined by bass Giulio Cesare Brancaccio, who was specifically brought to {{the court in}} 1577 for his singing ability. The preliminary ensemble was active throughout the 1570s, and its membership solidified in 1577. Only later did professionals replace these original singers.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 2010, United States women's {{national}} team head coach Pia Sundhage named a 30-player roster for two matches against China in October. The roster {{would then be}} narrowed down to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament. The players would {{take part in a}} training camp before the two matches starting on September 20. Although Harris was not one of the four goalkeepers on <b>this</b> <b>preliminary</b> roster, she was called into camp on September 23 to replace Hope Solo, who was recovering from a shoulder surgery. She was then named to the 24-player roster for the team's second match against China on October 6 in Philadelphia, although she did not dress for the match. She was not named to the 20-player roster for the 2010 CONCACAF Women's World Cup Qualifying tournament, but she did travel with the team to train.|$|E
5|$|The finance {{ministry}} {{started the}} budget preparation process by preparing instructions, forms and schedules {{for the upcoming}} state budget and prepared a preliminary balance of revenues and expenditures using data estimated by the State Planning Committee (Gosplan). <b>This</b> <b>preliminary</b> budget was then sent, together with instructions, to the all-Union ministries and ministries of finance of the Union's republics. The Union branches of the Ministry of Finance then prepared a budget estimate with information received from the lower Union ministries and information given {{to them by the}} all-Union Ministry of Finance. The state budget was conceived after the Union Ministry negotiated a compromise with its republican and local branches and each Soviet republic was given its own state budget. The Economic Committees of the Supreme Soviet voted on the state budget which, if it received enough support, would become policy.|$|E

5|$|After wasting their {{ammunition}} in <b>this</b> <b>preliminary</b> action, the Mahdist force began a flanking maneuver {{against the}} Belgians. The Mahdists' right flank, situated {{along the river}} parallel to the Nile, advanced rapidly trying to pin Chaltin {{with his back to}} the river. Chaltin, who by this time had advanced within two hundred meters of the Mahdists and begun a more effective barrage of his own, replied to the threat by ordering the sudden advance of his reserve companies. The move checked the advancing Mahdists, avoiding the unfavorable position and causing the rebels to falter. Sensing that victory was near, Chaltin ordered the Azande to charge the Mahdists to separate the advanced right wing from the rest of the line. The charge was successful, and the now considerably damaged Mahdist flanking force was completely cut off and surrounded by Free State soldiers. Chaltin's main companies then attacked, pressing the Mahdist defenses as they forced their way into the hills. Three of the companies attacked the well-defended path through the hills, while two others charged the hilltops. After a fierce contest for the heights, the demoralized and weakened Mahdist line broke and its remaining defenders fled to the north towards Rejaf, leaving ammunition and weapons. The action was finished by eight-thirty that morning.|$|E

25|$|In {{domestic}} policy, Maximilian {{launched a}} series of reforms at the 1495 Diet of Worms, at which the Imperial Chamber Court (Reichskammergericht) was launched as the highest court. Another new institution of 1495 was the Reichsregiment or Imperial government, meeting at Nuremberg. <b>This</b> <b>preliminary</b> exercise in democracy failed and was dissolved in 1502. Attempts at creating a unified state were not very successful, but rather re-emerged {{the idea of the}} three divisions of Austria that existed prior to the unification of Frederick and Maximilian.|$|E

25|$|Once a {{tribunal}} convened, {{the burden}} of proof was normally substantiated by escape reports from the internment camp commanders, arrest reports from police, and interrogations carried out by an official investigator, who was appointed to the court for a three-year term. <b>This</b> <b>preliminary</b> investigation was a laborious process, added to by the circumstances of the internees' travels during their escapes, and did not facilitate the swift execution of justice. The Swiss military justice system was quickly overwhelmed by the rash of escape attempts in the summer of 1944. For the minority of indicted internees who eventually received verdicts, the average sentence was 74 days in prison, but the average time to complete the investigations and military tribunals was 82 days.|$|E
25|$|As with {{virtually}} all of the test programs conducted during the war years, most of the actual flight test work on the P-59 was conducted by the contractor. Although Army Air Forces (AAF) pilots flew the aircraft from time to time, and flight test engineers from Wright Field reviewed the data, the formal preliminary military test and evaluation program did not commence until the Fall of 1943, a year after the first flight. Designed to validate the contractor's reports, <b>this</b> <b>preliminary</b> evaluation consisted of a very limited number of flights and was essentially completed within a month. Formal operational suitability and accelerated service tests did not get underway until 1944, well after the AAF had decided that the airplane would not be suitable for combat operations and would, instead, be relegated to a training role.|$|E
