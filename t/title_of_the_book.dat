5|$|Satisfied {{with his}} skills, the {{publishers}} asked Tolkien {{to design a}} dust jacket. This project, too, {{became the subject of}} many iterations and much correspondence, with Tolkien always writing disparagingly of his own ability to draw. The runic inscription {{around the edges of the}} illustration are a phonetic transliteration of English, giving the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> and details of the author and publisher. The original jacket design contained several shades of various colours, but Tolkien redrew it several times using fewer colours each time. His final design consisted of four colours. The publishers, mindful of the cost, removed the red from the sun to end up with only black, blue, and green ink on white stock.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} sonic {{weapon was}} one which had been unsuccessfully pioneered by German {{scientists}} {{under the control of}} Albert Speer during World War II. A book that Tintin examines in Professor Topolino's house, German Research in World War II by Leslie E. Simon– a retired Major General in the US Army– really existed and was published in 1947. In the strip, Hergé preserved the English language <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> rather than translating it into French, although altered the book's cover design to remove a prominent swastika. The inclusion of the book {{is one of the few}} instances that there is any reference to the Second World War within The Adventures of Tintin.|$|E

5|$|South Wind Through the Kitchen (1997) was the {{completion}} {{of one of the}} projects of David's later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and recipes are taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, and is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.|$|E

25|$|In 1557, the Scots Protestant lords {{had adopted}} the English Prayer Book of 1552, for {{reformed}} worship in Scotland. However, when John Knox returned to Scotland in 1559, {{he continued to}} use the Form of Prayer he had created for the English exiles in Geneva and, in 1564, this supplanted the Book of Common Prayer under the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Book</b> of Common Order.|$|E
25|$|The actual <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{commonly}} referred to as Sahih al-Bukhari, according to Ibn al-Salah, is: al-Jaami’ al-Sahih al-Musnad al-Mukhtasar min Umuri Rasooli-llahi wa sunanihi wa Ayyaamihi. A word-for-word translation of the title is: The Abridged Collection of Authentic Hadith with Connected Chains regarding Matters Pertaining to the Prophet, His practices and His Times. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani mentioned the same title, replacing the word umur (English: matters) with hadith.|$|E

25|$|Educating Eve: The 'Language Instinct' Debate {{is a book}} by Geoffrey Sampson, {{providing}} {{arguments against}} Noam Chomsky's theory of a human instinct for (first) language acquisition. Sampson explains the original <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> as a deliberate allusion to Educating Rita (1980), and uses the plot of that play to illustrate his argument. Sampson's book {{is a response to}} Steven Pinker's The Language Instinct specifically and Chomskyan linguistic nativism broadly.|$|E
25|$|The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> {{refers to}} the symbol adopted by the National Recovery Administration. The National Industrial Recovery Act was enacted by Congress in 1933 to stimulate the American economy and help the nation recover from the Great Depression. The law created the NRA to {{administer}} the act. Section 7(a) of the Act promoted the formation of labor unions, and created a tremendous upsurge of union organizing.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Richards {{published}} his autobiography entitled Hitting Across the Line. In the book, Richards describes how {{his whole life}} revolved around sports, cricket in particular. Of special interest is his technique, expressed by the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book.</b> To hit across {{the line of the}} ball is considered taboo, and dangerously risky. However, Richards' explanation of the conditions in which he played cricket in Antigua as a child, explains how this technique came to be.|$|E

25|$|A Change of Tongue, {{her second}} work of prose in English, recounts {{ten years of}} {{evolution}} after South Africa's first democratic elections. A post-modern blend of fiction, poetry, and reportage it explores the surprising and predictable changes that South Africans have made since abandoning apartheid. At times humorous, she weaves strands of autobiography with the stories of others to document struggles for identity, truth and salvation. The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> has political and private meanings: the diminishing role of Afrikaans in public discourse is reflected in her own flight into English as the vernacular of her work.|$|E
25|$|As {{is implied}} in the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> two {{elements}} mark the thesis of Being and Event: the place of ontology, or 'the science of being qua being' (being in itself), and {{the place of the}} event – which is seen as a rupture in being – through which the subject finds realization and reconciliation with truth. This situation of being and the rupture which characterizes the event are thought in terms of set theory, and specifically Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with the axiom of choice), to which Badiou accords a fundamental role in a manner quite distinct from the majority of either mathematicians or philosophers.|$|E
25|$|Leicestershire {{benefited from}} his return, winning four one day trophies and the County Championship in 1975. After announcing his {{retirement}} from the first-class game in 1978 {{he returned to}} Headingley to manage the Yorkshire team, despite his testy relationship with Geoff Boycott. In 1982, faced with an under-performing team on the field, he made {{a return to the}} playing arena and replaced Chris Old as captain. The side won the Sunday League in his final season in 1983 but failed in the championship, finishing bottom for the first time ever. The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> he wrote about this era was The Tempestuous Years.|$|E

25|$|In An Nam chí lược, Lê Tắc {{recounted the}} history {{and other aspects of}} his country Đại Việt from its {{beginning}} to the reign of the Trần Dynasty. The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> literally means Abbreviated Records of An Nam with An Nam (Pacified South) was the Chinese name for Vietnam during the Tang Dynasty, thus An Nam chí lược was written with a Chinese bias. The contents of An Nam chí lược are arranged in 20 chapters (quyển), except for details dating from Lê Tắc's lifetime, An Nam chí lược is derived almost entirely from Chinese accounts and contains some records that cannot be found elsewhere. Today 19 chapters are preserved in the original form except the 20th chapter named Danh công đề vịnh An Nam chí that was lost.|$|E
25|$|Swift's {{explanation}} for the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>book</b> is that the Ship of State was threatened by a whale (specifically, the Leviathan of Thomas Hobbes) and the new political societies (the Rota Club is mentioned). His book {{is intended to be}} a tub that the sailors of state (the nobles and ministers) might toss over the side to divert the attention of the beast (those who questioned the government and its right to rule). Hobbes was highly controversial in the Restoration, but Swift's invocation of Hobbes might well be ironic. The narrative of the brothers is a faulty allegory, and Swift's narrator is either a madman or a fool. The book is not one that could occupy the Leviathan, or preserve the Ship of State, so Swift may be intensifying the dangers of Hobbes's critique rather than allaying them to provoke a more rational response.|$|E
