5|$|The {{music is}} concertante and virtuoso {{for both the}} <b>trumpet</b> and the soloist. The first aria and the {{concluding}} Alleluja are {{in the style of}} an Italian concerto. Dürr observes that the five movements are in five different musical forms: concerto, monody, variation, chorale fantasia and fugue. The scoring is richest in the outer movements (with the <b>trumpet),</b> and reduced to just continuo in the central aria.|$|E
5|$|Both the soprano part, {{which covers}} two octaves and {{requires}} a high C, and the solo <b>trumpet</b> part, which at times trades melodic lines with the soprano {{on an equal}} basis, are extremely virtuosic. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr assumes that Bach had an unusually gifted singer, adding that a female voice was unlikely in conservative Leipzig. According to Joshua Rifkin Christoph Nichelmann is a possible candidate because Bach being aware of his capabilities accepted him willingly to the Thomasschule and Nichelmann matriculated into the school {{three weeks before the}} first performance. The <b>trumpet</b> part was probably written for Gottfried Reiche, Bach's principal trumpeter at the time. The scoring is unique in Bach's cantatas, but was frequently used by Italian composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti. Bach's son Friedemann Bach arranged the work by adding a second <b>trumpet</b> and timpani.|$|E

5|$|After passing exit 42, {{the turnpike}} curves away from US-81, turning {{northeast}} toward El Dorado and Emporia. It crosses the Arkansas River between Exits 42 and 45. Exit 45 (Wichita, K-15)) is a <b>trumpet</b> connection to K-15 in southern Wichita. It opened in 1956 {{as one of}} the original interchanges. As the highway continues northeast through Wichita, it comes to Exit 50 (East Wichita), a double-trumpet connection to the parallel Kellogg Avenue, which carries US-54 and US-400. It is one of the original 1956 interchanges. Exit 53, the final Wichita exit, is a <b>trumpet</b> connection to the K-96 freeway. The connector road junctions K-96 at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange and ends at 127th Street East. The interchange opened c. 1994 along with the nearby piece of K-96.|$|E
5|$|An unknown {{librettist}} retained four {{of these}} seven combined stanzas, using {{the first and the}} two last unchanged as customary, and expanding the third by adding text for a recitative. He paraphrased the other stanzas for two arias and another recitative. Bach structured the cantata in six movements and scored it for three vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of <b>trumpet,</b> oboe, strings and continuo. The first movement is a chorale fantasia dominated by the <b>trumpet.</b> In the unusual third movement, Bach has an alto and a tenor voice alternate for the recitative, while they sing the lines from the third hymn stanza in a duet. The fourth movement is a dramatic bass aria, accompanied by a restless continuo. Due to the compiled hymns, the melody of the closing two stanzas is different from the one used in movements 1 and 3.|$|E

5|$|For the 1733 version, Bach used a {{somewhat}} more extended orchestra: the recorders are replaced by traversos (Fl) and they get separate parts in all four choral movements. In movements three and four the oboes are replaced by oboes d'amore (Oa). In the 10th movement (Suscepit Israel) the oboes replace the <b>trumpet</b> for the obbligato instrumental part.|$|E
5|$|For {{the feast}} of Visitation of 1733, Bach {{produced}} {{a new version of}} his Latin Magnificat, without the Christmas hymns: instrumentation of some movements was altered or expanded, and the key changed from E-flat major to D major, for performance reasons of the <b>trumpet</b> parts. This version of Bach's Magnificat is known as BWV 243.|$|E
