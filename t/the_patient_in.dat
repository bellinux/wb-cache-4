5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of <b>the</b> <b>patient.</b> <b>In</b> this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{present the}} {{clinical}} features and outcomes of outpatients {{who suffer from}} refractory ascites. METHODS: This prospective observational study consecutively enrolled patients with cirrhotic ascites who submitted to a clinical evaluation, a sodium restriction diet, biochemical blood tests, 24 hour urine tests and an ascitic fluid analysis. All patients received a multidisciplinary evaluation and diuretic treatment. Patients who {{did not respond to}} the diuretic treatment were controlled by therapeutic serial paracentesis, and a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt was indicated for patients who required therapeutic serial paracentesis up to twice a month. RESULTS: The most common etiology of cirrhosis in both groups was alcoholism [49 refractory (R) and 11 non-refractory ascites (NR) ]. <b>The</b> majority of <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> refractory group had Child-Pugh class B cirrhosis (p= 0. 034). The nutritional assessment showed protein-energy malnutrition in 81. 6 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> R group and 35. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NR group, while hepatic encephalopathy, hernia, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, upper digestive hemorrhage and type 2 hepatorenal syndrome were present in 51 %, 44. 9 %, 38. 8 %, 38. 8 % and 26. 5 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> R group and 9. 1 %, 18. 2 %, 0 %, 0 % and 0 % of <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NR group, respectively (p= 0. 016, p= 0. 173, p= 0. 012, p= 0. 012, and p= 0. 100, respectively).
