40|$|Combined {{with the}} {{shortcomings}} of the media’s reporting, the government’s weaknesses are hiding some pretty good news, writes Rodney Tiffen in Inside StoryTHINK {{for a moment about}} all we have learned about Kevin Rudd over the past few weeks. An eminent author, David Marr, has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> the PM is motivated primarily by anger, stemming from a traumatic period in his childhood. A voice coach has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> has an unpleasant voice. Retailer Gerry Harvey has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> Rudd and his government are hopeless salesmen. Billionaire miner “Twiggy” Forrest has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> taking the country in a communist direction. And his brother Greg  has <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not impressed by the job Rudd is doing as prime minister. This is the man who a year ago was still enjoying record approval ratings, having won a sweeping election victory eighteen months earlier. His prolonged honeymoon was accompanied by extravagant flattery, praising his political genius, his capacious work ethic, his ability to mix social vision with practical politics. The turnaround could hardly be more complete. It is another case supporting the view that the media are either [...] . Read the full articlePhoto: Drew Douglas/ Flick...|$|R

60|$|His name, as I have said, was Jackson; and he <b>told</b> <b>us,</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a near {{relation}} of General Jackson of New Orleans, and swore terribly, {{if any one}} ventured to question what he asserted on that head. In fact {{he was a great}} bully, and being the best seaman on board, and very overbearing every way, all the men were afraid of him, and durst not contradict him, or cross his path in any thing. And what made this more wonderful was, that he was the weakest man, bodily, of the whole crew; and I have no doubt that young and small as I was then, compared to what I am now, I could have thrown him down. But he had such an overawing way with him; such a deal of brass and impudence, such an unflinching face, and withal was such a hideous looking mortal, that Satan himself would have run from him. And besides all this, it was quite plain, that he was by nature a marvelously clever, cunning man, though without education; and understood human nature to a kink, and well knew whom he had to deal with; and then, one glance of his squinting eye, was as good as a knock-down, for it was the most deep, subtle, infernal looking eye, that I ever saw lodged in a human head. I believe, that by good rights it must have belonged to a wolf, or starved tiger; at any rate, I would defy any oculist, to turn out a glass eye, half so cold, and snaky, and deadly. It was a horrible thing; and I would give much to forget that I have ever seen it; for it haunts me to this day.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as he}} set {{his foot}} on board our ship, and saw himself safe, he dropped down stone dead, to all appearance; not the least sign of life could be {{perceived}} in him; our surgeon immediately applied proper remedies to recover him; and was {{the only man in}} the ship that believed he was not dead: and at length he opened a vein in his arm, having first chafed and rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much as possible: upon this the blood, which only dropped at first, flowed something freely; in three minutes after the man opened his eyes; and about {{a quarter of an hour}} after that he spoke, grew better, and, in a little time, quite well; after the blood was stopped he walked about, <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> perfectly well, took a dram of cordial which the surgeon gave him, and was, what we called, come to himself; about a quarter of an hour after this they came running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a French woman that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark mad. It seems he had begun to revolve the change of his circumstances in his mind, and this put him into an ecstasy of joy: his spirits whirled about faster than the vessels could convey them; the blood grew hot and feverish; and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was in it; the surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition, but gave him something to doze and put him to sleep, which, after some time, operated upon him, and he waked next morning perfectly composed and well.|$|E
60|$|My anxiety to {{know how}} Sir Percival and the Count would occupy {{the early part of}} the day was by no means set at rest, so far as Sir Percival was concerned, by his leaving us {{immediately}} after breakfast, and going out by himself, in spite of the rain. <b>He</b> neither <b>told</b> <b>us</b> where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going nor when we might expect him back.

60|$|At that time, {{and for a}} {{good many}} weeks after that time, Richard was {{constant}} in his visits. Besides coming every Saturday or Sunday and remaining with us until Monday morning, he sometimes rode out on horseback unexpectedly and passed the evening with us and rode back again early next day. He was as vivacious as ever and <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> very industrious, but I was not easy in my mind about him. It appeared to me that his industry was all misdirected. I could not find that it led to anything but the formation of delusive hopes in connexion with the suit already the pernicious cause of so much sorrow and ruin. He had got {{at the core of}} that mystery now, he told us, and nothing could be plainer than that the will under which he and Ada were to take I don't know how many thousands of pounds must be finally established if there were any sense or justice in the Court of Chancery--but oh, what a great IF that sounded in my ears--and that this happy conclusion could not be much longer delayed. He proved this to himself by all the weary arguments on that side he had read, {{and every one of them}} sunk him deeper in the infatuation. He had even begun to haunt the court. He told us how he saw Miss Flite there daily, how they talked together, and how he did her little kindnesses, and how, while he laughed at her, he pitied her from his heart. But he never thought--never, my poor, dear, sanguine Richard, capable of so much happiness then, and with such better things before him--what a fatal link was riveting between his fresh youth and her faded age, between his free hopes and her caged birds, and her hungry garret, and her wandering mind.|$|E
6000|$|Next morning Campbell {{received}} a hint {{that this was}} a good opportunity for a vigorous remonstrance. The Dewan came with Tchebu Lama, his own younger brother (who was his pony driver), and the Lassoo Kajee. The latter had for two months placed himself in an attitude of hostility opposite Dorjiling, with a ragged company of followers, but he now sought peace and friendship as much as the Dewan; the latter <b>told</b> <b>us</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> waiting for a reply to a letter addressed to Mr. Lushington, after which he would set us free. Campbell said: [...] "As you appear to have made up your mind, why not dismiss us at once?" [...] He answered that we should go the next day at all events: Here I came in, and on hearing from Campbell what had passed, I added, that he had better for his own sake let us go at once; that the next day was our great and only annual Poojah (religious festival) of Christmas, when we all met; whereas he and his countrymen had dozens in the year. As for me, he knew I had no wife, nor children, nor any relation, within thousands of miles, and it mattered little where I was, he was only bringing ruin on himself by his conduct to me as the Governor-General's friend; but as regarded Campbell, the case was different; his home was at Dorjiling, which was swarming with English soldiers, all in a state of exasperation, and if he did not let us depart before Christmas, he would find Dorjiling too hot to hold him, let him offer what reparation he might for the injuries he had done us. I added: [...] "We are all ready to go--dismiss us." [...] The Dewan again turned to Campbell, who said, [...] "I am quite ready; order us ponies at once, and send our luggage after us." [...] He then ordered the ponies, and three men, including Meepo, to attend us; whereupon we walked out, mounted, and made off with all speed.|$|E

Just remember, Gabriel--try if you can't remember the time before I was bedridden, ten years ago and more--it was about six weeks, you know, before your mother's death; you can remember it by that.
