40|$|Introduction: The Local Government (Auckland Reorganisation) Bill (henceforth “the bill”) {{passed through}} its {{first and second}} readings, {{committee}} stage, and third reading under urgency from 13 to 16 May 2009. The passage of the bill was fraught, with more than 30, 000 amendments tabled at the committee stage. It called into question the fitness of the House’s practices regarding the <b>tabling</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> in the digital age and prompted discussion of whether the use of delaying tactics brought the House into disrepute. These events had a strong influence on the revision of related Standing Orders that came into effect for the following Parliament. Auckland’s local government {{was the subject of}} an inquiry by a Royal Commission established in October 2007 by the Clark Government. The Royal Commission reported in March 2009. It proposed replacing all existing councils with a single unitary authority. • by Peter Hoare, Parliamentary Officer (Table), New Zealand House of Representatives ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} the {{drafting}} and operation of amending legislation {{in the light of}} two paradigms of statute law. Part One examines the paradigm which developed in Great Britain in the nineteenth century. That paradigm emphasized the fragmentary character of the statute law.

It emphasizes the potential coherence of the statute law and tries to realise this potential through statute revision and the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment.</b> The consequences <b>of</b> the use <b>of</b> textual <b>amendment</b> for the operation of amending enactments are examined. The thesis also considers the argument that the use of re-enactment as a technique <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> is undesirable because it opens up for parliamentary <b>amendment</b> more <b>of</b> the act proposed to be amended than do other techniques <b>of</b> <b>amendment.</b> (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R
