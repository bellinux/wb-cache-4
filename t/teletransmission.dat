This user database should take related data from the fundamental databases on Information Systems (ISs) from various authorized state or private institutions, in charge of acquisition, processing and storing data from their domain. Various weather forecasts and reports, different cadastres, topological and other thematic maps are resulted from these fundamental databases, which are very useful for MISIDS. Synergetic concept for development of monitoring system {{for the needs of}} MISIDS is provided, which includes both, public and user monitoring systems.

40|$|HYPOTHESIS: Telemedicine for {{real-time}} {{transmission of}} clinical documents and interactive remote telediagnosis allows accurate clinical application in surgery. DESIGN: Prospective cohort {{study in which}} 2 hospitals, 120 miles apart, were connected via integrated services digital network (ISDN) teleconferencing units, and each evaluated clinical cases in real time. SETTING: A tertiary care university hospital and primary care county hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Between May 1, 1998, and June 30, 1998, 112 patients undergoing digestive or endocrine surgery were evaluated by <b>teletransmission</b> (study group) and direct vision (control group). Diagnosis had to be known by the viewer, and either conventional magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans were available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Picture quality, organ structure, and pathologic finding viewed on telemedicine documents were evaluated by radiologists and surgeons blind to diagnosis. Accuracy of remote 128 -kilobit (kb) /s transmission-rate diagnoses and results were compared with those obtained directly. RESULTS: Picture quality was "good" or "excellent" in 92. 9 % of transmitted documents and 95. 5 % of live images (P>. 4). The target organ was always recognized, structure and pathologic finding were analyzable in 98. 2 % of transmitted documents and 99. 1 % of live documents, and fine structures were assessable in 89. 3 % of transmitted pictures and 95. 5 % of live pictures (P>. 05). Diagnosis was made in 84. 8 % of transmitted cases and 93. 8 % of live cases (P =. 02). CONCLUSIONS: Low bandwidth (128 kb/s) telemedicine application in surgery is reliable in evaluating remote cases. Loss of image quality through <b>teletransmission</b> occurred in 2. 7 % of cases, and diagnosis was not possible in 15. 2 % of transmitted vs 6. 2 % of live cases, suggesting factors other than technical quality (choice of radiological studies, additional clinical information required, etc).

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{high levels of}} {{achievement}} and efficiency, image digitalization and <b>teletransmission</b> tools {{are more and more}} frequently used. Applied to cellular haematology, these tools often contribute to diagnosis confrontation, sometimes within the framework of therapeutic trials. We present one of the first approaches of the use of telehaematology for the inclusion of patients in the GOELAMS chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 98 trial. The advantages were (1) the creation of a unique, protected, stable data bank that could be remotely consulted, (2) the use of digitized pictures which made expertise on identical documents possible, (3) the facility of computer exchanges between experts, in terms of reception as well as replying time delays. We were able to set out new standards of image sampling for CLL, solve the semantic divergences, and point out interobserver variability as regards morphology. The limiting factors were the important need for expert investment, but they more importantly concerned the first line morphologists who should benefit from adequate tools, in terms of computer equipment as well as members of staff, so as to apprehend this second reading system as a quality control procedure...|$|E
40|$|The HHH {{study will}} be a full scale {{randomized}} controlled trial in Italy, Poland and UK enrolling 450 CHF patients (LVEF < 40 %, NYHA cl. II-IV) in 2 arms (usual clinical practice and home-care strategy). Objectives will be: (1) to determine if different strategies of home-care telemonitoring, affect hospital admissions, improve patient sense of well-being, and reduce overall costs of medical care; (2) to define the prevalence and the clinical impact of breathing disorders, arrhythmias and abnormalities of HRV in the occurrence of acute periods of instability and when on optimal therapy; (3) to evaluate in the home setting a new system for continuous monitoring of cardio-respiratory signals plus physical activity with <b>teletransmission</b> of recorded data embedded in an interactive voice response based telehealth system. The 300 'home strategy' patients will be divided into: (1) normal clinical practice supplemented by telephone contacts; (2) as strategy 1 plus periodic telemonitoring of vital signs parameters; (3) as 2 deg; strategy plus periodic 24 h ECG, respiration and physical activity (NICRAM) recording. Enrolment will be over 12 months with a further 12 months follow-up. The primary end-point will be total bed-days occupancy for heart failure in acute medical/surgical beds.

40|$|Background: Cardiac {{surgery is}} {{generally}} well or over-represented in many Western countries. Since {{the southern part}} of Switzerland relies on 300 km distance centers for cardiac surgery, we started a project of telemedicine for the distant evaluation of cardiac surgery candidates. We report our experience {{of the results of the}} diagnosis made by telemedicine and by direct scrutiny of coronary angiograms. Methods: Coronary angiography was performed at the distant hospital by an invasive cardiology team. <b>Teletransmission</b> of images was performed using three Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN) lines by direct transmission of recent recording. A total of 98 cases were reviewed (87 aorto-coronary bypass candidates, seven valvular and four congenital heart disease). We further performed a prospective blinded comparison of 47 consecutive cases with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) with respect to localization and number of significant coronary lesions, obtained by direct scrutiny of the original angiograms and the evaluation obtained with the teletransmitted images. Results: In 89 cases of the 98 analyzed (91 %) correct diagnosis and surgical approach could be established by distant transmission. In nine cases (9 %, all aortocoronary bypass candidates) definitive diagnosis and treatment was feasible only by direct scrutiny of the original angiograms. Five critically ill patients were urgently referred to the surgical care center based on the correct distant diagnosis. The blinded comparison of distant diagnosis and direct scrutiny of angiograms in defining 1 - 2 - 3 vessel CAD was good: r= 0. 87, P≪ 0. 01. Conclusion: Initial experience using non-sophisticated telemedical transmission of angiograms of cardiac surgery candidates seems to be a promising facility for distantly located center...|$|E
40|$|Methodology of {{designing}} applications for informatics in state administration organs represents a creative adaptation of experience gained {{mainly in the}} course of applying informatics in tho industry. It also takes into account typical conditions and complex nature of management and administration as well as a fact that all activities on the macroeconomic scale carry a much bigger burden of uncertainty than operations on the company's scale. The present trends in designing computer-based information systems in Wrocław administrative province of Poland are as follows : 1) designing of branch systems as independent functional units consisting of data files (unit, aggregated), and functional programmes created exclusively for those systems and serving collection and multiplication of data, accumulation and generation of output; 2) integration of data and systems into bigger functional units serving a much wider range of functions of different departments in the Provincial Administration Office; 3) adaptation of programme packages possessing features of management systems of data bases. Recently there can be observed birth and growing popularity in practice of the data base concept making possible designing of applications for informatics increasingly better adapted to steering of socio-economic process being very complex und characterized with big dynamics. The data base concept will substantially affect changes in methodology {{of designing}} informatics applications for regional administration purposes while in the provincial administration offices there will be founded three types of computer-based information systems: 1) department information systems; 2) interdepartment data bases with subject or problem orientation;. 3) integrated data base in the System of Information for Provincial Administration Executives. Evolution of designing from branch systems prooessed on piece-meal basis to multisubject and integrated data bases with a possibility of work in real time and long-distance transfer of information (data <b>teletransmission)</b> will change informatics into an elastic tool of management and administration.

40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} use of pill-sized ingestible capsule telemetric sensors for assessing core body temperature (Tc) as a potential indicator of variability in metabolic efficiency and thrifty metabolic traits. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the feasibility and accuracy of measuring Tc using the CorTemp® system. Methods: Tc was measured over an average of 20 h in 27 human subjects, with measurements of energy expenditure made in the overnight fasted state at rest, during standardized low-intensity physical activity and after a 600 kcal mixed meal. Validation of accuracy of the capsule sensors was made ex vivo against mercury and electronic thermometers across the physiological range (35 – 40 °C) in morning and afternoon of 2 or 3 consecutive days. Comparisons between capsule sensors and thermometers were made using Bland–Altman analysis. Systematic bias, error, and temperature drift over time were assessed. Results: The circadian Tc profile classically reported in free-living humans was confirmed. Significant increases in Tc (+ 0. 2 °C) were found in response to low-power cycling at 40 – 50 W (~ 3 – 4 METs), but no changes in Tc were detectable during low-level isometric leg press exercise (< 2 METs) or during the peak postprandial thermogenesis induced by the 600 kcal meal. Issues of particular interest include fast “turbo” gut transit with expulsion time of < 15 h after capsule ingestion in one out of every five subjects and sudden erratic readings in <b>teletransmission</b> of Tc. Furthermore, ex vivo validation revealed a substantial mean bias (exceeding ± 0. 5 °C) between the Tc capsule readings and mercury or electronic thermometers in half of the capsules. When examined over 2 or 3 days, the initial bias (small or large) drifted in excess of ± 0. 5 °C in one out of every four capsules. Conclusion: Since Tc is regulated within a very narrow range in the healthy homeotherm’s body (within 1 °C), physiological investigations of Tc require great accuracy and precision (better than 0. 1 °C). Although ingestible capsule methodology appears of great interest for non-invasively monitoring the transit gut temperature, new technology requires a reduction in the inherent error of measurement and elimination of temperature drift and warrants more interlaboratory investigation on the above factors...|$|E
