Moreover, aesthetic experience is highly individual, with observers varying significantly in their {{responses to}} the same artwork. Combining fMRI and behavioral analysis of individual differences in aesthetic response, we identify two distinct patterns of neural activity exhibited by different sub-networks. Activity increased linearly with observers' ratings (4 -level scale) in sensory (occipito-temporal) regions. Activity in the striatum (STR) also varied linearly with ratings, with below-baseline activations for low-rated artworks. In contrast, a network of frontal regions showed a step-like increase only for the most moving artworks (“ 4 ” ratings) and non-differential activity for all others. This included several regions belonging to the “default mode network” (DMN) previously associated with self-referential mentation.

40|$|Background: The {{attribution}} of <b>personal</b> <b>relevance,</b> i. e. relating {{internal and external}} stimuli to establish a sense of belonging, is a common phenomenon in daily life. Although previous research demonstrated a relationship between reward and <b>personal</b> <b>relevance,</b> <b>their</b> exact neuronal relationship including the impact of personality traits remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we applied an experimental paradigm that allowed us to explore the neural response evoked by reward and the {{attribution of}} <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> separately. We observed different brain regions previously reported to be active during reward and <b>personal</b> <b>relevance,</b> including the bilateral caudate nucleus and the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC).

40|$|Folk wisdom {{suggests}} that a negotiator (1) should avoid getting emotional and (2) is a passive recipient of the whims of emotion. In this article, I argue that both of these notions are false and that a better pair of assumptions is that (1) emotions can positively affect our ability to reach negotiation goals and (2) we can actively negotiate which emotions are experienced and how intensely. I extend the emotional appraisal work of Lazarus (1991) and Parkinson (1995) by suggesting that we appraise situations emotionally for <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> by evaluating relational identity concerns—namely, autonomy and affiliation. Negotiating emotions entails negotiating these relational identity concerns and the tensions that a conflicting set of concerns can create. Folk wisdom offers straightforward advice on dealing with emotions in negotiation: don’t get emotional. Negotiators are urged to “show no fear, ” “don’t be sad, ” “swallow your pride, ” “don’t worry, ” and deny any hint of emotion. A problem with this advice is that it rarely helps, and it often makes things worse. Negotiators are always feeling some emotion. Even if parties manage to suppress emotional expression, their negative emotional experience remains; their attempt to suppress emotions consumes extra cognitive energy; and physiological arousal increases, both personally and in their negotiating partner (Gross, 2002). Nevertheless, {{there are good reasons}} for folk wisdom advocating not getting emotional. First, getting emotional is often viewed as a...|$|E

This research investigated the relationship between exposure to a variety of emotionally laden stimuli and correspondent physiological activity and self-report of emotional responding. The principal aims of the present study were: (a) to replicate P. J. Lang and colleagues' work in 1979, 1980, and 1983, on reinforcement of verbal report of physiological activity during imagery; (b) to investigate how differences in self-reported ability to use imagery influence psychophysiological reactivity to personalized, affective scenes and to affective images from unfamiliar texts; (c) to elucidate the role of anxiety in the processing of affectively laden material; and (d) to investigate the differential physiological effects of reinforcement of verbal report of physiological activity during imagery for subjects differing in imagery ability and level of anxiety. Forty-eight females served as subjects. High- and low-scoring subjects were selected, using the Questionnaire Upon Mental Imagery (QMI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), thus comprising four groups: (a) High STAI/High QMI, (b) High STAI/Low QMI, (c) Low STAI/High QMI, and (d) Low STAI/Low QMI. During two subsequent laboratory sessions, each subject heard recordings of two anger scripts, two fear scripts, two neutral scripts and two scripts chosen for <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> to the subject on the basis of her response to the Fear Survey Schedule III (FSS III).

However, abnormalities in the attribution of <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> to sensory experiences are also critical features of many psychiatric disorders [2, 3].

40|$|This is {{the first}} issue of the Psychology of Sexualities Review. As {{mentioned}} in my previous Editorial, this change in name reflects the change made to the Section’s name, following a ballot of the Section’s membership. I trust that the papers in this issue are a testament to the Editorial Team’s promise to continue the legacy of the Lesbian & Gay Psychology Review’s of publishing high quality papers. In this Editorial I focus on the idea of using sexual identity labels, which have served us well and continue to do so, to move beyond them. I must clarify that by suggesting movement beyond these labels, I am in no way implying that we discard them, but permit a flexibility to incorporate other labelled identities and label-less identities to the fold. This plurality and inclusivity, I believe, forms the spirit of the Psychology of Sexualities Review. When thinking about plurality and inclusivity related to sexuality, two landmark judicial judgments in the recent past come to mind, perhaps because of <b>their</b> <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> to me, both from my own subject-ship and from those of some of my clients I see in therapy. The first, the Delhi High Court’s reading down of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, a section which criminalises private consensual sex between adults of the same sex (reported in the papers as ‘India decriminalises gay sex’, Mitta & Singh, 2009); and the second, the UK Supreme Court ruling related to ‘gay asylum seekers’ (‘Gay asylum seekers’, 2010). There is no question about the importance, the worthiness, the triumph, and the desperate need for both these judgments. A close reading, however, examining the language used in the official judgments and the English language newspaper reporting of these, exposes a certain conservative economy of terms that both reports employ. This is particularly pertinent as both judgments are related to minorities from India, and ‘gay asylum seekers’ from Cameroon and Iran, countries where some sexual minorities 2 do not identity as ‘gay’ or even ‘homosexual’. The collapsing of sexual identities (and associated labels) into seemingly ‘neutral’ terminology employing behavioural categories of ‘men who have sex with men’ (MSM) and ‘women who have sex with women’ (WSW) is also problematic. While such usage has almost become the mainstay of epidemiological and public health studies (since the 1990 s), social constructionists have highlighted the limits of such terms, but have also critiqued the use of identity labels such as ‘gay’, instead arguing for a ‘more textured understandings of sexuality that do not assume alignments among identity, behaviour, and desire’ (Young & Meyer, 2005, p. 1144). My argument is that just as terms such as MSM and WSW tend to obliterate self-determination regarding sexual identities, terms such as ‘gay’ and ‘lesbian’, when applied indiscriminately or as global categories, can be as alienating; obfuscating text and subtext of sexual identities, desires, and practices. These terms then have the potential to become essentialist concepts...|$|E

40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effects of mood and judgmental heuristics on decision making under uncertainty. According to the mood-and-general-knowledge model (Bless, 2000), the assimilation-accommodation model (Fiedler, 2000) and the numeric-priming account of anchoring (Jacowitz & Kahneman, 1995; Wong & Kwong, 2000), happy individuals should rely more on the anchoring heuristic in decision making under uncertainty. However, the semantic-priming account of anchoring (Strack & Mussweiler, 1997) and the processing account of mood (Bless, 2000; Fiedler, 2000) predict that it is sad individuals who should be more susceptible to the anchoring bias. Experiment 1 used a new methodological paradigm, which captures the key methodologies of past mood and anchoring studies to test these two competing hypotheses. The overall results of Experiment 1 found that neither positive nor negative mood influenced the reliance on the anchoring heuristic, but a post-hoc analysis suggests that happy participants relied more on the anchoring heuristic in making decisions for low <b>personal</b> <b>relevance,</b> low familiarity scenarios whereas sad participants were more susceptible to the anchoring heuristic in making high <b>personal</b> <b>relevance,</b> high familiarity decisions. Experiment 2 tested this suggestion and confirmed that <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> significantly moderated {{the effects of}} mood {{on the use of}} the anchoring heuristic. Experiment 3 replicated this result and showed that sad participants processed longer in the high <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> condition whereas happy participants were comparably fast in making high and low <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> decisions. These findings support the suggestion that it was changes in processing styles that were responsible for the effects of mood and <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> on the reliance of the anchoring heuristic. In addition, Experiment 3 found no evidence that familiarity moderated the effects of mood on anchoring. Experiment 4 extended these results to the domain of general knowledge questions but failed to show that an individual difference variable, the Need for Cognition (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982) moderated these effects. The fifth and final experiment extended these findings to a different kind of heuristic, the representativeness heuristic.

Five hundred rural {{residents of the}} Chatrooga River Basin (CRB) participated in a telephone survey. A recent Forest Service message on EM was com-pared with four messages developed using the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and a conrrol (no message) group in their abiliry to produce favorable a&&es toward EM. The four ELM messages were generated using combinations of high versus low <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> and strong versus weak argument strength. The interacbon of argu-ment strength and <b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> along with prior knowledge of EM was also ex-plored. Results show that (I) generally, CRB residents have very low knowledge of EM and (2) the most favorable attitudes were associated with messages containing strong arguments. Evidence of a three-way interaction (<b>personal</b> <b>relevance</b> by knowledge by argument strength) was found. Explanarions for the three-way interaction as well as theoretical and applied implications of rhe study findings are discussed...|$|R
