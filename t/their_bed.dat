5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on <b>their</b> <b>bed</b> saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E
25|$|Thus, in 1345, {{hearing of}} the Pope's reversal, a group of noble conspirators (probably {{including}} Queen Joan) determined to forestall Andrew's coronation. During a hunting trip at Aversa, Andrew left his room {{in the middle of}} the night and was set upon by the conspirators. A treacherous servant barred the door behind him; and as Joan cowered in <b>their</b> <b>bed,</b> a terrible struggle ensued, Andrew defending himself furiously and shrieking for aid. He was finally overpowered, strangled with a cord, and flung from a window. The horrible deed would taint the rest of Joan's reign.|$|E

25|$|The {{case against}} Chapman rests {{mainly on the}} point that he {{undoubtedly}} was a violent man with a misogynistic streak. He was known to beat his common-law-wives and was prone to other violent behaviour. While living in the US, Chapman allegedly forced his wife, Lucy Klosowska, down on <b>their</b> <b>bed</b> and began to strangle her, only stopping to attend to a customer who walked into the shop which adjoined their room. When he left, she was said to have found a knife under the pillow. He reportedly later told her that he had planned to behead her, even pointing out the spot where he would have buried her and reciting what he would have said to their neighbours.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Mildred became pregnant. In June 1958, {{the couple}} {{traveled}} to Washington, D.C. to marry, thereby evading Virginia's Racial Integrity Act of 1924, which made marriage between whites and non-whites a crime. They returned to {{the small town of}} Central Point, Virginia. Based on an anonymous tip, local police raided their home {{in the early morning hours}} of July 11, 1958, hoping to find them having sex, given that interracial sex was then also illegal in Virginia. When the officers found the Lovings sleeping in <b>their</b> <b>bed,</b> Mildred pointed out their marriage certificate on the bedroom wall. They were told the certificate was not valid in the Commonwealth.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} segment, Springfield {{is held in}} a grip of terror by Bart, who has omnipotent powers. Bart turns whoever is not happy with his rule into another being, and even history is changed to suit Bart's pleasure. When Homer refuses to turn off a {{football}} game so that Bart can watch [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (which has been running for 346 consecutive hours), Bart transports him into the football stadium {{in place of the}} ball for a field goal kick. As Homer creeps back into the house, trying to surprise Bart with a blow {{to the back of the}} head, Bart transforms him into a jack-in-the-box. Marge suggests that the two see Dr. Marvin Monroe. The doctor says that Bart is desperate for paternal attention from Homer and suggests that the two spend more time together. Despite being a jack-in-the-box, Homer spends quality time with Bart, and they soon become a normal, loving family. Bart turns Homer back into a human and the two share a warm family moment, causing Bart to wake up screaming. Bart and Lisa wake Homer and Marge and beg them to let them sleep in <b>their</b> <b>bed.</b> As the two crawl into bed, Homer laments that he has to go to work in a few hours and dozes off, becoming the last one in the episode to have a nightmare.|$|E

[...] Lee fell sick from exposure after hiding in a nearby field, and died days later. Glover then took over command of the militia.|$|E
2500|$|Biblical {{scholars}} {{regard this}} custom as an imitation by the laity of the behaviour of the priests. A baraita offers, as {{justification for the}} ritual of hand-washing after waking, the belief that a spirit of impurity rests upon each person during the night, and will not leave until the person's hands are washed, and the Zohar argues that body is open to demonic possession during sleep because the soul temporarily leaves the body during it; the kabbalah argues that death awaits anyone who walks more than four yards from <b>their</b> <b>bed</b> without ablution. According to , the cup containing the water {{has to be able}} to carry a certain amount [...] of water, and it should have two handles.|$|E
2500|$|After {{acquiring}} the recordings from Browne's studio, Double Trouble began assembling the {{material for a}} full-length LP. The album, Texas Flood, opens with the track [...] "Love Struck Baby", which was written for Lenny on their [...] "love-struck day". He composed [...] "Pride and Joy" [...] and [...] "I'm Cryin'" [...] {{for one of his}} former girlfriends, Lindi Bethel, and are both musically similar, but their lyrics are two different perspectives of their prior relationship. Along with covers of Howlin' Wolf, The Isley Brothers, and Buddy Guy, the album included Vaughan's cover of Larry Davis' [...] "Texas Flood", a song which he became strongly associated with. [...] "Lenny" [...] served as a tribute to his wife, which he composed at the end of <b>their</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E

Charlie and Grandpa Joe end up goading the other three grandparents out of bed, pointing out that <b>their</b> <b>bed</b> can't make it up to Marine One, forcing them to leap out of bed, not wanting to miss the opportunity.

2500|$|O'Brian has Aubrey {{speaking}} many proverbs, {{but usually}} in mangled form, such as [...] "There's {{a great deal}} to be said for making hay while the iron is hot" [...] (from Treason's Harbour and similarly in Desolation Island). In HMS Surprise (Chapter 6), Aubrey says that [...] "A bird in the hand is worth any amount of beating about the bush". Sometimes Aubrey gets in a muddle and Maturin affectionately mocks him by playing on the mixed metaphor: '... they have chosen their cake, and must lie in it.'; Maturin replies, 'You mean, they cannot have <b>their</b> <b>bed</b> and eat it?' (also from HMS Surprise, Chapter 7). Related to proverbs, Aubrey tells Maturin a clever Wellerism, [...] "'It's not a fit night out for man or beast,' as the centaur observed, ha, ha, ha!" [...] (Yellow Admiral).|$|E
2500|$|The Union attackers began firing their artillery, which awakened the Confederates {{from their}} slumber. Those who were armed fired {{a few shots}} at the {{advancing}} bluecoats, then Southerners broke and began running to the south, some still in <b>their</b> <b>bed</b> clothes. This caused Union journalists {{to refer to the}} battle as the [...] "Races at Philippi". Dumont's soldiers entered the town from the bridge (Col. Lander's ride down the steep hillside through heavy underbrush was considered such a feat of horsemanship that Leslie's Weekly gave an illustrated account of it shortly afterward), but Kelley's column had arrived from the north on the wrong road and were unable to block the Confederate retreat. Kelley himself was shot while pursuing some of the retreating Confederates, but Col. Lander chased down and captured the man who shot Kelley. The Confederates retreated to Huttonsville, about [...] to the south.|$|E
