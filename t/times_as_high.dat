5|$|The annual age-adjusted {{incidence}} rate (AAIR) of PSP {{is thought to}} be three to six <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> in males as in females. Fishman cites AAIR's of 7.4 and 1.2 cases per 100,000 person-years in males and females, respectively. Significantly above-average height is also associated with increased risk of PSP – in people who are at least 76 inches (1.93 meters) tall, the AAIR is about 200 cases per 100,000 person-years. Slim build also seems to increase the risk of PSP.|$|E
5|$|Washington has a growing, diversified {{economy with}} an {{increasing}} percentage of professional and business service jobs. The gross state {{product of the}} District in 2010 was $103.3billion, which would rank it No. 34 compared to the 50 states. The gross product of the Washington Metropolitan Area was $435billion in 2014, making it the sixth-largest metropolitan economy in the United States. Between 2009 and 2016, GDP per capita in Washington, D.C has consistently ranked on the very top among US states. In 2016, at $160,472, its GDP per capita is almost three <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as that of Massachusetts, which ranked {{second place in the}} country. As of June 2011, the Washington Metropolitan Area had an unemployment rate of 6.2%; the second-lowest rate among the 49 largest metro areas in the nation. The District of Columbia itself had an unemployment rate of 9.8% during the same time period.|$|E

25|$|Tupper {{remained}} an active politician during his <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>High</b> Commissioner, which was controversial because diplomats are traditionally {{expected to be}} nonpartisan. (Tupper's successor <b>as</b> <b>High</b> Commissioner, Donald Smith would succeed in turning the High Commissioner's office into a nonpartisan office.) As such, Tupper returned to Canada to campaign {{on behalf of the}} Conservatives' National Policy during the 1891 election.|$|R

25|$|In {{classical}} jurisprudence monetary {{compensation for}} bodily harm (diya or blood money) is assessed differently for different classes of victims. For example, for Muslim women the amount was half that assessed for a Muslim man. Diya {{for the death}} of a free Muslim man is twice as high as for Jewish and Christian victims according to the Maliki and Hanbali madhhabs and three <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> according to Shafi'i rules. Several legals schools assessed diya for Magians (majus) at one-fifteenth the value of a free Muslim male.|$|E
25|$|During his <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>High</b> Commissioner, Tupper vigorously defended Canada's rights. Although {{he was not}} a full plenipotentiary, he {{represented}} Canada at a Paris conference in 1883, where he openly disagreed with the British delegation; and in 1884 he was allowed to conduct negotiations for a Canadian commercial treaty with Spain.|$|R

25|$|Membership of the Order was {{historically}} {{lower in}} areas where Protestants are in the majority, and vice versa. In County Fermanagh, where the Catholic and Protestant populations are close to parity, membership in 1971 was three <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as in the more Protestant counties of Antrim and Down, where it was just over 10% of adult Protestant males. Other factors {{that are associated with}} high rates of membership are levels of unemployment that more closely match Catholic levels, and low levels of support for the Democratic Unionist Party among unionists.|$|E
25|$|Although {{this meant}} fewer clock cycles per instruction, {{compared}} to the Z80 for instance, the latter's higher resolution state machine allowed clock frequencies 3-5 <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> without demanding faster memory chips, which was often the limiting factor. This is because the Z80 combines two full (but short) clock cycles into a relatively long memory access period {{compared to the}} clock, while the more asynchronous 6809 instead has relatively short memory access times: depending on version and speed grade, approximately 60% of a single clock cycle was typically available for memory access in a 6809 (see data sheets).|$|E
25|$|The 46-caliber21-K was {{a minimal}} {{adaptation}} of the 53-K anti-tank gun that was created by taking the latter's barrel and mounting it on a simple pedestal mount. Its semi-automatic breech automatically ejected the cartridge case and locked open, {{ready for the next}} round. This was less than ideal for an anti-aircraft weapon that relied on its rate of fire to inflict damage on aircraft because every round had to be hand-loaded. Fully automatic weapons of roughly this caliber like the 40 mm Bofors typically used 4-5 round clips of ammunition to produce rates of fire four <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high.</b>|$|E

Rupe was over 425 pounds at the <b>time</b> (<b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> the scale went) and the judge was concerned that execution by hanging could cause Rupe to be decapitated, which would constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|R
50|$|However, IMR was, and remains, {{higher in}} LDCs. In 2001, the IMR for LDCs (91) was about 10 <b>times</b> <b>as</b> large {{as it was}} for MDCs (8). On average, for LDCs, the IMR is 17 <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>higher</b> than that of MDCs. Also, while both LDCs and MDCs made {{significant}} reductions in infant mortality rates, reductions among less developed countries are, on average, much less than those among the more developed countries.|$|R
25|$|Postpartum {{infection}} {{is one of}} the main causes of maternal death and may account for 10% of maternal deaths globally. Caesarean section greatly increases the risk of infection and associated morbidity (estimated to be between 5 and 20 <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high),</b> and routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infections is recommended. Infection can occur in around 8% of women who have caesareans, largely endometritis, urinary tract infections and wound infections. The use of preventative antibiotics in women undergoing cesarean section decreased wound infection, endometritis, and serious infectious complications by about 65%. Side effects and effect on the baby is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Putting on {{shows is}} costly to venues as well, due to theatre licence fees which by 2009 had risen 800% in the {{preceding}} three years, and were eight <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as fees in English cities, starting at £824 for a venue of up to 200 people and rising to £2,472 for a venue of up to 5,000 people. These fees have been cited as punitive to smaller venues and site-specific performances by such figures as Julian Caddy, which in 2009 featured site-specific shows in such venues as Inchcolm island and a swimming pool at the Apex International Hotel.|$|E
25|$|A fit adult {{creates a}} wake. Drag {{due to a}} wake is Newtonian drag, {{increasing}} with {{the square of the}} velocity. For example, if the relative speed between the water and the leg is twice as high on the thrust phase than on the recovery phase, the thrust is four <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as the drag. Assuming the legs are recovered with a relative speed between leg and body which amounts to the same as the relative speed between water and body, the legs must be kicked back with five times the mean velocity of the swimmer. This limits the top speed. Both effects together, velocity and frontal area, yield a thrust-to-drag ratio of 8 for the legs.|$|E

50|$|Utricularia resupinata, the {{lavender}} bladderwort or northeastern bladderwort, {{is a small}} perennial affixed subaquatic carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia (family Lentibulariaceae). It is native to eastern Canada, United States, and Central America. In its northern range it appears to only flower when low water levels occur at the same <b>time</b> <b>as</b> <b>higher</b> than average temperatures.

25|$|Workers {{must pay}} 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no {{tax on income}} in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, {{for people in the}} bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as it is for those in the top fifth.|$|E
25|$|The rate of {{complications}} is about 12% for minor complications and 3% for major complications; major complications include infections, facial paralysis, and device failure. To avoid {{the risk of}} bacterial meningitis, which while low is about thirty <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> compared to people who don't undergo CI procedures, the FDA recommends vaccination prior to the procedure. The rate of transient facial nerve palsy {{is estimated to be}} approximately 1%. Device failure requiring reimplantation is estimated to occur in 2.5-6% of the time. Up to one-third of people experience disequilibrium, vertigo, or vestibular weakness lasting more than 1 week after the procedure; in people under 70 these symptoms generally resolve over weeks to months, but in people over 70 the problems tend to persist.|$|E
25|$|The {{assumption}} {{of the use of}} a two-beamed cross does not determine the number of nails used in the crucifixion and some theories suggest three nails while others suggest four nails. However, throughout history larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized, at <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> as 14 nails. These variations are also present in the artistic depictions of the crucifixion. In the Western Church, before the Renaissance usually four nails would be depicted, with the feet side by side. After the Renaissance most depictions use three nails, with one foot placed on the other. Nails are almost always depicted in art, although Romans sometimes just tied the victims to the cross. The tradition also carries to Christian emblems, e.g. the Jesuits use three nails under the IHS monogram and a cross to symbolize the crucifixion.|$|E
