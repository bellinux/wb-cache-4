2500|$|For {{retreatment}} of a non-healing lesion, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> magical {{method that}} can be employed; the course of action is merely to achieve {{what was supposed to}} have been achieved the first time. [...] Keeping in mind the notion that endodontic retreatment is a problem-solving exploit will substantially increase its success.|$|E
2500|$|According to Bart D Ehrman: [...] "Mary (Magdalene) is accorded a {{high status}} among the apostles of Jesus." [...] Levi {{actually}} acknowledges that Jesus loved {{her more than}} he loved {{all of the other}} apostles. Mary claimed to have had a conversation with Jesus, and Andrew and Peter questioned this. [...] "Four pages are lost from the manuscript", so <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> way for anyone to know exactly what happened.|$|E
2500|$|The Flower {{class had}} been {{designed}} for inshore patrol and harbour anti-submarine defence; therefore, many required minor modifications when the Allied navies began deploying these vessels as trans-Atlantic convoy escorts. These small warships could be supported by any small dockyard or naval station, so many ships came to {{have a variety of}} different weapons systems and design modifications depending upon when and where they were refitted; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> such thing as a 'standard Flower-class corvette' ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} Meitner herself {{wrote in a}} letter, [...] "Surely Hahn fully {{deserved}} the Nobel Prize for chemistry. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> doubt about it. But I believe that Otto Robert Frisch and I contributed something not insignificant to the clarification {{of the process of}} uranium fission—how it originates and that it produces so much energy and that was something very remote to Hahn." [...] In a similar vein, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Lise Meitner's former assistant, later added that Hahn [...] "certainly did deserve this Nobel Prize. He would have deserved it even if he had not made this discovery. But everyone recognized that the splitting of the atomic nucleus merited a Nobel Prize." [...] Frisch wrote similarly in a 1955 letter.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 December, Hahn {{was persuaded}} {{by two of}} his captors {{to write a letter}} to the Nobel {{committee}} accepting the prize but also stating {{that he would not be}} able to attend the award ceremony. He could not participate in the Nobel festivities on 10 December since his captors would not allow him to leave Farm Hall. Meitner said in a letter to her friend B. Broomé-Aminoff on November 20, 1945:Surely Hahn fully deserved the Nobel Prize in chemistry. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> doubt about it.

2500|$|Janet Carr told News.com.au, [...] "When {{we first}} started [...] we knew there was nothing out there in {{mainstream}} media that satisfied us as gamers, and so we made the show from within the community... The TV show {{is just part of}} this community and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> screen between us and them." [...] News.com.au said, [...] "Good Game thrives from online interaction with its viewers, offering free episodes and even gaming sessions with the team", citing Carr's explanation: [...] "Our forums are incredibly active, we play games regularly with people who watch the show, and the emails they send are like, 'Hey Jungy (co-host Junglist), thanks for knifing me last night!'" [...] After spontaneously deciding to attend the EB Games Gold Coast conference, thinking the experience would be lonely and awkward, Hex and Bajo were overwhelmed by the response; the hundreds of people in queues to go see them. It was due to fan requests that Ask Good Game – an exclusive segment to Good Game: Spawn Point for some time – was added back to the parent show. In 2013, Bajo and Hex had an AMA with their fans on Reddit.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{may need}} them, some time," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> use in my {{manufacturing}} these things unless somebody uses them." ...|$|E

60|$|I hesitated. Shocking as it {{may seem}} to some people, I hesitated. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> need to hurry my decision. I had the whole day before me.|$|R
60|$|At this, Mrs. Hayes fell to entreating more loudly than ever; and as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> {{charge against}} him, Mr. Ballance was {{constrained}} {{to let him}} go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, just--well, not exactly--" [...] It was {{an awkward}} question. There came to her relief the {{reflection}} that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> need for her to answer it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] she said, [...] "everybody {{likes to}} be remembered, and I'm no {{exception}} in that respect. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> reason why you shouldn't have bought the guard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{often have}} you told me, Professor, that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> up or down in space?" [...] said the monk. [...] "I shall mount {{up as much as}} you will." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm allowin' that I've got {{a saddle}} {{he can have}} for a spell," [...] Mr. Mansfield replied thoughtfully; and {{although}} Dick insisted that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> <b>no</b> need of one, it was brought out.|$|R
