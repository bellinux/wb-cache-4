Each of the characters responds to this turn of events differently: Don Santiago scoffs, refusing to consider Americans any threat to his way of life; Alvaro wants to know what military action can be undertaken to stave off the American forces; Luis Gonzaga contemplates whether or not Americans really are the uncultured hoodlums he has heard them to be; María de los Ángeles, under the assumption <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> not Catholic, assumes the invasion is punishment from God for Mexico's sins; and Susanita wonders {{what it would be like}} to dance with a tall white-skinned man.|$|E

Their new-found enmity causes Mr. Khoo to select the marketing campaign of John, an American expatriate, over that of Mr. Liu, in addition to the stereotype <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> better than Asians.

500|$|The show's writers {{reject the}} idea that The Daily Show has {{become a source of}} news for young people. Stewart argues <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> living in an [...] "age of {{information}} osmosis" [...] in which it is close to impossible to gain one's news from any single source, and says that his show succeeds comedically because the viewers already have some knowledge about current events. [...] "Our show would not be valuable to people who didn't understand the news because it wouldn't make sense," [...] he argues. [...] "We make assumptions about your level of knowledge that... if we were your only source of news, you would just watch our show and think, 'I don't know what's happening.'" ...|$|E

500|$|American {{football}} {{also plays}} a significant role in American culture. The Super Bowl is considered a de facto national holiday, and in parts of the country like Texas, the sport has been compared to a religion. Football is also linked to other holidays; New Year's Day is traditionally the date for several college football bowl games, including the Rose Bowl. However, if New Year's Day is on a Sunday, the bowl games are moved to another date to not conflict with the typical NFL Sunday schedule. Thanksgiving football is an American tradition, hosting many high school, college, and professional games. Steve Deace of USA Today wrote <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> passionate about football [...] "because it embodies everything we love about American exceptionalism. Merit is rewarded, not punished. Masculinity is celebrated, not feminized. People of various beliefs and backgrounds – a melting pot, if you will – must unify for a common goal for the team to be successful". Implicit rules such as playing through pain and sacrificing for the better of the team are promoted in football culture.|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} the primary, Congressional Quarterly changed its rating of the race to [...] "Leans Democrat". By late September, the {{national}} GOP had pulled most of its funding, effectively conceding the seat to Giffords. Giffords won the race on November 7, 2006, with 54 percent of the vote. Graf received 42 percent. The rest of the vote went to minor candidates. Giffords's victory was portrayed as evidence <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> accepting towards comprehensive immigration reform. She was the first Jewish woman elected to Congress from Arizona.|$|E

[...] "Russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign Georgian territory. What is most critical now is to avoid further confrontation between Russian and Georgian military forces," [...] McCain said on August 8, 2008.|$|E

Bledsoe described his son's religious conversion and travels to Yemen, {{where he had been}} “trained and programmed” to kill. Bledsoe said, “Our children are in danger,” and that, “It seems to me <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> sitting around doing nothing about radical extremists. This is a big elephant in the room.” On an earlier occasion, Bledsoe had said, [...] "If it can happen to my son, it can happen to anyone’s son.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Another of Easterbrook's books, {{focusing}} on social science, is The Progress Paradox: How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse (2003), which explores people's {{perception of their}} own well-being. The book cites statistical data indicating <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> better off in terms of material goods and amount of free time but are not happier than before. Easterbrook argues that this has occurred due to choice anxiety (too many decisions to make) and abundance denial (not realizing how well we are doing). [...] His proposed remedy is to make our lives more meaningful by doing good while living well.|$|E

[...] Wisconsin Population Health Institute annual [...] "Health Rankings" [...] for 2012 showed West Virginia spends $9,671 per capita {{on health care}} annually. El Salvador spends just $467, yet both have the same life expectancy. [...] In 2012, according to the Census Bureau, West Virginia was the only state where death rates exceeds birth rates. During 2010–2013, about 21,000 babies per year were born in West Virginia, but there were 24,000 deaths. [...] In demographics, {{this is called a}} [...] "net mortality society." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 2013, in [...] "Playing War: How the Military Uses Video Games", Corey Mead, a {{professor}} of English at Baruch College showcased how the U.S. military financed the original development of video games, and has long used them for both training, recruitment purposes, and treatment of post traumatic stress disorder. He also argues that the two industries are currently intertwined into {{each other in a}} [...] "military-entertainment complex". Writing in 2013, scholars James Ivory and Malte Elson noted that, although research on video game effects remained inconclusive, the culture of the academic field itself had become very contentious and that politicians had put pressure on scientists to produce specific research findings. [...] The authors concluded it is improper for scholars or legislators to, at present, portray video games as a public health crisis. Research by Oxford psychologist Andrew Przybylski has shown <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> split in opinion on how video game violence links to gun violence. Przybylski found that older people, women rather than men, people who knew less about games and who were very conservative in ideology were most likely to think video games could cause gun violence.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{sections}} were struck by the courts. Section 805 of the Patriot Act allowed the U.S. government to prohibit citizens from providing material support for specially designated terrorist organisations, including [...] "expert advise and assistance." [...] Two organisations so designated were the Kurdistan Workers Party (in Kurdish it is the Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan, or PDK) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (also known as either the Tamil Tigers, the Ellalan Force or the LTTE). The Humanitarian Law Project supported both groups, and brought a civil action against the government complaining that the law was unconstitutional. The Federal court agreed and in a decision brought in December 2004 struck down section 805(a)(2)(B) because, in the courts view, it violated the First and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution as it was so vague that it [...] "could be construed to include unequivocally pure speech and advocacy protected by the First Amendment." [...] In the decision, the judge determined that this vagueness would cause a person of average intelligence to guess whether they were breaking the law, and thus potentially cause a person to be charged for an offence {{that they had no}} way of knowing was illegal. The vagueness may also have the effect of allowing arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law, as well as possible chilling effects on First Amendment rights. Soon after the decision, the Department of Justice released a statement that [...] "The provision at issue in today's decision was a modest amendment to a pre-existing antiterrorism law that was designed to deal with real threats caused by support of terrorist groups. By targeting those who provide material support by providing 'expert advice or assistance' the law made clear <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> threatened as much by the person who teaches a terrorist to build a bomb as by the one who pushes the button." ...|$|E

5000|$|In her interview, Osei {{provides}} some insight about her childhood. She moved to USA in 2008 {{when she was}} thirteen years old. She experienced extensive bullying for her obliviousness to American culture and simply for being the [...] "uncivilized" [...] African. For example, others had {{asked her if she}} was getting accustomed to wearing shoes since people do not wear shoes in Africa. She was also called names, such as monkey and pre-historic. As a result of this cruelty, she began to believe <b>that</b> <b>American</b> culture <b>was</b> very cold. She also noticed <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>were</b> [...] "protective of their property," [...] space, and time. She concluded <b>that</b> <b>American</b> society <b>is</b> [...] "extremely individualistic."

60|$|And yet {{one finds}} many American gentlemen who have allowed {{themselves}} to be drifted into such a theory. They have begun the world as republican citizens, and as such they must go on. But in their travels and their studies, and in the luxury of their life, they have learned to dislike the rowdiness of their country's politics. They want things to be soft and easy; as republican as you please, but with as little noise as possible. The President is there for four years. Why not elect him for eight, for twelve, or for life?--for eternity {{if it were possible}} to find one who could continue to live? It is to this way of thinking <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> driven, when the polish of Europe has made the roughness of their own elections odious to them.|$|E
60|$|I {{ought not}} to omit {{mentioning}} {{that he has been}} told in France that he personally resembles the Emperor, and I suspect he is trying to heighten the resemblance by training his mustache on the pattern of that which adorns the imperial upper lip. He is a genuine American character, though modified by a good deal of travel; a very intelligent man, full of various ability, with eyes all over him for any object of interest,--a little of the bore, sometimes,--quick to appreciate character, with a good deal of tact, gentlemanly in his manners, but yet lacking a deep and delicate refinement. Not but <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> as capable of this last quality as other people are; but what with the circumstances amid which we grow up, and the peculiar activity of our minds, we certainly do often miss it. By the by, he advanced a singular proposition the other evening, namely, that the English people do not so well understand comfort, or attain it so perfectly in their domestic arrangements, as we do. I thought he hardly supported this opinion so satisfactorily as some of his other new ideas.|$|E
60|$|But it is {{the real}} reason that {{interests}} me here. It is certainly not <b>that</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>are</b> so stupid as not to know that cocoa-nuts are only cocoa-nuts and paper boats only made of paper. Americans are, on an average, rather more intelligent than Englishmen; and they {{are well aware that}} Hercules is a myth and that Mrs. Asquith is something of a mythologist. It is not that they do not know that the object is small in itself; it is that they do really believe that the enthusiasm is great in itself. They admire people for being impressionable. They admire people for being excited. An American so struggling for some disproportionate trifle (like one of my lectures) really feels in a mystical way that he is right, because it is his whole morality to be keen. So long as he wants something very much, whatever it is, he feels he has his conscience behind him, and the common sentiment of society behind him, and God and the whole universe behind him. Wedged on one leg in a hot crowd at a trivial lecture, he has self-respect; his dignity is at rest. That is what he means when he says he is bound to come to the lecture.|$|E
