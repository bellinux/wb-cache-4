5|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>big</b> {{headland}} is Foreland Point, {{after which}} the path comes to Lynmouth with the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway linking it with Lynton on the hill above. At Lynmouth the path intersects with the Two Moors Way. The river here suffered a catastrophic flood in the 1950s. Beyond Lynton the path passes through the Valley of the Rocks, known for its herd of goats, then Duty Point and Lee Bay, then Crock Point and Woody Bay. After Highveer Rocks the path crosses the small River Heddon then skirts Trentishoe Down and Holdstone Down and climbs Great Hangman.|$|E

5|$|Baltimore {{was home}} to a major doo wop scene {{in the middle of}} the 20th century, which began with The Orioles, who are {{considered}} one of the first doo wop groups to record commercially. By the 1950s, Baltimore {{was home to}} numerous African American vocal groups, and talent scouts scoured the city for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>big</b> stars. Many bands emerged from the city, including The Cardinals and The Plants. Some doo wop groups were connected with street gangs, and some members were active in both scenes, such as Johnny Page of The Marylanders. Competitive music and dance was a part of African American street gang culture, and with the success of some local groups, pressure mounted, leading to territorial rivalries among performers. Pennsylvania Avenue served as a rough boundary between East and West Baltimore, with the East producing The Swallows and The Cardinals, as well as The Sonnets, The Jollyjacks, The Honey Boys, The Magictones and The Blentones, while the West was home to The Orioles and The Plants, as well as The Twilighters and The Four Buddies.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{attended}} St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school (later part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School, Sidcup), in Woolwich Road, Abbey Wood, south east London, in the mid-1970s. During {{this time}} her family produced a demo tape with over 50 of her compositions, which {{was turned down}} by record labels. David Gilmour of Pink Floyd received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped the sixteen-year-old Bush get a more professional-sounding demo tape recorded {{that would be more}} saleable to the record companies. Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour. The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend Andrew Powell, who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums, and sound engineer Geoff Emerick. The tape was sent to EMI executive Terry Slater. Slater was impressed by the tape and signed her. The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation. Progressive rock was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>big</b> thing were considering experimental acts.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{was already}} {{concerned}} in 1891 that Europe {{was much more}} advanced in balloon technology than the United States. He sent a letter of concern to the national newspapers claiming that {{if any of the}} European military powers wanted to they could annihilate New York City or any major city in northeastern United States. Newspapers printed his concerns that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>big</b> war would be fought in the sky. Myers pointed out that Germany, France, England, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Russia, Italy and China all had aeronautical apparatus, schools of practice, and secret experimental construction plants making state-of-the-art propeller power driven airships for war. He pointed out as early as October 1890 Commandant Charles Renard was in possession of a motor that could drive La France dirigible airship twenty-eight miles an hour and such an airship or a war airship twice that size traveling at forty-five miles an hour could totally destroy any major city in America without difficulty because of its speed. He was encouraging the government to recognize this and to prepare properly against this potential threat.|$|E

This changed in 1846 when American Samuel Phillippe introduced an imported fishing rod {{the first six}} strips of Calcutta cane made in Bavaria where Phillippe was importing Violins that he passed off as his own hand work. Split-cane rods were later independently produced after Phillippe started to sell the imported rods to a New York retailer and then copied by Americans Charles Orvis, Hiram Leonard and Englishman William Hardy in the 1870s and mass production methods made these rods accessible to the public. Horton Manufacturing Company first introduced an all steel rod in 1913. These rods were heavy and flexible and did not satisfy many customers. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>big</b> occurrence in fishing rods was {{the introduction of the}} fiberglass rod in the 1940s and was developed by Robert Gayle and a Mr. Mcguire.|$|E
25|$|Fefe Dobson's self titled {{debut album}} is {{generally}} pop-rock, {{as well as}} some traces of punk music. Several songs on the album are also in an acoustic format, stripped down to just Dobson and the guitar. The music was different from most music put out at the time, such as recent releases by Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. In fact, Dobson originally signed with Jive Records, who intended to make her <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>big</b> pop star. However, Dobson didn't want to be a pop-star and wanted to make her own type of music, and quickly left the label. For Dobson second official album Joy she worked producers David Lichens, Jon Levine, Howard Benson and Bob Ezrin on Joy, Dobson lives up to the portraits of her heroes she first hung during the recording of her first album—Kurt Cobain, Judy Garland, Coldplay, The Vines and Jeff Buckley. She co-wrote most of the songs on the album, usually composing on guitar, her choice of instrument.|$|E
