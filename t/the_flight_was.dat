5|$|The {{aircraft}} was a 5-year-old Lockheed L-1049H Super Constellation with 17,224 airframe hours. It carried 11 American civilian crew members and 96 military passengers. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{operated by the}} Flying Tiger Line as Military Air Transport Service (MATS) Charter flight 739.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{under the}} command of an {{experienced}} cockpit crew, consisting of Captain Henrique Stefanini Di Sacco (53) and First Officer Kleyber Aguiar Lima (54). Both pilots had been flying for over 30 years. The Captain had accrued nearly 13,700 flight hours throughout his career and the First Officer had almost 14,800 hours of flying experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{world record}} jump was very smooth. It felt like I {{was lying on}} my stomach on a glass coffee table, {{watching}} a movie projected on a screen underneath the table. Although <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> very smooth, {{it seemed like the}} movie projector was running the film faster than intended.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>is</b> {{very fast}} and dashing, {{although}} it will glide at height {{in a more}} leisurely fashion. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> call <b>is</b> a high-pitched djip-djip-djip, replaced at the nest by a chattering chee-chee-chee.|$|R

5|$|American Airlines Flight 77 was a {{scheduled}} American Airlines domestic transcontinental passenger flight from Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, to Los Angeles International Airport in Los Angeles, California. The Boeing 757-223 aircraft serving <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> hijacked by five men affiliated with al-Qaeda on September 11, 2001, {{as part of}} the September 11 attacks. They deliberately crashed the plane into the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., killing all 64 people on board, including the five hijackers and six crew, as well as 125 people in the building.|$|E
5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{cleared for}} the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} {{approach to the}} airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final approach to the runway. As it continued its descent past the missed approach point– where the runway must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{minutes into}} the flight, the hijackers injured at least three people (possibly killing one), {{forcibly}} breached the cockpit, and overpowered the captain and first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the controls. Air-traffic controllers noticed <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> in distress when the crew was no longer responding. They realized the flight had been hijacked when Mohamed Atta's announcements for passengers were transmitted to air traffic control. On board, flight attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong contacted American Airlines, and provided information about the hijackers and injuries to passengers and crew.|$|E
40|$|A postflight {{analysis}} of <b>the</b> Apollo 14 <b>flight</b> <b>is</b> presented. <b>The</b> basic objective of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> evaluation <b>is</b> to acquire, reduce, analyze, and report on <b>flight</b> data to <b>the</b> extent required to assure future mission success and vehicle reliability. Actual <b>flight</b> failures <b>are</b> identified, their causes are determined and corrective actions are recommended. Summaries of launch operations and spacecraft performance are included. The significant events for {{all phases of}} <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>are</b> analyzed...|$|R

5|$|Flight 421 {{was served}} by a Martin 2-0-2 {{aircraft}} was operated by Northwest Airlines. It was just under a year old, and had accumulated a total airtime of 1321 hours starting in 1947. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> piloted by Captain Robert L. Johnson, 30, who had 5,502 hours of flying time. The copilot was David F. Brenner, 27, with 2,380 hours of flight time.|$|E
5|$|Much media {{attention}} focused on the airfield when the body of Diana, Princess of Wales, arrived there from Villacoublay airfield, in Paris, France, after her death {{in a car crash}} in the city on 31 August 1997. The Queen's Colour Squadron, then based at neighbouring RAF Uxbridge, acted as the bearer party, while <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> met by the Prime Minister, the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Lieutenant of Greater London, Secretary of State for Defence, the RAF Northolt station commander and the RAF Chaplain-in-Chief.|$|E
5|$|On {{its way to}} the Museum of Flight in November 2003, G-BOAG set a New York City-to-Seattle speed {{record of}} 3 hours, 55 minutes, and 12 seconds. Due to the {{restrictions}} on supersonic overflights within the USA <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> granted permission by the Canadian authorities {{for the majority of the}} journey to be flown supersonically over sparsely-populated Canadian territory.|$|E

5|$|Pahing, who {{had grown}} up within the nascent {{independence}} movement and associated with several historical figures, was arrested for being half-Dutch by the Japanese spy Maruyama (Verdi Solaiman)– a man who coveted Pahing's wife. After being tortured, Pahing was released to discover that his wife had been raped and killed; their newborn son Fajar had been kidnapped. Pahing later died on a flight carrying medical supplies over Yogyakarta when <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> shot down. Meanwhile, his son was raised by Maruyama– the kidnapper– and had his name changed to Dasaad Muchlisin.|$|E
5|$|Public {{communication}} from Malaysian officials regarding {{the loss of}} <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> initially beset with confusion. The Malaysian government and the airline released imprecise, incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate information, with civilian officials sometimes contradicting military leaders. Malaysian officials were criticised for such persistent release of contradictory information, most notably regarding the last location and time of contact with the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Roland Morris was an {{experienced}} instructor {{with more than}} 2,000 hours. He was critical of Finucane's habit of trying to force the aircraft {{to do what he}} wanted instead of coaxing it. Despite a series of blunders, Finucane wanted to fly solo. At that time Finucane was five hours flight training behind the rest of his group, but he made a successful solo trip on 21 September after the completion of 14:05 hours piloting. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> not without fault; Finucane nearly stalled the aircraft after taking off.|$|E

5|$|St. John's was the {{starting}} point for the first non-stop transatlantic aircraft flight, by Alcock and Brown in a modified Vickers Vimy IV bomber, in June 1919, departing from Lester's Field in St. John's and ending in a bog near Clifden, Connemara, Ireland. In July 2005, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> duplicated by American aviator and adventurer Steve Fossett in a replica Vickers Vimy aircraft, with St. John's International Airport substituting for Lester's Field (now an urban and residential part of the city).|$|E
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain and}} first officer {{reported}} for work at Avjet's Burbank, California facility around noon {{on the day}} of the accident. After checking the weather and the aircraft, they embarked on an 11-minute repositioning flight to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to pick up their passengers. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> originally scheduled to leave LAX at 16:30 MST, but departed after a 41-minute delay for late passengers at 17:11 MST.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> fourth <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> first {{announced}} in August 2008, shortly after <b>the</b> third <b>flight</b> failed, it <b>was</b> planned for launch in September. The rocket {{that was used}} to conduct <b>the</b> test <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> originally built to launch the RazakSAT satellite. <b>The</b> test <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> introduced into <b>the</b> launch schedule because Astronautic Technology Sdn Bhd (ATSB) required a successful <b>flight</b> to <b>be</b> conducted before RazakSAT could be launched.|$|R
50|$|All 61 {{passengers}} and 7 crew of <b>the</b> Iberia <b>flight</b> <b>were</b> killed including Michael Jeffery, the former manager of Jimi Hendrix. No-one aboard <b>the</b> Spantax <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> harmed.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} during coastal defense maneuvers {{held by the}} Air Corps without {{the participation of the}} United States Navy, and apparently without understanding of their purpose by the Army Chief of Staff. Both had continuing disagreements with the leaders of the Air Corps over roles and missions, with the Navy disputing its maritime mission and the Army seeking to limit its role to that of supporting ground forces.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> {{operated}} for {{the purpose}} of maintaining the currency of the instrument rating of two of the airline's pilots. Shortly after takeoff and only seconds after climbing through , the plane began banking to the right. It continued to roll through 90degrees; the nose then dropped suddenly and moments later it struck the ground. All three members of the flight crew were killed upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents {{arrived at}} the airport after the plane landed. The {{aircraft}} was moved to a remote area so authorities could re-screen the plane, the passengers, and the baggage on board. A bomb-defusing robot was first used to board the plane, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) interviewed all passengers. Another passenger from <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>was</b> placed in handcuffs after a dog alerted officers to his carry-on luggage; he was searched, and released without charges. For several days following, federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred, they later reversed this position, confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>is</b> {{assumed to}} take place in still air, and the {{aircraft}} is treated as a rigid body.|$|R
