5|$|Restored after World War II, since 1949 <b>this</b> <b>oil</b> {{painting}} {{has been}} {{on display in the}} National Museum in Warsaw. In 1999 the Battle of Grunwald was loaned to Lithuania, where it garnered a positive reception because it prominently features Vytautas, who is considered a national hero in that country. By the 2000s, the painting needed restoration. In 2010, the poor condition of the painting prevented its inclusion it in a special exhibition at Wawel Castle to mark the 600th anniversary of the battle. The painting was renovated, with the work finished in 2012. After restoration the painting is once again on display at the National Museum.|$|E

5|$|After {{hatching}} {{the chick}} is brooded by a parent {{until it is}} large enough to thermoregulate efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting fulmars (around 16–20 days) and giant petrels (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive pelagic feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and stomach oil, an energy-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. <b>This</b> <b>oil</b> is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for birds, with fledging taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a northern fulmar that was over 50 years.|$|E

George Fownes named <b>this</b> <b>oil</b> furfurol in 1845 (from furfur - bran, and oleum).

25|$|The total {{estimated}} {{amount of oil}} in an oil reservoir, including both producible and non-producible oil, is called oil in place.

The ratio of reserves to the total amount of oil in a particular reservoir is called the recovery factor.

25|$|There are {{numerous}} deposits of oil sands in the world, {{but the biggest}} and most important are in Canada and Venezuela, with lesser deposits in Kazakhstan and Russia. The total volume of non-conventional oil in the oil sands of these countries exceeds the reserves of conventional oil in all other countries combined.

25|$|In October, 2013, Husky Energy and Government of Newfoundland & Labrador {{announced}} {{an agreement to}} amend the White Rose Development.

The announcement included the news that <b>this</b> <b>oil</b> resource could be exploited by installing a gravity based 'wellhead platform' structure over the western section of the oil field on the ocean floor in approximately 120 metres of water. To support this billion dollar wellhead platform construction project, Husky announced that it would be establishing a graving dock facility on the Northside Peninsula at Argentia to support the construction of the concrete base of the wellhead platform. Construction of the graving dock began in late 2013 and was finished in early 2015. However, in December 2014, Husky announced that, due to declining oil prices, the decision to construct the Concrete Gravity Base (CGS) had been deferred.|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{the energy}} dispute is the dispute over oil. In 1995, Russia and Belarus agreed that Russia would not impose any customs on oil {{exported}} to Belarus. In exchange, the revenues from <b>this</b> <b>oil</b> processed in Belarus would be shared by 15% for Belarus and 85% for Russia. In 2001, Belarus unilaterally canceled this agreement while Russia continued its duty-free exports. Lukashenko's state kept all the revenues, and many Russian oil companies moved their processing capacities to Belarus. On this arrangement, Russia also lost billions of dollars annually. Belarus imposed a tariff of US$45 per ton of oil flowing through the Druzhba pipeline, prompting Russia {{to claim that the}} move was illegal and to threaten retaliation, since it contradicts bilateral trade agreements and worldwide practice. Only imported or exported goods are being tariffed while transit goods are not objects of tariffing. Russia rejected paying the newly imposed Belarusian tariffs.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the nature of}} the interfacial membrane on the kinetics of droplet growth in hydrocarbon oil-in-water emulsions was investigated. Droplet growth rates were determined by measuring changes in the droplet size distribution of 1 wt % n-tetradecane or n-octadecane oil-in-water emulsions using laser diffraction. The interfacial properties of the droplets were manipulated by coating them with either an SDS layer or with an SDS-chitosan layer using an electrostatic deposition method. The emulsion containing SDS-coated octadecane droplets did not exhibit droplet growth during storage for 400 h, which showed that it was stable to Ostwald ripening because of <b>this</b> <b>oils</b> extremely low water-solubility. The emulsion containing SDS-coated n-tetradecane droplets showed a considerable increase in mean droplet size with time, which was attributed to Ostwald ripening associated with <b>this</b> <b>oils</b> appreciable water-solubility. On the other hand, an emulsion containing SDS-chitosan coated n-tetradecane droplets was stable to droplet growth, which was attributed to the ability of the interfacial membrane to resist deformation because of its elastic modulus and thickness. This study shows that the stability of emulsion droplets to Ostwald ripening can be improved by using an electrostatic deposition method to form thick elastic membranes around the droplets...|$|R
