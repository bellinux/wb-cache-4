5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> {{after an}} enzyme {{is mixed with}} substrate, no product has been formed and no {{intermediates}} exist. The study of the next few milliseconds of the reaction is called pre-steady-state kinetics. Pre-steady-state kinetics is therefore concerned with the formation and consumption of enzyme–substrate intermediates (such as ES or E*) until their steady-state concentrations are reached.|$|E
5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing {{me with the}} fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
25|$|This dogma {{states that}} Mary was {{conceived}} without original sin (de fide). This {{means that the}} conception of Mary in her mother's womb was without any stain of original sin and from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> of her existence, she was preserved by God {{from the lack of}} sanctifying grace that afflicts mankind, and that she was instead filled with divine grace.|$|E

25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E
25|$|During the 2003 season, the Vikings {{came close}} to getting into the playoffs. However, the Arizona Cardinals {{completed}} a game-winning touchdown on 4th-and-28 with 0:00 left, knocking the Vikings out of the playoffs. The moment of Arizona's touchdown was actually <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> the entire season in which the Vikings hadn't led their division. The Vikings became the second team in football history to miss the playoffs after getting off to a 6–0 start, following the 1978 Washington Redskins.|$|E
25|$|Again, to the Salon d'Automne of 1913 - a salon {{in which}} Cubism {{was now the}} predominating {{tendency}} - Metzinger sent the great picture called En Bâteau (En Canot, Im Boot), La Fresnaye La Conquête de l'Air, myself Les Bâteaux de Pêche and La Ville et le Fleuve. If <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> of surprise had passed by, the interest Cubism excited was as great as ever. The anger and the enthusiasm had not changed sides, our enemies held to their guns. It is enough for proof to read the diatribes of Louis Vauxcelles in Gil Blas for that year,1913, and the panegyrics of Guillaume Apollinaire in L'Intransigeant.|$|E

Using a bag-model calculation for the twist- 2 part of h 1, we give an estimate of the twist- 4 correction predicted by the renormalon ambiguity.

25|$|So {{completely}} absorbed was {{the attention}} of the twelve pounder Battery No. 6, which stood in a somewhat isolated position, by the contest in Saint-Amand-la-Haye, which it covered by its fire, that it had not noticed the stealthy advance of a Troop of the French horsemen, wearing the uniform of the Light Artillery of the Guard, and most unexpectedly found itself attacked in flank by these bold adventurers. This give rise to a curious scene, for the Prussian Gunners, in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> of surprise, could only defend themselves with their rammers and handspikes; but with these they plied the intruders with so much adroitness and resolution as to hurl their leaders to the ground, and force the remainder to hasty flight.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the cause}} of all this may {{be traced to the}} {{different}} views entertained by the two great Commanders. Blücher's extreme hatred of the French would not allow him to modify, still less to abandon, the opinion which he had imbibed from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> he heard of the escape of Napoleon from Elba; that they ought not only to be thoroughly humbled, but also severely punished. Neither he nor his soldiers could ever forget the cruelties and extortions which their own country had been compelled to endure when overrun by the French: and now that they were once more brought into the land of their enemies, and another period of retribution had arrived; but one sentiment pervaded the whole Prussian Army — that those who had not scrupled to inflict the scourge of war throughout the whole continent, should, in their turn, be made duly sensible of its evils. In Siborne's opinion a contrary train of ideas, or a different course of proceeding, {{on the part of the}} Prussians was scarcely to be expected. Hence the value of the excellent and orderly conduct of the British troops operating as a salutary counterpoise to the domineering and revengeful spirit which actuated the Prussians.|$|E
500|$|Many of Angelou's {{poems are}} {{about love and}} relationships. For example, all the poems {{in the first section}} of Diiie focus on love. In Southern Women Writers, Carol A. Neubauer states that they [...] "describe the whole gamut of love, from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> of passionate {{discovery}} to the first suspicion of painful loss". Over half the poems in Shaker focus on love (specifically its inevitable loss) and doomed relationships.|$|E

500|$|From <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> of the marriage, Anne {{was under}} {{pressure}} to provide James and Scotland with an heir, but the passing of 1591 and 1592 {{with no sign of}} a pregnancy provoked renewed Presbyterian libels on the theme of James' fondness for male company and whispers against Anne [...] "for that she proves not with child". As a result, there was great public relief when on 19 February 1594 Anne gave birth to her first child, Henry Frederick.|$|E
500|$|The {{chemistry}} between Cornell and {{the other}} three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: [...] "He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment,</b> you can't deny it." [...] The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.|$|E
500|$|On Inflikted, Max was the group's {{songwriter}} and lyricist. At {{the time}} of the album recording, he was watching the same four movies almost every day: Apocalypse Now, City of God, A Clockwork Orange, and La Haine. Max revealed to Revolver that he wanted to do something different, and it gave him a lot of ideas. He said, [...] "What came out of this album was more than enough to fill the void of not working together for so long. It's pretty intense.

40|$|Using {{the results}} for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moments</b> of <b>the</b> proton and {{deuteron}} spin structure functions glp,d measured at + the SLAC experiment E 143. we compare the conventional method of obtaining from those moments the quark helicity contributions to the proton spin assuming SU(3) flavor symmetry (which implies a strange quark sea helicity Δs≠ 0) to the results obtained assuming Δs= 0. We conclude that current experimental uncertainties cannot rule out the latter. Using Δs= 0 we extract the SU(3) flavor F and D terms directly from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moments,</b> which give an estimate of possible symmetry breaking. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

And, with Eric B. & Rakim, I think that was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> where I felt like, 'I've got to own this. This is crucial." ...|$|E

Depp's faith in Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides was somewhat shaken after the resignation, with Depp explaining that [...] "There's a fissure, {{a crack in}} my enthusiasm at the moment. It was all born in that office". Depp also explained Cook {{was one of the}} few who accepted his portrayal of Jack Sparrow: [...] "When things went a little sideways on the [...] and others at the studio were less than enthusiastic about my interpretation of the character, Dick was there from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment.</b> He trusted me".|$|E
500|$|The {{themes in}} the first section of Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie focus on love. [...] In Southern Women Writers, Carol Neubauer states that the first twenty poems in the volume [...] "describe the whole gamut of love, from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> of passionate {{discovery}} to the first suspicion of painful loss". [...] Kirkus Review finds more truth in the poems in this section, which describe love {{from the perspective of a}} Black woman, compared to those in the second section. [...] Hagen feels that Angelou's best love poem in Diiie is [...] "The Mothering Blackness", which uses repetition and biblical allusions to state that the Black mother loves and forgives her children unconditionally.|$|E

500|$|It was, however, an {{unrealistic}} aspiration.

Rehman described his international debut {{as one of the}} best memories he has in football, adding, [...] "The reception I received from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> till the last was unforgettable. I felt loved, appreciated, respected and wanted and most of all the interest in football really grew immensely."

500|$|Colbert {{has been}} married to Evelyn [...] "Evie" [...] McGee-Colbert since 1993. She is the {{daughter}} of prominent Charleston civil litigator Joseph McGee, [...] of the firm Buist Moore Smythe McGee. His wife appeared with him in an episode of Strangers with Candy as his mother. She also had an uncredited cameo as a nurse in the series pilot and a credited one (as his wife, Clair) in the film. McGee-Colbert actually met Jon Stewart before she met her future husband in 1990. They met at the world premiere of Hydrogen Jukebox at the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston. Colbert later described <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> he met Evie as being a love at first sight encounter; however, moments after they met, they both realized they had grown up together in Charleston and had many mutual friends.|$|E

[...] Ne-Yo further stated that Rihanna is not afraid to trying new things and from <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>moment</b> she heard the song he knew she would like it, [...] "I trust Rihanna to be Rihanna, and she trusts me to be me. That's the coolest thing about our relationship. I must say this song is a step in somewhat of a different direction for both of us."
