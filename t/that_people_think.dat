The ordinary metals have lower melting points and cohesive energies {{than those of}} the transition metals. Gray identifies as ordinary metals: aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, nihonium, tin, lead, flerovium, bismuth, moscovium, and livermorium. He adds that, 'in reality most of the metals <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> of as ordinary are in fact transition metals...'.|$|E

So the people who see us in the street and still shout 'We are young' may not like the new album, but fans who have grown up with us and know to expect change probably will." ...|$|E

If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing. I am totally cool with that. Definitely. I see myself as sexy. If you are comfortable with it, it can be very classy and it can be very appealing." [...] The single [...] "We Need a Resolution" [...] was argued to have transformed [...] "the once tomboy into a sexy grown woman". Aaliyah mentioned that her mother, during her childhood, would take pictures of her and notice a sex appeal. She reinforced her mother's belief by saying that she did feel [...] "sexy for sure" [...] and that she embraced it and was comfortable with this view of her.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you just look at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E

The video was shot between those of [...] "Kitty Kat" [...] and [...] "Green Light", and took about one and half days of filming. Jay-Z performed his rap scenes first, [...] afterwards Knowles studied his scene, and then did her impersonation of him. Melina said: [...] "If anybody knows Jay-Z, it would be Beyoncé". Knowles commented on her impersonation of Jay-Z on MTV, [...] "I love what I did in [...] because it's completely out of my character, {{or at least the}} character <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> I am. I was pretending to be Jay, and he was there, and I told him he had to leave, because I couldn't do it with him in the room — it was way too embarrassing. I think I did a pretty good job. I had the lip curl down!" [...] The video premiered on February 28, 2007, on BET's 106 & Park, with the video for Knowles' other single release, [...] "Beautiful Liar" [...] (2007) featuring Shakira, premiering the same day on Total Request Live (TRL).|$|E
500|$|Frank and Roo {{decide to}} get married because she is pregnant. Downing said that the serial was {{approaching}} sex before marriage in a liberal way. The writers dealt with it [...] "sensibly" [...] because Frank and Roo {{make up their own}} minds. She added {{that it was important to}} let teenagers show their maturity if they want to marry. Roo keeps her baby's paternity a secret until the wedding day. In the middle of exchanging vows, Roo decides to be honest and tells Frank the truth. A wedding scenario had been planned for Roo, by the serial's writing team from the off-set. Bateman said that the wedding was not just to attract more viewers. He opined <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that weddings were always based on the [...] "consummation of love". Roo and Frank's wedding highlighted that it does not always work that way. The wedding episode resulted in a ratings boost and heightened media interest for Home and Away. Magazines and newspapers labelled it as a [...] "shotgun wedding". Frank and Roo's wedding storyline was also covered by TV Week as their main story. Papps and Clarke were the first ever Home and Away cast members to feature on the cover of the magazine. Papps told J Clayden that Frank would never get over Roo lies about the baby's father. When Frank learns the truth, he leaves Roo at the altar. He then crashes his car and which leaves Frank in a coma.|$|E

500|$|American Life is {{suffused with}} Ahmadzaï's {{characteristic}} production techniques, like stuttering instruments and vocals, oscillating loop tones recalling 1950s Sonar pulses, morphing vocals consisting of grunts and squeals and treatments {{that make the}} music freeze in between rhythms. The producer hoped that using stuttering would become a rage in the future world of recording. He believed <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> it is not natural to skip and stutter the music. But he used it {{to create a new}} groove. With the help of Pro Tools, he froze the audio at any point he wanted to change the rhythm of the tracks. Madonna discussed the recording of the title track stating that Ahmadzaï had encouraged her to rap spontaneously, about all the materialistic objects that she herself had been using and doing. They had an instrumental breakdown in [...] "American Life", where the producer encouraged Madonna to add a rap about her everyday life. [...] "Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like'. So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous," [...] she added.|$|E

2500|$|Social {{cognition}} is {{a growing}} area of social psychology that studies how people perceive, think about, and remember information about others.

The study of how people form beliefs about each other while interacting is known as interpersonal perception.|$|E

2500|$|Besides {{opening a}} flood of {{tactical}} and strategic opportunities, the Revolutionary Wars also {{laid the foundation for}} modern military theory. Later authors that wrote about [...] "nations in arms" [...] drew inspiration from the French Revolution, in which dire circumstances seemingly mobilized the entire French nation for war and incorporated nationalism into the fabric of military history. Although the reality of war in the France of 1795 would be different from that in the France of 1915, conceptions and mentalities of war evolved significantly. Clausewitz correctly analyzed the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras to give posterity a thorough and complete theory of war that emphasized struggles between nations occurring everywhere, from the battlefield to the legislative assemblies, and to the very way <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>think.</b> War now emerged as a vast panorama of physical and psychological forces heading for victory or defeat.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of banknotes, precious or semi-precious metals minted into coins to certify their substance were widely used as a medium of exchange. The value that people attributed to coins was originally based upon the value of the metal unless they were token issues or had been debased. Banknotes were originally a claim for the coins held by the bank, but due to the ease with which they could be transferred and the confidence that people had in the capacity of the bank to settle the notes in coin if presented, they became a popular means of exchange in their own right. They now make up a very small proportion of the [...] "money" [...] <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that they have as demand deposit bank accounts and electronic payments have negated the need to carry notes and coins.|$|E

[...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying.

2500|$|A {{reviewer}} {{from the}} New York Times evaluated Ginsberg's The Captive Public: How Mass Opinion Promotes State Power 1986. Ginsberg argued <b>that</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> they're in control since they vote and answer public opinion polls, but {{he argues that}} such control is illusory. He thinks government used tactics such as extending rights of modern citizenship to diverse new groups, such as minorities and women, as well as encouraging voting {{as an alternative to}} more dangerous unwanted protests, such as striking or rioting, to tame a wary public. [...] "To vote meant not to strike or riot," [...] and the state preferred citizens to vote rather than mount more serious challenges to its power such as lawsuits, protests, organizing, parliamentary procedure, or lobbying. Schools taught children the benefits of voting with such repetition until it became a [...] "tenacious myth of mass control," [...] in his view. Since elections happen periodically, they limit citizen participation in politics to the selection of leaders and keep people away from policy formation. Ginsberg sees public opinion polling as a [...] "subtle instrument of power" [...] since it renders opinions [...] "less dangerous, less disruptive, more permissive, and, perhaps, more amenable to governmental control." [...] He sees policy based not on mass opinion but on managing mass opinion, a kind of giant public relations project. Reviewer Mark Crispin Miller found Ginsberg's analysis compelling but [...] "a bit too careful to do justice to the complex advertising mechanism that has swallowed up our politics," [...] and found his focus [...] "too narrow", [...] "too simple", with a [...] "libertarian bias." [...] He criticizes Ginsberg's terms as [...] "too crude" [...] such as using [...] "the state" [...] to describe regulatory agencies, and for equating agencies such as the Office of Economic Opportunity with Big Brother. Miller criticized Ginsberg for ignoring the [...] "subtle and extensive interrelationships" [...] between government, corporations, advertising agencies and the mass media. Miller thinks Ginsberg underestimated the public, and [...] "has translated his fellow citizens into a featureless manipulated mass, without fears or desires worth taking seriously." ...|$|E
