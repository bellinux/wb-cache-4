25|$|At 15:00 on Christmas Eve, Sveriges Television airs Kalle Anka och hans vänner önskar God Jul (From All of Us <b>to</b> <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>You),</b> {{commonly}} referred to as Kalle Anka - Donald Duck. (Donald {{is by far the most}} popular Disney cartoon in Sweden.) This one-hour show mostly contains clips from classical Disney films, such as Robin Hood and The Jungle Book (with the song The Bear Necessities), as well as promotional clips for recent Disney films, concluded with the song When You Wish Upon A Star. The show is one of the highest-rated Swedish television programs, only rivalled by international sports events and the Eurovision Song Contest, and most Swedish people can recite much of the show.|$|E
500|$|We {{have written}} them {{because we are}} mindful of God's gifts, which He has {{bestowed}} on our unworthy self {{from the beginning of}} life until the present moment ... and in gratitude we show <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> the talent He has entrusted to us. How can we be silent before such an abundance of blessings, or out of ingratitude bury the talent that has been given to us (Mt. 25:18), like ungrateful and evil servants? ... By our oral teaching we encourage you too to strive that you may have part in His gifts and enjoy them, the gifts of which we, though unworthy, have been partakers through His unutterable goodness. (Discourse XXXIV) ...|$|E
500|$|On May 10, 2010, the fortieth {{anniversary of}} Orr scoring the game-winning goal against the St. Louis Blues in {{overtime}} to clinch the 1970 Stanley Cup, the Bruins commemorated the event with a bronze statue of Orr outside the TD Garden, the Bruins' home rink. The statue depicts Orr sprawled in mid-flight after scoring the goal. The unveiling {{was attended by}} many of Orr's past teammates. Orr spoke at the unveiling: [...] "This specific moment and time we celebrate with this statue is something we can all now nostalgically remember with fondness, together, each time we enter Boston Garden. <b>To</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> {{thank you very much}} {{from the bottom of my}} heart. I'm honoured. Guys, thank you." [...] In 2012, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.|$|E

500|$|When Pedro II {{left the}} palace, the {{soldiers}} who were standing guard outside instinctively presented arms, and he responded by raising his hat. A few close friends voluntarily accompanied the Imperial Family into exile, including André Rebouças and Franklin Dória, baron of Loreto. [...] Very few were on hand to witness the departure. They {{were taken to the}} steamship Parnaíba and after that to the ship Alagoas, in which they sailed the next day to Europe. Before the final departure, Pedro II sent a short message to his faithful friend the Marquis of Tamandaré, who had remained at his side until embarkation: [...] "What is done, is done. It remains <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> to establish order and to consolidate your institutions." [...] After learning that the Emperor had left, Benjamin Constant spoke: [...] "It is fulfilled, the most painful of our duties." [...] Major Carlos Nunes de Aguiar later recalled saying to Rui Barbosa, who had been at his side witnessing the departure from afar: [...] "You were right to weep when the Emperor left." [...] Historian Lilia Moritz Schwarcz said that it was [...] "the end of the monarchy, but not of myth, called d. Pedro." ...|$|E
500|$|The live {{performance}} for [...] "I Was Here" [...] {{as part of}} 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, where it served as the closing song, was taped and premiered online on November 16, 2011. It was added on the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4, which was released in late November 2011. The video begins with Beyoncé onstage in a shimmery silver minidress, giving the crowd {{a bit of a}} windup about where [...] "I Was Here" [...] came from. She says: [...] "It's taken {{a lot of hard work}} to get to where I am. I searched all around the world, and I found myself. You all are my inspiration. I want to sing this last song and dedicate it <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> guys." [...] The video then turns into a career retrospective in the form of Beyoncé's home movies and her professional highlights. It splices poignant memories throughout Beyoncé's life, from her childhood, to partying and vacations with her family, to most of the locations she visited around the world, to her rise with Destiny's Child into solo stardom and her love story with Jay-Z. Also containing footage from major performances and awards shows, the clip begins with a young Beyoncé thanking the judges in a talent show and later doing the snake in her living room, performing in her TLC-inspired neon overalls.|$|E
2500|$|While {{accepting}} {{the award for}} Best Director at the 80th Academy Awards, Joel Coen said that [...] "Ethan and I have been making stories with movie cameras since we were kids", recalling a Super 8 film they made titled [...] "Henry Kissinger: Man on the Go". [...] "Honestly," [...] he said, [...] "what we do now doesn't feel that much {{different from what we}} were doing then. We're very thankful <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> out there for continuing to let us play in our corner of the sandbox." [...] It was {{only the second time in}} Oscar history that two individuals shared the directing honor (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins were the first, winning for 1961's West Side Story).|$|E

5000|$|McHale {{described}} his work; Parts <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> my novels are funny. But there's a tragi-comic sense <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them. <b>You</b> can't deny the comedy, but neither can you deny the tragedy. It's there.|$|R
2500|$|Approaching his 70th birthday, Jackson {{announced}} his first retirement from college football {{at the end}} of the 1998 season and his intention to live full-time at his home in California. Choosing the first BCS National Championship Game as his last broadcast, Jackson called the 1999 National Championship at the Fiesta Bowl between Tennessee and Florida State. He concluded the program by stating [...] "Tennessee 23, Florida State 16. And so it is done. I say goodbye <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> God bless and good night." [...] During the game, Jackson also verbally recognized that John Ward, Tennessee's long-time radio sportscaster, was also broadcasting his last football game for the Vols. [...] Ward remained retired; however, Jackson did not. During the final minutes of the game Jackson upset many Tennessee fans by focusing his commentary on his upcoming retirement rather than the game going on, detracting from the historic championship and revelry of the team.|$|E
2500|$|Following the lynching on October 16, 2000, Riccardo Cristiano, {{the deputy}} {{head of the}} Jerusalem bureau of Italy's state {{television}} channel RAI, published a letter (...) in Al-Hayat al-Jadida, the official daily newspaper of the Palestinian Authority (PA). In the letter (entitled [...] "Special Clarification by the Italian Representative of RAI, the Official Italian Television Station"), Cristiano denies that RAI had any involvement with the filming of the incident {{and that one of}} the station's Italian competitors was responsible for the footage. He wrote, [...] "We [...] emphasize <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> that the events did not happen this way, because we always respect (will continue to respect) the journalistic procedures with the Palestinian Authority for (journalistic) work in Palestine and we are credible in our precise work." [...] The Italian correspondent also praised the PA, declaring, [...] "We congratulate you [...] and think that it is our duty to put you in the picture (of the events) of what happened on October 12 in Ramallah.... We thank you for your trust, and {{you can be sure that}} this is not our way of acting. We do not (will not) do such a thing." ...|$|E
