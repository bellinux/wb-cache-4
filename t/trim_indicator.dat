40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a reliability {{analysis of a}} technical system. It {{is divided into three}} main sections. The first section introduces some of the most significant problems of reliability. It deals with a definition and an expresion of reliability, a reliability diagram selection and {{a detailed description of the}} reliability analysis. This part also includes an overview of reliability analysis types. Some of the most widely used reliability analyses are briefly described; further advantages and disadvantages of using each method are listed. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis - FMEA is then described in a greater detail. The second section contains an analysis of aviation conditions as well as a design of a reliability analysis that concerns a selected digital system; the system under analysis is a pitch <b>trim</b> <b>indicator.</b> The main design issue lies in a choice of a most suitable method. This choice stems from the overview of reliability analyses presented in the first section of the thesis. In the last section, a FMEA reliability analysis of the pitch <b>trim</b> <b>indicator</b> is conducted. This part includes a discussion of the results as well as a design action that is to lead to an increase in reliability of the analyzed system...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} alternative indicators of underlying or "core" inflation in the French case. Four broad measures are considered and implemented. The first two are inflation excluding food and energy, and the <b>trimmed</b> inflation <b>indicator.</b> We then implement two methods relying on time-series models: the Dynamic Factor Index and the structural VAR approach. Each indicator stresses on {{a particular type of}} shock on the inflation rate, so that no simple ranking of the measures emerges. Combining the various indicators conveys valuable information for appraising short term inflation developments. As regards theoretical interpretation, no indicator is fully satisfactory, lacking an explicit representation of monetary policy. However, comparing forecast performance with respect to inflation provides some specific support in favor of <b>trimmed</b> mean <b>indicators.</b> Core inflation; Trimmed mean estimators; Dynamic Factor Index...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review {{was conducted to}} identify past efforts in providing control guidance for aircraft upset recovery including stall recovery. Because guidance is integrally linked to the intended function of aircraft attitude awareness and upset recognition, it is difficult, if not impossible, to consider these issues separately. This {{literature review}} covered the aspects of instrumentation and display symbologies for attitude awareness, aircraft upset recognition, upset and stall alerting, and control guidance. Many different forms of symbology have been investigated including, but not limited to, pitch scale depictions, attitude indicator icons, horizon symbology, attitude recovery arrows, and pitch <b>trim</b> <b>indicators.</b> Past research on different visual and alerting strategies that provide advisories, cautions, and warnings to pilots before entering an unusual attitude (UA) are also discussed. Finally, potential control guidance for recovery from upset or unusual attitudes, including approach-to-stall and stall conditions, are reviewed. Recommendations for future research are made...|$|R
25|$|The first {{generation}} V70 was an improved {{development on the}} basis of the Volvo 850 estate. Overall design became more rounded doing away with the 850's square edges. Among the many changes were a completely revised front end, fully painted bumpers and side <b>trim</b> and clear <b>indicator</b> lenses all around. Most of the interior was redesigned, with new seats, door panels and dashboard. According to Volvo a total of 1800 changes were made.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced in Europe in late 1996 for the 1997 {{model year}} {{and later in}} the U.S. for the 1998 model year, the Volvo S70 was an updated version of the Volvo 850 saloon. [...] The S70's body style was overall more rounded {{compared}} to its predecessor. Changes included a redesigned front end with new lights, fully colour-coded bumpers and side <b>trim,</b> and clear <b>indicator</b> lenses for the rear lights, as well as a redesigned interior. According to Volvo, a total of 1800 changes were made.|$|R

According to Volvo a total of 1800 changes were made.Standard equipment was significantly improved with remote central locking, heated & electrically adjustable mirrors, 2 front- and 2 sideairbags, power brakes with ABS and power windows being standard on every car. Trim levels varied for each market as did equipment levels of the most basic trims. In the United States, the badging denoted the engine variant and to some extent the equipment level, whereas in Europe engines and options could be chosen individually. In all markets more powerful versions received better or upgraded standard equipment. The T5 and R were the series high-performance models.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{launched}} as the Datsun Prairie in Europe and was rebranded to Nissan {{along with the}} rest of the range from 1984, at first featuring 'Datsun by Nissan' badging and then solely 'Nissan' badging from 1985. However, as Prairie was a slow but steady seller, some instrument clusters remained with the Datsun script featuring on the centre of the speedometer. Nissan tried, with partial success, to cover over the script a grey sticker over the plastic fascia of the instruments, rather than on the speedometer itself. The 1.5L engine was dropped from the UK market sometime after the 1986 facelift with the 1.8 being the sole engine offered. From the facelift (larger front lights, larger front indicators with additional side repeat <b>indicators,</b> <b>trim</b> improvements, redesigned rear tail light clusters) onwards the UK model was available either in 1.5 GL, 1.8 SGL or 1.8 SGL Anniversary II specification (featuring two-tone paint, electric front windows, electric steel sliding sunroof, Power Assisted Steering and a dealer applied 'Anniversary II' badge on the tailgate). The Prairie was sold with a 3-year 100,000 mile warranty and a 6-year anti-corrosion warranty.|$|R
40|$|A ship’s energy {{efficiency}} performance is generally estimated by conducting special sea trials of few hours under very controlled environmental conditions of calm sea, standard draft and optimum <b>trim.</b> This <b>indicator</b> is then {{used as the}} benchmark for future reference of the ship’s Energy Efficiency Performance (EEP). In practice, however, for greater part of operating life the ship operates in conditions which are far removed from original sea trial conditions and therefore comparing energy performance with benchmark performance indicator is not truly valid. In such situations a higher fuel consumption reading from the ship fuel meter {{may not be a}} true indicator of poor machinery performance or dirty underwater hull. Most likely, the reasons for higher fuel consumption may lie in factors other than the condition of hull and machinery, such as head wind, current, low load operations or incorrect trim [1]. Thus a better and more accurate approach to determine {{energy efficiency}} of the ship attributable only to main machinery and underwater hull condition will be to filter out the influence of all spurious and non-standard operating conditions from the ship’s fuel consumption [2]. The author in this paper identifies parameters of a suitable filter to be used on the daily report data of a typical LNG tanker of 33000 kW shaft power to remove effects of spurious and non-standard ship operations on its fuel consumption. The filtered daily report data has been then used to estimate actual fuel efficiency of the ship and compared with the sea trials benchmark performance. Results obtained using data filter show closer agreement with the benchmark EEP than obtained from the monthly mini trials. The data filtering method proposed in this paper has the advantage of using the actual operational data of the ship and thus saving cost of conducting special sea trials to estimate ship EEP. The agreement between estimated results and special sea trials EEP is expected to improve further with use of better and more accurate filtering techniques...|$|R
