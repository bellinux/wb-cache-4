5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank {{to the north of the}} ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> systems are to replicate, {{regardless of whether they}} benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems could have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, Jane Addams and Smith had a {{disagreement}} over Hull House's Sunday concerts. Smith, a classically trained musician, felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events {{should be to}} present educationally challenging programs. Addams, felt that the programs should feature more popular music to promote Hull House and recruit broad audiences to experience the environment which the settlement house offered. A compromise was finally reached {{at the turn of}} the decade, with Sunday concerts featuring music which had a more popular appeal, and weekday evening programs focusing on more challenging material. The disagreement over content was serious enough to lead to Smith's resignation in 1901. Though Addams did not relent on the Sunday content, she was able to persuade Smith to remain.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss (Archana Puran Singh) for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. In order to keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Krishna's grandmother objects to this, saying that {{people will want to}} take advantage of his abilities. She then explains that his father Rohit was hired by Dr. Siddhant Arya (Naseeruddin Shah) to design a computer that could see the future in order to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. However, Rohit later found out <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> computer was not for good purposes and he destroyed the machine. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of a broken heart shortly thereafter. Krishna promises his grandmother that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself much to the disappointment of Honey and Priya, who get fired again.|$|E
5|$|Coach Leeman Bennett {{treated the}} season as a {{building}} season, but was disappointed with the team's mental errors and lack of progress. Later in the season, he would begin to privately admit that the Buccaneers' talent was much worse than he had realized. Steve DeBerg won the starting quarterback job after outplaying Steve Young in the preseason, but was benched in favor of Young after struggling {{in the first two}} games. Kevin House and Jimmie Giles were released after an October loss to the New Orleans Saints, along with ex-Dallas Cowboys fullback Ron Springs. Bennett showed up at a press conference held after the season by owner Hugh Culverhouse, unaware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> press conference was to announce Bennett's firing. Giles, then with the Detroit Lions, criticized the move, saying that no coach could compensate for the Buccaneers' lack of talent. He also claimed that administrator Phil Krueger destroyed team chemistry by demeaning players during contract negotiations, pointing to guard Sean Farrell's disgruntlement as an example.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, Crowley {{travelled}} to Mexico via the United States, {{settling in}} Mexico City {{and taking a}} local woman as his mistress. Developing a love of the country, he continued experimenting with ceremonial magic, working with John Dee's Enochian invocations. He later {{claimed to have been}} initiated into Freemasonry while there, and he wrote a play based on Richard Wagner's Tannh√§user as well as a series of poems, published as Oracles (1905). Eckenstein joined him later that year, and together they climbed several mountains, including Iztaccihuatl, Popocatepetl, and Colima, the latter of which they had to abandon owing to a volcanic eruption. Spence has suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trip might have been to explore Mexican oil prospects for British intelligence. Leaving Mexico, Crowley headed to San Francisco before sailing for Hawaii aboard the Nippon Maru. On the ship he had a brief affair with a married woman named Mary Alice Rogers; saying he {{had fallen in love with}} her, he wrote a series of poems about the romance, published as Alice: An Adultery (1903).|$|E

25|$|In the 1989 {{landmark}} case Street v Queensland Bar Association, {{the modern}} approach to interpretation was developed.

In addition, the court overruled a case in which the historical approach was used.|$|E
25|$|About an {{hour after}} Guerin was murdered, a meeting took place in Moore Street, Dublin, between Bowden, Meehan, and Mitchell.

25|$|In the New Dictionary of Sacramental Worship {{the need}} to {{establish}} communion is reinforced as it quotes the General Instruction to the effect <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> introductory rites is ‚Äúto ensure that the faithful who come together as one establish communion and dispose themselves to listen properly to God's word and to celebrate the Eucharist worthily‚Äù (GIRM, 46, emphasis added).|$|E
25|$|Mechitzas come in {{different}} styles, {{depending on the}} number of women the synagogue expects to attend their prayer services, how dedicated the congregation is to accommodating women who wish to pray with the congregation, and whether the congregation believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechitza is to provide a social separation or to prevent the men from seeing the women.|$|E

25|$|The Court of Appeal's {{judgment}} was rendered on 27 May 2011 by Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang.

The Court further affirmed that scandalizing contempt was a public injury and not a private tort.|$|E
25|$|His opponents contest job {{prediction}} claims, primarily {{noting that}} the increase in job creation predicted by Bush's plan failed to materialize. They instead allege <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax cuts was intended to favor the wealthy and special interests, as the majority of benefit from the tax cut, in absolute terms, went to earners in the higher tax brackets. Bush's opponents additionally claim that the tax cuts are a major reason Bush reversed a national surplus into a historically large deficit.|$|E

25|$|Jewel spiders exhibit colour polymorphism. They can {{be found}} in white, yellow, or red colour morphs. Jewel spiders found later in autumn (from March to April) are also {{sometimes}} melanistic, being entirely dark brown to black in coloration.

For example, it has been speculated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> melanistic colour morphs may be to facilitate better heat absorption during the colder months.|$|E
25|$|Two years later, Edward White Benson, at {{that time}} Bishop of Truro in Cornwall but later Archbishop of Canterbury, formalised the service with Nine Lessons for use on Christmas Eve (24 December) 1880. The first service took place at 10:00p.m. on Christmas Eve in the {{temporary}} wooden structure serving as his cathedral whilst the new cathedral was being built. Over 400 people attended this first service. There is an oft-repeated myth <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> service was to keep men out of the pubs.|$|E
25|$|Construction was not {{expected}} to start until 2013, and the earliest expected completion date was 2017.

The project {{has been reported to}} have been cancelled by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson as a cost-cutting measure, although there have been calls for this to be reconsidered, the extension being regarded by Barking and Dagenham council as essential to regenerating the area.|$|E
