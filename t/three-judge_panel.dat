5|$|The {{first appeal}} opened in September 2007 in the Court of Appeal of Paris, before a <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> led by Judge Laurence Trébucq. The court asked France2 {{to turn over}} the 27minutes of raw footage the {{cameraman}} said he had shot, to be shown during a public hearing. France2 produced 18minutes; Enderlin said that only 18 minutes had been shot.|$|E
5|$|As this {{statement}} was not true, Alvarez was indicted {{for violating the}} Stolen Valor Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, {{the place where the}} trial was to occur, rejected Alvarez's claim that the Act was unconstitutional. This decision was reversed by a <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held the law invalid.|$|E

5|$|On January 19, 2010, the Supreme Court {{ordered the}} appeals court to reconsider its {{decision}} to rescind the death penalty, with the same <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> convening in Philadelphia on November 9, 2010, to hear oral argument. On April 26, 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reaffirmed its prior decision to vacate the death sentence {{on the grounds that}} the jury instructions and verdict form were ambiguous and confusing. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case in October.|$|E
5|$|On March 27, 2008, the <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> {{issued a}} {{majority}} 2–1 opinion upholding Yohn's 2001 opinion but rejecting the bias and Batson claims, with Judge Ambro dissenting on the Batson issue. On July 22, 2008, Abu-Jamal's formal petition seeking reconsideration {{of the decision}} by the full Third Circuit panel of 12 judges was denied.

5|$|Shortly before Marsiyem's case concluded, {{the members}} of the White Kijang team were {{assigned}} to other, distant cities. After a final, unsuccessful, plea by Sumaji's council on 5 May 1997 to drop the case, the prosecutor's office appointed Amrin Naim to lead the case against Sumaji. On 15 July, after the legislative elections, the office filed charges; the trial began on 29 July, with two members of the <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> that served in the Marsiyem case.|$|E

5000|$|The Louisiana Supreme Court {{needs to}} [...] "more vigorously supervise" [...] the state's {{intermediate}} appellate {{courts in the}} wake of recent revelations that between February1994 and May 2007, appeals filed in the 5th Circuit by prisoners without attorneys were not reviewed by <b>three-judge</b> <b>panels</b> as the law requires.|$|R
5|$|United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins (520 F.3d 976) is a 2008 {{decision}} of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concerning civil forfeiture in admiralty law.

The government did not appeal the case further.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 2009, Coleman's {{campaign}} {{filed an}} election contest, {{which led to}} a trial before a <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel.</b> The trial ended on April 7, when the panel ruled that 351 of 387 disputed absentee ballots were incorrectly rejected and ordered them counted. Counting those ballots raised Franken's lead to 312 votes. Coleman appealed to the Minnesota Supreme Court on April 20. On April 24, the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Oral arguments were conducted on June 1.|$|E
5|$|The hearing {{began on}} 21 January 1997, under the {{supervision}} of a <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> led by Mikaela Warsito. After both sides were unable to come to an amicable settlement, a several-month-long trial began, in which Udin's family, Bernas reporters, and the police testified. On 7 April 1997, Wuryanto was convicted of destroying evidence for taking the blood, which Marisyem's lawyers speculated was used to frame Sumaji. Only {{a small percentage of the}} damages were awarded, after the court ruled that testimony from Udin's family– whom they saw as having a conflict of interest in the outcome of the case– was ineligible.|$|E
50|$|All {{judges in}} {{administrative}} courts are professionals, appointed {{in the same}} manner as judges who sit in general courts.

5000|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands in 2007, the Appellate Division of the District Court heard appeals from the Superior Court in <b>three-judge</b> <b>panels.</b> From 2007, the Supreme Court hears these appeals exclusively, with its decisions subject to review by the United States Supreme Court if that court decides to grant certiorari.|$|R
50|$|Appellate terms {{consist of}} {{between three and}} five justices of the Supreme Court, {{appointed}} by the Chief Administrative Judge {{with the approval of}} presiding justice of the appropriate appellate division.

Decisions by the Appellate Term must be followed by courts whose appeals lie to it.|$|R
5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Third Circuit, a <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> of Judge Robert Cowen, Judge Morton Ira Greenberg and Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie {{unanimously}} held for the city. In a decision issued in 2015, Judge Vanaskie, writing for the Court, reiterated Judge McNulty's finding that Heffernan's actions in picking up the sign for his mother did not constitute protected speech or association. He distinguished the case at hand from the Sixth Circuit's ruling in Dye by noting that in that case, the employers had inferred the employees' intent from their non-participation in partisan politics rather than an actual action they had taken, as had occurred in Heffernan's case.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{nevertheless}} obtained {{an injunction}} from a Virginia court {{to allow him}} to participate in the game, which was being held in Louisiana. In response, the NCAA threatened to remove the Independence Bowl's certification if Smith was allowed to play. When the bowl forbade Smith from participating, he obtained a restraining order from a Louisiana court to force the Independence Bowl {{to allow him to}} play. On the day of the game, the NCAA attempted to appeal the decision to the Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeals, but a <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> denied the appeal. By this time, the game was about to begin, and Smith was allowed to play.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia NAACP {{filed suit}} {{in federal court in}} 1956 to have the five barratry, champerty, and {{maintenance}} laws thrown out as an unconstitutional infringement of the 1st Amendment rights of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. A <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> of a U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia agreed that three of the laws were unconstitutional, but reserved judgment on the other two laws pending interpretation by state courts (which had not yet ruled on the laws' legality). Both the state and the NAACP appealed. In Harrison v. NAACP, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-to-3 that the district court should have withheld judgment until state courts had considered the issue first.|$|E
50|$|On April 26, 2013, a {{unanimous}} panel of three United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Judges found that MacLean {{was entitled to}} protections under the Whistleblower Protection Act and remanded {{the case to the}} Merit Systems Protection Board for further proceedings. DHS then appealed the <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel's</b> decision to ten judges on the Federal Circuit, all ten rejected DHS' appeal without comment.|$|R
50|$|The {{criminal}} {{procedural law}} {{provides for the}} right to a fair trial and an independent judiciary generally enforced this right. National and regional prosecutors investigate crimes, formulate charges, and prosecute cases. <b>Three-judge</b> <b>panels</b> form the court of first instance; the process is oral and adversarial, trials are public, and judges rule on guilt and dictate sentences. Court records, rulings, and findings were generally accessible to the public.|$|R

5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel,</b> ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
5|$|Lara {{appealed the}} denial of his motion to dismiss to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, arguing that the Tribal Court {{obtained}} its authority from the ICRA, an act of Congress, and that both the Tribal Court and the Federal Court derived their power from the same sovereign. A <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> of the Circuit Court affirmed {{the decision of the}} District Court, holding that the tribe derived its power from its own retained sovereignty that was separate from the sovereignty of the United States. The Eighth Circuit's panel noted that in the Duro decision, the Supreme Court had observed that Congress could address the jurisdictional system, which Congress did. When Congress amended the ICRA, they were addressing a federal common law issue, not a constitutional issue, and were within their authority to recognize the sovereignty of the tribes. The panel then affirmed the trial court on the Petite claim. Judge Hansen dissented, believing that the tribe drew its authority to try Lara from the federal government.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} {{the bombings}} on August 15, 1973, a legal {{challenge}} to the bombings had mounted in United States Federal Court in the case of Schlesinger v. Holtzman. Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman voted against the Case-Church amendment, as she wanted an immediate end to the bombings, and subsequently filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking an order to require such. On July 25, 1973, U.S. District Judge Orrin Grimmell Judd granted summary judgment to Holtzman and issued an injunction ordering the military to refrain from participating in military activities in Cambodia. His order would have become effective on July 27, however, on that day, a <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel</b> of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously stayed his order. Holtzman then attempted to get the Circuit Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court overseeing the Second Circuit, Justice Thurgood Marshall, to vacate the stay. Justice Marshall refused to vacate the stay, issuing an in-chambers opinion. Holtzman then turned to Justice William O. Douglas who granted Holtzman's motion to vacate the stay on August 4, 1973, and he ordered the U.S. Military to cease all bombing in Cambodia. The military ignored his order, and six hours later, the other eight Justices of the Supreme Court voted unanimously to reverse Douglas's order.|$|E
2500|$|North Dakota's {{court system}} has four levels. Municipal courts serve the cities, and most cases {{start in the}} {{district}} courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 42 district court judges in seven judicial districts.

40|$|Abstract: Decision {{making in}} the United States Courts of Appeals occurs {{primarily}} in <b>three-judge</b> <b>panels</b> with rotating membership. A substantial proportion of court of appeals cases is decided by panels that include a judge {{who is not a}} regular court of appeals jurist but is, instead, a district court judge serving temporarily on the court of appeals bench. Taken together, these two traits mean that court of appeals decision making is often a function of small groups with temporary members. In this paper, we set out to examine whether designated district court judges behave differently than their court of appeals colleagues with whom they render decisions. And, in doing so, we suggest a profitable direction for theory building vis-à-vis judicial behavior. Our analysis of data contained in the United States Courts of Appeals Database indicates that the votes of judges on <b>three-judge</b> <b>panels</b> are influenced by the preferences of their fellow panelists and that variance in the ideological direction of votes cast is not systematically related to status as a designated district court judge, with such judges manifesting greater variance in their ideological decision making...|$|R
40|$|The Ninth Circuit’s en banc {{opinion in}} Big Lagoon Rancheria v. California is, thus far, {{perhaps the most}} {{important}} Indian law decision in 2015. Rejecting its <b>three-judge</b> <b>panel’s</b> opinion, the Ninth Circuit, en banc, affirmed the importance of defending tribal sovereignty against invidious state actions. The court denounced California’s use of Carcieri to de-recognize the Big Lagoon Rancheria and rescind the trust status of its land, characterizing it as “a belated collateral attack” on the Tribe and an “end-run” around the APA...|$|R

50|$|The Wisconsin Court of Appeals is an {{intermediate}} appellate court which reviews contested {{decisions of the}} Wisconsin circuit courts. The Court of Appeals was created in August 1978 to alleviate the Wisconsin Supreme Court's rising number of appellate cases. Published Court of Appeals opinions are considered binding precedent until overruled by the Supreme Court; unpublished opinions are not. The Court hears most appeals in <b>three-judge</b> <b>panels,</b> but appeals of circuit court decisions in misdemeanor, small claims, and municipal ordinance cases are decided by a single judge.|$|R
5000|$|The Presidium of the Russian Supreme Court (...) {{represents}} Russia's final {{court of}} appeal. The Presidium consists of thirteen judges: the Chairman of the Supreme Court, its first deputy chairman, its six deputy chairmen {{and five other}} Supreme Court judges. Only the Prosecutor General {{has the right to}} appeal to the Presidium, and as a result, very few criminal cases reviewed by the <b>three-judge</b> <b>panels</b> of the Supreme Court make it to the Presidium. Only 0.4% of criminal cases in 1998 ended with an acquittal in the Presidium.|$|R
