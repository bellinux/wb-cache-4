5|$|As a manifesto, <b>this</b> <b>paragraph</b> became {{significant}} for the amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E

25|$|The {{designs of}} the coins have changed very little since 1879. Among the notable changes were new {{designs for the}} 5 franc coins in 1888, 1922, 1924 (minor) and 1931 (mostly just a size reduction). A new design for the bronze coins was used from 1948. Coins {{depicting}} a ring of stars (such as the 1 franc coin seen beside <b>this</b> <b>paragraph)</b> were altered from 22 stars to 23 stars in 1983; since the stars represent the Swiss cantons, the design was updated when in 1979 Jura seceded from the Canton of Bern and became the 23rd canton of the Swiss Confederation.|$|E

25|$|At the Maariv Amidah {{following}} {{the conclusion of}} a Shabbat or Yom Tov, a paragraph beginning Atah Chonantanu ("You have granted us...") is inserted into the weekday Amidah's fourth blessing of Binah. The paragraph thanks God for the ability to separate between the holy and mundane, paraphrasing the concepts found in the Havdalah ceremony. In fact, the Talmud teaches that if <b>this</b> <b>paragraph</b> is forgotten, the Amidah need not be repeated, because Havdalah will be said later over wine. Once Atah Chonantanu is said, work prohibited on the holy day becomes permitted because the separation from the holy day has been established.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year the French {{mathematician}} Jules Richard used a variant of Cantor's diagonal method to obtain another contradiction in naive set theory. Consider the set A of all finite agglomerations of words. The set E of all finite definitions of real numbers is a subset of A. As A is countable, so is E. Let p be the nth decimal of the nth real number defined by the set E; we form a number N having zero for the integral part and p + 1 for the nth decimal if p is not equal either to 8 or 9, and unity if p is equal to 8 or 9. This number N is not defined by the set E because it differs from any finitely defined real number, namely from the nth number by the nth digit. But N has been defined by {{a finite number of}} words in <b>this</b> <b>paragraph.</b> It should therefore be in the set E. That is a contradiction.|$|E

If the defendant fails a drug test, he may be detained pending verification of the test by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.|$|E

500|$|Another {{reform in}} 1856 {{increased}} the civil pound from 467.711g to 500.000g (the German civil pound {{defined by the}} Zollverein), {{as a first step}} towards metrication. As a consequence the official apothecaries' pound was now 375.000g, i.e. it was increased by 7%, and it was now very close to the troy standards. §4 of the law that introduced this reform said: [...] "Further, a pharmaceutical weight deviating from the civil weight does not take place."

500|$|Once in Philadelphia, Dennie {{resumed his}} {{editorial}} {{career with the}} Gazette of the United States, a Federalist-friendly newspaper. In 1800 Dennie, along with Philadelphia bookseller Asbury Dickens, began work on the Port Folio. Under the pseudonym Oliver Oldschool, Esq., Dennie wrote, in 1803, a scathing attack on Jeffersonian democracy, {{for which he was}} brought up on charges of seditious libel. Dennie wrote, in part:A democracy is scarcely tolerable at any period of national history. Its omens are always sinister, and its powers are unpropitious. It is on its trial here, and the issue will be civil war, desolation, and anarchy. No wise man but discerns its imperfections, no good man but shudders at its miseries, no honest man but proclaims its fraud, and no brave man but draws his sword against its force. The institution of a scheme of policy so radically contemptible and vicious is a memorable example of what the villany of some men can devise, the folly of others receive, and both establish in spite of reason, reflection, and sensation. <b>This</b> <b>paragraph</b> was reprinted in Federalist newspapers throughout the country. While Dennie was acquitted, the severity of the attacks leveled in Port Folio would henceforth be lessened. However, when Dennie criticized democracy, it was not the republican democracy found in the United States today, but rather the [...] "democracy" [...] found in France under Robespierre and Napoleon. Dennie was invoking Aristotle's argument that [...] "an absolute democracy is not to be reckoned among the legitimate forms of government. It is the corruption and degeneracy, and not the sound constitution of a republic." ...|$|E

40|$|Competition law {{judgments}} {{are notorious for}} their length. An extreme example is the 5134 paragraph judgment in Cement. In most cases the appeal judgment is significantly shorter, as with the 391 paragraphs in the appeal in Cement. AC-Treuhand is no exception to that rule, but it takes it to the extreme by reducing the Court’s reasoning to a single <b>paragraph.</b> <b>This</b> single <b>paragraph</b> supports the finding that cartel facilitators are also liable under Article 101 TFEU. The issue whether {{a company that is}} not active on the affected market should also be brought under the scope of article 101, is a difficult matter. However, the Court finds it ‘surprisingly’ easy to solve this matter, which raises practical points as well as some fundamental questions.

2500|$|The second {{paragraph}} continues this point, depicting how {{every event}} that {{will occur in}} the upcoming year is [...] "written on Rosh Hashanah and sealed on Yom Kippur". [...] <b>This</b> <b>paragraph</b> is known by its opening words, BeRosh Hashana, and it is traditional that the litany of possible destinies is read with increasing speed from the phrase [...] "Who shall rest and who shall wander" [...] {{to the end of}} the paragraph. [...] <b>This</b> <b>paragraph</b> reaches its climax with the final line, said by all the congregants in unison, [...] "But repentance, prayer, and charity avert the severe decree." [...] This verse is usually printed in more emphatic typeface and usually with, in smaller type, the words [...] "fasting", [...] "voice", and [...] "money" [...] above [...] "repentance", [...] "prayer", and [...] "charity" [...] respectively – those words are not read aloud but are intended as instructions on how to perform the three acts necessary to avoid (or reduce) the dire punishments. This verse expresses the formula by which a man may obtain a reduction in the severity of the original decree, as expressed in the Bible (Second Chronicles 7:14), the Talmud (T.B., Rosh Hashana 16b; T.J. Ta'anith 2:1) and Midrah (Bereshis Rabbah 44:13).|$|E

[...] (Vatican I, Session 4, Chapter 2, Paragraph 5) Vatican I teaches that St. Peter will have perpetual successors. It further teaches that the Roman Pontiff is the successor. <b>This</b> <b>paragraph</b> wouldn't allow sedevacantism to exist, because sedevacantists believe the last valid Pope was Pius XII (or John XXIII).|$|E
