500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If you <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|... "Like Father, Like Clown" [...] {{was written}} by the duo of Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Krusty's {{religion}} had not {{been part of the}} original concept of the character, so Kogen and Wolodarsky decided to parody The Jazz Singer and establish that Krusty is Jewish. They pitched the idea to co-executive producer Sam Simon, who rejected it, but it was approved by James L. Brooks. Krusty's last name, Krustofski, was established in this episode as pitched by Al Jean. The portion of the episode where characters quote the Bible in support or opposition of clowning were carefully researched. Cited passages from the Bible include Exodus 20:12 and Joshua 1:8. The quotations from the Talmud were also researched, and two rabbis, Lavi Meier and Harold M. Schulweis, were credited as [...] "special technical consultants". Schulweis was asked to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> draft of the script. While not a fan of the show, he felt [...] "it was profound" [...] and added some corrections. He later commented, [...] "I thought it had a Jewish resonance to it. I was impressed by the underlying moral seriousness." ...|$|E
