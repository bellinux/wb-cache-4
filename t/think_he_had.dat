5|$|In {{the third}} and final season, Aang is unable to use the Avatar State. Although {{reluctant}} with the plan at first, Aang accepts to have everyone <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> died and his remaining allies attack the Fire Nation's capital, but are thwarted by Azula. However, Zuko has a change of heart, rebels against his father, and offers to teach Aang Firebending. Aang and Zuko also improve their Firebending powers with the help of their world's last two dragons. During the finale, finding himself on a strange island, Aang is reluctant to actually kill Fire Lord Ozai, despite his four previous past lives convincing him it is the only way. But upon learning that he was actually {{on the back of a}} Lion Turtle, one of four that made the first benders by manipulating humans' chi, Aang receives the Lion Turtles' Energybending ability. With this ability, as he regained his Avatar State, Aang removes Ozai's bending ability, rendering him harmless and ending the Hundred Year War. Later, in the Fire Nation capital, Aang is seen beside Zuko, the new Fire Lord. The series ends with Aang and his friends relaxing at Iroh's tea shop at Ba Sing Se, where Aang and Katara share a kiss.|$|E

No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
25|$|Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started {{thinking}} about breaking Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him {{that he did not}} <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish's last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board.|$|E

25|$|For the Giro d'Italia, Voigt rode {{in support}} of Basso. Following Team CSC's team time trial win on stage 5, Voigt found himself second, {{trailing}} race leader Serhiy Honchar by six seconds. During the first mountains, Voigt helped Basso take the overall lead, while he slid down the board and finished 37th. On mountainous stage 19, Voigt and Julich were in a 20-man break, but as Team CSC was leading the peloton to defend Basso's first place, Voigt and Julich did not work. Up the last climb, Voigt was alone with Spanish rider Juan Manuel Gárate, but as Voigt did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done enough to deserve the victory, he let Garate take the win. Voigt finally got his first win {{of the season in}} the Ster Elektrotoer race in June. There he won stage 4 and helped teammate Kurt Asle Arvesen to the overall win, two weeks before the Tour de France.|$|E
500|$|Mason had hope, {{coming into}} the convention, that it would yield a result that he felt would {{strengthen}} the United States.

Still, he felt that the [...] "hopes of all the Union centre [...] in this Convention", and wrote to his son George, [...] "the revolt from Great Britain & the Formations of our new Government at that time, were nothing compared with the great Business now before us." ...|$|E
500|$|In the November 1902 {{issue of}} the {{literary}} magazine The Bookman Herriman wrote of his profession self-deprecatingly, while poet La Touche Hancock, {{in an article in}} that issue titled [...] "The American Comic and Caricature Art", wrote, [...] "Art and poetry is the characteristic of George Herriman. [...] Were his drawings not so well known one would <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> mistaken his vocation." [...] Herriman's work was increasing in popularity, and he occasionally had front-page, full-color strips for the Pulitzer supplements, such as Two Jolly Jackies about two unemployed sailors, which began in January 1903. [...] He began drawing the cowboy strip Lariat Pete in September for the McClure syndicate after Two Jolly Jackies was ended.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{received}} his first political office in November 1958, following that month's Federal election (in {{which he was}} returned as MP for Gwanda), after one of Welensky's Federal Cabinet ministers requested Smith's appointment as a Parliamentary Secretary in the new United Federal Party (UFP) government. Welensky turned this down, saying that while he appreciated Smith's relative seniority on the back benches after 10 years in parliament, he did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> [...] "shown the particular drive that I would have expected" [...] for such a role. He decided to instead give Smith [...] "a run as Chief Whip, which is generally the step to a ministerial appointment, and... see how he works out".|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{comes to}} terms with her {{difficult}} past, both as a descendant of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and as an African-American who has experienced racism. As she tells interviewer Connie Martinson, she brought her son to Ghana {{to protect him from}} the negative effects of racism because she did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the tools to withstand them. [...] She remains in Accra after his accident because it was traumatic for her as well—so traumatic it reduces her to silence, similar to her muteness after she was raped as a child in Caged Bird. [...] Her friend Julian Mayfield introduces her to Efua Sutherland, who becomes Angelou's [...] "Sister friend" [...] and allows her to cry out her pain, grief, and fear, something Angelou later admitted went against her American upbringing of emotional restraint.|$|E
500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E

500|$|On 3 November 1828 {{a warrant}} was issued for the {{detention}} of Burke, Hare and their wives; Broggan was released without further action. The four suspects were kept apart and statements taken; these conflicted {{with the initial}} answers given {{on the day of}} their arrests. After Dr Alexander Black, a police surgeon, examined Docherty's body, two forensic specialists were appointed, Robert Christison and William Newbigging; they reported that it was probable the victim had been murdered by suffocation, but this could not be medically proven. On the basis of the report from the two doctors, the Burkes and Hares were charged with murder. As part of his investigation Christison interviewed Knox, who asserted that Burke and Hare had watched poor lodging houses in Edinburgh and purchased bodies before anyone claimed them for burial. Christison thought Knox was [...] "deficient in principle and heart", but did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> broken the law.|$|E
500|$|After {{engineer}} Glyn Johns {{had failed}} to compile a satisfactory album from the Get Back tapes throughout 1969, the project passed to American producer Phil Spector, via the latter's connection with Beatles manager Allen Klein. Like Lennon, Harrison welcomed Spector's involvement, and he offered a glowing endorsement of the producer's talents on the sleeve of Ike & Tina Turner's album River Deep – Mountain High. In January 1970, Spector was in London discussing the possibility of producing a solo album by Harrison when the latter invited him to a recording session for Lennon's Plastic Ono Band single [...] "Instant Karma!" [...] After this session, Spector urged Harrison to record his album, which would become the triple set All Things Must Pass. In 2011, Spector recalled of the material that Harrison had amassed, such as [...] "Let It Down": [...] "He had literally hundreds of songs, and each one {{was better than the}} rest. He had all this emotion built up... I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> played them to anybody, maybe Pattie." ...|$|E
500|$|Anderle later {{stated that}} the line [...] "was taken {{slightly}} out of context" [...] and that Love was {{more concerned with the}} [...] "bottom line" [...] than the [...] "artistic" [...] side of business. [...] Asher did not recall hearing the remark and could not verify whether it was actually spoken. He said that, [...] "it seems very much like Mike. And to tell the truth, I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a point," [...] arguing that Pet Sounds [...] "was not much of a success" [...] and that its music [...] "was [...] not what Beach Boys fans were expecting." [...] Parks believes that Love's hostility toward Wilson and Smile was [...] "the deciding factor" [...] in the album's cancellation. In a 1998 deposition related to the memoir , Wilson testified that Love had never spoken the line to him, and when asked if Love's opposition to the lyrics made him shelve the album, he responded: [...] "No. There weren't as many lyrics as there was just—see, Smile wasn't a lyrical thing." ...|$|E

500|$|McElhenny {{was also}} an asset in the {{receiving}} game, becoming a favorite target of quarterback Y. A. Tittle on screen passes. His versatility drew praise from opposing coaches, including George Halas of the Chicago Bears and Steve Owen of the New York Giants. Former Bears quarterback Johnny Lujack lauded McElhenny as [...] "the best running back I have seen in a long, long time." [...] Also noted was his vision; he had an uncanny ability of seeing and reacting to tacklers in his peripheral vision. [...] "If you ever watched McElhenny", explained Washington State coach Jim Sutherland, [...] "you'd <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> eyes {{on the back of}} his head. I've seen him cut away from a tackler that 99 percent of the backs wouldn't even have seen. It wasn't instinct—he just saw the guy, out of the corner of his eye." [...] McElhenny described his playing style as such: [...] "My attitude carrying the ball was fear—not a fear of getting hurt but a fear of getting caught from behind and taken down and embarrassing myself and my teammates." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in Traveling Shoes, Angelou came {{to terms}} with her {{difficult}} past, both as a descendent of Africans taken forcibly to America as slaves and as an African America who had experienced racism. [...] As she told an interviewer, she brought her son to Ghana {{to protect him from}} the negative effects of racism because she did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> the tools to withstand them. For the first time in Angelou's life, she did not [...] "feel threatened by racial hate" [...] in Ghana. The theme of racism was still an important theme in Traveling Shoes, but she has matured in the way she dealt with it. As Hagen stated, Angelou was [...] "not yet ready to toss off the stings of prejudice, but tolerance and even a certain understanding can be glimpsed". This was demonstrated in Angelou's treatment of the [...] "genocidal involvement of Africans in slave-trading", something that has often been overlooked or misrepresented by other Black writers. [...] Angelou was taught an important lesson about combating racism by Malcolm X, who compared it to a mountain in which everyone's efforts was needed to overcome it.|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{returned}} to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into recidivism. Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, {{but at the same}} time he was not certain about the young man's psychiatric state, describing it as [...] "borderline" [...] or [...] "marginal". Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that the boy could just be playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct.|$|E

500|$|Martin {{pleaded guilty}} to running an illegal lottery at the Ford Motors plant he worked at to provide {{proceeds}} for the players. Martin testified that he paid Webber $280,000 in cash and gifts, but as of January 2003 Webber denied receipt of money from Martin and maintained that he had testified truthfully {{to a grand jury}} in 2000 on such matters. [...] Martin stated that there was always an understanding that the money would be repaid after the players became professionals. [...] In the 2000 grand jury investigation, Webber had been asked about whether his off-campus apartment rent had been paid by Martin and whether he had received spending money, jewelry, clothing or a stereo. Webber generally responded by saying either that he could not recall or that he did not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received such gifts. [...] However, prosecutors say that Webber, after turning professional, gave Martin a significant sum of money, in cash, as a partial repayment. In December 2002, Webber's father admitted he had accepted gifts and a small loan from Martin, which contradicted earlier statements. Prosecutors also accused Webber's aunt of lying about a meeting she had with Martin in the updated filing.|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to writing scripts for British television, including Gentry with Roger Daltrey for ITV in 1987, and the 1989 adaptation of Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black for transmission on ITV on Christmas Eve. Lynne Truss, reviewing a repeat {{broadcast of the}} production on Channel 4 for The Times in 1994, wrote that: [...] "Clip-clop is not usually a noise to get upset about. But {{it will be an}} interesting test, today, to go up behind people and whisper 'clip-clop', to find out whether they saw The Woman in Black last night. People who made the bold decision to watch this excellent drama will respond to any 'clip-clop' by gratifyingly leaping in the air and grabbing the backs of their necks." [...] The adaptation nearly went unmade; Kneale had written the script in ten days but been advised by his agent to wait before submitting it to the producers Central Independent Television so that they would not <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> rushed it. When he did submit the script three weeks later, he discovered that Central had been about to cancel the production as they had assumed that Kneale, then 67, {{had not been able to}} complete the work due to his age.|$|E
500|$|Flight 367 {{departed}} from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30p.m. on 26 January. The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, landed at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30p.m., {{where it was}} taken over by Vulović and her colleagues. [...] "As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park," [...] Vulović said. [...] "I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the baggage. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight." [...] Flight 367 {{departed from}} Copenhagen Airport at 3:15p.m. At 4:01p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9's baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart mid-air over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović {{was the only one of}} the 28 passengers and crew to survive the crash. She was discovered by a villager named Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her [...] stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact. Honke had been a medic during World War II and was able to keep her alive until rescuers arrived at the scene.|$|E
