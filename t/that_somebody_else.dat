500|$|On July 13, 2012, President Obama {{sparked a}} {{controversy}} when he echoed her thoughts {{in a campaign}} speech saying, [...] "Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system {{that we have that}} allowed you to thrive.

500|$|The gunfight started during court {{proceedings}} {{in the back}} room of a saloon. Diamond and Truby argued about Truby wearing his hat inside, and continued the argument outside. When Diamond asked for Truby's gun, Truby shot at Diamond, Diamond returned fire, and both men died. An inquest on both men, held in the saloon, found that the bodies each contained bullet wounds from the [...]41 caliber revolvers that were used, and powder burns caused by the proximity of the shootout. Truby also had [...]45 caliber bullet wounds in his back, indicating <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> had shot him during the shootout.|$|E
500|$|Jay Weinberg {{appeared}} {{at a number}} of shows on the first, North American leg, drumming on anywhere from four songs to half the show. [...] He had been a fan of heavy metal music for much of his life, and in playing with Springsteen he integrated a polyrhythmic approach influenced by metal bands such as Lamb of God, Mastodon, and Slipknot with the E Street drumming style derived from big bands and early rock and roll. [...] He received a very positive reaction from both audiences and reviewers as a spark plug for the band, with his vigorous, long-hair-flying style inviting comparisons to Dave Grohl and his potential for replacing his father drawing allusions to Wally Pipp. [...] Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot wrote, [...] "All hail Jay Weinberg. ... With [...] the band’s chemistry was slightly unsettled for the better. ... His fills during 'Radio Nowhere' kicked the song, and the concert, into a higher gear, and galvanized a band that was starting to pace itself." [...] Jay Weinberg said [...] "it's a summer job that anybody would want," [...] while Max Weinberg said Jay's segments allowed him a [...] "total out-of-body experience. For the first time in – I've been with Bruce for 35 years – I've been able {{to go out in the}} audience and enjoy a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert." [...] Jay Weinberg played his first full show on May 14 at the Times Union Center in Albany, New York, as Max Weinberg was in California to prepare test runs for The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien start. [...] Springsteen said of the occasion, “This is the first night in 35 years <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> sat at the drums.” Overall, Modern Drummer magazine's editor said that a college freshman playing on one of the year's biggest rock tours was [...] "certainly a unique story". [...] For the final Meadowlands Arena shows of the first leg, Jay Weinberg did the first but his father took a red-eye flight back from Los Angeles to do the second.|$|E

2500|$|After the revolution, it was {{disclosed}} that Islamist militants started the fire. After the Islamic Republic government wrongfully executed {{a police officer}} for the act, the lone surviving arsonist, angered <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> was receiving credit for his act, admitted to starting the fire. After forcing {{the resignation of the}} presiding judges in an attempt to hamper the investigation, the new government finally executed Hossein Talakhzadeh for [...] "setting the fire on the Shah's orders" [...] (despite his insistence he did it on his own accord as an ultimate sacrifice for the revolutionary cause).|$|E
2500|$|In the May 11th {{edition of}} Texarkana Gazette, Sheriff Presley and Chief of Police Jack N. Runnels asked for any {{information}} on missing persons on the nights of the murders.

5000|$|An SEP is {{something}} we can't see, or don't see, or our brain doesn't let us see, because we think <b>that</b> it's <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> problem. <b>That’s</b> what SEP means. <b>Somebody</b> <b>Else’s</b> Problem. The brain just edits it out, it's like a blind spot.|$|R

[...] "Mother has changed already; I can see that she isn't a bit like herself. There she was fussing over whether he had enough sugar with his tea, and whether the kidneys were done enough for him; then her coming down to breakfast was wonderful. I expect she has found already <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> will besides her own has got to be consulted; it's pretty soon for her to have begun to learn the lesson." ...|$|R

2500|$|American vocal {{producer}} Kuk Harrell, who {{has been}} working with Rihanna since 2007 stated that for Anti, Rihanna was creatively more involved in the making process. Harrell stated that she aimed to push the album in the direction she envisioned. The producer stated that he attempted to move away from mainstream pop music when producing the album's vocals, [...] "Every record that everybody does is a record <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> could've done, if that makes sense. It's so awesome that she just stepped out and was courageous enough to stick to that and be that and do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty and Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz (chief of homicide) {{conducted}} the first interrogation of Oswald on Friday, November 22. When Oswald {{was asked to}} account for himself {{at the time of}} the assassination, he replied that he was eating his lunch in the first-floor lounge (known as the [...] "domino room"). He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker, who had entered the building with his gun drawn. Oswald said that while he was in the domino room, he saw two [...] "Negro employees" [...] walking by, one he recognized as [...] "Junior" [...] and a shorter man whose name he could not recall. Junior Jarman and Harold Norman confirmed to the Warren Commission that they had [...] "walked through" [...] the domino room around noon during their lunch break. When asked if anyone else was in the domino room, Norman testified <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> was there, but he could not remember who it was. Jarman testified that Oswald was not in the domino room when he was there. During his last interrogation on November 24, according to postal inspector Harry Holmes, Oswald was again asked where he was {{at the time of the}} shooting. Holmes (who attended the interrogation at the invitation of Captain Will Fritz) said that Oswald replied that he was working on an upper floor when the shooting occurred, then went downstairs where he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know; {{guess it}} doesn't apply. I could {{understand}} his {{wanting to get}} rid of one <b>that</b> belonged to <b>somebody</b> <b>else,</b> after he'd cleaned it out. Aren't you beginning to understand?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{years that}} had passed since Joe had {{attended}} the village Sunday-school had weakened his once easy familiarity with the characters of the Old Testament. It is possible <b>that</b> he had <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> in his mind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what it means," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "It means <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> has pretended he is Roger here--an enemy who wants to locate the lost mine first, if he can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; and I'll {{tell you}} who <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> is. Mind, I shouldn't say {{anything}} about it if I wasn't sure; that is almost sure; for one never can be quite sure about anything." ...|$|E

What have you and yours ever had from my family but confidence and kindness? We gave you a home when you had none, and here's our reward!" [...] and he flung a parcel of papers down before the old General; who saw the truth at once;--he had known it long before, probably, and sank down on his chair, covering his face.|$|R
60|$|These narrow {{notions about}} debt, {{held by the}} old {{fashioned}} Tullivers, may perhaps excite a smile {{on the faces of}} many readers in these days of wide commercial views and wide philosophy, according to which everything rights itself without any trouble of ours. The fact that my tradesman is out of pocket by me is to be looked at through the serene certainty <b>that</b> <b>somebody</b> <b>else's</b> tradesman is in pocket by somebody else; and since there must be bad debts in the world, why, it is mere egoism not to like that we in particular should make them instead of our fellow-citizens. I am telling the history of very simple people, who had never had any illuminating doubts as to personal integrity and honor.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Because--. Oh, {{you know}} why. Besides, I've told you ever so often, my lord. I thought a gentleman {{would never go}} on with a lady when the lady has told him <b>that</b> she liked <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> better.' ...|$|R

60|$|I did {{wish the}} fool would think {{to beat a}} tin pan, and beat it all the time, but he never did, {{and it was the}} still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me.

6000|$|... "He didn't {{have much}} to say after I told him all I knew," [...] responded Thomas Appleby.

6000|$|... "I hope not, {{with all}} my heart; and I hope <b>that</b> <b>{{somebody}}</b> <b>else</b> may,--unless somebody else should change his mind. Thank you; I am so much obliged to you.

6000|$|... ‘And what I {{recommend}} {{you for the}} present, is, don’t talk, Mr. Landless.
