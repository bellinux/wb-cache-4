5|$|The Committee to Protect Journalists, Proceso magazine, {{and several}} journalists and press freedom {{organizations}} have complained about irregularities {{in the investigation}} and question <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole case. They believe that their colleague's murder {{was part of a}} campaign of intimidation against those who investigate alleged links between drug traffickers and politicians in the state of Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|The Periya Puranam {{version is}} {{interpreted}} as a Brahmanical narrative, where a particular Dalit is granted salvation by transforming into a Brahmin; {{the superiority of the}} Brahmins is reinforced and <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ban of Dalits is not challenged.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} hagiographies of {{previous}} Zagwe dynastic rulers composed during the Solomonic period. For instance, {{during the reign}} of Zara Yaqob (1434–1468) a chronicle focusing on Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (r. 1185–1225) portrayed him as a Christian saint who performed miracles. Conveniently for <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solomonic dynasty, the chronicle stated that Lalibela did not desire for his heirs to inherit his throne.|$|E

40|$|One {{perceived}} {{problem for}} <b>the</b> democratic <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU is that linguistic diversity across Europe {{makes it difficult}} for there to be a viable European democratic community. Joseph Lacey assesses the potential for the EU to take inspiration from multilingual Switzerland in its attempts to strengthen <b>the</b> democratic <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU policy process. He argues that, much like Switzerland, the EU requires a more radical form of democracy to accommodate the diversity that exists between European citizens. He proposes a number of specific measures for improving EU democracy, including the capacity to hold EU-wide referendums, and making the European Commission open to electoral competition via the European Parliament...|$|R
5|$|Various antipopes, however, {{received}} prominent burials, {{including one}} among the papal tombs in Old St. Peter's Basilica (which were destroyed during the sixteenth/seventeenth century demolition). In particular, the conciliar claimants of the Western Schism were entombed in elaborate tombs in important churches by famous sculptors. The tomb of Antipope John XXIII typifies political iconography of antipapal burial, subtly arguing for <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entombed.|$|E
5|$|After Sultan Ali's {{death in}} 1877, the Raja Temenggong of Muar and its village chieftains voted {{in favour of}} a merger of Muar with Johor {{following}} a succession dispute between two of Sultan Ali's sons. Sultan Ali's oldest son, Tengku Alam, disputed <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chieftains' wishes and staked his hereditary claims over Muar. Tengku Alam instigated the 1879 Jementah Civil War {{in a bid to}} reclaim Muar, but was quickly crushed by the Maharaja's forces. During the 1880s, Abu Bakar actively encouraged the Chinese leaders to set up new gambier and pepper plantations in Muar.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work {{that had been done}} by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath also contributed to the paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E

25|$|The three crucial {{problems}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European {{economic governance}} {{emerged during the}} crisis are the asymmetry in the policy-making process for centralized policies and decentralized ones, ambiguities related to <b>the</b> coherent functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> euro area and the EU {{as well as of}} distribution of powers between national institutions and supranational ones, which implies <b>the</b> dilemma <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European economic governance and its rules.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First Crusade, Crusader armies assembled at Constantinople and promised to return to the Byzantine Empire any land they might conquer. However, Bohemond, the son of Alexios' former enemy Robert Guiscard, claimed the Principality of Antioch for himself. Alexios did not recognize <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Principality, and Bohemond went to Europe looking for reinforcements. He launched into open warfare against Alexios, but he was soon forced to surrender and negotiate with Alexios at the imperial camp at Diabolis (Devol), where the Treaty was signed.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, the {{interpretation}} of Magna Carta and the First Barons' War shifted. Henry VII took power {{at the end of}} the turbulent Wars of the Roses, followed by Henry VIII, and extensive propaganda under both rulers promoted <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regime, the illegitimacy of any sort of rebellion against royal power, and the priority of supporting the Crown in its arguments with the Papacy.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This {{is at odds with}} the traditional Egyptian system where <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E

40|$|Published online: 04 December 2007 This is an {{introduction}} to a Special Issue that first considers representative and deliberative conceptions <b>of</b> democratic <b>legitimacy</b> in <b>the</b> EU, and then presents empirical research on how <b>the</b> institutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU are attempting to increase <b>the</b> democratic <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-level political system. The first three articles concern central democratic concepts and use political theory and institutional analysis. <b>The</b> second set <b>of</b> three articles turns to an empirical analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> institutions and institutional processes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU and the member states, including the European Commission and the media, the European Parliament and <b>the</b> Open Method <b>of</b> Coordination. It is concluded that both representative and deliberative mechanisms within each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> member states and the EU institutions need to be improved {{in order to increase}} <b>the</b> democratic <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU among the citizens...|$|R

5|$|In September 2007 {{a public}} {{discussion}} between supporters {{and opponents of}} the mosque plan was held at Ithaca House in Stratford. Issues discussed included <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concerns about the mosque, {{the extent of the}} conservative view of Islam taught by Tablighi Jamaat, their unwillingness to engage in public discourse, the extent that racism plays a role in the mosque's opposition, and the demand for larger facilities in the West Ham area to support the needs of the community.|$|E
5|$|In this context, Tătărescu {{chose to}} back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants' Party, {{remained}} active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning {{it had never been}} enforced any further). Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties, he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> action for the following years. Allegedly, his ousting was recommended by Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants' Party's and, for the following years, the closest of Dinu Brătianu's political allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{war began}} with the Libyan {{occupation}} of northern Chad in 1983, when Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi, refusing to recognize <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chadian President Hissène Habré, militarily supported the attempt by the opposition Transitional Government of National Unity (GUNT) to overthrow Habré. The plan was foiled by the intervention of France which, first with Operation Manta and later with Operation Epervier, limited Libyan expansion to north of the 16th parallel, in the most arid and sparsely inhabited part of Chad.|$|E
50|$|A {{constitutional}} {{reform bill}} {{passed by the}} Italian Parliament in April 2016, which is still awaiting popular confirmation by referendum, will require the Constitutional Court to decide on <b>the</b> consititutional <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electoral law even if the aforementioned application is rejected.

5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains {{taken out of the}} royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Alfano {{was accused}} of being {{the man behind the}} murder of rival Camorra boss Gennaro Cuocolo and his wife. The trial against Alfano and his {{associates}} in Viterbo in 1911–12, expanded from a murder case into a tribunal against the Camorra and attracted a lot of attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in July 1912, and despite the fact that <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial was seriously questioned when the main witness for the prosecution retracted, he was only released in 1934 after having served 27 years.|$|E
5|$|At the 34th Session of the UN General Assembly, {{represent}}atives of the People's Republic of Kampuchea and Democratic Kampuchea both claimed the right to represent their country. The former also notified the member nations of the UN Security Council {{that it was the}} sole legitimate representative of Kampuchea and its people. In response, the UN Credentials Committee decided to recognise Democratic Kampuchea by a vote of six to three, despite the Khmer Rouge's blood-stained record while in power. Accordingly, {{representatives of}} Democratic Kampuchea were allowed to be seated in the General Assembly, with strong support from China. By January 1980, 29 countries had established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of Kampuchea, yet nearly 80 countries still recognised <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deposed Democratic Kampuchea. At the same time, the Western powers and the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) also voiced strong condemnation of Vietnam’s use of force to remove the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E
2500|$|Symbolic {{violence}} is fundamentally <b>the</b> imposition <b>of</b> categories {{of thought and}} perception upon dominated social agents who then take the social order to be just.

The dominated then take their position to be [...] "right." [...] Symbolic {{violence is}} in some senses much more powerful than physical violence {{in that it is}} embedded in <b>the</b> very modes <b>of</b> action and structures of cognition of individuals, and imposes <b>the</b> spectre <b>of</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> social order.|$|R

5|$|Blankett and Elphinstone united off the Cape on 10 June 1795 and {{anchored}} in Simon's Bay. There messages {{were sent to}} Sluysken offering an alliance against the French. The Dutch governor was inclined to resist however, evacuating the civilian population from Simon's Town in early July and making preparations to raze the town. To prevent this, Craig landed 800 soldiers and Royal Marines on 14 July, who occupied Simon's Town while the Dutch withdrew to the pass at Muizenberg, through which passed the road to Cape Town. For the next month the two armies observed an uneasy truce, broken by occasional patrols and sniping. During this period, Elphinstone and Sluysken continued negotiations for the surrender of the colony. These negotiations were stalled by disputes in the colonial government regarding <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deposed William of Orange and suspicion concerning British intentions. While the debates continued, British envoys were permitted free movement in Cape Town, making detailed observations of the defences.|$|E
5|$|By 1100, {{there were}} several Crusader states, {{including}} the Principality of Antioch, founded by Bohemond in 1098. It was argued that Antioch {{should be returned to}} the Byzantines, despite Alexios's supposed betrayals, but Bohemond claimed it for himself. Alexios, of course, disagreed; Antioch had an important port, was a trade hub with Asia and a stronghold of the Eastern Orthodox Church, with an important Eastern Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch. It had only been captured from the empire a few decades previously, unlike Jerusalem, which was much farther away and had not been in Byzantine hands for centuries. Alexios therefore did not recognize <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Principality, believing it should be returned to the Empire according to the oaths Bohemond had sworn in 1097. He therefore set about trying to evict Bohemond from Antioch.|$|E
5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert <b>the</b> <b>legitimacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fledgling government, but to no avail. Its {{jurisdiction}} extended {{only as far as}} the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
25|$|Having {{lost their}} human hostages, the workers {{decided to take}} {{materials}} hostage to block the restructuring plans. They seized 65,000 watches and hid them in various remote locations.
