5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin inhibit the enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer <b>together.</b> <b>This</b> causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E
5|$|Fuller and Form {{said the}} casting process for Friday the 13th was more {{difficult}} than that for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre because thirteen young actors were involved in Friday the 13th, as opposed to five in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access. When they are taken <b>together,</b> <b>this</b> results in a reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. In advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E

5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group at Aldermaston had to produce the bomb assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for air dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. Both designs were frozen in July. The Green Bamboo design was also nominally frozen, but tinkering with it continued. On 3 September, John Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer <b>together.</b> <b>This</b> design became known as Short Granite.|$|E
5|$|Having {{spent the}} winter {{alone on the}} ocean, {{it is unclear whether}} the Atlantic puffin meets its {{previous}} partner offshore or whether they encounter each other when they return to their nest of the previous year. On land, they soon set about improving and clearing out the burrow. Often, one stands outside the entrance while the other excavates, kicking out quantities of soil and grit that showers the partner standing outside. Some birds collect stems and fragments of dry grasses as nesting materials but others do not bother. Sometimes a beakful of materials is taken underground, only to be brought out again and discarded. Apart from nest-building, the other way in which the birds restore their bond is by billing. This is a practice in which the pair approach each other, each wagging its head from side to side, and then rattle their beaks <b>together.</b> <b>This</b> seems to be an important element of their courtship behaviour because it happens repeatedly, and the birds continue to bill, to a lesser extent, throughout the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant General Walton Walker and the Eighth Army began {{preparing}} a counteroffensive, the first {{conducted by the}} UN in the war, for August. It would kick off with an attack by the US reserve units in the Masan area to secure Chinju from the North Korean 6th Division, followed by a larger general push to the Kum River {{in the middle of}} the month. One of his goals was to break up a suspected massing of North Korean troops near the Taegu area by forcing the diversion of some North Korean units southward. On August 6, the Eighth Army issued the operational directive for the attack by Task Force Kean, named for the US 25th Infantry Division commander, Major General William B. Kean. Task Force Kean consisted of the 25th Division, less the 27th Infantry and a field artillery battalion, with the 5th Regimental Combat Team (5th RCT) and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade attached. <b>Together</b> <b>this</b> represented a force of about 20,000 men. The plan of attack required the force to move west from positions held near Masan, seize the Chinju Pass, and secure the line as far as the Nam River. However, the offensive relied on the arrival of the entire 2nd Infantry Division, as well as three more battalions of American tanks.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March 1805, the French Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve {{successfully}} {{broke out}} of Toulon harbour, avoiding the British blockade fleet under Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson and sailing westwards out of the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic, Nelson following several days behind. Villeneuve, joined by a Spanish squadron, crossed the ocean to the Caribbean and anchored at Martinique, while Nelson arrived at Barbados on 11 June. Panicked by the British arrival, Villeneuve immediately returned to Europe, with Nelson again close behind. Villeneuve's orders had specified that he sail to Brest, the French naval port on the Bay of Biscay, and join there with the fleet under Vice-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume. <b>Together</b> <b>this</b> force would drive the Royal Navy out of the English Channel in preparation for an invasion of Britain. However, as he passed the Spanish port of Ferrol on 22 July 1805, Villeneuve was intercepted by a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder. At the ensuing Battle of Cape Finisterre, Calder captured two Spanish ships but failed to inflict a decisive blow on Villeneuve's squadron, which later sailed to Cadiz, Spain's principal Atlantic seaport. Nelson arrived shortly afterwards and initiated a blockade of the port.|$|E
5|$|One year later, Celes awakens from a coma on {{a deserted}} island and learns {{that the world}} has been devastated by Kefka, who now dominates it as a god-like ruler. Much of the human {{population}} has died and plant and animal life are slowly being killed by sickness, punctuating humanity's despair. Celes sets out from the Solitary Island to try to reunite with as many of her friends as she can find. Celes is only required by the game's story to reunite with Edgar and Setzer, who leads them to the Falcon, an airship that belonged to a deceased friend; however, in a series of mostly optional side-quests, the player has the opportunity to gather the entire group, all still alive, as well as new allies Umaro and Gogo. <b>Together,</b> <b>this</b> quantity of Returners launch a new offensive against Kefka's Tower. Inside, the Returners battle their way through Kefka's defenses and destroy the three statues, the source of Kefka's newfound power. When destroying the statues, once the source of all magic, does not cause any noticeable reaction, the party realizes that Kefka has successfully drained the Warring Triad of power and has become the source of all magical power.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting the {{tendency}} in the Third Reich to have several rival agencies {{operating in the}} same field, {{a number of new}} organizations emerged in the diplomatic field that competed with the Auswärtiges Amt. The most important of the rivals of the Auswärtiges Amt was the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, which was the rival foreign office headed by Joachim von Ribbentrop that operated its own foreign policy in direct competition with the Auswärtiges Amt. Neurath favored a pro-Chinese policy whereas Ribbentrop favored a pro-Japanese policy. In the summer of 1935, Ribbentrop and his friend, the Japanese military attache to Germany General Hiroshi Ōshima, {{came up with a plan}} to square the circle between Germany having to choose between Japan or China, and bring China into the Japanese sphere of influence by devising a plan for anti-Communist alliance that would unite Germany, China and Japan <b>together.</b> <b>This</b> was the origin of what become the Anti-Comintern Pact, but the Ribbentrop-Ōshima plan was vetoed in November 1935 jointly by the Foreign Minister Konstantin von Neurath and by the War Minister Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg , who told Hitler that the Chinese would never join this proposed alliance, and that on economic grounds China had much more to offer Germany than did Japan.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. <b>Together,</b> <b>this</b> demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E
5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches gathered <b>together.</b> <b>This</b> find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E
5|$|The {{physiological}} {{function of the}} AH receptor {{has been the subject}} of continuous research. One obvious function is to increase the activity of enzymes breaking down foreign chemicals or normal chemicals of the body as needed. There may be other functions, however, related to growth of various organs or other regulatory functions. The AH receptor is phylogenetically highly conserved transcription factor with a history of at least 500 million years, and found in all vertebrates, and its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species. In fact, knock-out animals with no AH receptor are prone to illness and developmental problems. Taken <b>together,</b> <b>this</b> implies the necessity of a basal degree of AH receptor activation to achieve normal {{physiological function}}.|$|E
