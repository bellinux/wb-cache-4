5000|$|Excessive {{negative}} air pressure, {{behind a}} [...] "slug" [...] {{of water that}} is draining, can siphon water from traps at plumbing fixtures. Generally, a toilet outlet has the shortest <b>trap</b> <b>seal,</b> making it most vulnerable to being emptied by induced siphonage.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{if the air}} {{pressure}} within the drain becomes suddenly higher than ambient, this positive transient could cause waste water to be pushed into the fixture, breaking the <b>trap</b> <b>seal,</b> with serious hygiene and health consequences if too forceful.

40|$|The {{appliance}} <b>trap</b> <b>seal</b> {{remains the}} primary defence against cross-contamination from the foul air present within the building drainage system. As an identified vector {{in the spread}} of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) in Hong Kong in 2003, <b>trap</b> <b>seal</b> failure has been confirmed as a significant, and potentially fatal, risk to public health. Prevention of <b>trap</b> <b>seal</b> failure depends upon both good design, to limit the air pressure transients propagated within the system, and good maintenance. However, current maintenance regimes rely solely on visual inspections which is time consuming and often impractical to implement in large complex buildings. This thesis documents the development of a novel approach to system maintenance whereby the threat of cross-contamination of disease is minimised by the remote monitoring of <b>trap</b> <b>seal</b> status. This was approached through the application and development of the reflected wave technique which is fundamentally based upon the characteristic reflection coefficients of system boundary conditions. An extensive programme of laboratory experiments and field trials were carried out to collect transient pressure data which, together with results from an existing mathematical model (AIRNET), developed by the Drainage Research Group at Heriot- Watt University, have been used to validate the proposed technique and to formulate a practical methodology which may be applied to any building drainage system. Automatic system diagnosis, which would in the future allow the proposed technique to be integrated as an automated system test, was provided by the development of the trap condition evaluator (TRACER) program by this author. Incorporating a time series change detection algorithm, the TRACER program accurately detects and locates a depleted <b>trap</b> <b>seal</b> by automatically identifying the return time of the trap’s reflection. The reflected wave technique has been demonstrated as a successful approach to depleted trap identification provided that the wave propagation speed is known and the dampening influence of the junction effect (which can delay the observed reflection return time) are taken into account. The reflected wave technique offers a remote and non-invasive approach to maintaining the building drainage system and provides, for the first time, a diagnostic tool to help prevent cross-contamination.

40|$|Improvements {{in public}} health through better {{sanitary}} plumbing systems has been mainly due to the prevention afforded by barrier technologies to the ingress of foul air, which can contain toxic gases and pathogens, notwithstanding the nuisance of malodour. The main defence against this ingress is the ‘trap seal’ which comes in two forms; the ‘water trap seal’ and the ‘waterless trap seal’. Whilst these devices form effective barriers, they are vulnerable to, or can produce, transient air pressure fluctuations in the system {{which can lead to}} seal loss. Greater understanding of the characteristics of these devices is essential for the development of better protection strategies. The development of novel analytical techniques is central to this research as it increases computer model resolution at these important system extremities. Current methods employ a laboratory only approach, whereby a single loss co-efficient is developed. These laboratory derived boundary conditions are inherently static {{and in the case of}} the waterless <b>trap</b> <b>seal,</b> ignore structure flexibility. This research has produced new methodologies to evaluate performance and generate dynamic boundary conditions suitable for inclusion in an existing 1 -D Method of Characteristics based model, AIRNET, which solves for pressure and velocity via the St. Venant equations of continuity and momentum in a finite difference scheme. The first novel technique developed uses photographic image and pressure data, transformed via photogrammetric and Fourier analysis to produce mathematical representations of the opening and closing of a waterless trap under transient pressures. The second novel technique developed focusses on the dynamic response of a water <b>trap</b> <b>seal.</b> Current boundary conditions use a steady state friction factor, ignoring separation losses. Analysis via ANSYS CFX allowed a frequency dependent dynamic representation of velocity change in the water <b>trap</b> <b>seal</b> to be developed, integrating unsteady friction and separation losses for the first time. Incorporation of these new boundary conditions in AIRNET confirms that frequency dependent whole system responses are possible and more realistic, reflecting both laboratory and on-site observations...|$|E

40|$|A {{brief summary}} of {{conclusions}} drawn from this work is as follows: 1. The coefficient of discharge increases directly as the operating head on a siphon spillway while discharging into deep water, and decreases rapidly with increase of head when discharge is in shallow water and air. The rate of discharge increases with the head, and approaches a nearly constant value for higher heads. Similar tests made on the model without the air <b>trap</b> <b>seal</b> {{has the effect of}} increasing the rate of discharge when discharging into air, and a slight increase of the coefficient of discharge at lower heads. 2. Better means of measuring pressure must be sought, and until then, accurate means of obtaining losses from point to point are not available. A Pitot tube exploration seems the best suggestion. The maximum losses are in the entrance, throat, and bend over the crest. Q = AV does not hold for ordimry piezometer tube measurements, and Bernoulli's theorem may not be applied. 3. The principles of similitude my be applied to the siphon, and the scale factor may be increased to 4, with all characteristics remaining the same.

40|$|Demand {{for energy}} is growing rapidly, causing {{worldwide}} concerns on security of supply. Petroleum systems modeling in 4 dimensions (cube + time) predicts generation, migration, and quality/quantity of accumulated hydrocarbons in reservoirs, incorporating temperature and pressure {{through the entire}} evolution of the basin. A petroleum systems model thus provides the only means to combine all physical aspects (source, <b>trap,</b> <b>seal,</b> and reservoir) and timing (charge) to reduce exploration risk and provide a reasonable resource assessment to guarantee a secure and constant supply of hydrocarbons. Over the years, the technology has advanced so far that the basin model results in combination with multi phase chemical reaction kinetics appear to approach reality. Nobody has quantified and published how close to reality these models actually get in the Jeanne d’Arc basin, {{especially in terms of}} charge history reconstruction and fluid quality and quantity. All necessary input data for a numerical model are available: especially for the Kimmeridgian Egret Member, the only mature source rock, which generates hydrocarbons; pvT (pressure, volume, temperature) data; and source and reservoir samples are accessible for more than 50 wells. Furthermore, there is processed, converted and interpreted 3 D seismic available for the Jeanne d’Arc Basin. This makes the basin ideal for the present study. In addition, petroleum systems modeling should itself be tested to constrain correct assumptions and routines, as well as to improve the predictive capacity of the basin modeling approach. The first part of the thesis focused on the reconstruction of the geodynamic situation of the basin yielding new results for the reconstructed heat flow history using a 3 D enhanced McKenzie model. Results show that to understand the thermal evolution of the Jeanne d’Arc sedimentary basin completely, it is crucial to consider the Triassic rift system. This first rift generated the structural framework of the basin, where most of the sediments were deposited. A second extension, in the Cretaceous, represents most likely an ultra-slow extension phase with a heat-impulse, too weak to leave any thermal record. This study demonstrates that the entire evolution of the Jeanne d’Arc basin can be reconstructed assuming just one single Triassic thermal rift. Additionally, the study shows the theoretical effects of lateral heat transfer on the determination of McKenzie stretching factors, its resulting implications for the tectonic subsidence, and the reconstructed heat flow history. The second and third parts concentrate on the determination of source rock properties (chemical reaction kinetics – bulk, multi component and PhaseKinetics) and on the reconstruction of the petroleum reservoir filling history for the entire basin. Petroleum generation and phase behavior were analyzed using phase-predictive compositional kinetic models (PhaseKinetics) determined by pyrolysis of Egret Member source rock samples. Different charge scenarios were tested to reconstruct the most likely migration pathways for the petroleum, which is trapped in the Terra Nova oil field. The most probable filling history includes charge to the reservoir from a local kitchen and a second kitchen located between Hibernia and Terra Nova that was responsible for the long-range contribution. This new migration concept differs from the traditional explanation based on geochemical measurements only (published by von der Dick et al., 1989), which infers that local generation was solely responsible for filling the Terra Nova field. This theory of local generation can be disproved based on a simple mass balance calculation. The mass of the local source rock is not enough to generate the known present amount of hydrocarbons. Finally, the study presents a basin-wide mass balance calculation showing the impact of a newly tested adsorption behavior of the source rock. Additionally, this chapter discusses the influence of different migration techniques (flowpath, Darcy, hybrid and invasion percolation) on a basin-wide mass balance calculation (MBC) in the Jeanne d’Arc basin. It can be concluded that a pure Darcy migration is not sufficient to reproduce the accumulation pattern in the basin and that hybrid or flowpath are the most efficient and precise migration methods to predict correct volumes and composition. Additionally, {{it turned out that the}} applied adsorption model does not adequately reproduce the natural behavior of source rocks (SR). Therefore, a revised approach was applied, in which the adsorption capacity is in general much higher, but diminishes, with increasing maturity. In summary, the study provides new insights into the geodynamic development of the Jeanne d’Arc basin, presents calibrated, verified and tested kinetics for the Egret source rock and presents new aspects of a mass balance calculation for the entire basin...|$|E
