5|$|Some scientists, {{including}} Kerry Emanuel and Lakshmi Kantha, {{have criticized}} the scale as being simplistic, indicating that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces. Additionally, they and others {{point out that the}} Saffir–Simpson scale, unlike the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes, is not continuous, and is quantized into a small number of categories. Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm's winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which is based on surface wind speeds, the radius of maximum winds of the storm, and its translational velocity. Both of <b>these</b> <b>scales</b> are continuous, akin to the Richter scale; however, neither of <b>these</b> <b>scales</b> have been used by officials.|$|E

5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized the continents. Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that <b>these</b> <b>scales</b> are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks {{can be traced back to}} around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.|$|E

40|$|A non-perturbative Renormalization Group {{approach}} {{is used to}} calculate scaling functions for an O(4) model in d= 3 dimensions in the presence of an external symmetry-breaking field. <b>These</b> <b>scaling</b> functions are important for the analysis of critical behavior in the O(4) universality class.

25|$|The {{structure}} of the scales of Platecarpus may have been another adaptation toward a marine lifestyle. The small size and similar shape of <b>these</b> <b>scales</b> throughout the body would have stiffened the trunk, making it more resistant to lateral movement.

The early mosasauroid Vallecillosaurus also preserves body scales, but they are larger and more varied in shape, suggesting that the animal relied on undulatory movement in its trunk rather than just its tail. Plotosaurus, a more derived mosasaur than Platecarpus, has even smaller scales covering its body, indicating that it had even more efficient locomotion in the water.|$|E
