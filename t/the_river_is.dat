5|$|Some 700 metres below Pulteney weir, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> {{joined by}} the Kennet and Avon Canal which connects through Bath Locks. Together with the Kennet Navigation which joins the River Thames at Reading, this {{provides}} a through route for canal boats from Bristol to London. From this point downstream <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> known as the Avon Navigation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} for its dragonfly communities, {{with a strong}} population of Scarce Chaser (found in only six other areas in England), together with a strong population of White-legged Damselfly. Red-eyed Damselfly is also found. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> also {{important for}} aquatic plants, including Loddon Pondweed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> used to {{transport}} lumber from the forested areas surrounding <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Beginning in <b>the</b> 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> {{used to generate}} hydroelectric power. Undammed sections of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>are</b> also used for canoeing, kayaking and recreational fishing.|$|R
5000|$|Originally <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> a {{tributary}} of <b>the</b> Ialomiţa <b>River.</b> In 1927 <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> diverted into <b>the</b> Ilfov <b>River</b> ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> {{named in}} 1843 by Henry Stuart Russell under the mistaken {{impression}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same watercourse as <b>the</b> Boyne <b>River</b> located in Central Queensland.|$|R
5|$|The Avon rises {{just north}} of the village of Acton Turville in South Gloucestershire, before flowing through Wiltshire. In its lower reaches from Bath to the Severn Estuary at Avonmouth near Bristol, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> navigable and known as the Avon Navigation.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge at}} Deeping Gate carries the date 1651, {{and is a}} Grade II* listed stone {{structure}} with three round arches. After the remains of Deeping High lock and Deeping Low lock, there is a junction where the old course, the Maxey Cut, the South Drain and the Folly River, also a drain, meet. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> officially navigable below this point. Through Crowland and Cowbit {{to the edge of}} Spalding, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> laid out with washlands, which were historically used as pasture, because the river was allowed to flood the land when tidal levels prevented the water discharging into the sea. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> bounded on the north and west by a bank, while the New River, a drainage channel to the south and east of it, is bounded by another bank. The land between the channels forms Crowland High Wash, Crowland Fodder Lots and Cowbit Wash. The southern bank is variously named Corporation Bank, Wash Bank and Barrier Bank. These wash lands were designed to be flooded in extremis, although the building of the Coronation flood relief channel has made this purpose obsolete.|$|E
5|$|The {{eastern end}} of the pass is by the River Derwent. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> bridged by the Ashopton Viaduct, built {{as part of the}} Ladybower Reservoir project between 1935 and 1945.|$|E
50|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> dammed up {{which created}} pollution, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> used for {{irrigation}} and for fishing purposes. A clean-up effort in September 1996, {{was a step}} toward <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> restoration.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> {{tested in}} 2009 and had pH levels of 7.6. Oxygen {{saturation}} levels {{at the source}} of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>are</b> 68%. Fish species found in <b>the</b> <b>river</b> include Chub, Roach, Pike and Bream.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> {{named in}} 1901 by the {{surveyor}} Frederick Brockman. It <b>is</b> thought that <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> named after either the shipbuilder, William Chamberlain or the politician Joseph Chamberlain.|$|R
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name for <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> unknown but appears to be Pre-English. In Old English the form was Weolud and may have changed to the Middle English form due to folk-etymology or Scandinavian influence. The Welland (Weolud) is first {{mentioned}} in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 921AD.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{is another}} {{significant}} source of the Sava River basin surface water pollution, specifically through livestock manure production. It is estimated that the nutrient pollution levels generated by manure production equal 32,394tonnes of nitrogen and 3,784tonnes of phosphorus per year. As a consequence, the Sava River is microbiologically polluted in areas affected by the nutrient pollution. One such part of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> the lowermost part of its course between Šabac and Belgrade, where acceptable freshwater bacterial counts are exceeded.|$|E
5|$|Below Prado Dam, the Santa Ana River crosses into Orange County, {{and cuts}} between the Santa Ana Mountains and Chino Hills via the narrow Santa Ana Canyon. The river roughly bisects the county as it flows {{southwest}} towards the ocean. In Anaheim, the entire {{flow of the}} river (except during wet seasons) is diverted into spreading grounds for groundwater recharge of the north Orange County aquifer, providing {{about half of the}} county's municipal water supply. Downstream of there, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> mostly confined to a concrete channel, serving only for flood control and urban runoff drainage, and is usually dry or a small trickle. At Orange it receives Santiago Creek from the east before entering Santa Ana. After crossing under Interstate 5 it passes through the River View Golf Course, one of its few non-concreted sections within Orange County, and then becomes a concrete channel again through most of Santa Ana and Fountain Valley to a point below the 405 Freeway, where the river bed becomes natural (though the banks remain concrete). The mouth of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> located in a small tidal lagoon between Huntington Beach and Costa Mesa, at the northern end of Santa Ana River County Beach.|$|E
50|$|The first European to {{discover}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> explorer Francis Gregory in 1858. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> named by Surveyor General John Septimus Roe after the naval hero Admiral Sir Edmund Lyons.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the nineteenth}} century, early {{improvements}} and alterations to <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>were</b> for <b>the</b> purposes of navigation. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> important for carrying trade and passengers {{and was a}} major transportation route.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Wood <b>River</b> <b>is</b> a {{tributary}} of <b>the</b> Columbia <b>River</b> in <b>the</b> Canadian province of British Columbia. <b>The</b> <b>river's</b> lower reach <b>is</b> flooded by Mica Dam on <b>the</b> Columbia <b>River,</b> until its inundation <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> formerly a {{tributary of}} <b>the</b> Canoe <b>River.</b> <b>The</b> lower Wood <b>River</b> <b>is</b> called Wood Reach, which is connected to Canoe Reach, the flooded lower portion of <b>the</b> Canoe <b>River.</b> Both <b>are</b> part of the Mica Dam's reservoir, Kinbasket Lake.|$|R
5|$|Beyond {{the bridge}} is Bodiam railway station, the western {{terminus}} of the Kent and East Sussex Railway since 2000. On the north bank of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> Bodiam Castle, built soon after 1385 by Sir Edward Dalyngrigge. Lord Curzon restored the ruins in 1919 and gave them to the National Trust six years later. The buildings are grade I listed, and the landscaped grounds, which include a millpond and a Second World War pillbox, are a scheduled ancient monument.|$|E
5|$|Further along {{from the}} Welsh Bridge is the Porthill Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} suspension bridge running between the Quarry and Porthill, built in 1922. The next bridge along <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> Kingsland Bridge, a privately owned toll bridge, {{and the subsequent}} bridge is the Greyfriars Bridge, a pedestrian bridge between Coleham and the town centre. Following the Greyfriars Bridge is the English Bridge, historically called Stone Bridge, which was rebuilt in the 1930s. Beyond it is the railway station, which is partly built over the river. After the station is Castle Walk Footbridge, another modern pedestrian footbridge.|$|E
5|$|Henry III of England {{granted a}} market to the Bishop of Ely using letters close on 9April 1224 {{although}} Ely {{had been a}} trading centre prior to this. Present weekly market days are Thursday and Saturday and seasonal markets are held monthly on Sundays and Bank Holiday Mondays from Easter to November. The city is situated on the River Great Ouse, which was a significant means of transport until the fens were drained and Ely ceased to be {{an island in the}} eighteenth century. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> now a popular boating spot, and has a large marina.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> {{named in}} 1820 by the {{explorer}} Philip Parker King aboard the Mermaid while making charts in <b>the</b> area. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> named after <b>the</b> surgeon on the Mermaid, James Hunter.|$|R
50|$|This small {{community}} {{has had a}} public school since 1862 located in Towamba Street. The original ford crossing <b>the</b> Towamba <b>River</b> <b>was</b> opposite <b>the</b> old Police Station, now a private dwelling. The first bridge built across <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> swept away in the 1919 floods where every bridge on <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> swept away.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>River</b> Gilpin <b>is</b> a <b>river</b> in <b>the</b> English {{county of}} Cumbria. Formerly, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> in <b>the</b> county of Westmorland.|$|R
5|$|In central Bristol, where <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> tidal, it is {{diverted}} {{from its original}} course into the New Cut, a channel dug between 1804 and 1809 {{at a cost of}} £600,000. The original course is held at a constant level by lock gates (designed by Jessop) and is known as the Floating Harbour. The Floating Harbour is protected by an 1870s replacement for Jessop's locks. This unusual dock has a tentacled plan resulting from its origins as the natural river course of the Avon and its tributaries, the River Frome and Siston Brook, and is intimately entwined with Bristol's city centre as few docks are. As a result of this, the Floating Harbour {{is one of the more}} successful pieces of dockland regeneration, with much of the dockside now occupied by residential, office and cultural premises, and the water area heavily used by leisure craft. The Floating Harbour gave the port an advantage by enabling shipping to stay afloat rather than grounding when the tide went down. Downstream of central Bristol the river passes through the deep Avon Gorge, spanned by Brunel's Clifton Suspension Bridge, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> tidal and is navigable by seagoing vessels at high tide but drying to a steep sided muddy channel at low tide. It was largely the challenge of navigating this section that sealed the fate of the Floating Harbour as commercial docks and saw them replaced by docks at Avonmouth where the Avon joins the Severn Estuary.|$|E
5|$|Land use is mixed. The land to {{the extreme}} north {{adjacent}} to <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> mostly industrial, split by the Felling By-Pass. The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. Centrally the land is mixed between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square. At High Felling, land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street.|$|E
5|$|Many sources {{state the}} meaning of Rhondda as 'noisy', though this is a {{simplified}} translation without research. Sir Ifor Williams, in his work Enwau Lleoedd, suggests that the first syllable rhwadd {{is a form of}} the Welsh adrawdd or adrodd, as in 'recite, relate, recount', similar to the Old Irish rád; 'speech'. The suggestion is that <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> speaking aloud, a comparison to the English expression 'a babbling brook'.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> drains Lake Elligo. <b>The</b> Black <b>River</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> main <b>river</b> in {{town and}} is the {{northern}} drain from that lake. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> called Elligo-sigo by the natives.|$|R
5000|$|The first European to {{discover}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> surveyor Robert Austin during an expedition in 1857. In 1858 <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> named by explorer Francis Gregory [...] after the prominent geologist, Sir Roderick Impey Murchison.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Polatiștea <b>River</b> <b>is</b> a {{tributary}} of <b>the</b> Jiu <b>River</b> in Romania. <b>The</b> upper reach of <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>is</b> sometimes known as Obârșia Polatiștei River or Căpriorul River.|$|R
5|$|On its route southwards, {{the river}} passes the former {{junction}} with Aike Beck, once navigable to Lockington Landing, but the stream was subsequently re-routed {{to join the}} Arram Beck. The Leven Canal used to join on the east bank, but the entrance lock {{has been replaced by}} a sluice. The Arram Beck flows in from the west, and then <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> crossed by Hull Bridge, the cause of repeated disagreement between the owners of the Driffield Navigation and the Corporation of Beverley, who owned the bridge. Just above Beverley Beck, which joins from the west, is Grovehill Bridge, now a lift bridge but once a ferry bridge.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outskirts}} of Bridgwater at Huntworth the river passes several local nature reserves which provide roosts for thousands of common starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) each winter. The mouth of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> where it flows into the National Nature Reserve at Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel. It consists of large areas of mudflats, saltmarsh, sandflats and shingle ridges, {{some of which are}} vegetated. It has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1989, and is designated as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. The risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury {{is home to}} Shrewsbury School, {{a public}} school, on a large site ("Kingsland") {{just south of the}} town centre {{overlooking}} the loop of the Severn. The school was once in the town centre, in the buildings that are now the main county library on Castle Street. Opposite it {{on the other side of}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> Shrewsbury High School, an independent girls' day school.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>rivers</b> name <b>is</b> {{probably}} of Celtic origin but {{banks of}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>are</b> lined by villages and places with names of Viking origin.|$|R
50|$|Pueblo {{was founded}} near the {{confluence}} of Fountain Creek and <b>the</b> Arkansas <b>River.</b> After a flood in 1921, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> diverted to Pueblo Reservoir.

5000|$|<b>The</b> Ebi <b>River</b> <b>was</b> called <b>the</b> Ōigawa <b>River</b> (太白川) {{earlier in}} history. It current name, [...] "ebi", is the Japanese word for [...] "shrimp". By legend <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> renamed when {{residents}} of the area presented Minamoto no Yoritomo with a gift of shrimp. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> larger in <b>the</b> Edo period.
