5|$|After {{maintaining}} its intensity for 24 hours, Rachel made landfall at peak intensity near {{the southern tip}} of Baja California Sur. Strong wind shear prevented additional intensification, despite moving into the warm waters of the Gulf of California. After weakening slightly, Rachel made a second landfall midway between Las Mochis and Culiacán. Upon moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as the forward speed increased. Rachel dissipated several hours later on October3. By <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> winds had decreased to 30mph (45km/h).

5|$|After passing {{north of}} Taiwan, Rananim made {{landfall}} at peak intensity around 1300UTC on August12, near Wenling in Zhejiang province in China. The China Meteorological Administration {{reported that the}} typhoon was the strongest to hit Zhejiang since Typhoon Sally in 1956. Moving over land, the typhoon quickly weakened to tropical storm status as it turned toward the west. Early on August13, the JMA downgraded Rananim to a tropical depression and issued the last warning; by <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> circulation was over Jiangxi. The depression lasted another two days before dissipating over northwest Hunan.|$|E
5|$|After redevelopment, {{wind shear}} {{continued}} to be a problem, with convection located southwest of the center. Early on August17, a pulse in the monsoon increased thunderstorms and allowed the system to become better organized. The convection became more concentrated and the circulation less exposed. As a result, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Vongfong early on August18, still in the central South China Sea. Around <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> storm began moving more quickly to the northwest due to a developing ridge to its northeast. Although the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of only 75km/h (45mph), the JTWC assessed Vongfong as continuing to intensify to peak 1minute winds of 100km/h (65mph), early on August19. By <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>the</b> storm was near Hainan, and at 1240UTC that day, Vongfong made landfall in southern China near Wuchuan, Guangdong. It quickly weakened over land, dissipating early on August20 to the west of Guilin.|$|E
