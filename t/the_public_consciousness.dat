5|$|Abolition {{continued}} to be associated in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> with the French Revolution and with British radical groups, resulting in a decline in public support. In 1795, the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade ceased to meet, and Clarkson retired in ill-health to the Lake District.

5|$|The NWOBHM {{began as}} an {{underground}} phenomenon growing in parallel to punk and largely ignored by the media. It was only through the promotion of rock DJ Neal Kay and Sounds campaigning that it reached <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> and gained radio airplay, recognition and success in the UK. The movement involved mostly young, white, male and working-class musicians and fans, who suffered the hardships brought on by rising unemployment for years after the 1973–75 recession. As a reaction to their bleak reality, they created a community separate from mainstream society to enjoy each other's company and their favourite loud music. The NWOBHM was heavily criticised for the excessive hype generated by local media in favour of mostly talentless musicians. Nonetheless, it generated a renewal in the genre of heavy metal music and furthered {{the progress of the}} heavy metal subculture, whose updated behavioural and visual codes were quickly adopted by metal fans worldwide after the spread of the music to continental Europe, North America and Japan.|$|E
5|$|John Greyson became {{interested}} in offering a counterpoint to the Patient Zero story as early as 1987, when the Patient Zero meme began entering <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> following the publication of Randy Shilts's book And the Band Played On. The book described the cluster study {{which led to the}} popular identification of flight attendant Gaëtan Dugas as the vector through which HIV was first brought to North America. It should be noted, however, that Shilts himself never claimed that Dugas was the first. In early 1991 Greyson was given a development grant for the script from the Canadian Film Centre, of which Greyson is an alumnus. Over the next year Greyson, in collaboration with Film Centre partners Louise Garfield and Anna Stratton, continued to develop the script, eventually presenting it with producer Alexandra Raffé in a workshop format. During the first half of 1992, the production team secured additional development funding from the Canada Council, Telefilm Canada and the Ontario Film Development Corporation. By June of that year the script and the songs were completed and that autumn, with funds from the Telefilm Canada and OFDC grants along with revenue from the sale of British broadcast rights to Channel 4, pre-production and casting got underway. Principal photography began in November 1992 and wrapped after five weeks. Sneak previews took place at the Seattle International Film Festival and a number of LGBT film festivals across the United States before its official debut in September 1993 at Toronto's Festival of Festivals.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{his return}} to Italy, Feltrinelli disseminated {{thousands}} of copies of the poster {{to raise awareness of}} Che's precarious situation and impending demise. Later in 1968 after his October 9, 1967 execution, Che's Bolivian Diary with Korda's photograph on the cover was released worldwide. Feltrinelli also created posters to promote the book, crediting the copyright to (c) Libreria Feltrinelli 1967 (in the lower left hand corner of the image) with no mention of Korda. By this time, Korda's image had officially entered <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Alberto Korda later expounded that if Feltrinelli had paid him just one lira for each reproduction, that he would have received millions. However, Korda also expressed that he forgave him, because through his actions, the image became famous.|$|E

Like the Afro-Protestant Revival services, traditional Rastafarian worship often included psalm singing and hymn singing, and Rastas typically modified the words to fit their own spiritual conceptions; Psalm 137 was among their sacred chants.|$|R

25|$|In the 1980s, first genital herpes {{and then}} AIDS emerged into <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> as sexually {{transmitted}} diseases {{that could not be}} cured by modern medicine. AIDS in particular has a long asymptomatic period—during which time HIV (the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS) can replicate and the disease can be transmitted to others—followed by a symptomatic period, which leads rapidly to death unless treated. HIV/AIDS entered the United States from Haiti in about 1969. Recognition that AIDS threatened a global pandemic led to public information campaigns and the development of treatments that allow AIDS to be managed by suppressing the replication of HIV for as long as possible. Contact tracing continues to be an important measure, even when diseases are incurable, as it helps to contain infection.|$|E
25|$|The Home Guard was immortalised in the British {{television}} comedy Dad's Army (1968–1977), {{which followed}} {{the formation and}} running of a platoon in the fictional south coast town of Walmington-on-Sea, and {{is widely regarded as}} having kept the efforts of the Home Guard in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>consciousness.</b> Dad's Army is a BBC television sitcom about the British Home Guard during the Second World War. It was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft and broadcast on BBC television from 1968 to 1977. The sitcom ran for 9 series and 80 episodes in total, plus a radio version based on the television scripts, a feature film and a stage show. The series regularly gained audiences of 18 million viewers and is still repeated worldwide. In turning the popular impression of the Home Guard into a comedy organisation, the series put off a great many veterans from telling their stories and distorted research into the Home Guard for many years.|$|E
25|$|What {{served to}} launch Beuys into <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> was that which transpired {{following}} his {{performance at the}} Technical College Aachen in 1964. As part of a festival of new art coinciding with the 20th anniversary of an assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, Beuys created a performance or Aktion. The performance {{was interrupted by a}} group of students, one of whom attacked Beuys, punching him in the face. A photograph of the artist, nose bloodied and arm raised, was circulated in the media. It was for this 1964 festival that Beuys produced an idiosyncratic CV, which he titled Lebenslauf/Werklauf (Life Course/Work Course). The document was a self-consciously fictionalised account of the artist's life, in which historical events mingle with metaphorical and mythical speech (he refers to his birth as the ‘Exhibition of a wound;’ he claims his Ulysses Extension to have been carried out ‘at James Joyce's request’ – impossible, given that the writer was, by 1961, long dead). This document marks a blurring of fact and fiction that was to be characteristic of Beuys' self-created persona, as well as the source of much controversy (although, significantly, there is no mention here of the famous plane crash).|$|E

In other words, the First World War soldier had become a [...] "victim" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>consciousness,</b> a circumstance at odds with the historical record. The impact of Blackadder on <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>consciousness</b> was so pervasive that Gordon Corrigan referenced it in his book cover copy when he published his book Mud, Blood, and Poppycock, which was an attempt to [...] "dispel various myths" [...] about the war.|$|E
