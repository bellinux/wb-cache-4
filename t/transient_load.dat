40|$|This {{research}} addresses some of {{the difficulties}} faced when operating voltage controlled inverters with synchronous generators in microgrids. First, an overview of microgrid value propositions is provided, and the problems faced when attempting to use microgrids to provide improved power quality are discussed. Design considerations for different types of microgrids are provided to enable microgrids to deliver the desired functionality without adding unnecessary cost. The main body of this research investigates the poor <b>transient</b> <b>load</b> sharing encountered between voltage controlled inverters and synchronous generators in islanded operation. Poor <b>transient</b> <b>load</b> sharing results in high peak inverter rating requirements and high cost. The tradeoff between power quality and power sharing is highlighted, and methods to improve <b>transient</b> <b>load</b> sharing are proposed. The use of current limiting to protect inverters during faults and overloads is also investigated. Stability problems are identified when using simple inverter current limiting methods when operating in parallel with synchronous generators. Virtual impedance current limiting is proposed to improve transient stability during current limiting. The methods proposed in this thesis for mitigating inverter overloads and faults will allow for more reliable and cost effective application of inverter based distributed energy resources with synchronous generators in microgrids.

40|$|A key {{step in the}} {{application}} of formal automated design techniques to structures under <b>transient</b> <b>loading</b> is the calculation of sensitivities of response quantities to the design parameters. This paper considers response quantities to the design parameters. This paper considers structures with general forms of damping acted on by general <b>transient</b> <b>loading</b> and addresses issues of computational errors and computational efficiency. The equations of motion are reduced using the traditional basis of vibration modes and then integrated using a highly accurate, explicit integration technique. A critical point constraint formulation is used to place constraints on the magnitude of each response quantity as a function of time. Three different techniques for calculating sensitivities of the critical point constraints are presented. The first two are based on the straightforward application of the forward and central difference operators, respectively. The third is based on explicit differentiation of the equations of motion.

However, power efficiency, power density characteristics of SC converters are adversely affected by the integration, and characteristics such as response time and noise can be further improved with an on-chip converter. An analysis on speed, power efficiency, and noise performance of SC converters is presented and verified using simulations. Based on the analysis two techniques, converter-gating and adaptive gain control, are developed. Converter-gating uses a combination of smaller stages and reconfiguration during <b>transient</b> <b>load</b> steps to improve the power efficiency and transient response speed. The stages of the converter are also distributed across the die to reduce the voltage drop and noise on power supply. Adaptive gain control improves transient response through manipulation of the gain of the integrator in the control loop.
