500|$|Heiner {{apologized for}} any role {{members of his}} {{campaign}} may have had in perpetuating the accusations against Comer, but the story touched off a feud between Heiner and Comer that some analysts predicted would benefit Bevin. Bevin declared that Heiner's alleged connection to <b>the</b> <b>Comer</b> accusations had [...] "disqualified [...] from being the GOP nominee for governor". During a debate featuring all four Republican candidates on Kentucky Sports Radio, Bevin said, [...] "I don't know if [...] behind <b>the</b> <b>Comer</b> story, but I'm telling you his people have been pushing {{this for a long}} time. And Hal himself has personally told me months and months ago before I even got in this race, that he knew things, not had heard things, that he knew things based on conversations that his people had had about Jamie Comer." [...] Bevin also released an ad depicting Comer and Heiner as children in a food fight, with the narrator promising that Bevin would bring [...] "grown up leadership" [...] to the governor's race.|$|E

50|$|A {{testament}} to Comer's emphasis on education {{as the supreme}} attribute of any society, one of his final actions was to direct the construction of <b>the</b> Catherine <b>Comer</b> School in Barbour County.

5000|$|The {{architecture}} of the residential sections is generally understated, as typically found in small rural communities. The Victorian influence is predominant with the classical and Craftsman influences represented. The oldest house in the district is at 205 Madison Street. With a mansard roof and dormer windows, {{it was built in}} c.1870 and still has an intact, single-pen, tenant house on the property.
