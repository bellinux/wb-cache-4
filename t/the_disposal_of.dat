5|$|<b>The</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> surplus {{military}} equipment {{took place at}} the same time as the size of the services was being reduced. The disposal process was managed to limit its economic impact. Most equipment was transferred to other government agencies, sold or destroyed by the end of 1949.|$|E

5|$|Around 1,400 {{men of the}} Belgian {{fishing fleet}} had left for Britain after the Belgian surrender. Three Belgian {{trawlers}} even {{took part in the}} evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk, rescuing 4,300 British soldiers between them. Their ships and crews were put at <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the Royal Navy, for coastal patrols and launching barrage balloons. From October 1940, many joined the RNSB.|$|E
5|$|Fisher formed {{his only}} {{minority}} {{government and the}} First Fisher Ministry. The government amended the Seat of Government Act providing for the new federal capital {{to be in the}} Yass-Canberra area, passed the Manufacturers' Encouragement Act to provide bounties for iron and steel manufacturers who paid fair and reasonable wages, ordered three torpedo boat destroyers, and assumed local naval defence responsibility and placed the Australian Navy at <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the Royal Navy in wartime.|$|E

5|$|Stretford Public Hall {{was built}} in 1878 by John Rylands. It was {{designed}} by N. Lofthouse {{and is on the}} western side of the A56 Chester Road, opposite the Longford Cinema. Stretford's first public lending library was established in the building in 1883. On the death of Rylands in 1888, his widow placed the building at <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the local authority for a nominal rent, and on her own death in 1908, the building was bought by Stretford Council for £5,000.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> {{military}} {{equipment and materials}} was also a key priority {{after the end of}} the war. Equipment with civilian uses such as motor vehicles, clothing and housing were urgently needed to counter shortages in the civilian economy. The timing of equipment release had to be carefully planned, however, to avoid harming employment by creating surpluses of manufactured goods. Planning for <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> equipment began in 1943 and the Commonwealth Disposals Commission was established to oversee the sale or destruction of equipment on September 1944. Before the commission was established the Government decided that ex-{{military equipment}} would be offered to other government agencies before being made available to the public, that sales to the public were to be made on a 'as is, where is' basis and be processed through existing trade channels or public auction at 'fair market prices' and that payment was to be required in cash. Some special priorities were also established; farmers were to be given priority for motor vehicles, machine tools were to be allocated to ex-servicemen and training colleges and special consideration was to be given to the needs of the Red Cross and other overseas and domestic charitable associations.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{committees}} differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison {{to those of the}} United States Congress, the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff. Considerable administration, archives and research resources are also at <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the whole Parliament when needed.|$|E
5|$|The post-millennium {{period has}} seen {{changes to the}} way the club is run as a {{business}}. When a new business management team was appointed {{at the start of the}} 2009–10 season, it inherited a business saddled with debt. The subsequent turnaround has resulted in operational profitability based on <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> non-core property assets, a new equity investment and a financial restructuring agreement with lenders for all debt to be repaid within five years. In 2016, the club reported that it was debt-free.|$|E
5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt}} to build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 {{as a result of an}} explosion in his lab. McCluskey died at the age of 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E

5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned villages that the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{with the}} area around Woking by this time heavily populated, rental income from the LNC's land {{holdings}} was an extremely valuable asset, and in May 1955 the Alliance Property Company launched a hostile takeover bid {{with the aim of}} using the cemetery's land for property development. The bid failed, but prompted the LNC to secure the passing of the London Necropolis Act 1956, allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land. A new company, the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company, was founded to oversee <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve, finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Fly ash {{and bottom}} ash are two {{byproducts}} made through {{the burning of}} coal in power stations. Ash is normally dumped in the station's Ash Lagoons landfill site, which is located on site. Since 2006, ash produced at Lynemouth Power Station has been recycled and used as a sub-fill material {{in the construction industry}} and in the production of grout. In 2007, 63,000 tonnes of ash from the station, along with 100,000 tonnes of ash from the Ash Lagoons, was taken and recycled. In September 2007, Pulverised Fuel Ash was utilised as a filling material in the capping of Woodhorn Landfill, which had been used for <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> spent potlining from the smelter.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland {{also has}} an {{economic}} system for garbage disposal, which is based mostly on recycling and energy-producing incinerators {{due to a lack}} of space for open pit garbage disposals. As in other European countries, <b>the</b> Illegal <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> garbage is not tolerated but usually the enforcement of such laws is limited to violations that involve <b>the</b> unlawful <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> garbage bags at traffic intersections and public areas. In some cities, stickers need to be purchased that allow for identification of disposable garbage.|$|R

5|$|In 1900, {{ownership}} of the gatehouse was transferred from Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort to Monmouthshire County Council as part of <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> {{the entirety of the}} Somersets' land holdings in Monmouthshire. The gift is recorded on a brass plaque attached to the gatehouse. The local antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley wrote the first history of the bridge and gatehouse, Monnow Bridge Tower, which appeared in 1903. In April 1893, the first street light had been erected on the bridge by the town council. In the late 1920s, the top portion of this light was replaced by twin electric lamps. In the 1960s, the lamps were removed completely, and since 1991 the bridge has been floodlit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sector}} of Longwy, Sedan and Namur, where the Ardennes and the River Meuse meet, the French Ninth Army and French Second Army were made up chiefly of poor quality divisions. Reinforcements were minimal, and those units were {{equipped}} with obsolete weapons. The resources at <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the two Series B divisions, the 55th and later 71s Infantry Divisions, {{who were to}} {{bear the brunt of}} the attack, were weak. They had almost no Regular officers and they had not been broken-in to war conditions by being in contact with the enemy.|$|E
5|$|It was {{possible}} {{to look into the}} back yard from the road...the corpses in British uniform were lying in the yard near the buildings. They were lying in such a position that one can assume they were killed by machine-gun bursts. It struck me at once that the dead soldiers were not wearing helmets, nor did they have any equipment on them...I took pictures of the dead bodies, and the whole farm. At Thum's request these were to be placed at <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> the division...I believe I was already sitting there in the vehicle when Thum...told me that in the field which he had returned the equipment...the shot British soldiers were lying in a heap, from which he had {{come to the conclusion that}} a summary trial had taken place.|$|E
40|$|In the Republic of Slovenia {{there are}} five larger sites {{polluted}} with heavy metals. The largest one is <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead and zinc mine {{in the northern part}} of the country, and the second one is the waste and tailings <b>disposal</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world second largest mercury mine. Both mines are now closed. The other three sites are smaller from those described above and they are: <b>the</b> tailings <b>disposal</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uranium mine, <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ironworks and <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aluminum processing plant. The article will present up-to-date data on the quantities of disposed wastes as well as measurements of some parameters connected with harmful effects on the environment and human health. Hazardous heavy metals from mines are monitored in the soil, flowing waters, groundwater and in the air. In some cases they are also monitored in some vegetables and human tissues and organs. The results of blood analysis for the content of heavy metals for mine workers and general population will be presented for two mining towns. On the largest sites, i. e. <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lead and zinc mine and <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mercury mine, some remediation activities are being in progress.
