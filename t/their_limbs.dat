These foxes display transitional features between northern red foxes and smaller fox species; their skulls possess more primitive, neotenous traits than the northern forms, {{and they are}} much smaller; the maximum sizes attained by southern foxes are invariably less than the average sizes of northern foxes. <b>Their</b> <b>limbs</b> are also longer, and their ears larger.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, spiders {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen, and joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel. Unlike insects, spiders do not have antennae. In all except the most primitive group, the Mesothelae, spiders have the most centralized nervous systems of all arthropods, as all their ganglia are fused into one mass in the cephalothorax. Unlike most arthropods, spiders have no extensor muscles in <b>their</b> <b>limbs</b> and instead extend them by hydraulic pressure.|$|E

50|$|Somatoparaphrenia {{differs from}} a similar disorder, asomatognosia, which is {{characterized}} as loss of recognition of half of the body or a limb, possibly due to paralysis or unilateral neglect. For example, asomatognosic patients may mistake their arm for the doctor's. However, they can be shown <b>their</b> <b>limb</b> and this error is temporarily corrected.|$|R
5|$|Most {{amphibians}} today remain semiaquatic, {{living the}} first stage of their lives as fish-like tadpoles. Several groups of tetrapods, such as the snakes and cetaceans, have lost some or all of <b>their</b> <b>limbs.</b> In addition, many tetrapods have returned to partially aquatic or fully aquatic lives throughout the history of the group (modern examples of fully aquatic tetrapods include cetaceans and sirenians). The first returns to an aquatic lifestyle may have occurred as early as the Carboniferous Period whereas other returns occurred as recently as the Cenozoic, as in cetaceans, pinnipeds, and several modern amphibians.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, spiders' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to very weak air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae. Pedipalps carry {{a large number of}} such setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air-borne smells, such as female pheromones. Spiders also have in the joints of <b>their</b> <b>limbs</b> slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E
5|$|When laying eggs, females grow {{a special}} type of bone between the hard outer bone and the marrow of <b>their</b> <b>limbs.</b> This {{medullary}} bone, which {{is rich in}} calcium, is used to make eggshells. A discovery of features in a Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton provided evidence of medullary bone in extinct dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a fossil dinosaur specimen. Further research has found medullary bone in the carnosaur Allosaurus and the ornithopod Tenontosaurus. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus diverged from the line that led to Tenontosaurus {{very early in the}} evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that the production of medullary tissue is a general characteristic of all dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|The Golden Arm is a folktale, a story {{appearing}} in multiple cultures through oral tradition and folklore, most famously told by Mark Twain and also used by him to instruct others {{in how to}} tell a story. The tale begins with a death or a recently deceased victim who has an artificial limb, usually an arm, made of gold. The victim has <b>their</b> <b>limb</b> stolen after <b>their</b> death, most often by a loved one or trusted one in greed. Then the victim comes back from the grave looking to get <b>their</b> golden <b>limb</b> back and scares the robber into giving back their arm.|$|R

5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or <b>their</b> <b>limbs</b> are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock {{with each other and}} have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E
5|$|Battletoads Arcade is a coin-operated, {{scrolling}} beat 'em up arcade video game. Up {{to three}} players, as the Battletoads (Rash, Pimple, and Zitz), punch and kick oncoming enemies through six levels {{to save their}} alternate universe from the Dark Queen. Arcade was the first Battletoads game to feature three-player cooperative multiplayer. Players control their characters with eight-directional joysticks and two buttons (attack and jump). Characters can run if the player pushes the joystick twice in the same direction. The Toads vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly, and Zitz is a balance of the two. As customary for the series, the Toads can knocked enemies offscreen such that they appear to fly towards the players, breaking the fourth wall. The Toads can also eat flies to regenerate health. Each Toad has its own signature exaggerated power and attack, in which <b>their</b> <b>limbs</b> turn into objects such as axes and drills. Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents, and snowmen.|$|E
5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it {{is a myth}} that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact that}} they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of <b>their</b> <b>limbs</b> protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

5|$|Reptiles are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or <b>their</b> <b>limbs</b> are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian {{but there is a}} septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Variations in the toolkit {{may have}} {{produced}} {{a large part of}} the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways. A toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's large ground-finch was enlarged by the BMP gene, or when snakes lost their legs as distal-less became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form <b>their</b> <b>limbs.</b> Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, distal-less, which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that small changes in toolbox genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. distal-less generates wing patterns in the butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene, which are Müllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex <b>their</b> <b>limbs,</b> spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight times their resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 times their own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E
50|$|Disuse atrophy {{of muscles}} and bones, with loss of mass and strength, can occur after {{prolonged}} immobility, such as extended bedrest, {{or having a}} body part in a cast (living in darkness for the eye, bedridden for the legs etc.).
