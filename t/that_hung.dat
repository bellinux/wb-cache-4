5|$|A famous story, {{possibly}} apocryphal, {{states that}} during the Battle of Princeton, when Alexander Hamilton, then the commander of an artillery battery, ordered his cannons to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall, one of the cannonballs was shot through {{the head of the}} portrait of King George II <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> in the chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> there were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box {{in the corner of}} the room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
5|$|Oasis {{evolved from}} an earlier band called the Rain, {{composed}} of Paul McGuigan (bass guitar), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Tony McCarroll (drums) and Chris Hutton (vocals). Unsatisfied with Hutton, Arthurs invited and auditioned acquaintance Liam Gallagher as a replacement. Liam suggested that the band name be changed to Oasis. This change was inspired by an Inspiral Carpets tour poster <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> in the Gallagher brothers' bedroom. One of the venues the poster listed was the Oasis Leisure Centre in Swindon.|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s, Hung Tung’s {{paintings}} were featured in exhibitions throughout the world, {{notably in the}} US, Germany, France and Belgium. Although these exhibitions may appear trivial, butwe can see <b>that</b> <b>Hung’s</b> art reflects the changes to Taiwan society.|$|R

5|$|Next, {{the finals}} of The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament were held between Christian Cage and Kaz in a ladder match that lasted 15 minutes and 13 seconds. In a ladder match, an object is hung above {{the ring and}} the first to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the object is the winner. During the match, Cage was legitimately busted open above his eye. Midway through the encounter, the contract fell off the clipboard <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> above the ring, which changed the objective to just grabbing the clipboard to win. Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off the ladder onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending the ladder to grab the clipboard, becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E
5|$|Sumptuary laws {{regulated}} {{the food}} that one consumed and the clothes that one wore according to status and social class. Clothing was made of hemp or cotton cloths, restricted to a colour standard of black and white. Trousers were the acceptable attire for peasants, soldiers, artisans, and merchants, although wealthy merchants might choose to wear more ornate clothing and male blouses that came down below the waist. Acceptable apparel for scholar-officials was rigidly defined by social ranking system. However, {{as time went on}} this rule of rank-graded apparel for officials was not as strictly enforced. Each official was able to display his awarded status by wearing different-coloured traditional silken robes <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> to the ground around his feet, specific types of headgear, and even specific styles of girdles that displayed his graded-rank of officialdom.|$|E
5|$|The event {{opened with}} a Shop of Horrors match between Abyss and Black Reign, which lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds. In a Shop of Horrors match, all weapons are legal to use, a wrestler can not be counted out, and {{it can only be}} won by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell {{interfered}} on Reign's behalf during the encounter. Abyss won the contest by pinfall after slamming Reign into the mat with his maneuver, the Black Hole Slam. After the encounter, Abyss grabbed a key <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> around Reign's neck and used it to open a locked building on the stage, which unknowingly was occupied by an unknown wrestler. Reign and the unknown wrestler then proceeded to lock Abyss in the building and push it off the stage.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{analysts have}} argued <b>that</b> <b>Hung's</b> career arose out of mockery, {{and that the}} media {{exploited}} him as a joke {{rather than as a}} talented or inspirational figure. Ron Lin, former {{editor in chief of the}} UC Berkeley's Daily Californian asserts: [...] "It's really difficult for Asian American males to break through and (Hung) may not be the most appealing example." ...|$|R

25|$|Three square gates {{existed on}} {{the eastern side of the}} Kremlin wall, which in the 17th century, were known as: Konstantino-Eleninsky, Spassky, Nikolsky (owing their names to the icons of Constantine and Helen, the Saviour and St. Nicholas <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> over them). The last two were {{directly}} opposite the Red Square, while the Konstantino-Elenensky gate was located behind Saint Basil's Cathedral.|$|E
25|$|Parnell's {{personal}} {{political views}} remained an enigma. An effective communicator, he was skilfully ambivalent and matched his words depending on circumstances and audience {{though he would}} always first defend constitutionalism on which basis he sought to bring about change, though hampered thereat by the crimes <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> around the Land League and by the opposition of landlords aggravated by attacks on their property.|$|E
25|$|In his youth, {{he played}} {{baseball}} with Sonny and David Rooslet (a neighborhood friend of Marciano's), worked out on homemade weightlifting equipment (later in his life, Marciano {{was also a}} client of Charles Atlas) and used a stuffed mailbag <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> from a tree in his back yard as a heavy bag. He attended Brockton High School, where he played both baseball and football. However, he was cut from the school baseball team because he had joined a church league, violating a school rule forbidding players from joining other teams. He {{dropped out of school}} after finishing tenth grade.|$|E

25|$|At {{the fall}} of the monarchy, Grand Duke Sergei was at Mogilev in the company of Nicholas II when he had to abdicate. During the first months of the {{provisional}} government, Grand Duke Sergei remained in Mogilev in voluntary exile on the advice of his brother Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich, because of the cloud of corruption <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> over him {{as a result of the}} Ksehesinskaya scandal. However, after twenty-two years of having a substitute of a family life with his mistress, he resisted pressure from his brother to break off all relations with Mathilde and her son.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 the Reds {{became one}} of eight ARL teams to join the rival Super League during the dispute known as the Super League war. They changed their name to the Perth City Reds for the 1997 Super League season, and adopted a jersey of red, white and black. Although the club had made some {{promising}} signings, such as Rodney Howe and Robbie Kearns, the crushing $10 million debt <b>that</b> <b>hung</b> over the club (from having to pay the airfares for all visiting teams) {{at the end of}} the season led to Super League axing the Perth Reds on 1 October 1997.|$|E
25|$|Not {{everything}} at Princes Gate was bequeathed to the Courtauld as the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna was bequeathed two paintings: a copy by Van Dyck of a Titian called 'Madonna and Child with St Dorothy' and {{a painting by}} Domenico Fetti called 'The Return of the Prodigal Son' and Seilern's nephews and nieces received substantial bequests of groups of art works in the collection, like the Dürer engravings, Greek vases, German and Austrian paintings not in the published catalogue (<b>that</b> <b>hung</b> principally on the bedroom floor at Princes Gate), and the pictures at the farm in Buckinghamshire.|$|E

25|$|Hung Lau faces {{southeast}} with Pui To Peak at its back, {{overlooking the}} sea off Tuen Mun and facing Lantau Island further across it. The {{area near the}} present Butterfly Estate was uninhabited in the late Qing Dynasty and was accessible by water transport only. Legends leave it <b>that</b> <b>Hung</b> Lau became a base for the revolutionaries of the Revive China Society. It was said that secret meetings convened by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and other revolutionaries for planning the Huang Hua-Gang Uprising and the Huizhou Uprising took place at Hung Lau. It was also where they took oath and got their ammunition and food supplies. Thus, Hung Lau has been of great significance to the Nationalist Revolution. A monument to Dr. Sun, a bust of him, a reproduction of his will and a gomuti palm tree planted by the revolutionary martyrs {{can also be found}} in Chung Shan Park.|$|E
25|$|Hung found renewed {{success in}} Hong Kong film {{industry}} in the 2000s, beginning with The Legend of Zu (2001), the long-awaited sequel to the 1983 hit Zu Warriors from the Magic Mountain. In 2004, Stephen Chow's Kung Fu Hustle was released. Though Yuen Woo-ping was credited for the martial arts choreography on Kung Fu Hustle, Hung actually did the preliminary work but left the film midway through, and Yuen filled in to complete it. Because of his departure from the film, there was tabloid speculation that he and Chow had strong differences over the film, resulting in their separation. Chow has since responded <b>that</b> <b>Hung</b> left for personal reasons and not because of speculated tensions. In 2004, Hung again worked with Jackie Chan, in a brief but notable appearance in Disney's Around the World in 80 Days as the legendary folk hero Wong Fei Hung, a character played by Chan in the Drunken Master series.|$|E
