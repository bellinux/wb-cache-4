5|$|A {{week after}} taking command, Moosally and his {{executive}} officer, Mike Fahey, canceled a planned $1million repair package for Iowas main gun batteries, including repairs {{to the main}} gun turrets' lighting, electrical, powder hoists, and hydraulic systems—75 detailed deficiencies in all. Instead, the funds were spent on overhauling the ship's powerplant. In August 1988, Iowa set sail on sea trials around the Chesapeake Bay area and then began refresher <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> waters around Florida and Puerto Rico in October.|$|E
5|$|After the ship's {{trials and}} initial <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chesapeake Bay, Wisconsin {{departed}} Norfolk, Virginia, on 7 July 1944, {{bound for the}} British West Indies.

5|$|An {{investigation}} found several shortcomings in the airline's operating procedures, in particular lack of proper cockpit communication and mutual {{control of the}} descent and approach plans. This was in part caused by the airline electing to not follow the Sterile Cockpit Rule and that a passenger {{was sitting in a}} cockpit jump seat during the flight. The investigating commission also found lack of proper pilot <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airline. Flight 710 was the second of four Widerøe accidents between 1982 and 1993, all of which revealed shortcomings in the airline's operations and internal control.|$|E

5|$|During {{the long}} period of peace between 1815 and 1846 midshipmen had few {{opportunities}} for promotion, and their warrants were often obtained via patronage. The poor quality of officer <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US Navy became visible after the Somers Affair, an alleged mutiny aboard the training ship USS Somers in 1842, and the subsequent execution of midshipman Philip Spencer. Spencer had gained his post aboard the Somers via the influence of his father, United States Secretary of War John C. Spencer.|$|E
5|$|Following {{experience}} {{with both the}} Tornado and the McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle, the RSAF discontinued low-level mission <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> F-15E {{in light of the}} Tornado's superior low-altitude flight performance. In addition, 10 of the Saudi Tornados were outfitted with equipment for performing reconnaissance missions. The 22 Tornado ADVs were replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon; the retired aircraft were being purchased back by the UK as of 2007.|$|E

In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.|$|E
5|$|HMS Orion was {{the lead}} ship of her class of four {{dreadnought}} battleships built for the Royal Navy in the early 1910s. She spent the bulk of her career assigned to the Home and Grand Fleets, generally serving as a flagship. Aside from participating in the failed attempt to intercept the German ships that had bombarded Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby in late 1914, the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive Action of 19 August, her service during World War I generally consisted of routine patrols and <b>training</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North Sea.|$|E
