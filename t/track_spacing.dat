50|$|The minimum <b>track</b> <b>spacing</b> can {{be derived}} from the loading gauge. The European Berne Gauge has a width of 3,150 mm. The minimal {{distance}} to structures {{on the side of the}} track is half of it but that is doubled again for double track lines. As the wagon can move within the rail gauge one adds 100 mm and with a possible displacement of tracks over time one adds some 250 mm as a security margin. This leads to a minim centre-to-center spacing of 3,500 mm. In fact, the first Prussian railways were built to that standard but it became soon apparent that it was too dangerous with some passengers having a hand or their head out of the window.|$|E

5000|$|Metrication of the United Kingdom's railway {{engineering}} standards was a [...] "soft metrication" [...] exercise since {{anything else}} would have required a gauge conversion. An 1846 Act of Parliament fixed the track gauge for Great Britain at 4 ft 8 in and for Ireland at 5 ft 3 in. The 4 ft 8 in gauge, now known as standard gauge, was the basis of 60% of the world's railways and is now expressed as 1,435 mm - a decrease of 0.1 mm, which, with a slightly tighter engineering tolerance, keeps <b>track</b> <b>spacing</b> within the original tolerance band. The Irish gauge is now expressed as 1,600 mm gauge giving {{a difference between the}} imperial and metric values of exactly 0.2 mm and thus also well within engineering tolerances.|$|E
5000|$|Now {{consider}} an improvement {{to the design}} that doubles {{the density of the}} bits by reducing sample length and keeping the same <b>track</b> <b>spacing.</b> This would immediately result in a doubling of transfer speed because the bits would be passing under the head twice as fast. Early floppy disk interfaces were originally designed with 250 kbit/s transfer speeds in mind, and were already being outperformed with the introduction of the [...] "high density" [...] 1.44 MB (1,440 KiB) floppies in the 1980s. The vast majority of PCs included interfaces designed for high density drives that ran at 500 kbit/s instead. These too were completely overwhelmed by newer devices like the LS-120, which were forced to use higher-speed interfaces such as IDE.|$|E
50|$|The LIDAR system {{consisted}} of a 180 mJ, 1064 nm wavelength Nd-YAG (Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet) laser transmitter which transmitted pulses to the lunar surface. The laser produced a pulse with a width less than 10 ns. At 1064 nm wavelength, the pulse had an energy of 171 mJ with a divergence less than 500 microrad. At 532 nm, it had a 9 mJ pulse with a 4 millirad divergence. The reflected pulse travelled through the High-Resolution Camera telescope, where it was split off by a dichroic filter to a silicon avalanche photodiode detector. The detector was a single 0.5 &times; 0.5 mm cell SiAPD receiver with a field of view of 0.057 square degrees. The laser had a mass of 1250 g, the receiver was housed in the 1120 g HIRES camera. The travel time of a pulse gave the range to the surface. The LIDAR memory could save up to six return detections per laser firing, with a threshold set for the best compromise between missed detections and false alarms. The returns were stored in 39.972 m range bins, equal to {{the resolution of the}} 14-bit clock counter. The LIDAR has a nominal range of 500 km, but altimetric data was gathered for altitudes up to 640 km, which allowed coverage from 60 degrees south to 60 degrees north {{by the end of the}} lunar phase of the mission. The vertical resolution is 40 m, and the horizontal spot resolution is about 100 m. The across <b>track</b> <b>spacing</b> of the measurements at the equator was about 40 km. One measurement was made each second over a 45-minute period during each orbit, giving an along <b>track</b> <b>spacing</b> of 1 - 2 km.|$|E

Virtual Reality (VR) is {{an imitation of}} the real world. VR provides people an opportunity to experience surroundings that simulate real experiences, train people for situations or pro- vide interaction with situations that do not exist. VR allows users to learn about a particular environment which {{would not be possible}} due to reasons such as time, distances, expense and safety. Virtual environments (VE) are usually presented through Head Mounted Dis- plays (HMD). There are different locomotive techniques to explore virtual environments. The most common and immersive one is natural walking with a HMD in a room-size or larger <b>tracking</b> <b>space.</b> However, the size of the VE system that can be explored by walking is limited by the size of <b>tracking</b> <b>space</b> area. Redirected Walking is a promising, low-cost algorithm for enabling large virtual explo- ration via natural locomotion in smaller <b>tracked</b> <b>spaces.</b> This thesis utilizes a Redirected Walking algorithm that is used to steer user’s exploration in an infinite virtual scene while augmenting the algorithm to avoid potential physical obstacles that may exist in the <b>tracked</b> <b>space</b> itself. Adding obstacle avoidance to the Redirected Walking algorithm makes the <b>tracking</b> <b>space</b> more robust because there can be restrictions such as physical tables, doors or other obstacles that could hinder the user’s movements in VR. Moreover,this addition has potential use with passive haptics in Redirected Walking situations. The Magic Barrier Tape Technique is another alternative for exploring a large virtual environments on foot when the size of the physical surroundings is small by taking advantage of people’s natural ability to spatially update. Magic Barrier Tape is an interactive locomotion technique that helps the user to navigate in an infinite virtual space while restricted to a limited <b>tracking</b> <b>space</b> area. In the Magic Barrier Tape algorithm the user's pointing direction acts like a joystick to control their movement when near the <b>tracking</b> <b>space</b> boundaries. Magic Barrier Tape has the potential to become an effective resetting technique for the Redirected Walking algorithm because it may be more natural and there is a continuous visual flow for the users in the system. This thesis implements Redirected Walking while also dealing with potential collisions between users and physical objects in the laboratory...|$|R

An example of these more widely spaced tracks was Line 331 to Stammersdorf. The Amerikaner were comparatively modern, because they were equipped with air-operated doors and automatic retractable ramps. Additionally, the seat backs could be adjusted, so that all seated passengers could always face towards the direction of travel. Some of the major modifications required for the Amerikaner to be able to run in Vienna were carried out by Gräf & Stift in Wien-Liesing.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe current surface mine countermeasures (MCM) fleet is aging, {{yet there are}} no viable systems to replace it. The U. S. Navy requires an improved minehunting platform, and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) can meet that need. In order to attain enough UUVs and operators to make these missions successful, the United States must rely on the participation of allies to provide these assets. This study assesses the key decision factors in mine clearance operations using UUVs of differing capabilities. It uses a discrete-event simulation to model the performance of UUVs in a large-scale MCM operation. Data is generated using a state-of-the- art design of experiments and analyzed {{to find the best}} tasking plan for the scenario. The results show that with proper tasking, UUVs with lesser ability levels can be used appropriately and still produce acceptable levels of mine clearance, usually more quickly than a smaller cadre of highly capable vehicles. This study finds UUV altitude, <b>track</b> <b>spacing,</b> number of passes, and search speed to be decision factors that influence minehunting results, while <b>track</b> <b>spacing,</b> number of passes, search speed, and resupply are influential factors that effect mission completion times.
