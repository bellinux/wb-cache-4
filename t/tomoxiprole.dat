40|$|Objective(s) : In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} the potential anti-nociceptive activity and acute anti-inflammatory {{effect of a}} synthetic quinoline compound (2 -(4 -Methoxyphenyl) benzo[h]quinoline- 4 -carboxylic acid, QC), possessing structural elements of both naproxen and <b>tomoxiprole</b> drugs. Materials and Methods: The anti-nociceptive activity of QC was evaluated using chemical- and thermal-induced nociception models and its acute anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated by xylene-induced ear edema test in mice. Results: QC displayed a dose dependent effect in both acute anti-nociceptive tests (writhing and hot plate). This compound at dose of 6. 562 mg/kg showed a high anti-nociceptive effect near equal toÂ  diclofenac 5 mg/kg. It also showed high anti-inflammatory effects (less than 6. 562 mg/kg) {{comparable to those of}} reference drugs diclofenac (5 mg/kg) and celecoxib (100 mg/kg). Docking study showed that this quinoline derivative could inhibit COX- 2 enzyme strongly. Conclusion: QC showed high anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects comparable to reference drugs and can exert its anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities through COX- 2 inhibition...|$|E
