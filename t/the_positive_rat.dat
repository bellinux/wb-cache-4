The efficiency of Bio-tea pretreatment was compared against black tea pretreatment and <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> control (<b>rats</b> with isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction) and negative control (normal control rats). For this purpose, biochemical analysis of the in vivo antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and reduced glutathione), glycoprotein components (hexose, hexosamine, sialic acid, and fucose), lipids (total, ester and free cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and phospholipids), and transmembrane protein activities (Na+/K+ ATPase, Ca 2 + ATPase, and Mg 2 + ATPase) was carried out along with the histological and ultrastructural study of the myocardial tissue. Induction of myocardial infarction using isoproterenol resulted in a significant decrease in tissue antioxidants and an increase in the levels of total, ester and free cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and glycoprotein components in plasma and heart. The phospholipid content showed an increase in plasma and a simultaneous decrease in the heart tissue, while the Na+/K+ ATPase activity decreased and Ca 2 + ATPase and Mg 2 + ATPase activities increased, resulting in destabilization of the membranes.

Careful examination of recruited T cells and macrophages, both of which are thought to play important roles in the development of ulcerative colitis, indicated that rat IgG, but not its human counterpart, decreased the number of immunocompetent cells in colonic mucosa. Meanwhile, in an in vitro study, both forms of IgG were shown to suppress production of TNF-α and IL- 1 α from lamina propria mononuclear cells isolated from rat colon.

40|$|In rats, {{complete}} Freund's adjuvant (CFA), injected at {{the base}} of the tail, induced a hyperactivation of cellular immune functions and triggered the development of adjuvant arthritis (AA). Before onset of arthritis (Days 9 - 10 upon CFA), <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> control <b>rats</b> showed significant increases of pituitary prolactin (Prl) mRNA accumulation (Days 3 - 5). On the other hand, production of pituitary growth hormone (GH) mRNA was significantly reduced from Day 3 onwards. During this early latent period, plasma Prl levels were transiently increased (at least on Day 4), while GH levels were reduced within 8 days (and onwards). Pituitary proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA content progressively decreased with a nadir between Days 6 and 8, accompanied by a loss of the adrenocortical ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) circadian rhythm of activity and a transient reduction of plasma corticosterone (CS) levels (Days 3 - 6, obvious during the dark phase). At onset of arthritis, the POMC mRNA accumulation and adrenocortical ODC activity increased over their respective baselines. Elevation of plasma CS levels (obvious during the light phase) and important CS-induced thymolysis occurred. Further, hypophysectomized rats did not develop AA. However, hypophysectomized male rats carrying pituitary grafts under the kidney capsule had mild hyperprolactinaemia and developed a worsened arthritic response to CFA, compared to sham-operated controls. On the other hand, intact hyperprolactinaemic male rats showed a delay in the onset and a reduction in the severity of AA. This difference might be due to stimulation of the adrenal cortex in intact pituitary-grafted rats. Such rats showed increased baselines of pituitary POMC mRNA production, adrenocortical ODC activity and plasma CS levels. In addition, during the latent period after CFA, POMC mRNA accumulation, adrenocortical ODC activity and plasma CS levels were only partially suppressed, less than in sham-operated rats. Extensive thymolysis occurred after CFA in these animals [...] as in the sham-operated rats [...] but not in the hypophysectomized pituitary-implanted rats. This suggested that in the presence of adrenocortical deficiency, Prl released by the pituitary graft can freely act on the immune system, without being counter-regulated by CS...|$|R

The dimension of <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> realization of a discrete phase-type realization may be larger than its McMillan degree of probability generating functions. <b>The</b> <b>positive</b> realization with sufficient large dimension bound can be obtained easily but generally, <b>the</b> minimal <b>positive</b> realization problem is not solved yet. We propose an efficient dimension reduction algorithm to make <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> realization with tighter upper bound from a given probability generating functions in terms of convex cone problem and linear programming. 1...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{probable}} relationship between the accumulation of oxLDL and hepatic fibrogenesis in cholestatic rats. INTRODUCTION: There is growing evidence to support the current theories on how oxidative stress that results in lipid peroxidation is involved in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury and fibrogenesis. One of the major and early lipid peroxidation products, OxLDL, is thought to play complex roles in various immuno-inflammatory mechanisms. METHODS: A prolonged (21 -day) experimental bile duct ligation was performed on Wistar-albino rats. Biochemical analysis of blood, histopathologic evaluation of liver, measurement of the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide-dismutase (SOD) in liver tissue homogenates, and immunofluorescent staining for oxLDL in liver tissue was conducted in bile-duct ligated (n = 8) and sham-operated rats (n = 8). RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of MDA and lower concentrations of SOD were detected in jaundiced rats than in <b>the</b> sham-operated <b>rats.</b> <b>Positive</b> oxLDL staining was also observed in liver tissue sections of jaundiced rats. Histopathological examination demonstrated that neither fibrosis nor other indications of hepatocellular injury were found in the sham-operated group, while features of severe hepatocellular injury, particularly fibrosis, were found in jaundiced rats. CONCLUSION: Our results support the finding that either oxLDLs are produced as an intermediate agent during exacerbated oxidative stress or they otherwise contribute to the various pathomechanisms underlying the process of liver fibrosis. Whatever the mechanism, it is clear that an association exists between elevated oxLDL levels and hepatocellular injury, particularly with fibrosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the potential effects of oxLDLs on the progression of secondary biliary cirrhosis...|$|R

40|$|This {{narrative}} review considers <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> side of <b>the</b> work-family interface. It surveyed a {{range of}} relevant literature (1960 – 2012) using search terms on <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> work-family interface. From the literature {{it is evident that}} various concepts (e. g., work-family enhancement, work-family positive spillover, work-family facilitation and work-family enrichment) are used to conceptualise <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> side of <b>the</b> work-family interface. Further research is needed to explore <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> side of <b>the</b> work-family interface. Findings showed that only a few studies on <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> work-family interface phenomenon have been reported from the South African population, but there is still a huge gap in the South African literature regarding <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> work-family interface.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the results of {{immunological}} tests (tests with recombinant allergen TB in standard dilution (RAT) and the Mantoux tuberculin test) in children at risk of developing tuberculosis in Tomsk Region. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of 1204 outpatient medical records of children and adolescents at the age from 1 to 16 was performed. Results. When two tests are carried out at the same time (skin test with RAT (Diaskin-test) and Mantoux tuberculin test), <b>the</b> proportion of <b>positive</b> reactions to tuberculin was 92, 4 %, including 6, 6 % of hyperergic reactions, while there were 6, 0 % of <b>positive</b> reactions to <b>RAT,</b> including 3, 2 % of hyperergic reactions. The biggest number of <b>positive</b> reactions to <b>RAT</b> was recorded among children with severe and hyperergic tuberculin sensitivity (28, 7 %) and children from tuberculosis prevalence areas (17, 5 %). The lowest number of <b>positive</b> reactions to <b>RAT</b> was recorded among children with conversion of tubercular tests and children with latent TB infection (LTBI) – 2, 8 % and 1, 5 % respectively. Conclusions. The results of skin tests with RAT as compared to the tests with tuberculin are different. When there is a conversion of tubercular test <b>the</b> <b>positive</b> reaction to Diaskintest was detected only in a few cases (2, 8 % of cases) as compared to prevailing (in 96, 4 % of cases) positive reaction to tuberculin; in children with severe and hyperergic results the tuberculin reaction to RAT was the same in every third child (28, 7 %); in children with increasing sensitivity to tuberculin the immunological response during Diaskintest was detected in 4, 7 % of cases. More often local forms of tuberculosis were detected among children with hyperergic reactions to skin tests with RAT (12 of 38 children, 31, 6 %), χ 2 = 306, 3; p < 0, 001, and when there is an overlap of hyperergic results of two immunological tests (6 of 15 children, 40, 0 %) χ 2 = 303, 5; p < 0, 001 </p...|$|R
