5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>flawed</b> material or <b>to</b> produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of residual stresses in a structure influences his behaviour. Fatigue strength of welded joints is significantly {{influenced by the}} {{presence of}} residual stresses, of flaws and notch sharpness at the weld toe. Plasma dressing at the weld toe is frequently used <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>flaws</b> and to lessen the notch sharpness at the weld toe.

This paper presents a 2 D finite element model to predict the residual stresses generated by Plasma dressing at the weld toe of a T-joint.

40|$|Aluminum-Lithium is {{a modern}} {{material}} that NASA MSFC is evaluating as an option for the aluminum alloys and other aerospace metals presently in use. The importance of aluminum-lithium is in it's superior weight to strength characteristics. However, aluminum-lithium has produced many challenges in regards to manufacturing and maintenance. The solution to these problems are vital to the future uses of the shuttle for delivering larger payloads into earth orbit and are equally important to future commercial applications of aluminum-lithium. The Metals Processes Branch at MSFC is conducting extensive tests on aluminum-lithium which includes the collection of large amounts of data. This report discusses the automation and data acquisition for two processes: the initial weld and the repair. The new approach reduces {{the time required to}} collect the data, increases the accuracy of the data, and eliminates several types of human errors during data collection and entry. The same material properties that enhance the weight to strength characteristics of aluminum-lithium contribute to the problems with cracks occurring during welding, especially during the repair/rework process. The repairs are required <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>flaws</b> or defects discovered in the initial weld, either discovered by x-ray, visual inspection, or some other type of nondestructive evaluation. It has been observed that cracks typically appear as a result of or beyond the second repair. MSFC scientists have determined that residual mechanical stress introduced by the welding process is a primary cause of the cracking. Two obvious solutions are to either prevent or minimize the stress introduced during the welding process, or remove or reduce the stress after the welding process and MSFC is investigating both of these...|$|E

40|$|The Silk Route {{has become}} synonymous with the {{movement}} of knowledge that accompanies the trade of objects. Many of the textiles discussed here were not traded along the Silk Route, but all {{are representative of the}} associations that are made with this artery of cultural exchange. The examples cited arrive from a range of cultures and geographies: Indonesia and Nigeria, the Southwest United States and New Zealand. From these vastly different regions, using a variety of materials, weavers painstakingly unpicked yams from woven fabrics for use in other weavings. The term 2 ̆ 7 raveled yam 2 ̆ 7 refers to threads that have been unpicked from a piece of woven cloth and rewoven into another. This paper attempts to determine the reasons behind what seems in the twenty-first century to be such a laborious undertaking. Unpicking fabric <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>flaws,</b> examine the structures involved or possibly recycle precious threads is common. But rarely does the contemporary designer work with materials of such inherent value that time is not considered more valuable. Historically, the reasons for unpicking yarn have been both aesthetic and economic. Penelope 2 ̆ 7 s ruse to stall time by unpicking her daily weaving each night {{may be one of the}} earliest examples. Certain cities developed reputations for deconstructing fabrics for thread such as the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra along the Silk Road which was devoted to the unpicking and reweaving of silk to local fashions. 2 ̆ 2 On a more intimate level the instinct to recover threads from woven materials appears in an example from the other side of the world where slave women and girls in the southern United States are thought to have unwound threads from their owner 2 ̆ 7 s discarded stockings and fabric remnants so that they could use the thread to stylishly wrap around their own hair. As early as 1730 a Danish envoy in Africa wrote, 2 ̆ 2 Opoku bought silk taffeta and materials of all colours. The artists unravelled them so that they obtained large quantities of woolen and silk threads which they mixed with their cotton and got many colours. 2 ̆ 2 In 1817 a British envoy wrote of chiefs 2 ̆ 2 in a general blaze of splendor 2 ̆ 2 who 2 ̆ 2 wore Ashantee cloths, of extravagant price from the costly foreign silks which has been unravelled to weave them in all the varieties of colour, as well as pattern. 2 ̆ 2 In Documents on the Portuguese in Mozambique and Central Africa it is written: Now, the Moors once more make in this land quantities of cotton, much of which is gathered here; they spin it and weave it into white cloth and, since they do not know how to dye, or because they do not have dyes, they take blue painted cloths from Cambay, unravel them and gather the thread into a ball and. with their white weave and with the other they make them painted, from which they obtain a great sum of gold. Finally, the use of raveled yarns is preserved in an Akwete myth from south eastern Nigeria that recounts their use by the group 2 ̆ 7 s legendary weaver who was alleged to have designed new textile patterns in her dreams. A version of the legend states: She brought threads from Europeans and loosened them to use in her cloth. Some of the threads were silk. Dada Nwakwata originated weaving with imported yarn and producing designs. She worked in secret to avoid others from copying. In many cases value is determined by rarity of fiber or colour. But in other cases a very literal value is at stake, such as the real gold thread brocade (songket) of the Palembang in Sumatra. Due to the economic value of the gold thread it is recycled over and over again. When thread bare weavings are sold by weight, taken apart and incorporated into new pieces. The result of this continuous system of recycling is a dearth of old songkets, for the valuable thread is always being removed and used again...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{provides}} {{a new understanding}} of light propagation and light-matter interactions by examining the physical implications of group velocity and energy conservation equation. The classical definition of group velocity has two flaws: (a) the group velocity can be greater than the phase velocity and break Fermat's principle in a non-dispersive, lossless, non-conducting, anisotropic uniform medium; (b) the definition is not consistent with the principle of relativity for a plane wave in a moving isotropic uniform medium. <b>To</b> <b>remove</b> the <b>flaws,</b> a modified definition is proposed. A criterion is set up to identify the justification of group velocity definition. A "superluminal power flow" is constructed to show that the electromagnetic energy conservation equation (Poynting theorem) cannot uniquely define the power flow if the principle of Fermat is not taken into account. It is indicated that the group velocity is not a strict observable quantity in general cases because the physical implication of the definition itself is ambiguous. As an application, associated basic concepts in textbooks and experimental observations reported in recent research works are also reviewed, including: why the traditional formulation of Fermat's principle has a limited application; how the Fermat's principle is formulated for a plane wave; why the Fermat's principle is consistent with Maxwell electromagnetic theory; what the significant difference is between energy conservation equation and energy conservation law; why the physical explanations for "spatially structured" photons in Giovannini-coworkers experiments are not consistent with the principle of relativity; why the traditionally-argued invariance of information velocity contradicts Maxwell equations; and why the superluminal light pulse propagation claimed in Wang-Kuzmich-Dogariu experiments voilates Einstein causality.

Research in Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) {{in recent decades}} investigates how distributed, collaborative scientific projects take place across different geographical and temporal scales through the enactment of research infrastructures. This dissertation expands upon existing CSCW research with a qualitative, episodic study {{of a group of}} cosmologists who are themselves enacting and working among multiple research infrastructures by producing data analysis software as part of a multinational radio telescope project. I describe this cosmology group’s software production practices to explain how software is a material for expressing their scientific method. Software operationalizes and encapsulates their cosmology theory, a model of the telescope, observation data, and ongoing analysis decisions. I demonstrate how by using plots (visualizations of observation data, their software, and the physical telescope) they engage in rigorous and thoughtful testing and analysis of infrastructural components in their work. Doing this data-intensive scientific work requires that they collectively develop a deep understanding of multiple infrastructures <b>to</b> isolate and <b>remove</b> <b>flaws</b> in their data and do a high-precision scientific analysis, interrogating the many embedded relations among conventions of practice that make up their work. My dissertation offers a novel perspective on the production, use, and work of software in science that emphasizes that software in scientific research is not some static product to simply be sustained but a perpetually mutable expression of method to be iterated upon and improved through unfolding research work...|$|R
40|$|The use of Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} methods of pressure measurement. Effective both on simple and complex surfaces, PSP can produce global surface pressure maps with exceptional spatial resolution. However, there are practical issues that hinder its accuracy. Surface preparation and paint application is tedious, expensive, and time consuming. Sensitivity to temperature is also an issue as it affects luminescent molecules and their transitions. Research has focused on developing self-adhesive tape or decals, pre-coated with PSP material. One advantage to this approach is quick and easy application to areas of interest during experimentation. This would not only minimize cost and surface preparation time, but simultaneously unveil a solution to the issue of PSP degradation. Should the PSP degrade from use or handling, one would need only <b>to</b> quickly <b>remove</b> the <b>flawed</b> strip and apply fresh PSP coated tape. Due to the more controlled conditions under which the tapes would be prepared, it would also be possible to apply dual coatings. For example: running a stripe of PSP along with a parallel stripe of Temperature Sensitive Paint would grant the ability to determine relative temperature and pressure measurements on a given surface. It would also allow for pressure measurement adjustments accordingly...|$|R

40|$|Plasticity {{corrections}} to elastically computed {{stress intensity}} factors are often included in brittle fracture evaluation procedures. These corrections {{are based on}} the existence of a plastic zone {{in the vicinity of the}} crack tip. Such a plastic zone correction is included in the flaw evaluation procedure of Appendix A to Section XI of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. Plasticity effects from the results of elastic and elastic-plastic explicit flaw finite element analyses are examined for various size cracks emanating from the root of a notch in a panel and for cracks located at fillet fadii. The results of these caluclations provide conditions under which the crack-tip plastic zone correction based on the Irwin plastic zone size overestimates the plasticity effect for crack-like flaws embedded in stress concentration regions in which the elastically computed stress exceeds the yield strength of the material. A failure assessment diagram (FAD) curve is employed to graphically c haracterize the effect of plasticity on the crack driving force. The Option 1 FAD curve of the Level 3 advanced fracture assessment procedure of British Standard PD 6493 : 1991, adjusted for stress concentration effects by a term that is a function of the applied load and the ratio of the local radius of curvature at the flaw location to the flaw depth, provides a satisfactory bound to all the FAD curves derived from the explicit flaw finite element calculations. The adjusted FAD curve is a less restrictive plasticity correction than the plastic zone correction of Section XI for flaws embedded in plastic zones at geometric stress concentrators.
