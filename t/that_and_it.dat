500|$|According to guitarist Marty Friedman, it {{took the}} band a year to prepare the record [...] "from note one to mixing". A lot of the {{material}} was written during the tour {{and some of it}} afterwards. As Friedman said, the songs came together naturally because the band wasn't rushed to get a record out. The album was produced by Dann Huff, who had his producing debut with Megadeth. The band chose to work with Huff because they were not satisfied with Max Norman, the producer of their previous record. Mustaine explained why he decided to quit the collaboration with Norman: [...] "Max came up with this bullshit formula that every song had to be 120 beats per minute to get on the radio. When people make drastic decisions to do things like <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> backfires, it usually ends up, in one way or another, costing them their jobs." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2003, McCartney persuaded Starr and Ono (as Lennon's widow) {{to release}} Let It Be... Naked, {{touted as the}} band's version of Let It Be remixed by {{independent}} producers.

The new album included a later take of [...] "The Long and Winding Road", recorded on 31 January. [...] With no strings or other added instrumentation beyond that which was played in the studio at the time, it was closer to the Beatles's original intention than the 1970 version. This take is also the one seen in the film Let It Be and on the Beatles' 2015 video compilation 1. Starr said of the Let It Be... Naked version: [...] "There's nothing wrong with Phil's strings , this is just a different attitude to listening. But it's been 30-odd years since I've heard it without all <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> just blew me away." ...|$|E

Horowitz explained, [...] "Emma is in a raw emotional place, trying {{to come to terms with}} her feelings about what she discovered about Graham. Graham is also in a very raw emotional place because he's clearly conflicted and it's this cauldron of emotions that leads to the kiss."

The 29 shows in North America had grossed around US $26 million, with an average of almost $900,000 per show. Fogel also addressed concerns that Live Nation had lost $30 million from Gaga's tour, saying that if a similar situation really happened, then the company would have cancelled the concerts.

500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{wrote that}} Valkyrie [...] "has visual splendor galore, {{but is a}} cold work lacking in the {{requisite}} tension and suspense". McCarthy considered Cruise as [...] "a bit stiff but still adequate" [...] as von Stauffenberg. The critic believed that McQuarrie's script was well-carpentered but felt that compressing and streamlining the events to make a known failed plot more thrilling lacked a [...] "sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters". McCarthy missed [...] "many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men" [...] that were not detailed. He thought that the production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb stood out, that Newton Thomas Sigel's cinematography had a [...] "restrained elegance", and that John Ottman performed well in his dual role as editor and composer. A similar sentiment was stated by Mike LaSalle in the San Francisco Chronicle, who wrote [...] "There's nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand, strutting around in a German colonel's uniform. But neither is there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg, leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup d'etat. Think of Valkyrie as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> becomes possible to enjoy the movie.|$|E
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>it</b> felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E
