5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|The claw {{of a bird}} of prey; {{its primary}} hunting tool. The talons are very important; without them, most birds of prey {{would not be able}} to catch their food. Some birds also use claws for {{defensive}} purposes. Cassowaries use claws on their inner toe (digit II) for defence, and have been known to disembowel people. All birds however have claws, which are used as general holdfasts and protection for the tip of the digits. The hoatzin and turaco are unique among extant birds in having functional claws on the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> (digit I and II) on the forelimbs as chicks, allowing them to climb trees until the adult plumage with flight feathers develop. However, several birds have a claw- or nail-like structure hidden under the feathers at the end of the hand digits, notably ostriches, emus, ducks, geese and kiwis.|$|E
25|$|The pad-to-pad pinch {{between the}} <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> is made {{possible}} because of the human ability to passively hyperextend the distal phalanx of the index finger. Most non-human primates have to flex their long fingers {{in order for the}} small thumb to reach them.|$|E
50|$|The {{technique}} used {{to tie the}} hair into a Kudumi is as follows: The lengthy hair can be tied {{with the help of}} left <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers.</b> You roll up the lock of hair over the left <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> put together by your right hand till you reach the tail end. Then hold the tail end of hair by the left <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> pull out the fingers with {{the tail end of the}} hair. You get the knot. After some little practice you will get a tight and neat knot.|$|R

25|$|The typical {{method of}} {{muffling}} {{is to place}} the pads of the fingers against the head while holding onto the timpani stick with the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> Timpanists are required to develop techniques to stop all vibration without making any sound from the contact of their fingers.|$|E
25|$|The {{thumb is}} not opposable in all primates— some primates, {{such as the}} spider monkey and colobus, are {{virtually}} thumbless. The spider monkey compensates for this by using the hairless part of its long, prehensile tail for grabbing objects. In apes and Old World monkeys, the thumbs can be rotated around its axis, but the extensive area of contact between the pulps of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> is a human characteristic.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} four-mallet grip for vibraphone is the Burton grip, named for Gary Burton. One mallet is held between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> {{and the other}} is held between the index and middle fingers. The shafts cross {{in the middle of the}} palm and extend past the heel of the hand. For wide intervals, the thumb often moves in between the two mallets and the inside mallet is held in the crook of the fingers.|$|E
50|$|Use <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> of {{both hands}} to massage the center of earlobe, with the other three fingers curved naturally. Meanwhile, do the catch-earth {{movement}} using all toes of both feet to the beats of music.|$|R
50|$|Another popular grip {{is similar}} to the timpani grip. The mallets are again held between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>and</b> {{controlled}} with the remaining three fingers, but the palms are held vertically, facing inward towards each other. Most of the stroke action comes from the finger-tip control of the shafts.|$|R
40|$|A Variant of acrokerato elastoidosis {{characterized}} by linear, scaly, hyperkeratotic, fissured and transluscent papules on sides of <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers,</b> {{was seen in}} 55 male patients, above the age, of fifty years. Actinic damage and repeated trauma were not evident. The term acrokerato - elastodosis linearis manus is suggested for this variant...|$|R
25|$|A soft contact lens may {{be removed}} by {{pinching}} the edge between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> Moving the lens off the cornea first can improve comfort during removal and reduce risk of scratching the cornea with a fingernail. It {{is also possible}} to push or pull a soft lens far enough to the side or bottom of the eyeball {{to get it to}} fold then fall out, without pinching and thereby damaging it. If these techniques are used with a rigid lens, it may scratch the cornea.|$|E
25|$|Interval {{changes are}} {{accomplished}} {{by moving the}} inside and outside mallets independently of one another, as described in Stevens' book, Method of Movement for Marimba. As the interval widens, the inside mallet rolls between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger,</b> such that the index finger moves from underneath {{to the side of}} the shaft, and the middle finger becomes the fulcrum of the cantilever. The outside mallet is moved principally with the little and ring fingers, although the first section of the middle finger follows along and remains in light contact. When properly used, this grip causes no tension on the hand muscles.|$|E
25|$|Following {{his release}} in 1936 after serving two years, Nikolai took {{his family to}} live in Berezniki in Perm Krai, where his brother Ivan, a blacksmith, had been exiled the year before for failing to deliver his grain quota. Nikolai {{remained}} unemployed {{for a period of}} time and then worked again in construction. His mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Yeltsina, worked as a seamstress. Boris studied at Pushkin High School in Berezniki. He was fond of sports (in particular skiing, gymnastics, volleyball, track and field, boxing and wrestling) despite losing the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of his left hand when he and some friends furtively entered a Red Army supply depot, stole several grenades, and tried to disassemble them.|$|E
50|$|In Murghasana, the Yogi has to bend down, Pass arms between {{legs and}} hold her ear lobes with <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers,</b> in easy words, holding ears lobes while in uttanasana. This asana {{is very good}} for blood {{circulation}} on brain and face. It removes untimely wrinkles, sharps memory and brings glow to your face.|$|R
50|$|Its origin {{stems from}} the {{traditional}} way of holding a Japanese sword. The bottom three fingers of each hand are used to grip the sword tightly, with the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> slightly loose. The removal of digits starting with the little finger moving up the hand to the <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> progressively weakens a person's sword grip.|$|R
5000|$|The Laban sign is a Filipino hand gesture made by {{extending}} the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> pointing up, leaving the other fingers closed {{to create the}} letter L, which stands for laban (Filipino for [...] "fight"). It is sometimes mistaken for the mildly offensive Western [...] "loser" [...] and [...] "raised gun" [...] gestures, {{to which it is}} unrelated.|$|R
500|$|Type 1 is [...] "partial or {{total removal}} of the {{clitoris}} and/or the prepuce". Type Ia (circumcision) involves {{removal of the}} clitoral hood only. This is rarely performed alone. The more common procedure is Type Ib (clitoridectomy), the complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood. The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with her <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> and cuts it off.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E
2500|$|Two-mallet players use several {{different}} grips, {{with the most}} common being a palms-down grip that is basically {{the same as the}} matched grip used by drummers. [...] The mallets are held between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of each hand, with the remaining three fingers of each hand pressing the shafts into the down-facing palms. [...] Strokes use a combination of wrist movement and fingertip control of the shaft.|$|E
5000|$|The loser is a hand gesture made by {{extending}} the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers,</b> leaving the other fingers closed {{to create the}} letter L, interpreted as [...] "loser", and generally given as a demeaning sign. Sometimes this is accompanied by raising the hand to the giver's forehead, and sometimes it is done when resting the head in one's own hands.|$|R
30|$|The {{extracted}} {{key points}} of the hands trajectories (the average position of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers)</b> are used {{to carry out the}} assembly motion plan for the Baxter Research robot arms. However, as we are using the tip position of the fingers, there is no constraint on the type of robotic hand that can be used, as long as the transformation between the tip and the wrist is known.|$|R

He is wearing a hat and his clothes are stained. He is pinching the rabbit's tail with his <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> {{while the rest of}} his fingers hold up his shotgun. Shrubs, wild grass and bushes cover the surrounding area...|$|R
2500|$|Other notable putting styles include [...] "the claw", a {{style that}} has the grip {{directly}} in between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of the dominant hand while the palm faces the target. The weak hand placed normally on the putter. Anchored putting, {{a style that}} requires a longer putter shaft that can be anchored into the players stomach or below the chin; {{the idea is to}} stabilize one end of the putter thus creating a more consistent pendulum stroke. This style will be banned in 2016 on the profession circuits.|$|E
2500|$|His films {{frequently}} contained [...] "thrill sequences" [...] {{of extended}} chase scenes and daredevil physical feats, {{for which he}} is best remembered today. Lloyd hanging from the hands of a clock high above the street (in reality a trick shot) in Safety Last! (1923) {{is one of the most}} enduring images in all of cinema. Lloyd did many dangerous stunts himself, despite having injured himself in August 1919 while doing publicity pictures for the Roach studio. An accident with a bomb mistaken as a prop resulted in the loss of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of his right hand (the injury was disguised on future films with the use of a special prosthetic glove, though the glove often did not go unnoticed).|$|E
2500|$|Still, {{people came}} to EDSA until it swelled to {{hundreds}} of thousands of unarmed civilians. The mood in the street was actually very festive, with many bringing whole families. Performers entertained the crowds, nuns and priests led prayer vigils, and people set up barricades and makeshift sandbags, trees, and vehicles in several places along EDSA and intersecting streets such as Santolan and Ortigas Avenue. Everywhere, people listened to Radio Veritas on their radios. Several groups sang Bayan Ko (My Homeland), which, since 1980, had become a patriotic anthem of the opposition. People frequently flashed the 'LABAN' sign, which is an [...] "L" [...] formed with their <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> 'Laban' is the Tagalog word for 'fight', but also the abbreviation of Lakas ng Bayan, Ninoy Aquino's party.|$|E
5000|$|The Merkel-Raute (German for [...] "Merkel rhombus") is {{what has}} been termed Merkel diamond [...] or [...] "Triangle of Power" [...] by English-speaking media, a hand gesture made by resting one's {{hands in front of}} the stomach so that the {{fingertips}} meet, with the <b>thumbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> forming a rough quadrangular shape. This signature gesture of Angela Merkel, the current German Chancellor, has been described as [...] "probably one of the most recognisable hand gestures in the world".|$|R

50|$|Anselmo López (April 21, 1934 - February 14, 2016) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bandola llanera players in Venezuela. He is also the creator of the Jalao (Spanish for pull) technique, which applies the technique of classic guitar to the bandola. In jalao, the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers</b> hold the plectrum to pick the melody, while the middle finger is used to pluck harmonic notes in the chord of the melody on the first or second strings. With this technique, Anselmo López popularized the bandola nationally and internationally. He recorded several bandola albums.|$|R
2500|$|As police arrived, {{the house}} lights {{were brought up}} and Brewer pointed out Oswald sitting near {{the rear of the}} theater. Police Officer Nick McDonald testified that {{he was the first to}} reach Oswald and that Oswald seemed ready to {{surrender}} saying, [...] "Well, it is all over now." [...] McDonald said that Oswald pulled out a pistol tucked into the front of his pants, then pointed the pistol at him, and pulled the trigger. McDonald stated that the pistol did not fire because the pistol's hammer came down on the webbing between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> of his hand as he grabbed for the pistol. McDonald also said that Oswald struck him, but that he struck back and Oswald was disarmed. As he was led from the theater, Oswald shouted he was a victim of police brutality.|$|E
2500|$|The {{carpal tunnel}} is an {{anatomical}} compartment {{located at the}} base of the palm. Nine flexor tendons and the median nerve pass through the carpal tunnel that is surrounded on three sides by the carpal bones that form an arch. The median nerve provides feeling or sensation to the thumb, index finger, long finger, and half of the ring finger. At the level of the wrist, the median nerve supplies the muscles {{at the base of}} the thumb that allow it to abduct, move away from the other four fingers, as well as move out of the plane of the palm. The carpal tunnel is located at the middle third of the base of the palm, bounded by the bony prominence of the scaphoid tubercle and trapezium {{at the base of the}} thumb, and the hamate hook that can be palpated along the axis of the ring finger. From the anatomical position, the carpal tunnel is bordered on the anterior surface by the transverse carpal ligament, also known as the flexor retinaculum. The flexor retinaculum is a strong, fibrous band that attaches to the pisiform and the hamulus of the hamate. The proximal boundary is the distal wrist skin crease, and the distal boundary is approximated by a line known as Kaplan's cardinal line. [...] This line uses surface landmarks, and is drawn between the apex of the skin fold between the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> to the palpated hamate hook.|$|E

40|$|Some {{experimental}} {{evidence suggests that}} grasping {{should be regarded as}} independent control of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> the <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> (digit control hypothesis). To investigate this further, we compared how the tips of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> the <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> moved in space when grasping spheres to how they moved when they were hitting the sphere using only one digit. In order to make the tasks comparable, we designed the experiment {{in such a way that}} subjects contacted the spheres in about the same way in the hitting task as when grasping it. According to the digit control hypothesis, the two tasks should yield similar digit trajectories in space. People hit and grasped stationary and moving spheres. We compared the similarity of the digits' trajectories across the two tasks by evaluating the time courses of the paths of the average of the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> the <b>index</b> <b>finger.</b> These paths were more similar across tasks than across sphere motion, supporting the notion that grasping is not controlled fundamentally differently than hitting. © 2011 The Author(s) ...|$|R
5000|$|CS Campbell, an {{orthopedic}} surgeon, originally {{coined the term}} [...] "gamekeeper's thumb" [...] in 1955, after he observed this condition {{in a number of}} Scottish gamekeepers. The injury appeared to occur {{as a result of the}} particular manner in which they killed small animals such as rabbits. Specifically, the animals were placed on the ground, and their necks were broken as the gamekeeper exerted downward pressure with the <b>thumb</b> <b>and</b> <b>index</b> <b>fingers.</b> This maneuver would place a valgus force upon the abducted metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. Over time, this would lead to insufficiency of the ulnar collateral ligament of the thumb, a condition which Campbell referred to as [...] "gamekeeper's thumb".|$|R
