Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush noted that [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] features [...] "a slow, sensuous romp", which she found reminiscent of Michael Jackson. Lyrically, Brown asks his lover to forgive him [...] "for his past indiscretions" [...] and [...] "move on with the future." [...] In the song, Brown encourages his lover {{that there is nothing}} going on between him and his ex-girlfriend as he sings, [...] "You're hearing rumors about me / And you can't stomach the thought / Of someone touching my body / When you're so close to my heart / I won't deny what they saying / Because most of it is true / But it was all before I fell for you." [...] He later declares [...] "that he is a changed man who can now be trusted" [...] as shown in the lines, [...] "Take me as I am / Not who I was / I'll promise I'll be / <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can trust." [...] During the chorus, Brown sings [...] "So please don't judge me / and I won't judge you / because it could get ugly / before it gets beautiful." [...] Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press noted that Brown [...] "sings in his signature semi-high pitch", and critics speculated that the lyrics were about Brown's former relationships with aspiring American model and fashion designer Karrueche Tran and Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. Holly Frith of Entertainment Wise noted that Rihanna [...] "may be the inspiration" [...] for the lyrics.

But I know that I could support any hardships; and kind as they are to me here, I would rather go through anything with my husband than remain here; the darkness and the silence are more trying than any hardships. So you see that my lord's orders were given under a misapprehension, and as I am sure he would not have given them had he known that I was not afraid of hardships, and desired above all things to be with him, I shall disobey them, and he, when I join him, must decide whether I have done wrong, and, if he thinks so, send me away from him." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{told him}} then {{that all the}} kings in the country round about were in debt to her father the troll, and the king of a certain kingdom, the name of which she told him, was the first who had to pay, and {{if he could not}} do so at the time {{appointed}} he would lose his head. 'And he cannot pay,' said she; 'I know that for certain. Now you must, first of all, give up your service with my father; the three years are past, and you are at liberty to go. You will go off with your six bushels of money, to the kingdom that I have told you of, and there enter the service of the king. When the time comes near for his debt becoming due {{you will be able to}} notice by his manner that he is ill at ease. You shall then say to him that you know well enough what it is that is weighing upon him--that it is the debt which he owes to the troll and cannot pay, but that you can lend him the money. The amount is six bushels--just what you have. You shall, however, only lend them to him on condition that you may accompany him when he goes to make the payment, and that you then have permission to run before him as a fool. When you arrive at the troll's abode, you must perform all kinds of foolish tricks, and see that you break a whole lot of his windows, and do all other damage that you can. My father will then get very angry, and as the king must answer for what his fool does he will sentence him, even although he has paid his debt, either to answer three questions or to lose his life. The first question my father will ask will be, [...] "Where is my daughter?" [...] Then you shall step forward and answer [...] "She is at the bottom of the sea." [...] He will then ask you whether you can recognise her, and to this you will answer [...] "Yes." [...] Then he will bring forward a whole troop of women, and cause them to pass before you, in order that you may pick out <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> take for his daughter. You will not be able to recognise me at all, and therefore I will catch hold of you as I go past, so that you can notice it, and you must then make haste to catch me and hold me fast. You have then answered his first question. His next question will be, [...] "Where is my heart?" [...] You shall then step forward again and answer, [...] "It is in a fish." [...] "Do you know that fish?" [...] he will say, and you will again answer [...] "Yes." [...] He will then cause all kinds of fish to come before you, and you shall choose between them. I shall take good care to keep by your side, and when the right fish comes I will give you a little push, and with that you will seize the fish and cut it up. Then all will be over with the troll; he will ask no more questions, and we shall be free to wed.' ...|$|E
