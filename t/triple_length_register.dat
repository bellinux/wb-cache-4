40|$|International audienceManganese oxides are {{important}} scavengers of {{rare earth elements}} (REE) in hydrosystems. However, it {{has been difficult to}} include Mn oxides in speciation models {{due to the lack of}} a comprehensive set of sorption reactions consistent with a given surface complexation model (SCM), as well as discrepancies between published sorption data and predictions using the available models. Surface complexation reactions for hydrous Mn oxide were described using a two surface site model and the diffuse double layer SCM. The specific surface area, surface side density, and pHzpc were fixed to 746 m 2 /g, 2. 1 mmol/g, and 2. 2, respectively. Two site types (<b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashXOH and <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashYOH) were also used with pKa 2 values of 2. 35 (<b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashXOH) and 6. 06 (<b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashYOH). The fraction of the high affinity sites was fixed at 0. 36. Published REE sorption data were subsequently used to determine the equilibrium surface complexation constants, while considering the influence of pH, ionic strength, and metal loading. Log K increases from light REE to heavy REE and, more specifically, displays a convex tetrad effect.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is the study of}} the {{interaction}} mechanisms between U(VI) ions and SrTiO 3 surfaces as a function of pH and temperature (25, 50, 75 and 90 °C) by coupling thermodynamic and spectroscopic approaches. First, the reactivity towards U(VI) for both surface sites of the strontium titanate (<b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashTisingle bondO and <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashSrsingle bondO) has been investigated {{as a function of the}} temperature. The N 2 -BET specific area was measured: View the MathML source. The surface site density has been determined from potentiometric titrations (6 sites/nm 2 for each site <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashTisingle bondO and <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashSrsingle bondO). The potentiometric titration data have been simulated, for each temperature, using the FITEQL 4. 0 software and the constant capacitance model, taking into account both protonation of the <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashSrsingle bondOH surface sites and deprotonation of the <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashTisingle bondOH ones (one pK model). The intrinsic strontium protonation constant increases with an increasing temperature, while the titanate deprotonation one decreases. Moreover, both enthalpy and entropy changes corresponding to the surface acid–base reactions have been evaluated using the van't Hoff relation. The uranium(VI) ions are sorbed onto SrTiO 3 surfaces in the 0. 5 – 5. 0 pH range with an initial cation concentration equal to 10 − 4 M. The U(VI) surface complexes were identified by using time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS). For all the studied samples, the fluorescence spectra and the corresponding lifetime values do not change with the pH and the temperature. Two U(VI) complexes sorbed onto SrTiO 3 were detected and the corresponding lifetimes are 60 ± 5 and 12 ± 2 μs whatever the temperature (25, 50, 75 and 90 °C). The sorption edges were simulated with the FITEQL 4. 0 code. The sorption equilibrium constants of the U(VI) /SrTiO 3 system between 25 and 90 °C were obtained with the constant capacitance model (CCM), considering two reactive surface sites. According to the spectroscopic characterization, two types of surface complexes, namely [(triple bond; <b>length</b> of mdashSrOH) (<b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashTiOH) UO 2] 2 + and [(triple bond; <b>length</b> of mdashTiOH) (<b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashTiO) UO 2] 2 +, were considered. Finally, enthalpy (ΔrH°) and entropy (ΔrS°) changes were calculated from the temperature-dependent sorption constants, by the application of the van't Hoff formalism. The formation of the [(triple bond; <b>length</b> of mdashSrOH) (<b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashTiOH) UO 2] 2 + surface complex was found to present an endothermic character associated to an increase in the disorder of the system. On the contrary, the formation of the [(triple bond; <b>length</b> of mdashTiOH) (<b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashTiO) UO 2] 2 + surface complex led to an exothermic process with only a slight increase in the disorder of the system...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThree {{series of}} Fe-containing BEA zeolites are {{prepared}} by two-step postsynthesis (PS), ion exchange (IE) and conventional wet impregnation (Imp) procedures with various Fe content (1. 0 – 4. 0 Fe wt. %). In these series of zeolites iron is mainly present as pseudo-tetrahedral Fe(III) {{as evidenced by}} combined used of DR UV–vis, 57 Fe Mössbauer and XPS investigations. Two kinds of pseudo-tetrahedral Fe(III) have been distinguished by 57 Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy in all Fe-containing BEA zeolites. As evidenced by TPD of NH 3, the (Imp) -FexHAlBEA and (IE) -FeHAlBEA have a significantly higher acidity than (PS) -FexSiBEA. This {{is related to the}} presence in the former both pseudo-tetrahedral <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashAl(III) –O(H) –Sitriple bond; length of mdash and <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashFe(III) –O(H) –Sitriple bond; length of mdash framework sites and in the latter only pseudo-tetrahedral <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> of mdashFe(III) –O(H) –Sitriple bond; length of mdash. (PS) -FexSiBEA, (Imp) -FexHAlBEA and (IE) -FeHAlBEA are found to be active and selective catalysts of N 2 O decomposition, with 100 % conversion in the temperature range of 750 – 800 K. Moreover, the samples are active in selective catalytic reduction of NO with ammonia, with selectivity toward N 2 exceeding 90 % for NO conversions of 80 – 93 % in the temperature range of 550 – 800 K.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} and model the adsorption of Eu(III) on bentonite {{in the presence of}} phosphate. Binary (phosphate/bentonite) and ternary (Eu(III) /phosphate/bentonite) systems were studied as a function of contact time, pH, solid-to-liquid ratio and Eu(III) /phosphate concentration by using a batch experimental method. The adsorption of phosphate on bentonite slightly increased in the pH range of 2. 5 - 6. 5, and decreased in the pH range of 6. 5 - 9. 4. This adsorption can be quantitatively interpreted by a model considering the formation of three monodentate surface complexes. In the ternary system, a synergistic adsorption was observed in the presence of both phosphate and Eu(III). In addition to the two sub-models describing Eu(III) and phosphate adsorption, the formation of ternary surface complexes had to be considered in order to explain the synergistic effect experimentally observed. The experimental data could be quantitatively explained when Eu(III) (6 -point <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> half of m-dashSOEuH 2 PO 4 + and 6 -point <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> half of m-dashSOEuHPO 4) or phosphate (6 -point <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> half of m-dashSPO 4 Eu+) are the bridged atoms.

Unlike the Srivastav approach, this regularization transforms dual equations into a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind given on the crack surface. Hence, exact asymptotic expansions of the Fredholm equation solution, the stress intensity factor and the torque are derived for the case of a shallow crack. The asymptotic expansions are certain power-logarithmic series of the normalized crack depth. Coefficients of these series are found from recurrent relations. Calculations for a shallow crack manifest that the stress intensity factor exhibits the rather weak dependence upon the cylinder length when the torque is fixed and the <b>triple</b> <b>length</b> is larger than the diameter...|$|R

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{designing}} a digital filter, the coefficients of the transfer function are normally evaluated {{with a high degree}} of accuracy. To implement the designed filter in hardware, finite word <b>length</b> <b>registers</b> have to be utilized. This may bring about truncation of the filter coefficients to the limited word <b>length</b> <b>registers</b> employed, which in turn may affect the total response of the digital filter. To remedy this, filters are designed with the finite word length coefficients. In this thesis a review of existing techniques for the design of integer coefficients 1 -D FIR filters is presented. Where possible extension of these techniques to 2 -D are also presented. In this thesis two design methods for 1 -D and 2 -D FIR filter with integer coefficients based on the suboptimal approach of discretization and reoptimization techniques are presented. These two approaches are somewhat modified versions of the well known branch and bound optimization technique. This thesis also presents a technique for the design of 1 -D and 2 -D FIR filters with integer coefficients using Mixed integer linear programming. Delta modulation is also employed for a new filter structure for 1 -D FIR filter with its coefficients being $-$ 1, 0, and + 1. McClallan transformation is used for designing a class of 2 -D FIR filters with integer coefficients and a suitable realization structure. In this thesis, we also present a comparison of various techniques we have proposed in terms of complexity of the design issue, as well as the computational burden for each iteration.

In the first step, part of the melt (the trisaturated triacylglycerols (TAGs)) crystallized in α crystals adopting a double length structure (2 L), while the second step consisted of a polymorphic transition of these 2 Lα crystals to β’ crystals with a <b>triple</b> <b>length</b> structure (3 L). Extra 3 Lβ’ crystals consisting of monounsaturated TAGs were also formed directly from the melt. In the third and last step, β crystals were formed due to a second polymorphic transition of trisaturated 3 Lβ’ crystals to β crystals adopting a 2 L structure. Above a cut-off temperature of 20 °C lard crystallized in two steps: no formation of α crystals could be observed and 3 Lβ’ crystals (trisaturated and monounsaturated TAGs) were formed directly from the melt. This proposed mechanism implies that lard crystallization is characterized by an overlap of fractionated crystallization and polymorphic transitions. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|To {{explain the}} {{nitrogen}} low rate in CVD CNx layers, and their amorphisation, {{a release of}} gaseous species containing N was proposed. Previous modelling studies based on local density functional theory use pyrite type CN 2 as starting model to assess the release of molecular nitrogen. This model is completed here to investigate another mechanism of release of cyanogen as another gaseous species. The theoretical pyrite-like C 2 N wherein C and N atoms form dumbbells in octahedral sites of a carbon face-centred sub-lattice is proposed as likely to model it. It demonstrates a good compressibility (B 0 = 272 GPa) and a mechanical instability, which supports both release of atoms and the amorphisation of layers. However, the variation of interatomic distances under strain leads to propose {{the formation of a}} radical species radical dotC 6 -point <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> half of m-dashN. This is enforced by the consideration of the chemical bonding and its evolution in the model with the ECOV and ELF functions. The release of nitrogen in molecular cyanogen is consequently substituted by a mechanism which implies a radical dotC 6 -point <b>triple</b> bond; <b>length</b> half of m-dashN radical species, which is likely to recombinate at the CVD layers surfaces...|$|R
