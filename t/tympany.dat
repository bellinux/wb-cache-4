25|$|In 1951, Jordan {{assembled}} a short-lived big band that included Pee Wee Moore and others, {{at a time}} when big bands were declining in popularity. This is considered the beginning of his commercial decline, even though he reverted to the <b>Tympany</b> Five format within a year. By the mid-1950s, Jordan's records were not selling as well as before, and he left Decca Records.|$|E
25|$|External {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} are constipation of very long duration, abdominal bloating, abdominal tenderness and <b>tympany,</b> abdominal pain, palpation of hard fecal masses and, in toxic megacolon, fever, low blood potassium, tachycardia and shock. Stercoral ulcers are sometimes observed in chronic megacolon, which may lead to perforation of the intestinal wall in approximately 3% of the cases, leading to sepsis and risk of death.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of gastric dilatation-volvulus {{is made by}} several factors. The breed and history will often give a significant suspicion of gastric dilatation-volvulus, and the physical exam will often reveal the telltale sign of a distended abdomen with abdominal <b>tympany.</b> Shock is diagnosed {{by the presence of}} pale mucous membranes with poor capillary refill, increased heart rate, and poor pulse quality. Radiographs (x-rays), usually taken after decompression of the stomach if the dog is unstable, will show a stomach distended with gas. The pylorus, which normally is ventral and {{to the right of the}} body of the stomach, will be cranial to the body of the stomach and left of the midline, often separated on the x-ray by soft tissue and giving the appearance of a separate gas filled pocket (double bubble sign).|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [149]- 157) Many {{researchers have}} argued that Neandertal craniofacial morphology contains unique features which distinguish Neandertals from all previous archaic and subsequent modem humans at the species level. Few published studies have specifically examined the variation contained within Neandertal craniofacial morphology along with providing detailed morphometric comparisons with modem populations. This study attempts to provide quantitative and qualitative data taken along the temporal bone (a bone {{on the side of}} the cranial vault) from one "population" of Neandertals, the Krapina collection. The Croatian rockshelter of Krapina has yielded over 800 fragments of human fossils deposited within a short time span of approximately 10, 000 years. These remains have been used as an approximation of a Neandertal "population" because of its limitations in deposition. Three comparative samples were also examined, two Bronze Age sites from Bosnia, Pod and Vlasic, and one recent modem human sample housed at Northern Illinois University. For this thesis a variety of data were collected including descriptive, categorical, ontogenetic, metrical and angular. The total morphological pattern of the Neandertal temporal bone reflects its archaicness with respect to robusticity; however, much of the morphology along the Krapina temporal bones is commensurate with modem humans. The Krapina Neandertal temporal bones can be distinguished from the modem comparative samples by a variety of the categorical data, with one exception. One feature which has been used to distinguish Neandertals, the anterior mastoid tubercle, is unique in its absence from the Krapina specimens. The Krapina specimens demonstrate angulation along the petrosal which also distinguish them from the modem samples. However, numerous features do not differentiate the samples including thickness measurements along the anterior and inferior <b>tympanies,</b> mandibular fossa widths, measurements along the petrosal pyramid, dimensions of the external acoustic meatus and thickness measurements along the post-glenoid process. The overall patterning of the results obtained indicate that the Krapina Neandertals probably are not a separate species from previous and subsequent populations but that a combination of characteristics and morphometries along the temporal bone could be used to assess populational affinity.

500|$|Guttural Pouch <b>Tympany</b> (GPT) {{occurs in}} horses ranging {{from birth to}} 1 year of age and {{is more common in}} fillies than in colts. It is thought to be genetic in Arabians, {{possibly}} polygenic in inheritance, but more study is needed. Foals are born with a defect that causes the pharyngeal opening of the eustachian tube to act like a one-way valve [...] air can get in, but it cannot get out. The affected guttural pouch is distended with air and forms a characteristic nonpainful swelling. Breathing is noisy in severely affected animals. Diagnosis is based on clinical signs and radiographic examination of the skull. Medical management with NSAID and antimicrobial therapy can treat upper respiratory tract inflammation. Surgical intervention is needed to correct the malformation of the guttural pouch opening, to provide a route for air in the abnormal guttural pouch to pass to the normal side and be expelled into the pharynx. Foals that are successfully treated may grow up to have fully useful lives.|$|E
2500|$|The new band's first {{recording}} date, for Decca Records on December 20, 1938, produced {{three sides}} {{on which they}} backed an obscure vocalist, Rodney Sturgess, and two novelty sides of their own, [...] "Honey in the Bee Ball" [...] and [...] "Barnacle Bill the Sailor". These recordings were credited to the Elks Rendezvous Band, but Jordan subsequently changed the name to the <b>Tympany</b> Five, since Martin often used tympani in performance. (The word <b>tympany</b> is also an old-fashioned colloquial term meaning [...] "swollen, inflated, puffed-up", etymologically related to timpani, or kettledrums, but historically separate.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The various lineups of the <b>Tympany</b> Five (which often {{featured}} two {{or three}} extra players) included Bill Jennings and Carl Hogan on guitar, the renowned pianist-arrangers Wild Bill Davis and Bill Doggett, [...] "Shadow" [...] Wilson and Chris Columbus on drums and Dallas Bartley on bass. Jordan played alto, tenor and baritone saxophone and sang the lead vocal on most songs.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this period}} Jordan again placed {{more than a}} dozen songs on the {{national}} charts. However, Louis Jordan and His <b>Tympany</b> Five dominated the 1940s R charts, or (as they were known at the time) the [...] "race" [...] charts. In this period Jordan had eighteen number 1 singles and fifty-four in the Top Ten. According to Joel Whitburn's points-based analysis of Billboard chart placings, Jordan ranks fifth among the most successful artists over the period 1942–1995. From July 1946 through May 1947, Jordan had five consecutive number 1 songs, holding the top slot for 44 consecutive weeks.|$|E
2500|$|With his dynamic <b>Tympany</b> Five bands, Jordan {{mapped out}} the main {{parameters}} of the classic R, urban blues and early rock-and-roll genres {{with a series of}} highly influential 78-rpm discs released by Decca Records. These recordings presaged many of the styles of black popular music of the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and exerted a strong influence on many leading performers in these genres. Many of his records were produced by Milt Gabler, who went on to refine and develop the qualities of Jordan's recordings in his later production work with Bill Haley, including [...] "Rock Around the Clock".|$|E
2500|$|Jordan wrote (or co-wrote) a large {{proportion}} of the songs he performed, but did not benefit financially from many of them. Many of the hit songs he wrote, including [...] "Caldonia", were credited to his wife Fleecie Moore as a means of avoiding an existing publishing arrangement. Their marriage was acrimonious and short-lived. On two occasions, Moore stabbed Jordan after domestic disputes, almost killing him the second time. After their divorce she retained ownership of the songs. However, Jordan may have taken credit for some songs written by others—he is credited as the co-writer of [...] "Saturday Night Fish Fry", but the <b>Tympany</b> Five pianist Bill Doggett later claimed that in fact he had written the song.|$|E
2500|$|First attested in English in {{the late}} 19th century, the Italian word timpani derives from the Latin {{tympanum}} (pl. tympana), which is the latinisation of the Greek word τύμπανον (tumpanon, pl. tumpana), [...] "a hand drum", which in turn derives from the verb τύπτω (tuptō), meaning [...] "to strike, to hit". Alternative spellings with y in place of either or both is—tympani, <b>tympany,</b> or timpany—are occasionally encountered in older English texts. Although the word timpani has been widely adopted in the English language, some English speakers choose {{to use the word}} kettledrums. The German word for timpani is Pauken; the French and Spanish is timbales. The Ashanti pair of talking drums are known as atumpan.|$|E
2500|$|Ruminal <b>tympany,</b> {{also known}} as bloat, is a common problem in grazing systems for ruminants, {{although}} not for pigs or poultry, that if left untreated can lead to animal death. [...] This problem occurs when foam producing compounds in plants are digested by cows, causing foam to form in the rumen of the animal and ultimately prohibiting animals from expelling gas. The risk of bloat can be mitigated by seeding non-bloating legumes with the grasses. [...] Animals are especially susceptible to bloat if they are moved to new pasture sources when they are particularly hungry. [...] It is therefore important {{to ensure that the}} herd is eating enough {{at the end of a}} rotation when forage will be more scarce, limiting the potential for animals to gorge themselves when turned onto new paddocks.|$|E

"Redneck Eats" [...] {{begins and}} ends with spoken {{dialogue}} featuring the character Lonesome Cowboy Burt (played by Jimmy Carl Black) heckling the orchestra, which is performing an Igor Stravinsky and Edgard Varese-influenced composition. [...] "Janet's Big Dance Number" [...] is {{about one of the}} film's two groupie characters and features [...] "Slow piano chords [...] played over sustained contrabass notes. The choir enters late in the piece, picking up the Stravinskian melody sketched by the chords." [...] "Lucy's Seduction of a Bored Violinist", follows the other groupie character, and features [...] "a soft melody, followed by a rhythm break and a <b>tympany</b> roll" [...] and a faster reprise of the [...] "Janet" [...] melody. The album pairs [...] "Lucy" [...] with the film's [...] "Postlude", which appears during the ending credits, and is played on a harpsichord.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Bessie Smith's recording, numerous musicians began interpreting the song in recordings of their own. The song became an early standard with jazz and blues artists, such as the Count Basie Orchestra, Louis Jordan And His <b>Tympany</b> Five, Sidney Bechet, Scrapper Blackwell, Eddie Condon, Josh White, Julia Lee, and Lead Belly. In the late 1950s – early 1960s, it again became popular with the American folk music revival, with recordings by Eric Von Schmidt, Odetta, Chad Mitchell Trio, Dave Van Ronk, and an early demo by Janis Joplin with Jorma Kaukonen. In 1960, a version by Nina Simone reached number 23 in the Billboard R chart as well as number 93 in the Hot 100 pop chart. In the mid-1960s, soul versions were recorded by Sam Cooke and Otis Redding; rock versions by the Spencer Davis Group, pre-Allman Brothers Band Duane Allman and Gregg Allman, and Them; and a French version by Nino Ferrer (as [...] "Le Millionnaire").|$|E
2500|$|Within {{a year of}} his breakthrough, the <b>Tympany</b> Five's {{appearance}} fee {{rose from}} $350 to $2,000 per night. But the breadth of Jordan's success {{and the size of}} his combo had larger implications for the music industry. The blues singer Gatemouth Moore said, [...] "He was playing... with five pieces. That ruined the big bands... He could play just as good and just as loud with five as 17. And it was cheaper." [...] Jordan's position as the band's lead vocalist was also uncommon and proved influential. The artistic innovations and economic advantages reinforced each other and helped pave the way for black pop music to shift from big-band swing to rock and roll. The word rock, originally black slang for coitus, began to be popularly used in its musical sense in the early 1940s. Following Jordan, many other small bands began achieving success, including Joe Liggins and the Honeydrippers and Johnny Moore's Three Blazers, while single acts such as Big Joe Turner, Ivory Joe Hunter, T-Bone Walker and Wynonie Harris travelled the circuit without bands.|$|E
2500|$|In 1948, RCA Victor was {{marketing}} {{black music}} {{under the name}} [...] "Blues and Rhythm". In that year, Louis Jordan dominated the top five listings of the R charts with three songs, {{and two of the}} top five songs were based on the boogie-woogie rhythms that had come to prominence during the 1940s. Jordan's band, the <b>Tympany</b> Five (formed in 1938), consisted of him on saxophone and vocals, along with musicians on trumpet, tenor saxophone, piano, bass and drums. Lawrence Cohn described the music as [...] "grittier than his boogie-era jazz-tinged blues". Robert Palmer described it as [...] "urbane, rocking, jazz-based music with a heavy, insistent beat". Jordan's cool music, along with that of Big Joe Turner, Roy Brown, Billy Wright, and Wynonie Harris, is now also referred to as jump blues. Already Paul Gayten, Roy Brown, and others had had hits in the style now referred to as rhythm and blues. In 1948, Wynonie Harris' remake of Brown's 1947 recording [...] "Good Rockin' Tonight" [...] hit the charts in the #2 spot, following band leader Sonny Thompson's [...] "Long Gone" [...] at #1.|$|E
2500|$|In 1949, {{the term}} [...] "Rhythm and Blues" [...] {{replaced}} the Billboard category Harlem Hit Parade. Also in that year, [...] "The Huckle-Buck", recorded by band leader and saxophonist Paul Williams, {{was the number}} 1 R tune, remaining {{on top of the}} charts for nearly the entire year. Written by musician and arranger Andy Gibson, the song was described as a [...] "dirty boogie" [...] because it was risque and raunchy. Paul Williams and His Hucklebuckers' concerts were sweaty riotous affairs that got shut down on more than one occasion. Their lyrics, by Roy Alfred (who later co-wrote the 1955 hit [...] "(The) Rock and Roll Waltz"), were mildly sexually suggestive, and one teenager from Philadelphia said [...] "That Hucklebuck was a very nasty dance". Also in 1949, a new version of a 1920s blues song, [...] "Ain't Nobody's Business" [...] was a #4 hit for Jimmy Witherspoon, and Louis Jordan and the <b>Tympany</b> Five once again made the top 5 with [...] "Saturday Night Fish Fry". Many of these hit records were issued on new independent record labels, such as Savoy (founded 1942), King (founded 1943), Imperial (founded 1945), Specialty (founded 1946), Chess (founded 1947), and Atlantic (founded 1948).|$|E

50|$|Guttural pouch <b>tympany</b> is an {{uncommon}} ailment in which excessive amounts of air become {{trapped in the}} pouch, resulting in abnormal expansion. <b>Tympany</b> is usually unilateral, {{but in some cases}} can affect both pouches. It is seen most often in young foals and is more common in females than in males. <b>Tympany</b> results in non-painful, soft swelling beneath the ear and behind the jaw. Additional symptoms may include roaring, difficulty breathing, and difficulty swallowing and/or aspiration pneumonia. Diagnosis is achieved through radiography and endoscopic evaluation. The specific cause of guttural pouch <b>tympany</b> is not known, but it is suspected that it is more common when there are defects of the plica salpingopharyngeus, and/or the pharyngeal orifice where they act as a one-way valve that does not allow air to escape. Because of the risk of secondary infection, it is crucial that <b>tympany</b> be treated as soon as possible. Treatment protocols may include, but are not limited to, surgical intervention and in cases where surgery is not an option, insertion of a transnasal Foley balloon catheter in an attempt to remodel the pharyngeal orifice.|$|E
