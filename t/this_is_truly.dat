500|$|... "Occupation" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Eric Goldman of IGN rated [...] "Occupation" [...] a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10, stating [...] "watching the season premiere of Battlestar Galactica {{is a great}} reminder that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> still the best show on television." [...] Ian Berriman of SFX called the episode a [...] "stunning season opener," [...] citing the similarities of the occupation of Iraq as its greatest strength, but also {{thought it was the}} episode's weakness. Berriman also liked Tigh's transformation to a [...] "ruthless terrorist" [...] and Starbuck's part of the episode. [...] "Occupation" [...] was rated five stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] was {{directed}} by Miguel Sapochnik. He previously directed the fifth season episodes [...] "The Gift" [...] and [...] "Hardhome", and the sixth season episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards". In an interview, Sapochnik spoke about the scenes {{at the beginning of}} the episode, which mostly lacked any dialogue, saying [...] "Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of smart and witty dialogue. This is something that Game of Thrones is probably quite famous for and rightly so, but I love non-verbal film making more than anything probably." [...] He continued by drawing a comparison to the film Heat starring Robert DeNiro, noting [...] "To me, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> wonderful filmmaking. And so any opportunity I can get to try my hand at that I welcome. From that perspective, I really hit the jackpot this year and I'm very grateful." ...|$|E

500|$|The Huffington Post {{ranked the}} song sixth {{on their list}} of [...] "The 13 Most Underrated Madonna Songs"; author Pandora Boxx wrote: [...] "This song takes a sad {{break-up}} and empowers it [...] <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> a hidden gem in the vast Madonna library". Louis Virtel, from TheBacklot.com, placed [...] "You'll See" [...] at number 48 of his list [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs". He wrote; [...] "Madonna's declaration of independence over beautiful Spanish guitar-playing is organic and inspired". Writing for The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs gave the song a more negative review; [...] "it could be credited as a curtsy to Madonna's impending Evita/Ray of Light comeback. Unfortunately, it also sounds like a dull displacement from a compilation of yearning '80s ballads". Nevertheless, he placed [...] "You'll See" [...] at number 69 of his list [...] "The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles". The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) honored it as the Most Performed Song, in their annual ASCAP Pop Awards for 1997.|$|E
500|$|Chuck Taylor also {{reviewed}} [...] "I Want You to Need Me" [...] {{and wrote}} that linking Dion and Diane Warren {{has always been}} about [...] "as fine a fit as a trusty pair of Thom McAn's." [...] Between Warren's [...] "heart-drenched" [...] words and dramatic melody writing and Dion's [...] "potent vocals straight from soulside, divadom has never sounded so mighty." [...] According to him, for fans of Dion's [...] "high-caliber" [...] power ballads, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> among the best ever and a highlight on All the Way... A Decade of Song. Longing for romantic attention, Dion sings, [...] "I want you [...] to need me, like the air you breathe/I {{want you to feel}} me, in everything/I want you to see me, in your every dream/The way that I taste you, feel you, breathe you, need you." [...] Taylor stated that Warren's trusty melody is wholly natural and free-flowing, while production from the usually rock-oriented Matt Serletic is [...] "sheer perfection". It all peaks from the glorious midsection through to the end, where Dion delivers exactly what we've come to expect: a crescendo as [...] "spine-tingling" [...] as those first few times we heard [...] "My Heart Will Go On".|$|E
500|$|... "Precipice" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Keith McDuffee of TV Squad felt that Sharon Agathon {{coming to the}} fleet was a [...] "surprising development" [...] and the cliffhanger was [...] "unbelievable", adding [...] "are the writers actually crazy enough to mass kill so many main characters to the series? Is it possible at all that they can actually get out of this?" [...] Eric Goldman of IGN rated the episode a [...] "masterful" [...] 10 out of 10, stating [...] "watching the season premiere of Battlestar Galactica is a great reminder that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> still the best show on television." [...] Ian Berriman of SFX reacted positively towards the episode, stating [...] "Although {{there are a couple}} of great surprises in this episode – Casey, the Great Escape-homaging finale – the highlights are a fistful of fabulous face-offs: Baltar discussing the bombing with Roslin; Roslin questioning Tigh's methods; Apollo telling Adama that his plan is madness. James Callis's performance as the haggard, tortured Baltar is outstanding." [...] Berriman rated the episode five stars out of five. Patrick Sauriol of UGO felt that although it was set a year since [...] "Lay Down Your Burdens", it [...] "hasn't lost a thing by jumping ahead," [...] and that the episode, along with [...] "Occupation", [...] "confirm that it's still the best show on television." [...] Sauriol graded both episodes an A-. Television Without Pity gave the episode an A+, a higher grade than the previous episode.|$|E
5000|$|When the 1992/1993 season started, Deportivo {{had become}} an Anonymous Society (S.A.D.). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> a common factor for clubs in Spain, as each club is their own {{independent}} institution.

5000|$|An article later {{published}} on the internet discussion forum NyeMeninger.no criticized the UNE statement of 19. April, and claimed that UNEs claims could be refuted on all points.

2500|$|A joint risk-assessment by EFSA/ECDC, issued 29 June 2011, made a {{connection}} between the German outbreak and a HUS outbreak in the Bordeaux area of France, first reported on 24 June, in which infection with E. coli O104:H4 has been confirmed in several patients. The assessment implicated fenugreek seeds imported from Egypt in 2009 and 2010, from which sprouts were grown, as a common source of both outbreaks, but cautioned, [...] "there is still much uncertainty about whether <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> the common cause of the infections", as tests on the seeds had not yet found any E. coli bacteria of the O104:H4 strain. The potentially contaminated seeds were widely distributed in Europe. Egypt, for its part, steadfastly denied {{it may have been the}} source of deadly E. coli strain, with the Minister of Agriculture calling speculations to that effect [...] "sheer lies".|$|E

[...] Like other reviewers, he also noted of the band's musical evolution and light departure from their previous works; [...] "Progression is inevitable. To evolve in music, {{you need to keep}} ideas fresh and move forward. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> evident in the fourth album by Perth-bred alternative rockers, Birds Of Tokyo.". Nick Linde of Tom Magazine also gave the album a positive review, and also touched upon the difference of sound March Fires presented, writing [...] "The new album from West Australian band Birds of Tokyo has a little bit of old {{and a little bit of}} new." [...] He took note - [...] "March Fires delivers a strong anthemic feel, coupled with the sound from the band that has taken off over the last few years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 231, a Wu officer Sun Bu (孫布) {{secretly}} sent {{a messenger}} to meet Wang Ling, the Wei inspector of Yang Province, and convey {{his desire to}} defect to Wei. Sun Bu also said in his message: [...] "As we are too far apart from each other, I cannot come to you. You will need to send troops to escort me over." [...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is good to hear that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious. I think you should secretly make plans for yourself first and act accordingly when the time comes." ...|$|E
