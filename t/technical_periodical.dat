50|$|On December 17, 1987 an {{incident}} (INES 1) occurred: Coworkers overlooked a stop valve {{that had not}} been closed. In order to close the armature a valve was opened. The Radioactive primary cooling agent discharged for a short time into the annular space. Because the discharge of the reactor cooling water took place outside of the reactor containment, there was no feedback from the sump over the safety feeding pumps and/or cooling pumps. The incident became public one year later, when an article in an American <b>technical</b> <b>periodical</b> (Nucleonic Weeks) was published.

A second and enlarged edition, {{in which he}} was assisted by Mr E. R. Pitt of the public library, Melbourne, appeared in 1911. He did much valuable work for the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria (president 1901-1903), the Royal Society of Victoria, and the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science. His Victorian Hill and Dale (1909), describing the geology of the country around Melbourne, is a model book of popular science, written without a trace of scientific jargon; there is barely a technical term in its 150 pages. He did not write a large number of papers, but his work on the graptolite rocks of Victoria led to his being made the recipient of The Murchison Fund of the Geological Society of London in 1901. One of his major discoveries was the key to the unravelling of the complex Ordovician sequence.|$|E

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} prucalopride {{in the treatment of}} chronic constipation (CC). Methods　Articles regarding treatment of constipation were retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Chinese Journals Full-text Database (CNKI, China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wan Fang Digital Journal Full-text Database, and Database for Chinese <b>Technical</b> <b>Periodical</b> (VIP) to collect clinical randomized controlled trials for CC treated by prucalopride. Meta analysis was performed by using Review Manager 5. 0. Results　A total of eleven randomized controlled trials including 3278 patients met the inclusion criteria, and ten of them were analyzed to compare the effect of prucalopride with placebo, and another group of articles were analyzed to compare the effect or prucalopride with that of PEG 3350 +electrolytes. Mete-analysis showed that the efficacy rate was significantly higher in prucalopride group (29. 2 %) than in the placebo group (12. 6 %, RR= 2. 37, 95 % CI 2. 02 - 2. 79, P 0. 05). Conclusion　Prucalopride is effective in the treatment of CC, with relatively milder and lower incidence of adverse reaction, and it could be a new choice for the treatment of CC.

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} the diagnostic value of serum Golgi protein 73 (GP 73) and alpha fetoprotein (AFP) {{in patients with}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods　The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, EMBase, Web of Science, Nature, Science, Springer link, Chinese Journal Full-Text Database (CNKI), Database for Chinese <b>Technical</b> <b>Periodical</b> (VIP), Wanfang Digital Journal Full-text Database (before October 2012) were retrieved to collect relevant literature in which the diagnostic value of serum GP 73 and AFP in patients with HCC was evaluated. The statistical information and scientific quality were assessed and classified. The {{data were analyzed using}} Meta-Disc 1. 4 software. The diagnostic value of serum GP 73 and AFP in HCC was evaluated by the statistical indicators as pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, pooled likelihood ratio and summary receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). Results　Eighteen articles were collected and 5279 cases were included in the study (2075 HCC and 3204 NHCC patients). After heterogeneity test, the data were analyzed by random-effect model. The results showed that, the pooled sensitivity, specificity of the serum GP 73 and AFP were 0. 78 (0. 76 - 0. 79) and 0. 55 (0. 53 - 0. 57), 0. 84 (0. 83 - 0. 86) and 0. 80 (0. 78 - 0. 81), respectively. The pooled positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio was 5. 60 (4. 05 - 7. 74) and 2. 92 (2. 04 - 4. 17), 0. 28 (0. 24 - 0. 32) and 0. 58 (0. 51 - 0. 67), respectively. The ROC area under the curve (AUC) was 0. 8849 and 0. 6827, and Z test showed that the difference was statistically significant (P< 0. 01).

40|$|Objective　To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} selective vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonists {{in the treatment of}} hepatic cirrhosis patients with ascites. Methods　PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Database for Chinese <b>Technical</b> <b>Periodical</b> (VIP), Chinese Journal Full-Text Database (CNKI), and Wan Fang Digital Journal Full-text Database were retrieved to collect clinical randomized controlled trials of hepatic cirrhosis with ascites treated by selective vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonists. Meta analysis was performed by using Review Manager 5. 0. Results　Nine randomized controlled trials including 1884 patients met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that: 1) The selective vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonists were associated with a significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo (WMD=– 1. 98 kg, 95 %CI:– 3. 24 -– 0. 72 kg, P= 0. 002). Treatment with selective vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonists was associated with an improvement of low serum sodium concentration compared to placebo (WMD= 3. 74 mmol/L, 95 %CI: 0. 91 - 6. 58 mmol/L, P= 0. 01). The percentage of patients with worsening ascites was higher in the group of patients treated with placebo (RR= 0. 51, 95 %CI: 0. 34 - 0. 77, P= 0. 001). 2) The amplitude of increased urine volume was obviously higher in selective vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonists group than in placebo group (WMD= 1437. 65 ml, 95 %CI: 649. 01 - 2226. 30 ml, P= 0. 0004). The difference of serum creatinine in the selective vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonists group was not statistically significant compared with the control group (WMD=– 3. 49 μmol/L, 95 %CI: – 12. 54 ¬ 5. 56 μmol/L, P= 0. 45). 3) There was no statistical significance between the two groups in the heart rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and mortality (P> 0. 05). The rate of other adverse reactions was higher in the selective vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonists group compared with that of placebo group (P= 0. 003). Conclusion　The selective vasopressin V 2 receptor antagonists may improve ascites and increase serum sodium in patients with hepatic cirrhosis and ascites. No significant changes are observed in heart and kidney function, and the incidence of adverse reaction is relatively less. It could be a novel therapy for the treatment of ascites due to liver cirrhosis...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAs {{part of the}} curriculum of the Electronics Engineering Course at the U. S. Naval Postgraduate School the author was assigned as a junior engineer to the Engineering Products Department, RCA Victor Division, Radio Corporation of America, Camden, N. J. for a period of eleven weeks during the winter of 1949. He was specifically assigned to assist Mr. H. C. Bryson of RCA in the pre-production development of a counter under Navy Contract NObsr- 393 l 3. This project consisted primarily of investigating miniature and sub-miniature techniques in order to produce an easily portable piece of test equipment. Prior to, and during this period, the author studied the articles listed in the Bibliography to assist him in this assignment and in the preparation of this thesis. Using this background and the circuitry already developed by Mr. W. H. Bliss of the RCA Laboratories Division. Princeton, N. J. the author attempted to design a 400, 000 to 1 counter by scaling known designs {{to the needs of the}} assigned project. By trial and error techniques barely acceptable circuits were produced. It soon became apparent that it would be highly desirable to have some means of predicting the optimum circuit design. To meet this need, and at the instigation of Mr. Bryson, the author evolved the design procedures set forth in this thesis. Three different counter circuits were built using these procedures and upon testing gave highly satisfactory results. Rather than write a lengthy summary of the past literature on counters, the author hopes that this paper will be an extension to the literature. The only claim to true originality lies in the method for determining the optimum ratio of R 2 to R 3; it was on this phase that the author spent the major portion of his research time on this project. The other procedures set forth, however, represent a compilation in one article of known facts in other fields of electronics which are adaptable to the design of electronic counters. It is hoped that this paper will meet the need for which it was written; to this end it is additionally being offered for publication in a <b>technical</b> <b>periodical.</b> The Bibliography herein is offered for those who wish to make a more extensive study of counters, their circuitry and applications.
