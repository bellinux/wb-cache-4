5|$|A key {{development}} of the <b>testing</b> <b>program</b> was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E

The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test Baker prevented the required technical support personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant that there were no uncontaminated target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling Charlie was that the program staff felt it was unnecessary due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests.

40|$|In practice, various ad hoc {{approaches}} for designing reliability <b>test</b> <b>programs</b> have been observed. Many {{of these approaches}} rely on previously established rules of thumb for which the underlying rationale is indefensible. As a consequence, those who use such approaches are unlikely to maintain a firm resource commitment {{for the conduct of}} reliability <b>test</b> <b>program</b> activities. Furthermore, it is difficult to ascertain the impact that budgetary cuts will have on the adequacy of the reliability <b>test</b> <b>program</b> with any degree of accuracy. The contributions of this research are as follows. This dissertation presents a novel 7 -step planning process to aid practitioners in designing adequate reliability <b>test</b> <b>programs.</b> This planning process serves as a tool to systematically identify, quantify, and mitigate evaluation risks subject to resource constraints. By performing the 7 steps associated with this planning process, practitioners will be able to logically justify reliability <b>test</b> <b>program</b> requirements and more effectively articulate the significance of evaluation risks associated with a particular reliability <b>test</b> <b>program</b> design. Additionally, it is a straightforward process {{to assess the impact of}} a reduction in reliability <b>test</b> <b>program</b> resources. This planning process includes a step for assessing the level of risk associated with key aspects of the reliability <b>test</b> <b>program.</b> One such consideration that is of paramount importance is the adequacy of the test configuration of the system. Hence, we present a simulation-based approach for assessing the adequacy of the test configuration of a complex system-of-systems. For the purpose of demonstration, an application of this approach to air defense systems is included; however, the approach is valid for any type of system. As well, this dissertation presents an evaluation risk assessment process for reliability <b>test</b> <b>programs</b> [...] adapted from the traditional failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) process. This process can be applied to any reliability <b>test</b> <b>program,</b> irrespective of the manner in which the plan was formulated.
