5|$|Despite his {{reputation}} among his contemporaries for untruth and fantasy, Morrell has been defended by some later commentators who, while questioning his general reliability, maintain {{that not all}} his life was fraud and exaggeration. They believe that aside from the bombast and boastful tone of the account that carries his name, {{there is evidence that}} he carried out useful work, such his discovery of large-scale guano deposits which {{led to the development of}} a full-scale industry. He is believed to have died in 1838 or 1839, in Mozambique; there is, however, evidence to suggest that <b>this</b> <b>death</b> might have been staged, and that he lived on in exile, possibly in South America.|$|E
5|$|San Martín made a {{new request}} for ships to Bowles, but {{received}} no answer. He moved again to Buenos Aires, to make a similar request. He arrived to Mendoza {{a few days after}} the execution of the Chileans Luis and Juan José Carrera, brothers of José Miguel Carrera. The specific initiative of those executions is controversial. Chilean historian Vicuña Mackenna indicts San Martín, while J. C. Raffo de la Reta blames O'Higgins instead. Manuel Rodríguez was also imprisoned and then killed in prison; <b>this</b> <b>death</b> may have been decided by the Lautaro lodge. San Martín could not have taken part in it, as he was already on the way to Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|The orally {{lethal dose}} in humans has been {{reported}} as approximately 1.4 mL/kg of pure ethylene glycol. That is approximately 224 mL (7.6 oz.) of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 56 mL (2 oz.) for a 20kg child. Although survival with medical treatment has occurred with doses much higher than <b>this,</b> <b>death</b> has occurred with 30 mL of the concentrate in an adult. In the EU classification of dangerous substances it is 'harmful' (Xn) while more toxic substances are classified as 'toxic' (T) or 'very toxic' (T+). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency generally puts substances which are lethal at more than 30 g to adults in Toxicity Class III.|$|E

25|$|A major {{emphasis}} of Evangelical Protestantism were organised missions. In {{the eighteenth century}} the focus had been the Highlands and Islands. Missions also developed to fishermen and to the growing communities of the urban poor. The visit of American Evangelists Moody and Sankey in 1874-75 revitalised the Evangelical mission. David Livingstone became the most foreign missionary and after <b>this</b> <b>death,</b> Scottish missionary efforts were also fuelled by the rivalry between different denominations in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|According to Eliade, one of {{the most}} common shamanistic themes is the shaman's {{supposed}} death and resurrection. This occurs in particular during his initiation. Often, the procedure is supposed to be performed by spirits who dismember the shaman and strip the flesh from his bones, then put him back together and revive him. In more than one way, <b>this</b> <b>death</b> and resurrection represents the shaman's elevation above human nature.|$|E

25|$|Fleeing {{before the}} {{advancing}} Red Army, {{large numbers of}} {{the inhabitants of the}} German provinces of East Prussia, Silesia, and Pomerania died during the evacuations, some from cold and starvation, some during combat operations.

25|$|Virtual {{population}} analysis (VPA) is a cohort modeling technique {{commonly used in}} fisheries science for reconstructing historical fish numbers at age using information on death of individuals each year. <b>This</b> <b>death</b> is usually partitioned into catch by fisheries and natural mortality. VPA is virtual {{in the sense that}} the population size is not observed or measured directly but is inferred or back-calculated to have been a certain size in the past in order to support the observed fish catches and an assumed death rate owing to non-fishery related causes.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>death</b> {{penalty was}} also set for conduct that placed another {{in danger of}} death.

25|$|The {{maternal}} death figure for Madagascar {{is lower than}} average in Sub-Saharan Africa, at a total of 498 deaths per 100,000 live births. <b>This</b> <b>death</b> rate remained stable between 2000 and 2009. This figure has been influenced by numerous factors. Although 86 percent receive pre-natal checkups, 49 {{percent of them are}} not told if there are complications. Approximately 46 percent of new mothers receive fewer than four post-natal care sessions. Most women give birth outside of health centres, and the number of those who had assistance in giving birth is decreasing; according to Sharp and Kruse, 35 percent of Malagasy women who give birth outside of health centres do not receive medical care. Abortions due to unwanted pregnancies are also a major contributor.|$|E
