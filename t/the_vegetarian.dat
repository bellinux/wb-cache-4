The Mahaprasad consists of dried rice mixed with grated coconut, cheese, curd and butter.

5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. <b>The</b> <b>vegetarian</b> Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E
5|$|In all versions, Khandoba {{returns to}} Jejuri {{with his new}} wife and faces the wrath of Mhalsa. Many songs tell about the {{confrontations}} of Mhalsa and Banai. In some songs, Mhalsa complains about Khandoba's infatuation with the impure Banai. The cantankerous Mhalsa grumbles how Banai has polluted the house by her uncouth ways and suggests that Banai {{should be returned to}} the wilderness again. The songs sing how <b>the</b> <b>vegetarian,</b> high-caste Mhalsa is forced to catch fish and eat in the same plate as the non-vegetarian low-caste Banai. Mhalsa is portrayed blaming Banai for the problems in the palace and talking about her superiority to Banai. Banai retorts by saying that Khandoba came to her, mesmerized by her beauty and became her servant. A frustrated Khandoba leaves the palace on a hunting trip after Mhalsa and Banai quarrel about who will embroider a shawl for him and marries Rambhai. The songs also narrate how ultimately the wives have to remain in harmony and aid each other. For example, a song sings how Mhalsa and Banai come together and celebrate the festival of Diwali with Khandoba at Jejuri.|$|E
5|$|The {{only time}} in the year when {{separate}} food is cooked for the goddess is when she is offered non-vegetarian offerings. During Durga Puja, Vimala is offered non-vegetarian food and animal sacrifice, traditionally offered to the Hindu Mother Goddess. The goddess is considered to assume a destructive form during the festival and the meat is considered necessary to placate her. In strict secrecy during the pre-dawn hours, animal sacrifice of a he-goat is offered in the temple, while fish from the sacred Markanda temple tank are cooked and offered to Vimala, as per Tantric rituals. The rituals have to be completed before {{the doors of the}} main sanctum of <b>the</b> <b>vegetarian</b> Jagannath are opened at dawn and the first morning aarti is offered to the god. Vaishnava devotees of Jagannath are debarred from the temple. Only a few who witness the ceremony are given the Bimala parusa (Vimala's cuisine) as prasad. The animal sacrifice and the non-vegetarian offerings to Vimala produced protests.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Dietary intakes oftwo {{groups of}} vegetarians (ofAsian Indian and of Amen-can origin) {{residing}} in the United States were compared with intakes ofa group of nonvegetari-ans. Mineral intakes and balances were determined for all three groups for a 7 -d period. <b>The</b> <b>vegetarians</b> had a significantly higher percent of energy intake from carbohydrate and signifi-cantly higher intakes ofcrude fiber (CF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) than did the non-vegetarians. <b>The</b> American <b>vegetarians</b> had significantly higher intakes of magnesium, iron, and copper than did the other groups. Manganese intakes were significantly higher for <b>the</b> two <b>vegetarian</b> groups than for the nonvegetarians. Calcium, iron, zinc, and copper balances {{were not significantly different}} among the groups. Magnesium and manganese balances were sig-nificantly more negative for <b>the</b> American <b>vegetarians</b> than for <b>the</b> other two groups. In general, the higher percent of carbohydrate intake or the higher level of fiber intake did not appear to affect mineral utilization by <b>the</b> <b>vegetarians.</b> Am J C/in Nuir l 988; 48 : 875 - 9.

25|$|An {{article in}} the society's magazine, <b>the</b> <b>Vegetarian</b> Messenger, in 1851 {{discussed}} alternatives to shoe leather, which suggests the presence of vegans within the membership who rejected animal use entirely, not only in diet. The first known vegan cookbook, Rupert H. Wheldon's No Animal Food: Two Essays and 100 Recipes, was published in London in 1910. The consumption of milk and eggs became a battleground over the following decades. There were regular discussions about it in <b>the</b> <b>Vegetarian</b> Messenger; it appears from the correspondence pages that many opponents of veganism came from within <b>the</b> <b>vegetarian</b> community.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{vegetarian}} diet on oral health status could be manifold, but reports have so far mainly appeared from within Western populations. This study reports the oral health status of southeast Indian vegetarians, obtained {{by means of a}} questionnaire, clinical examination, and study cast evaluations. The material comprised 30 vegetarians and 25 sex- and age-matched non-vegetarian controls. Comparison between the samples included dietary and oral hygiene habits, health-related variables, caries prevalence, and dentoalveolar characteristics. The questionnaire showed significantly less consumption of between-meal sweets and more widespread use of a soft toothbrush by <b>the</b> <b>vegetarians.</b> <b>The</b> <b>vegetarians</b> had a significantly higher degree of tooth wear than the non-vegetarians, but no difference in the degree of wear between women and men in either group was found. <b>The</b> <b>vegetarians</b> had a significantly higher tendency towards crowding in the maxillary arch, numerically higher DMFT, and greater number of cervical buccal defects than the controls. The {{results of this study suggest}} that <b>the</b> Indian <b>vegetarian</b> diet may produce certain effects on the oral health, associations that need to be studied further.

In May 2016, it won the 2016 Man Booker International Prize. <b>The</b> <b>Vegetarian</b> thus became the first recipient of the award after its reconfiguration in 2015, prior to which it was awarded to an author's body of work rather than a single novel.
