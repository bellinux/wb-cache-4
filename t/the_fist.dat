5|$|All Souls {{suffered}} from low viewership, and {{was placed on}} hiatus following the broadcast of <b>the</b> <b>fist</b> two episodes.

Additionally 32TEN provided several practical elements for ILM’s compositing team including dust clouds, breaking glass and water effects.|$|E

The line {{bisecting}} the shield horizontally symbolises the River Mersey running through Trafford {{from east to west}} and the canals in the borough. The white legs of a lion on a red background represent the parts of Trafford previously controlled by the De Massey family, while the red body and head of an eagle on a white background represents the areas of Trafford previously controlled by the De Traffords. Both elements were taken from the coats of arms of the respective families. <b>The</b> <b>fist</b> holding bolts of lightning represents Stretford and the electrical industry; the cog on the arm represents Altrincham's engineering industry. The unicorns stand for Sale and Altrincham. The oak branches represent Urmston and the rural areas of Trafford.|$|E

25|$|The show parodies {{many things}} about popular culture, {{primarily}} being a spoof of {{shows such as}} Jackass; whereas they perform stunts designed to injure and/or humiliate an individual, <b>the</b> <b>Fist</b> team do things that would obviously kill them. Such as jumping off cliffs, being hit by trucks, getting shot in the head, etc. These dangerous stunts and outlandish actions are usually achieved {{with the use of}} computer generated imagery. Indeed, one of the most innovative and noteworthy features of Double <b>the</b> <b>Fist</b> is its extensive and imaginative use of CGI, especially considering that the programme was produced for a very low budget, even by Australian standards ($250,000 for all 8 episodes).|$|E
