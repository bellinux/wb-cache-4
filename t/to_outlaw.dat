5|$|Beach Thomas {{was opposed}} {{to the use of}} the toothed steel trap for {{catching}} rabbits, supporting the RSPCA in its efforts <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> the device and noting that it both inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} and joined with the majority at the convention in voting <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> slavery and disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War. In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} Republic, {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} aristocracy to limit the increasing level of chaos associated with the obstructive tendencies and democratic impulses of some of the senators. Laws were enacted to prevent the inclusion of extraneous material in bills before the Senate. Other laws were enacted <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> the so-called omnibus bills, which are bills, usually enacted by a single vote, that contain a large volume of often unrelated material.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} Ottoman authority, Murat II appointed native Albanians like Jakub Muzaka and Skanderbeg to high positions within the sanjak of Albania. The nobles who accepted Ottoman overlordship were granted their pre-Ottoman holdings and border estates {{as well as}} a degree of autonomy, while others were exiled or continued warring. In 1436–37, rebels were active in the regions of Gjirokastër and Vlorë and Teodor Korona Muzaka led a revolt in the region of Berat. As many rebels used Venetian territories like Shkodër and Parga as bases to launch raids into Ottoman territory, representatives of Mehmed II asked the Venetians <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> their activity in October 1436.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after the Dade County vote, Fort Lauderdale, Gainesville, and Palm Beach, Florida, and Austin, Texas, all {{rejected}} ordinances <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> discrimination based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development overturned its own rules they had set {{earlier in the year}} to allow unmarried and same-sex couples federally financed housing. Newsweek reported that a county government employee who had worked in her position for 15years had been fired. An openly gay aide to future U.S. senator Paula Hawkins had also been dismissed. Despite the success of the Dade County campaign, activists worked quietly in liberal towns of Aspen, Colorado, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, Iowa City, Iowa, Wichita, Kansas, and the very liberal Eugene, Oregon to pass gay rights ordinances.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February 1793, another vote {{to abolish}} the slave trade was {{narrowly}} defeated by eight votes. The outbreak of war with France the same month effectively prevented any further serious consideration of the issue, as politicians concentrated on the national crisis {{and the threat of}} invasion. The same year, and again in 1794, Wilberforce unsuccessfully brought before Parliament a bill <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> British ships from supplying slaves to foreign colonies. He voiced his concern about the war and urged Pitt and his government to make greater efforts to end hostilities. Growing more alarmed, on 31 December 1794, Wilberforce moved that the government seek a peaceful resolution with France, a stance that created a temporary breach in his long friendship with Pitt.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{between the}} factions were {{inflamed}} {{almost as soon}} as the 1924 legislature convened. A bill <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> parimutuel betting in the state passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate. The next legislative battle centered on removing the head of the Board of Charities and Corrections and give the governor greater control over the board's makeup; this attempt also narrowly failed. When Senator Stanley, an opponent of prohibition, sought re-election to the Senate in 1924, Fields and his allies did not support him, leading to the election of Republican Frederick M. Sackett and giving the Republicans both of the state's senate seats {{for the first time in}} history.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} and senator J. C. W. Beckham to challenge Sampson. The primary {{issue in the}} campaign was whether <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> parimutuel betting at the state's racetracks. Beckham favored the ban, while Sampson opposed it. A political machine known as the Jockey Club backed Sampson, and several key Democrats bolted the party after Beckham's nomination. Sampson won the governorship by over 32,000 votes, but every other Republican on the ticket lost by small majorities. The results suggested that some carefully coordinated vote swapping had occurred to ensure Beckham's defeat, but none was ever proven.|$|E
5|$|The federal {{government}} took direct {{aim at the}} U.S. Communist party in 1948 when it indicted its top twelve leaders in the Foley Square trial. The case hinged {{on whether or not}} mere membership in a totalitarian political party was sufficient to conclude that members advocated the overthrow of the United States government. The ACLU chose to not represent any of the defendants, and they were all found guilty and sentenced to three to five years in prison. Their defense attorneys were all cited for contempt, went to prison and were disbarred. When the government indicted additional party members, the defendants could not find attorneys to represent them. Communists protested outside the courthouse; a bill <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> picketing of courthouses was introduced in Congress, and the ACLU supported the anti-picketing law.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he could}} not {{convince}} Congress <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> the spoils system, Hayes issued an executive order that forbade federal office holders from being required to make campaign contributions or otherwise taking part in party politics. Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port of New York, and his subordinates Alonzo B. Cornell and George H. Sharpe, all Conkling supporters, refused to obey the president's order. In September 1877, Hayes demanded the three men's resignations, which they refused to give. He submitted appointments of Theodore Roosevelt, Sr., L. Bradford Prince, and Edwin Merritt—all supporters of Evarts, Conkling's New York rival—to the Senate for confirmation as their replacements. The Senate's Commerce Committee, which Conkling chaired, voted unanimously to reject the nominees, and the full Senate rejected Roosevelt and Prince {{by a vote of}} 31–25, confirming Merritt only because Sharpe's term had expired.|$|E

5000|$|Cain's {{position}} on abortion {{has been the subject}} of some controversy. In interviews with Piers Morgan and John Stossel, Cain stated that he was [...] "pro-life from conception", that it was not the government's role to make decisions about abortion, and in the interview with Stossel that [...] "abortion should not be legal". His seemingly contradictory statements alarmed pro-life activists and other social conservatives, who accused Cain of echoing pro-choice reasoning and questioned his dedication <b>to</b> <b>outlawing</b> abortion. Cain sought to address these concerns by emphasizing his commitment <b>to</b> <b>outlawing</b> abortion and <b>to</b> de-funding Planned Parenthood. He argued that some of his comments had been taken out of context and described himself as [...] "100% pro-life. End of story." [...] The Washington Post described Cain's positions on abortion as inconsistent, but noted that his initial position [...] "actually sounds vaguely pro-choice".|$|R
5|$|The final was {{postponed}} from its scheduled start on Monday at 4p.m. until Thursday, 19 July, at 3:30p.m. because of rain. On Thursday {{it was still}} showery, causing the final to be further delayed by an hour. It began on a dead and slippery court in front of about 200 spectators. There was a temporary three-plank stand {{on one side of}} the court offering seating to about thirty people. Marshall won the toss, elected to serve first and was immediately broken by Gore. After the first set was won by Gore, it started to rain for a quarter of an hour; this further softened the ground and affected the quality of play. The final lasted 48 minutes, and Spencer Gore won the inaugural championship against William Marshall in three straight sets of 15, 13, and 20 minutes respectively. En route to the title Gore had won 15 sets and lost two and won 99 games for the loss of 46. Gore, the volley specialist, had beaten the baseline player, at a time when volleying was considered by some to be unsporting. Some tried <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> the volley and a discussion on its merits took place in The Field for weeks after the tournament.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there were}} {{attempts}} {{to bridge the}} differences between North and South, ultimately Lincoln's victory prompted seven southern slave states to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America before he moved into the White House. The Confederate attack on Fort Sumter inspired the North to rally behind the Union. As {{the leader of the}} moderate faction of the Republican Party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp, anti-war Democrats (called Copperheads), who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by carefully planned political patronage, and by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory. His Gettysburg Address became an iconic endorsement of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. He suspended habeas corpus, leading to the controversial ex parte Merryman decision, and he averted potential British intervention by defusing the Trent Affair. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of generals, including his most successful general, Ulysses S. Grant. He made major decisions on Union war strategy, including a naval blockade that shut down the South's trade. As the war progressed, his complex moves toward ending slavery included the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863; Lincoln used the U.S. Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraged the border states <b>to</b> <b>outlaw</b> slavery, and pushed through Congress the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which permanently outlawed slavery.|$|E
