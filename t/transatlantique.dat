5|$|The {{process was}} {{repeated}} for Cunard's North Atlantic shipping interests. They applied and were {{accepted into the}} Atlantic Container Line in December 1966, joining with the founding companies Wallenius Lines, Swedish American Line, Swedish Transatlantic Line and Holland America Line. Cunard joined {{at the same time}} as Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique</b> (French Line). Cunard inherited planning work and ship designs when they joined with Atlantic Container Line group, and as part of their application to join, Cunard would build two ships for the ACL fleet, the SS Atlantic Causeway and the SS Atlantic Conveyor. The SS Atlantic Conveyor would, in 1982, become the first British merchant ship to be lost to enemy action since World War II, after being requisitioned for use in the Falklands War.|$|E

25|$|In March 1885, Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique</b> (CGT), {{announced}} {{the building of}} four new steamers for the Le Havre–New York route at the company's Penhoët ship yard. The similarly sized steamers, , , La Bretagne, and , were built under a French government subsidy law that provided that the ships could be taken over {{in a time of}} war. CGT also announced that noted French designer Jules Allard would decorate the four ships.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, Empire Call {{was sold}} to the French government, who renamed her Ingénieur Général Haarbleicher and placed her {{under the control of}} the Ministère de la Marine Merchande.

25|$|A classic three-island style, {{general cargo}} steamship, Mont-Blanc was a tramp steamer, {{carrying}} diverse types of cargos around the world. The ship changed owners {{several times and}} was registered at first in Marseille, then Rouen and finally Saint-Nazaire, France. In World War I, Mont-Blanc was purchased from Gaston Petit on 28 December 1915 by the Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique</b> CGT (The French Line), the French state-owned corporation that had taken charge of much of France's wartime shipping.|$|E
25|$|Of the 35 Atlantic liners to {{hold the}} Blue Riband, 25 were British, {{followed}} by five German, three American, {{as well as one}} each from Italy and France. Thirteen were Cunarders (plus Queen Mary of Cunard White Star), 5 by White Star, with 4 owned by Norddeutscher Lloyd, 2 by Collins, 2 by Inman and 2 by Guion, and one each by British American, Great Western, Hamburg-America, the Italian Line, Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique</b> and finally the United States Lines.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} new ships appeared; the SS Manhattan and the SS Washington for United States Lines, and the SS Champlain and the SS Lafayette for the Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique.</b> Figures from 1937 show that in that year, Britannic carried 26,943 passengers; Georgic carried a few hundred more. However, Champlain {{achieved}} {{a greater number of}} passengers. The poor performance of Britannic was partially due to slightly damaged engines, identified on 4 January 1937 while the ship was leaving New York, and it was sent into a dry dock for repairs.|$|E

25|$|With the Great Western, Isambard Kingdom Brunel {{laid the}} {{foundations}} for new shipbuilding techniques. He realised that the carrying capacity of a ship increases as the cube of its dimensions, whilst the water resistance only increases as the square of its dimensions. This means that large ships are more fuel-efficient, something very important for long voyages across the Atlantic. Constructing large ships was therefore more profitable. Moreover, migration to the Americas increased enormously. These movements of population were a financial windfall for the shipping companies, {{some of the largest}} of which were founded during this time. Examples are the P of the United Kingdom in 1822 and the Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique</b> of France in 1855.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the U.S. banking magnate J.P. Morgan began to acquire a number of shipping companies, including the White Star Line, the Leyland Line, and the Red Star Line, to build a transatlantic monopoly. He succeeded in signing both HAPAG and NDL to an alliance, but was unable to acquire the British Cunard Line, and the French Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique</b> (CGT). HAPAG and NDL gave Morgan the largest U.S. rail company, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and so Morgan offered to divide the market. The Holland-America Line and the Red Star Line together divided a contract for the passengers of the four companies. Ruinous competition was prevented. In 1912, the Morgan Agreement was terminated.|$|E
25|$|Sydney Lasry {{built for}} the Compagnie Lasry, Oran, French Algeria. She was {{registered}} on 23 May 1920. She was completed in September 1920. Her port of registry was Oran, under the French flag and the Code Letters OUAG were allocated. Sydney Lasry was renamed Ariège in 1933. She was sold to the Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique</b> in December 1934. Her code letters were changed to FNUA in 1934. On 5 December 1934, Ariège was the first ship to enter port at Safi, Morocco. In March 1938, Ariège was sold to Société Anonyme de Gérance et d'Armement and renamed Cap Tafelneh. Her port of registry was changed to Dunkirk. In 1938, Cap Tafelneh's GRT was recorded as 2,299 and her NRT as 1,399.|$|E
50|$|Over the 1889-90 season Seymour toured America as {{a dancer}} with Professor Hermann's <b>Transatlantiques</b> Vaudevilles company. During the tour one American press release {{described}} Seymour as having hair that streamed down her shoulders like rivers of gold. and another declared Dainty Katie Seymour dances like a fairy or butterfly.

50|$|Princess's third charter {{ship was}} none other than Costa's Carla C. Originally, Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique's</b> SS Flandre, the ship had been {{purchased}} by Costa in the late 1960s and given a major rebuilding. Almost immediately after completion, the ship was chartered to Princess, and it was on board the ship, which was marketed as, but again not officially renamed, Princess Carla, that Jeraldine Saunders wrote the first chapters of her nonfiction book The Love Boats.|$|R
50|$|Seymour {{died of a}} renal affliction at {{a nursing}} home in the Maida Vale {{district}} of London on 7 September 1903. She had become ill while {{on a tour of}} South Africa with one of George Edwardes' theatrical companies. Seymour was survived by her husband, Harry Athol, a music hall comedian who {{had been a member of}} Professor Hermann's <b>Transatlantiques</b> Vaudevilles during her first American trip. Seymour's well attended funeral services were held at her residence on Burton Road, Brixton and were concluded at Lambeth Cemetery, Tooting.|$|R
25|$|At first, {{the idea}} of two 35,000-ton running mates was {{considered}} to replace Ile de France and Liberté. Charles de Gaulle (the future President of France) opined {{that it would be}} better for French national pride, then flagging due to the then ongoing Algerian War of Independence, to construct one grand ocean liner, in the tradition of the , as an ocean-going showcase for France. The idea of such a publicly funded liner was controversial, leading to raucous debates in the French parliament. The dealing lasted three and a half years, and though the letter commissioning the construction was finally signed by the Chairman of the Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique,</b> Jean Marie, on 25 July 1956, debate about the form, cost and construction schedule for the France lasted a further year.|$|E
25|$|At the {{conclusion}} of World War I, war reparations permanently assigned the eight seized ships to the nations that held them. Further, Königin Luise and Bremen, safely laid up in Germany during the war, {{were assigned to the}} UK. Apart from those two, only two other Barbarossa-class ships changed national registry after the war. Brazil sold Leopoldina (the ex-Blücher) to the French Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique</b> which operated her under the name Suffren. Pocahontas (the ex-Prinzess Irene) was laid up in Gibraltar after mechanical failures and was purchased by NDL in 1923. She became {{the only member of the}} Barbarossa class to resume sailing under the German flag. First renamed Bremen and later Karlsruhe (to free the name Bremen for a newer ship), she sailed primarily on the Bremen–New York route.|$|E
25|$|Richardson, Duck and Company of Thornaby-on-Tees built Farnworth {{was built}} for R.S. Dalgleish Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne and {{completed}} her in June 1917. She was allocated the United Kingdom Official Number 140672. Farnworth was used on routes serving {{the east and west}} coast of the United States, the Caribbean and West Indies. In 1924, she was sold to the Harlem Steamship Co Ltd, Newcastle upon Tyne and was renamed Illinois. She was initially operated under the management of F Newson. Later in 1924, management was transferred to Brown, Jenkinson & Co Ltd. In 1926 she was transferred to Compagnie Générale <b>Transatlantique.</b> Her port of registry was Le Havre and the Code Letters OTRW were allocated. On 17 March 1932, Illinois was laid up at Roscanvel. In 1934, Illinois was sold to Kulukundis Shipping Co, Piraeus, Greece and renamed Mount Pentelikon. She was placed under the management of Rethymnis & Kulukundis Ltd. Her port of registry was changed to Piraeus and the Code Letters SVAV were allocated.|$|E
50|$|Banque <b>Transatlantique’s</b> {{relationships}} with its clients evolved {{dramatically in the}} 1980s to better address their needs in an increasingly complicated and globalized financial system. The crises resulting from the Yom Kippur War (1973) and the Iranian Revolution (1979) were beginning to abate as the organization of international monetary policy began to shift because of the dollar’s decline as a concerted effort on the parts of central banks in the United States, Japan, Germany, France, and Great Britain {{in addition to the}} decline in the price of crude oil because oil producing countries ceased augmenting the price.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first public}} {{performance}} of his work ("Episodes for piano solo") took place just after the uprising of May '68 at the [...] "Latin America Hall" [...] in Paris, receiving favourable reviews. After that, his music was often performed {{and he had his}} first commissions (by French Radio and TV, the Ars Nova Orchestra and the Dance Group of Vitry). After that period, several of his works are performed in renowned international contemporary music festivals (Royan, Reims, Bordeaux and Paris); at the same time, he works on a regular basis with the contemporary dance group of Vitry and the choreographer Michel Cazerta. A portion of his Paris works were published by Editions <b>Transatlantiques,</b> and it was in Paris in 1974 that he released for the first time one of his works on record: Four-channel electro-acoustic music for the [...] "Ballet Smog", one of the first pieces written for four-channel tape in the world. In Greece, he made his debut as a composer at the 4th Hellenic Week of Contemporary Music (Athens, 19-26 September 1971) with his work [...] "Docimology".|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to study the {{professional}} relationship between French American Studies specialists with their American colleagues and to analyze the specific contributions they, along with many other non-Americans, make to the field. As outsiders the French may have to overcome a geographic and cultural handicap but they also provide their American colleagues with fresh view-points and angles to tackle the many facets of American life. The relationship between insiders and outsiders is often central to a mutual widening of perceptions. America itself is made up of a collection of outsider groups, and the marginalized and forgotten within American society are in a similar position vis-à-vis mainstream society as foreign analysts are in relation to America. Their perceptions of America enrich the whole culture of the United States which, probably more than other countries, has a "common culture that is multicultural. " Foreign observers, who work with Americans and in American institutions, often prove to be a boon to Americans themselves who might be too immersed in their cultural milieu to perceive what they take for granted. In the same way as Americanists the world over obviously benefit from the work of their American counterparts, the field of American Studies can only be enriched by transnational observation and cooperation.
