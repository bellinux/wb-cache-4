5|$|By July 1789, revolutionary {{sentiment}} {{was rising}} in Paris. The Estates-General was convened in May {{and members of}} the Third Estate proclaimed <b>the</b> <b>Tennis</b> <b>Court</b> Oath in June, calling for the king to grant a written constitution. Violence between loyal royal forces, mutinous members of the royal Gardes Françaises and local crowds broke out at Vendôme on 12 July, leading to widespread fighting and the withdrawal of royal forces from the centre of Paris. Revolutionary crowds began to arm themselves during 13 July, looting royal stores, gunsmiths and armourers' shops for weapons and gunpowder.|$|E

Portions leased at the west end included the land between St James's Palace and <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court</b> at the corner of St James's Street, and a parcel of land leased to the Duchess of Cleveland that became the site of 8–12 Cleveland Row and Stornoway House.

25|$|The electors had {{originally}} chosen {{the members of}} the Estates-General to serve for a single year. However, by the terms of <b>the</b> <b>Tennis</b> <b>Court</b> Oath, the communes had bound themselves to meet continuously until France had a constitution.

25|$|At age eight, Nadal won an under-12 {{regional}} tennis {{championship at}} a time when he was also a promising football player. This made Toni Nadal intensify training, and at that time he encouraged Nadal to play left-handed for a natural advantage on <b>the</b> <b>tennis</b> <b>court,</b> as he noticed Nadal played forehand shots with two hands. This may be due to the fact he is ambidextrous, playing tennis with his left hand, and writing with his right.|$|E

25|$|The {{death of}} the Dauphin on 4 June, which deeply {{affected}} his parents, was virtually ignored by the French people, who were instead preparing for the next meeting of the Estates General and hoping for a resolution to the bread crisis. As the Third Estate declared itself a National Assembly and took <b>the</b> <b>Tennis</b> <b>Court</b> Oath, and as people either spread or believed rumors that the queen wished to bathe in their blood, Marie Antoinette went into mourning for her eldest son. Her role was decisive in urging the king to remain firm and not concede to popular demands for reforms. In addition, she showed her determination {{to use force to}} crush the forthcoming revolution.|$|E
25|$|The French Revolution {{began in}} 1789 with the {{convocation}} of the Estates-General in May. The {{first year of}} the Revolution witnessed members of the Third Estate proclaiming <b>the</b> <b>Tennis</b> <b>Court</b> Oath in June, the Storming of the Bastille in July. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the Abolition of feudalism in France on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and privileges and restrictions, and the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August. Jefferson, the American ambassador to France, was consulted in its drafting and there are striking similarities with the American Declaration of Independence.|$|E
