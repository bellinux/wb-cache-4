THE FOLLOWING TESTS WERE APPLIED: 1. PLATELET COUNT. 2. BLEEDING TIME (MIELKE ET AL 1969). 3. PLATELET ADHESIVENESS TEST (SALZMAN'S METHOD, MODIFIED). 4. PLATELET AGGREGATION BY ADP, COLLAGEN AND ADRENALINE. 5. "ADP RELEASE" FROM PLATELETS BY COLLAGEN.

5|$|Modern scholar Peter Davies surmises that Eusebius is {{referring}} to the same event as Lactantius, but that he heard of the event through public rumors and knew nothing of the privileged discussion at the emperor's private religion ceremony that Lactantius had access to. Since it was Galerius's army {{that would have been}} purgedDiocletian had left his in Egypt to quell continuing unrestAntiochenes would understandably have believed Galerius to be its instigator. The historian David Woods argues instead that Eusebius and Lactantius are referring to completely different events. Eusebius, according to Woods, describes <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army purge in Palestine, while Lactantius describes events at court. Woods asserts that the relevant passage in Eusebius's Chronicon was corrupted in the translation to Latin and that Eusebius's text originally located <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> army persecution at a fort in Betthorus (El-Lejjun, Jordan).|$|E

5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> swelling scene, before {{the decision was made}} to do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give the impression that her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of {{earthquakes}} constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes {{in the development of}} the earthquake swarm. Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the two events.|$|E

5|$|Literature {{in early}} modern Scotland is {{literature}} written in Scotland or by Scottish writers between the Renaissance {{in the early}} sixteenth century and <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution in mid-eighteenth century. By {{the beginning of this}} era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands, but the tradition of Classic Gaelic Poetry survived. Middle Scots became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. The establishment of a printing press in 1507 made it easier to disseminate Scottish literature and was probably aimed at bolstering Scottish national identity.|$|E

5|$|The First Fleet {{brought the}} initial {{population}} of 70 sheep from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia in 1788. The next shipment was of 30 sheep from Calcutta and Ireland in 1793. All {{of the early}} sheep brought to Australia were exclusively used for the dietary needs of the penal colonies. <b>The</b> <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Australian wool industry were due {{to the efforts of}} Captain John Macarthur.

Today, Macarthur is generally thought of as the father of the Australian sheep industry.|$|E
