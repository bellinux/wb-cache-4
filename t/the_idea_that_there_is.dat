Along with highlighting the struggles of blue-collar America, the lyrics portray <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> hope even when things appear to be bleak and that giving up is not an option. While there are Christian themes throughout the songs, neither Christian nor secular reviewers found them to be preachy.|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents {{the reader with}} a choice between two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E

Several presidents of the Society for Psychical Research had been fellows of Trinity, and the Perrott-Warrick Fund, set up in Trinity in 1937 to fund parapsychology research, is still administered by the college. He continued to explore <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> intelligence in nature, particularly after reading Fritjof Capra's The Tao of Physics (1975), and in 1979 took up a more advanced form of TM, known as the TM-Sidhi program. According to Anderson, the TM movement produced a poster showing Josephson levitating several inches above the floor. Josephson argued that meditation could lead to mystical and scientific insights, and that, as a result of it, he had come to believe in a creator.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading {{and that we should}} use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{much of the}} 1980s, Unger {{worked on}} his magnum opus, , a three volume work that {{assessed}} classical social theory and developed a political, social, and economic alternative. The series {{is based on the}} premise of society as an artifact, and rejects the necessity of certain institutional arrangements. Published in 1987, Politics was foremost a critique of contemporary social theory and politics; it developed a theory of structural and ideological change, and gave an alternative account of world history. By first attacking <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a necessary progression from one set of institutional arrangements to another, e.g. feudalism to capitalism, it then built an anti-necessitarian theory of social change, theorizing the transition from one set of institutional arrangements to another.|$|E
25|$|The Hymns to the Night {{display a}} {{universal}} religion with an intermediary. This concept {{is based on}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> always a third party between a human and God. This intermediary can either be Jesus – as in Christian lore – or the dead beloved as in the hymns. These works consist of three times two hymns. These three components are each structured in this way: the first hymn shows, {{with the help of}} the Romantic triad, the development from an assumed happy life on earth through a painful era of alienation to salvation in the eternal night; the following hymn tells of the awakening from this vision and the longing for a return to it. With each pair of hymns, a higher level of experience and knowledge is shown.|$|E
25|$|Late {{learners}} of L2 perform worse on grammaticality judgment tasks or tests than native speakers {{or early}} acquirers, in that L2 learners {{are more likely}} to accept a sentence that is ungrammatical as grammatical. After the critical period, age of acquisition is no longer supposed to have an effect, and native-like performance is no longer supposed to be achievable. However, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a critical period for the acquisition of syntactic competence, which is reflected by the ability to assess the well-formedness of a sentence, is controversial. On one view, biological or language-specific mechanisms become non-functional after a certain age. On another view, decreased L2 learning ability with age is not inevitable, and can be explained by factors such as motivation, learning environment, pressure, and time commitment. Although there is evidence that supports the claim that speakers outside the L2 mastery age range are not capable of acquiring native-like mastery of a language, there is also evidence supporting the opposite, as well as evidence for young learners not mastering an L2.|$|E

40|$|In her {{new book}} Gillian Russell puts forth a novel defense of the analytic/synthetic distinction. During {{the first couple of}} decades {{following}} Quine's Two Dogmas of Empiricism (1951) analyticity fell into disrepute. Once Kripke allowed us to separate analyticity from necessity the case appeared closed: With Kripke's help it seemed as if we could get all the modal results we wanted without having to fall back on <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are certain truths that are 'true in virtue of meaning alone'. More recently, however, analyticity has undergone something of a renaissance. In particular, {{it has been suggested that}} although Quine was right to question <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are truths in virtue of meaning, he was wrong to give up <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are certain truths that have special epistemic properties, i. e. that can be known a priori (Boghossian 1996). In her defense of analyticity Russell takes the opposite line: She suggests that Quine was right to give up <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are analytic truths in the sense of being a priori knowable, but wrong to reject <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> certain truths are true in virtue of meaning. Russell's book is impressive and richly argued. A central thesis is that we need to bring the debate on analyticity up to date and leave behind the simpler conception o...|$|R

25|$|However, most {{contemporary}} authors credit Daniel Khazzoom for the re-emergence of the rebound {{effect in the}} research literature. Although Khazzoom {{did not use the}} term, he raised <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a less than one-to-one correlation between gains in energy efficiency and reductions in energy use, because of a change in the 'price content' of energy in the provision of the final consumer product. His study was based on energy efficiency gains in home appliances, but the principle applies throughout the economy. A commonly studied example is that of a more fuel-efficient car. As each kilometre of travel becomes cheaper, there will be an increase in driving speed and/or kilometres driven, as long as the price elasticity of demand for car travel is not zero. Other examples might include the growth in garden lighting after the introduction of energy-saving compact fluorescent lamps or the increasing size of houses driven partly by higher fuel efficiency in home heating technologies. If the rebound effect is larger than 100%, all gains from the increased fuel efficiency would be wiped out by increases in demand (the Jevons paradox).|$|E
