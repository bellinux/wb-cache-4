40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1994 Computer virus {{programs}} are generally {{perceived to be}} a threat to the information stored by computer users. This research evaluated the impact computer viruses have on information stored by computer users. The emphasis was on the effects of computer viruses rather than on the detail of their operation. The main hypotheses involved {{the question of whether or}} not computer viruses do pose a threat to the information stored by computer users. The effect of computer viruses on the information of users in industry was measured by sending a questionnaire to 388 companies country-wide. &~ average of 2 l, 5 % of the respondents claimed detrimental effects to information stored on disk due to computer viruses. This and other data was used to guide laboratory experiments on the actual damage done by computer viruses to stored information. A set of test disks was prepared to represent programs and data of a typical PC user in industry. Fifteen different virus programs were used individually to infect the test disks. After each infection, all the test disks were inspected <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>damage</b> to data, system and program files as well as to separate disk sectors. The research established that: The damage done by computer viruses to stored information is generally limited to one file or disk area. Where damage to stored information did occur, it was often reversible. Irrational user responses to virus symptoms provide a large potential source for damage to stored information. The availability of master program disks (for program file restoration) and recent, validated data backup is essential to recovery from a computer virus infection. A user can solve most problems caused by virus infections if he has a basic understanding of disk structure, i. e. tracks, sectors, sides, the FAT, etc, and of the use of disk utility programs like Norton Utilities or PCTools. The fact that some of the findings of prominent virus researchers could not be verified, suggests that virus programs could be unstable. Claims regarding the damage inflicted by viruses must be considered to be valid only for a specific copy of the virus under discussion. The importance of using original application software (to minimize the transfer of viruses and to enable program file restoration), regular back-ups (to enable data file restoration) and basic user awareness (infection prevention, symptoms, the use of anti-viral and utility programs, etc.) was emphasized. The average PC user should be able to clear up a virus infection without assistance by following the given disinfection procedure. Suggestions for further study include virus origins, generations, mutations, multiple infections, and the effect of viruses on computer networks...|$|E

40|$|The {{movement}} and deformation of the overlying strata and surface induced by underground mining are processes involving {{temporal and spatial}} changes, which, in turn, cause damage to buildings. Estimating the dynamic ground {{movement and}} deformation is important <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> the <b>damage</b> degree of buildings. To predict the dynamic ground subsidence caused by underground coal mining and protect ground buildings from dynamic damage, a dynamic prediction model was established to calculate ground deformation. A derivation of the dynamic subsidence prediction model based on Knothe’s dynamic subsidence hypothesis and Litwiniszyn's stochastic medium theory was proposed under the conditions of constant advancing speed mining and post-mining. The composition and significance of the dynamic model were analyzed and provided a basis for calculating the dynamics and programming implementation. Through case studies, the dynamic prediction model was verified and the expected results were obtained during mining and post-mining. Results showed the dynamic prediction model is fit for the normal geological condition of mining but is limited for the special geological condition, that is, thick loose layer and thick bedrock. The study can meet the demand of protecting ground buildings from deformation caused by underground mining. The proposed model solves the time issue in mining subsidence prediction...|$|R

In this case, there may be a wide range of normal conditions, and it is clearly undesirable to signal damage simply because of a change in the environment.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction. Vibroacoustic disease (VAD) is the whole-body {{pathology}} {{caused by}} excessive exposure to LFN. For the past 25 years, {{it has been}} know that low frequency noise (LFN, < 500 Hz, including infrasound) targets the respiratory system. In LFN-exposed rodents, the morphological changes of respiratory tract tissue partially explained some respiratory symptoms reported by VAD patients. However, many questions remain unanswered. Recently, some volunteer VAD patients underwent bronchoscopy in order <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> possible <b>damage</b> that could be associated with their respiratory complaints. Methods. Fourteen fully-informed and volunteer VAD patients were submitted to bronchoscopy, and biopsies were removed for analysis. Results. All patients exhibited small submucosal vascular-like lesions near the spurs, consisting of increased collagen and elastin fibres. Histology disclosed cilliary abnormalities, basal membrane hyperplasia, and thickening of vessel walls. In five patients, collagen bundles appeared degenerative and disrupted. No inflammatory process was ever identified, and no differences were seen between smokers and non-smo-kers. Discussion. Data is in accordance with what was observed in LFN-exposed animal models and also in 8 VAD patients who developed lung tumours. Collagen disruption and degeneration was also observed in electron microscopy images of the respiratory tract of LFN-exposed rodents. Thickened blood and lymphatic vessel walls have been consistently seen in images of VAD patients and of LFN-exposed rodents. During bronchoscopy performed by other reasons, this sort of structural aspects is not frequently seen. Taken together, it is strongly suggested that these findings could be VAD-specific.
