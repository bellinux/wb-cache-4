25|$|Romney {{generally}} opposes federal {{financial aid}} {{for college and}} other post-secondary education. While campaigning for the presidency in 2012, he argued that students should not expect government handouts to fund their education. In response to {{a high school senior}} who had asked what kind of college tuition assistance Romney would seek to provide as president, Romney replied, “I know that it would be popular for me {{to stand up and say}} I’m going to give you government money to make sure you pay for your college. But I’m not going to promise that. What I’m going to <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> shop around, get a good price.... Don’t take on too much debt, and don’t expect the government to forgive the debt that you take on. Recognize that you’re going to have to pay it back.” He similarly told a law student who had asked what kind of federal assistance might be available in a Romney presidency for graduate students struggling to repay education loans: “I wish I could tell you that there’s a place to find really cheap money or free money and we could pay for everyone’s education. That’s just not going to happen.” He encouraged young people to be entrepreneurially-minded and to take risks, even to consider borrowing money from their parents if necessary to further their careers.|$|E
500|$|On May 14, {{the day of}} the {{scheduled}} vote on Thorne-Begland's appointment, Republican Governor Bob McDonnell stated that the candidate's sexuality should not be an issue: [...] "All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> what I've always said about judges, and that is that these ought to be merit-based selections solely based on a person's skill, ability, fairness, judicial temperament". Thorne-Begland also attempted to address concerns by pledging to [...] "neutrally apply the laws" [...] and avoid political advocacy.|$|E

He then commented on the irony of his [...] "last lecture" [...] in a series that used to be the [...] "Last Lecture" [...] series, but was renamed [...] "Journeys": [...] "It's wonderful to be here. What Indira didn’t <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> that this lecture series used to be called the 'Last Lecture'. If you had one last lecture to give before you died, what would it be? I thought, damn, I finally nailed the venue and they renamed it." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{most recent}} {{meeting between the}} two clubs was in the FA Cup semi-finals; the tie was decided by a replay as the initial game {{finished}} goalless. The match was settled in extra time when Giggs {{ran the length of}} the pitch and evaded several Arsenal players to score the winning goal. In the close season, Anelka was involved in a protracted transfer saga and vowed to never play for Arsenal again. He cited the media in England as a reason for wanting to leave the club: [...] "The one thing I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> that I can't stand the English Press, who cause me enormous problems on a personal level," [...] but it was implied that his [...] "gold-digging brothers" [...] wanted Anelka to move abroad to make more money – they served as his agents.|$|E
500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> that the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
500|$|The {{fruit body}} of Lactifluus volemus has a fleshy and firm cap with a velvety or smooth surface and a shape that changes with maturity: it starts off convex, with edges curved inwards, then later grows flat with a {{depression}} in the middle. With a typical diameter of 5 to 11cm (2–in), its colour ranges from apricot to tawny. The cap colouration, however, is somewhat variable, as has been noted in Asian, European, and North American specimens. The stem, whose height varies between 4 and 12cm ( [...] and 5in), and which is typically between [...] thick, has a slightly lighter colouration than the cap. It is firm, with a velvety or smooth surface that sometimes has depressions running longitudinally up and down its length. The gills are adnate to slightly decurrent, brittle, narrow, quite closely spaced and sometimes forked. Normally a pale golden yellow colour, the gills turn brown when bruised. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae, short gills that do not extend to the stem. The flesh is whitish and firm. The mushroom smells somewhat fishy; one source suggests the odour is [...] "like a dead shad, which anglers will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> probably the most malodorous freshwater fish". The odour is concentrated when the fruit bodies are dried. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the abundant latex, so plentiful that a small nick on the gills will cause it to [...] "weep" [...] the milky substance. The latex tends to impart brown stains on whatever it contacts.|$|E

500|$|The Dhoom series {{began with}} the release of Dhoom in 2004. The film became a {{commercial}} box office hit and received generally positive reviews from audiences, but not so much from critics. As a result, producer Yash Chopra announced plans for a sequel, titled Dhoom 2: Back in Action. John Abraham, portrayer of Kabir Sharma, the villain of the predecessor, was eliminated from the sequel because Chopra did not want Dhoom 2 to repeat the stories featured in its predecessor. Instead, Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai were introduced into the franchise as the sequel's main villains. Aishwarya Rai's character was summarised as Catwoman, a female fictional comic book femme fatale or anti-hero [...] Rai stated, [...] "All I can <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>is</b> it would be nothing like anything you've seen me do before." [...] Producer Aditya Chopra told Rai to lose weight after she gained it for her role in 2004's Bride & Prejudice. Yash Chopra stated, [...] "But yes, the role does require Aishwarya to convey oodles of sensuality. She has asked {{for a couple of months}} to get into shape. We (at Yash Raj Films) are very clear about every character in every script and what's required of the actors. Before Dhoom, Esha Deol was specifically briefed about the look and the attitude she needed to cultivate. She readily agreed, and look at what Dhoom did to her career!" [...] Roshan also lost twelve pounds of weight at Aditya Chopra's request. With the exception of Abraham and Esha Deol, all of the other main actors in Dhoom were hired again for Dhoom 2.|$|E
