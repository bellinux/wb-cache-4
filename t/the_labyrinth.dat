5|$|As with A Wizard of Earthsea, The Tombs of Atuan is a bildungsroman or coming-of-age story, {{this time}} from the {{perspective}} of a female character, Tenar. Though she nominally has a position of high authority, Tenar feels trapped by her duties as priestess, and desires to escape to a place where she can make her own choices. In contrast to Ged, whose journey was chiefly a private quest, Tenar's choices have direct social consequences. While Ged's growth is traced through the various adventures he experiences in the first volume of the series, Tenar's development is shown through her exploration of her own domain. <b>The</b> <b>labyrinth,</b> in particular, with its twists and turns, is a metaphor for Tenar's exploration of her own thoughts. In this reading of the novel, <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> symbolizes the imprisonment of the women, and the darkness and unacknowledged thoughts within Tenar, which she begins to struggle through after feeling guilt over killing the prisoners sent to her.|$|E

5|$|The imprisoned {{architect}} Daedalus tells Kratos {{to unite}} <b>the</b> <b>Labyrinth.</b> Completing this task, Kratos fights {{his way through}} the aerial puzzle and rescues Pandora, who tells him to break the Chain of Balance so <b>the</b> <b>Labyrinth</b> can be raised, and she can reach her box. Neutralizing the three judges and breaking the chain, Kratos raises <b>the</b> <b>Labyrinth,</b> and Pandora tries to enter the Flame of Olympus. Zeus intervenes and fights Kratos; after a brief battle, Pandora sacrifices herself and quenches the flame, despite Kratos' protests. Finding Pandora's Box empty, Kratos attacks the mocking Zeus. Gaia returns and tries to kill them, but they escape through a gaping wound in her chest where they continue their battle. Gaia is killed when Kratos impales Zeus against her heart with the Blade of Olympus, which apparently also kills Zeus. When Kratos recovers the blade and tries to leave, he is attacked by Zeus' spirit and loses all of his weapons in the process. Before Zeus can land a fatal blow, Kratos is saved by Pandora during a journey into his psyche. With help from the spirits of his wife Lysandra and daughter Calliope, Kratos forgives himself for his past sins. After discovering the power of hope, he regains consciousness and beats Zeus to death with his bare hands, thus ending the reign of the Olympian Gods.|$|E

5|$|Arha's {{childhood}} and youth are lonely; her only friends are Manan and Penthe, a priestess her own age. She {{is trained in}} her duties by Thar and Kossil, the priestesses of the two other major deities. Thar tells her of the undertomb and <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> beneath the Tombs, teaching her the instructions to find her way around them. She tells of the treasure hidden within <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth,</b> which wizards from the archipelago have tried to steal in past years. When Arha asks about the wizards, Thar tells her that they are unbelievers who can work magic. When she turns fourteen, Arha assumes all the responsibilities of her position, becoming the highest ranked priestess in the Tombs. She is required to order the death of prisoners sent to the Tombs by the God-King of the Kargad lands; she has them killed by starvation, an act which haunts {{her for a long}} time. After Thar dies of old age, Arha becomes increasingly isolated: although stern, Thar had been fair to her. Kossil despises Arha and sees the Nameless Ones as a threat to her power.|$|E

She traps him in <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> by slamming the door on him, and through a peephole sees him unsuccessfully attempt {{to open the door}} with a spell. Trapped in <b>the</b> <b>labyrinth</b> the man collapses out of exhaustion, and Arha has him chained up while debating what to do with him. After questioning him she learns that he has come to the Tombs looking for the long-lost half of the ring of Erreth-Akbe, a magical talisman, broken centuries before, necessary for peace in Earthsea. The other half had come into his possession by chance, and a dragon told him of its true nature. Arha is drawn to him as he tells her of the outside world, and keeps him prisoner in the tombs, bringing him food and water. However, Kossil learns of Ged's existence, forcing Arha to promise that Ged will be sacrificed to the Nameless Ones; however, she realizes that she cannot go through with the sacrifice. She instructs Manan to dig a false grave underground, while she herself takes Ged to hide in the treasury of the Tombs.|$|E
