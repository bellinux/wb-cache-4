If you are too stupid to turn things around with your vote, there are people out here like me who are willing to turn things around with guns, force and violence. We hope our method does not become necessary.|$|E
25|$|Trial revenue {{services}} commenced in February 1946 on the Bergen Line from Oslo to Geilo. After a month {{there were}} {{issues with the}} pinions, causing them <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced. The unit continued on the Geilo service until September. By then the roller bearings in the prime mover's big ends were sufficiently weakened that they were causing engines to malfunction. Low standards caused by wartime manufacturing combined with dust and rust in the engines through four years of storage required a major clean-up of the prime movers before they could be returned to service. The prime movers were manufactured in 1939 and their big ends had to be replaced with sleve bearings to improve reliability.|$|E

25|$|The {{independent}} {{years were}} not as kind to Yost as his years in the Big 9. Michigan suffered one loss in 1907. In 1908, Michigan got battered by Penn (a team that went 1101 that year) in {{a game in which}} Michigan center Germany Schulz took such a battering as <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dragged off the field. In 1909, Michigan suffered its first loss to Notre Dame, leading Yost to refuse to schedule another game against Notre Dame; the schools did not play again until 1942. In 1910, Michigan played their only undefeated season of the independent years, going 303. Overall from 1907 to 1916, Michigan lost at least one game every year (with the exception of 1910).|$|E
25|$|Jens K. Bay {{was hired}} as the first {{managing}} director. Thirty people were sent by SS Carl to Kings Bay for the 1917 season. Planning of the mining community started, first with {{the site of the}} town. SS Deneb arrived with 100 men and supplies such as railway tracks and two locomotives on 26 August. By winter thirteen buildings had been erected and of railway laid. The company was not permitted to erect a radio telegraphy station. This caused communications <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sent by skiers by land to Longyearbyen, which resulted in an amputation in February 1918. The company therefore pressed for permission to establish a telegraphy station. A post office opened in 1918.|$|E
25|$|As {{the launch}} {{customer}} of extended Q400, SAS {{was prone to}} many of the early faults with the aircraft type. Aviation historian Åke Hall stated that it was the aircraft type which SAS has had the most challenges with throughout its history. First of all the production was delayed and by May only four of eleven planned deliveries had been made. One issue was false alarms created by the cockpit software, while oil leaks caused for engines <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced. By October there had been nine emergency landings caused by various technical faults, and SAS Commuter chose to ground the aircraft for several days. Deliveries came to a halt that month as the eleven first aircraft were all having faults caused by the same defects. Delivery of further aircraft resumed in February 2001. As the various issues were resolved, the aircraft entered a more normal mode of operation. The 28th aircraft was delivered in 2002.|$|E

500|$|Romanek {{described}} {{working with}} child actors and [...] "knowing {{that the first}} act of the film was going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried by 12-year-olds" [...] as probably the most difficult aspect of making the film. He said {{that most of the}} rehearsal schedule was devoted to ensuring that the first act would be good. At rehearsals, the film-maker would have the younger actors observe the older actors practise the first-act scenes. This had a double purpose: the older actors would have a memory of having played those scenes, while the child actors would get a better idea of how a more skilled actor would play their part. Romanek would then mix and match the actors (for example, Mulligan would do a scene with the child playing the younger Tommy). He also had them spend time together doing things like playing and talking. He took them to the school location and let them play games together so they could get a better idea of the layout of the place.|$|E
500|$|While in Paris, Lana {{begins a}} new romantic {{relationship}} with Jason Teague. Kreuk believes that Lana did love Jason Teague, {{but she also}} still loved Clark at the same time. With Clark, it was the [...] "first love" [...] that she never {{had the chance to}} discover, and that lingered with her while she was in Paris during the space between seasons three and four. According to Kreuk, before Lana can experience successful relationships with other people she will need to know {{what it is like to}} truly be in a relationship with Clark, because of the [...] "intense connection between [...] two". Allison Mack shares her insight into the relationship between Clark and Lana, believing that the pair should have remained apart until they could finally be honest with each other: [...] "There's no honesty in their relationship, and there's no way that they could have a healthy relationship without that honesty [...] You can't be with someone if you're not honest with them." [...] Kreuk echoes Mack's sentiments, acknowledging that Lana is not stupid, and if Clark wants a real relationship then he is going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honest with her.|$|E

She thinks he's the only guy she could possibly be with." [...] Natasha thinks that school and studying is not cool and is happy that Andrew feels the same, until Summer Hoyland joins their class and Andrew becomes interested in his studies. Natasha fears that she could lose her control over Andrew. Summer later asks Natasha {{if there is anything}} else, other than the physical aspect, to her relationship with Andrew. Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her stop and think about what she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about communicating and understanding each other. Andrew does not take the new direction of the relationship well. Novakovic said that Natasha believes the relationship between her neighbours, Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), is something to be inspired by. She added [...] "That's what she wants to look forward to, but she's getting way ahead of herself. Andrew likes her but he isn't as serious as she is." [...] Novakovic opined that Andrew and Natasha [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and that Natasha's relationship with Andrew had been one of her favourite storylines.|$|E

500|$|The {{stage was}} {{designed}} by production designer Steven Cohen and production manager Rob Brenner for the HBO special. This {{was the first time}} Spears used an entire new stage design after having used a typical end-stage with a ramp and stairs at the center as on her first 3 tours (the ...Baby One More Time Tour, the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, and the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour). Cohen designed the main stage with an oval shape so that Spears could perform around the stage and so that it would look good from multiple camera angles. He said {{that the rest of the}} stage was created with three main components in mind: a runway, a B-stage, and a flying device over the crowd. The last was developed, as explained by Cohen, [...] "around this Cleopatra's barge concept I got into my head while designing when the movie Cleopatra was playing in the background. It needed to be elegant and stylized but also high tech, because it was going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> traveling on conventional motors and transport mechanisms. Plus, it had to have a big enough performance area for her and the dancers." [...] Brenner continued, [...] "I wanted to try to give the kid in the back of the house the same experience as the one in the first 10 rows." [...] The runway uniting the main stage and the B-stage was suggested by one of Spears's managers, Johnny Wright. The entire stage was built by Michael Tait from Tait Towers. Cohen said, [...] "We took a more expanded role in preparing the drawings for Michael. We wanted to retain the essence of the look of the show, both in its overall footprint and in the execution of these various pieces. [...] did a great job on executing the fine details like the hand railings and the floor lights and the MR-16 covers. When you're doing something for TV, all of those pieces are foreground pieces. The mirrors on the platforms and the floor painting made the show look better on TV." ...|$|E
