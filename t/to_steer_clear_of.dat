5|$|Despite the success, {{chairman}} Derek Pavis {{refused to}} spend money on transfers, and as a result fell out with Allardyce. Allardyce was eventually allowed to spend £50,000 on striker Kevin Rapley, who helped the club <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> relegation {{at the end of the}} 1998–99 campaign. In the summer he signed midfielder Craig Ramage and utility player Clayton Blackmore. Allardyce remained in charge at Meadow Lane until 14 October 1999, when he resigned his post at Notts County to return to Bolton Wanderers.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Brian Horton, {{his former}} captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh's {{services}} in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth from bottom with eleven Premier League games left {{to play and}} Walsh's strike partner Uwe Rösler was also a new signing – and had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding however, {{and the arrival of}} wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking firepower <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> the relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals between them in the final ten games.|$|E
5|$|As a youth, John de la Pole married twice; {{his first}} {{marriage}} was annulled, but his second marriage, to Elizabeth of York, made him the brother-in-law of two kings, Edward IV and Richard III. It brought him eleven children, the eldest of whom, John, would eventually be named heir to Richard III in 1484 and die in battle in the Yorkist cause. John de la Pole, though, generally managed <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> involvement in the tumultuous events of the Wars of the Roses. Although he was politically aligned to the House of York, {{by virtue of his}} marriage, he avoided participating in the battles of the 1450s, not taking up arms until Edward IV had claimed the throne. De la Pole appears to have spent much of this period, in fact, feuding with his East Anglian neighbours, the Paston family over an inheritance—even interfering in parliamentary elections, for example, in attempt to gain the upper hand.|$|E

25|$|In 1889 {{the boom}} burst. Three Turin banks, heavily {{involved}} in financing speculative building in Rome, suspended payments. The note issuing banks were persuaded {{by the government to}} bail out other banks in order to avoid a major disaster. They were allowed to issue bank notes in excess of their reserves and legal limits in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> economic recession. However, this caused them to become entangled in the crisis.|$|E
25|$|Commercial {{arrangements}} that are tailored {{for the average}} band instrumentation are also available. Military and university bands typically have a repertoire of traditional music associated with the organization they serve. Some competitive bands use an arrangement of popular music varied for marching band, as well as music from a movie or other such theme. However, {{the largest and most}} successful marching bands tend <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> show tunes and popular music, instead preferring compilations or arrangements of classical or traditional concert pieces (i.e. Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring or Puccini's Nessun Dorma) or of entirely new compositions.|$|E

Despite having more than two months remaining in the season, Mathews was unable <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> Longford <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> relegation with the midland's side dropping to the First Division for the 2017 season. Following a disappointing series of results which left Longford struggling in mid table, Mathews parted company with the club by mutual consent on 27 May 2017.|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{the late}} 19th century, the British East India Company was {{interested}} only in trading, and tried {{as much as possible}} <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> Malay politics. However, Siam's influence in the northern Malay states, especially Kedah, Terengganu, Kelantan and Pattani, was preventing the Company from trading in peace. Therefore, in 1826, the British, through the Company, signed a secret treaty known today as the Burney Treaty with the King of Siam. The four Malay states were not present during the signing of the agreement. In that treaty, British acknowledged Siamese sovereignty over all those states. In return, Siam accepted British ownership of Penang and Province Wellesley and allowed the Company to trade in Terengganu and Kelantan unimpeded.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, {{the arrival}} of Channel 4, and its edgy new soap opera Brookside, {{was one of the}} biggest changes for Coronation Street. Unlike Coronation Street, which had a very nostalgic view of working-class life, Brookside brought {{together}} working and middle-class families in a more contemporary environment. The dialogue often included expletives and the stories were more hard-hitting, and of the current Zeitgeist. Whereas stories at this time in Coronation Street were largely about family affairs, Brookside concentrated on social affairs such as industrial action, unemployment, and the black market. The BBC also introduced a new prime time soap opera, EastEnders in 1985. Like Brookside, EastEnders had a more gritty premise than Coronation Street, although unlike Brookside it tended <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> blue language and politicised stories.|$|E

With the gradual extension into northern Somalia of Italian colonial rule, both Kingdoms were eventually annexed in the early 20th century. However, unlike the southern territories, the northern sultanates were not subject to direct rule due to the earlier treaties they had signed with the Italians.|$|E

25|$|Governor General the Viscount Monck had {{originally}} {{pushed for a}} distinct Canadian order of knighthood in 1867, {{to be called the}} Order of St. Lawrence. The idea was revived by Vincent Massey in 1935 and again in 1951, in between which he also suggested in 1940 a Royal Order of Canada. The Canadian Cabinet, however, never accepted these proposals, generally wishing instead <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> the controversial topic of orders. Still, the beginnings of a distinct Canadian honours system came in March 1934, with the creation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Long Service Medal by royal warrant of King George V, issued on the advice of the Cabinet of R. B. Bennett; {{this was the first time}} an honour specific to Canada and for service in Canada had been established by the monarch of Canada (as opposed to earlier campaign and service medals that had been issued to Canadians and British personnel alike by the British monarch). There was uncertainty amongst officials in Canada and Britain alike around how to go about creating such an honour, and delays were incurred not only as Canadian bureaucrats interpreted the Nickle Resolution as applying to medals, but also because the King himself was widening the project to consider all the Commonwealth and Empire police forces.|$|E

She tells Arun about her unfortunate past relationships: How she was molested by her uncle, {{the ending of}} her first relationship in college when her lover left her by marrying another woman {{for the sake of}} employment, and how her second love, Mano (Sivachandran), a Christian priest's son, used her to satisfy his needs and lust, calling her [...] "sister" [...] in front of her parents. These incidents have led to her present attitude towards men. Arun later shares these conversations with Thyagu, who warns him <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> such women.|$|E
500|$|Webster's {{appearance}} and behaviour {{were seen as}} key signs of her inherently criminal nature. Crimes {{were thought to be}} committed by a social [...] "residuum" [...] at the bottom of society who occupied themselves as [...] "habitual criminals", choosing to live a life of drink and theft rather than improving themselves through thrift and hard work. Her strong build, partly a result of the hard physical labour that was her livelihood, ran counter to the largely middle-class notion that women were meant to be physically frail. Some commentators saw her facial features as indicative of criminality; O'Donnell commented upon her [...] "obliquely set eyes", which he declared [...] "are not infrequently found in homicides... this peculiarity, which I consider was sufficient in itself, as one of nature's danger signals, to have warned people <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> her".|$|E

500|$|As {{they passed}} the Crab Tree pub, the Cambridge stroke R. J. L. Perfitt put in a spurt which made little {{difference}} as Oxford continued to lead by Harrods Furniture Depository. [...] Steering away from the Light Blues to avoid a collision, Oxford lost their lead as the crews passed under Hammersmith Bridge level.

500|$|The media {{prepared}} for Diệm's arrival by writing about and praising the South Vietnamese leader in great detail. The Washington Post devoted four pages to its profile of Diệm and titled it [...] "DiệmSymbol of Free New Asia." [...] The Washington Evening Star ran the headline [...] "Welcome to a Champion" [...] and described Diệm as [...] "a valiant and effective fighter against communism". The New York Times praised the visiting president for [...] "advancing {{the cause of}} freedom and democracy in Asia". The Boston Globe dubbed him [...] "Vietnam's Man of Iron". Various papers favourably commented on Diệm's overt opposition to communism, juxtaposing it to non-aligned Asian leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru of India and Sukarno of Indonesia. Nehru and Sukarno attempted <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> both the US-led anti-communist world and the Soviet bloc, and sought to recruit other countries into their movement. The newspapers compared South Vietnam to a beacon of light in a dark sea of communism.|$|E

The Germans had prepared a file on all famous RAF personnel based on information from British newspapers. They knew most of what had happened in his career and private life. While there, he was interrogated by the aide of Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring. The German questioned him about British defences and Supermarine Spitfires, {{as he was about to}} resume operations on Ju 88s. Jokingly, Braham advised him <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> <b>clear</b> <b>of</b> Spitfires. While at Oberursel the pilot who had shot him down—Leutnant Robert Spreckels of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1 Fighter Wing 1)— arrived to meet him. Braham was one of his 12 air victories; a figure of 45 is often misquoted. An interpreter was provided. Braham promised to buy him a whisky when the Allies won the war. The statement came as a shock to Spreckels who believed firmly in a German victory. Braham came to respect Spreckels, their differences aside. He learned that Spreckels had lost his parents in a British air attack and was surprised when the German dismissed the fact with the words [...] "it is the war." [...] Both fighter pilots dissociated themselves with the bomber war. They shook hands and parted.|$|E
