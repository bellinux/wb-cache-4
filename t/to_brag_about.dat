25|$|Since Tracey is {{actually}} Lavinia's gardener, he is naturally {{called in the}} next morning to investigate the damage K9's pursuit of him caused to the greenhouse. After Brendan attempts <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> the pH balance of the soil, Tracey sharply comments that gardening is more about respect for nature than scientific theory. Otherwise, though, he doesn't betray his more sinister intent towards Brendan. Later that night, he sends his son out to kidnap the sleeping Brendan from the house.|$|E
25|$|Rhonda Lee (Leslie Easterbrook) is a tall, voluptuous, {{somewhat}} ditzy blonde actress/singer/dancer/model {{trying to}} get discovered and make it big in Hollywood. She is Laverne and Shirley's neighbor and a regular character after they move to Burbank. Rhonda, who also comes off as rather narcissistic about her good looks and self-obsessed, usually (always?) refers to herself in the third person, by her first name. Rhonda often bursts into Laverne and Shirley's apartment (occasionally at inopportune times, much like Lenny and Squiggy often do) to borrow things without really asking and <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> her social engagements or romantic dates with desirable men {{with the intention of}} making the girls envious.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{demands that}} Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{research}} his family tree. To spite him, she falsely {{tells him that}} he is related to U.S. First Lady [...] Michelle Obama. He begins <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> his discovery, which causes his co-workers to wonder if Andy's family ever owned slaves. In order {{to get back at}} his co-workers, Andy asks Nellie to [...] "dig up dirt" [...] {{on the rest of the}} office. In turn, she makes up more fake facts as a prank. It is revealed by Andy's mother that the Bernards never owned slaves: they simply transported them.|$|E

50|$|Rumors {{exist that}} Le Roux was {{planning}} to build a militia to invade the Maldives. His enforcer Hunter is known <b>to</b> have <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> such plans, but {{the head of the}} UN investigative team concerned with Le Roux’s activities in Somalia dismissed it. According to him, Le Roux intended to set up a security firm specialized in protecting commercial ships from pirate attacks.|$|R
500|$|The video {{takes place}} in a lair/dungeon setting, as Ludacris is {{directing}} a movie but the filming is on break. During that time Ludacris begins <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> his [...] "girl" [...] towards the other cast members. Later in the video Minaj is revealed as the actress of the film, portraying a Freddy Krueger character, complete with the trademark glove made of razor blades. She is found lying in a couch, held by restraints, before the video ends with Ludacris and Nicki performing in the lair. The remix video with Diamond, Trina and Eve, also directed by TAJ, premiered on March 26, 2010 on VEVO and 106 & Park. The video is an extension of the original clip, featuring the same concept and premise. While Eve, Trina, and Diamond, make cameos {{near the end of the}} original video, Rick Ross, Lil Scrappy, DJ Khaled, Larenz Tate, [...] and 2 Chainz make cameo appearances both clips.|$|E
500|$|After being {{reminded}} {{to pick up}} Meg at {{the local}} roller rink, Peter and his friends decide to go skating. At the roller rink scene, the 1976 disco song [...] "A Fifth of Beethoven" [...] is featured, performed by Walter Murphy. This is a tongue-in-cheek gag, as Murphy {{is also one of}} the composers for Family Guy. After returning home without Meg, the Griffin family are shown watching a Pepperidge Farm commercial on their television. Immediately afterwards, Meg enters her home, and begs her parents to get buy her a new vehicle. Reluctant to do so, Peter informs Meg that plenty of people are able to get around without a car, including the fictional Marvel Comics superhero Iceman. Finally deciding to give in and purchase a vehicle for Meg, the Griffin family head to the local car dealership. While there, Brian notices a large amount of Hummers, and questions who would ever want to drive one. A cutaway then shows a loud, obnoxious man driving a yellow Hummer, who goes on <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> being able to watch the 2005 film Madagascar while driving, and proceeds to destroy two vehicles in the process while yelling the name of former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E
2500|$|Warner {{proposes to}} Elle, having been dumped by Vivienne. Elle gently refuses, {{claiming}} to have been changed by the experience. Three years later, Elle ends up as the valedictorian of her class. Paulette tells the audience that Elle is not one <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> her valedictorian status, so she decided to allow Paulette to play [...] "Where Are They Now" [...] during her speech. Paulette says that Enid practices family law, Vivienne is training for the Peace Corps, and Warner dropped out and pursues a modeling career. Callahan ran for governor but was defeated, and his wife hired Emmett to handle their divorce. Paulette married Kyle, had two kids, and is pregnant with a third. They live in Worcester, Massachusetts and Paulette bought a new salon (the Worcester detail {{was taken from the}} London script, and replaced with the detail that a child of hers was named Seamus) ("Find My Way"). At the end of the graduation, Elle proposes to Emmett, and Emmett accepts ("Finale").|$|E
50|$|Peter Straub was the SS {{officer in}} command for the executions. According to {{testimony}} Straub {{was said to}} be drunk the night of the executions because of a party thrown for the departure of Plaza. Straub was known <b>to</b> have <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> the injections <b>to</b> other prisoners in the camp. Straub was charged with 13 years in prison which was thought to be surprising considering all of the other war crimes he had been accused of committing in other concentration camps.|$|R
50|$|Donald {{is also a}} bit of a show-off. He likes <b>to</b> <b>brag,</b> {{especially}} <b>about</b> how skilled he is at something. He does, in fact, {{have many}} skills—he is something of a Jack of all Trades. Amongst other things, he is a good fisher and a good hockey player. However, his love of bragging often leads him to overestimate his abilities, so that when he sets out to make good on his boasts, he gets in over his head, usually to hilarious effect.|$|R
5000|$|Set {{during the}} Middle Ages in Europe, a king {{is seeking a}} brave warrior to kill a giant which has been terrorizing the small kingdom. There is much {{discussion}} in the village, {{but no one is}} willing to take on the task. Nearby in the same village, a young peasant tailor (Mickey Mouse) kills seven flies at once while at his work, and accidentally interjects several other peasants' discussion of the problems with the giant <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> loudly <b>about</b> his accomplishment: ...|$|R
2500|$|Besides {{the added}} {{incentive}} of no longer depleting the finances with expensive wars with Hatti {{and increasing the}} security of Egypt's claims in Syria, signing the treaty with Hatti also provided Ramesses the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> his [...] "defeat" [...] of the Hittites. Since Hattušiliš {{had been the one}} to approach Ramesses, the pharaoh in his depictions at the Ramesseum represents the settlement as one that the Hittite had asked for in a position of submission. Considering the official language of the treaties at the time was completely independent of one another, Ramesses was able to present the terms of the treaty from his perspective. This free control over the depictions of his role by the language of the treaty gave the pharaoh opportunity to present a greatly idealized point of view. His ability to assert a sense of supremacy as ruler of Egypt and his attempts to portray this strategic alliance as a victory over the Hittites demonstrate why Ramesses' would be so willing to choose such a mutually beneficial peace. The conclusion of open hostilities between the two regional powers was a personal triumph for the aging pharaoh and as his monument at Abu Simbel shows the pharaoh made his subjects well {{aware of the fact that}} he, Ramesses, was the conqueror of the Hittites.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accounts}} of this battle mainly {{are derived from}} Egyptian literary accounts known as the Bulletin (also known as the Record) and the Poem as well as pictorial Reliefs. Unfortunately for scholars and individuals interested in the Battle of Kadesh, the details that these sources provide are heavily biased interpretation of the events. Since Ramesses II had complete control over the building projects, the resources were used for propagandist purposes by the pharaoh, who used them <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> his victory at Kadesh. It is still known that Ramesses marched through Syria with four divisions of troops {{in the hopes of}} destroying the Hittite presence there and restoring Egypt to the [...] "preeminent position it had enjoyed under Tuthmosis III". The Hittite king, Muwatalli II, gathered together an army of his allies to prevent the invasion of his territory. At the site of Kadesh, Ramesses foolishly outdistanced the remainder of his forces and, after hearing unreliable intelligence regarding the Hittite position from a pair of captured prisoners, the pharaoh pitched camp across from the town. The Hittite armies, hidden behind the town, launched a surprise attack against the Amun division and quickly sent the division scattering. Although Ramesses tried to rally his troops against the onslaught of the Hittite chariots, it was only after the arrival of relief forces from Amurru that the Hittite attack was thrown back.|$|E

25|$|Although the Egyptians {{were able}} to survive a terrible predicament in Kadesh {{it was not the}} splendid victory that Ramesses sought to portray but rather a {{stalemate}} in which both sides sustained heavily losses. After an unsuccessful attempt to gain further ground the following day, Ramesses headed back south <b>to</b> Egypt <b>bragging</b> <b>about</b> his individual achievements during Kadesh. Even though Ramesses technically won the battle, he ultimately lost the war, when Muwatallis and his army retook Amurru and extended the buffer zone with Egypt further southward.|$|R
5000|$|Nasiri's {{account of}} Osama, the younger {{of the two}} sons, {{was that he was}} [...] "almost hyperactive", and was {{constantly}} talking, <b>bragging.</b> [...] According <b>to</b> Nasiri, he <b>bragged</b> <b>about</b> how important his father was, and offered Nasiri his first hint of Osama bin Laden's role in running the camp—telling him [...] "the other Osama" [...] paid for all the food consumed there.|$|R
2500|$|A 2006 {{column in}} the Birmingham News (Alabama) {{reported}} about people who remembered Bush {{when he was in}} Alabama, working for the Blount campaign: [...] "None have specific recollections about Bush and the National Guard. Some heard he was serving but never saw for themselves." [...] Opinions of him during his time working on the campaign ranged from good (amiable, well liked, and fond of sports) <b>to</b> bad (<b>bragging</b> <b>about</b> drinking and allegations he trashed a cottage where he was living). [...] Winton Blount's son Tom said [...] "He was an attractive person, kind of a 'frat boy.' I didn't like him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no telling}} what a fellow of Link's stamp might do. He is just fool enough <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> what he hoped to do rather than go and do it. It's an outrage that he should call you a 'poorhouse nobody.'" ...|$|E

"No, I never did," [...] confessed Digger, [...] "but I've {{heard my}} {{grandfather}} tell of Sheep that {{live on the}} tops of the great mountains as free as Light-foot the Deer or any other of the Green Forest people, and with horns so large that they, the Sheep, are called Big-Horns. From what I have heard my grandfather say, those horns over there of Mr. Ram's are nothing <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about.</b> No, Sir, they are nothing <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about.</b> One of those wild, free cousins of Mr. Ram over there would laugh at those horns. But they are funny horns, and they've been like that always {{since the days of the}} first great Ram, the great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of all the Sheep, so my grandfather told me. It was way back in those long-ago days that they became curved and quite useless for fighting, and all because of old Big-Horn going about with a chip on his shoulder." ...|$|E

50|$|While the Croatian {{military}} inflicted a heavy blow on Krajina and retook {{a relatively}} large section of Croatian territory, it failed to completely remove the threat towards the Dalmatian cities. Even the stated aim of securely connecting Dalmatia {{to the rest of}} Croatia was not achieved. This became apparent with the opening of a pontoon bridge at Maslenica later in the year. The bridge was in range of RSK artillery, thus allowing RSK leader Milan Martić <b>to</b> publicly <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> his ability <b>to</b> sink it or close it to traffic at his leisure. Traffic over the bridge normalised only after UN-sponsored negotiations.|$|R

He proclaims he is going <b>to</b> drink, unintentionally <b>brags</b> <b>about</b> his wealth, and turns to leave the meeting. Hobson stands up and takes the bullet, giving Arthur’s humiliating introduction in his place. Arthur, touched, states that if only she would do his drinking for him as well, he would be set.|$|R
5000|$|Soon after Casey’s death, {{the song}} was first sung by engine wiper and friend of Casey’s named Wallace Saunders {{to the tune of}} a popular song of the time known as [...] "Jimmie Jones."

He used <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> mightily <b>about</b> Mr. Jones even when Casey was only a freight engineer." [...] But Saunders never had his original version copyrighted, and thus {{there is no way of}} knowing precisely what words he sang.|$|R
60|$|Now, {{whatever}} may be {{the reason}} for it, my experience in life {{is that it is}} never wise <b>to</b> <b>brag</b> <b>about</b> anything. At any rate, on a hunting trip, to come to a particular instance, wait until you are safe at home till you begin to do so. Of the truth of this ancient adage I was now destined to experience a particularly fine and concrete example.|$|E
