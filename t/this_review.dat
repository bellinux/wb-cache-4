The objectives of <b>this</b> scoping <b>review</b> are therefore, {{to characterize the}} rehabilitation programs performed by individuals with transfemoral amputation following the implantation of an osseointegrated fixation for bone-anchored prostheses; to describe partial weight bearing exercises in each rehabilitation program for screw-type and press-fit fixations; and to compare key rehabilitation parameters {{for each of these}} exercises within each program for screw-type and press-fit fixations (intra-variability) as between programs for screw-type and press-fit fixations (inter-variability). <b>This</b> scoping <b>review</b> will consider studies involving individuals with transfemoral amputation fitted with a bone-anchored prosthesis using either screw-type or press-fit osseointegrated fixation. <b>This</b> scoping <b>review</b> will examine the concepts of intra-variability and inter-variability in clinical indicators of the rehabilitation programs for screw-type and press-fit fixations fitted to bone-anchored prosthesis of individuals with transfemoral amputation. <b>This</b> scoping <b>review</b> will consider studies providing broad and specific clinical elements underlying the rehabilitation program aiming at promoting bone remodeling around osseointegrated fixation.
