5|$|Critics chastised Stewart for not {{conducting}} sufficiently hard-hitting {{interviews with}} his political guests, {{some of whom}} he may have lampooned in previous segments. Stewart and other Daily Show writers responded to such criticism by saying {{that they do not}} have any journalistic responsibility and that as comedians their only duty is to provide entertainment. Stewart's appearance on <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> show Crossfire picked up this debate, where he chastised <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> production and hosts for not conducting informative and current interviews on a news network.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} {{participants}} on Tiananmen Square was also {{called into question}} by a CNN producer on the scene. While the Chinese government claimed that a 12-year-old Liu Siying had set herself on fire {{at the urging of}} her mother, <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> producer said that she did not see any children among the self-immolators.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to create a sense of}} realism for the storyline, {{principal}} CNN news outlet commentators were scripted into Contact. More than 25 news reporters from CNN had roles in the film and <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> programs Larry King Live and Crossfire were also included. Ann Druyan makes a cameo appearance as herself, debating with Rob Lowe's character, Richard Rank, on Crossfire. In January 1997, a second unit was sent to Puerto Rico for one week at the Arecibo Observatory.|$|E
5|$|Later, in an on-air {{phone call}} from his office at <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> New York bureau, CNN {{vice-president}} of finance Sean Murtagh reported that a large passenger commercial jet had hit the World Trade Center. Eventually, other television networks interrupted regular broadcasting with news of the crash. President George W. Bush was arriving at Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. Initial news reports speculated that the crash had been an accident until United Airlines Flight 175 was flown into the South Tower 17 minutes after Flight 11 made impact.|$|E
30|$|For <b>the</b> <b>CNNs</b> and RNNs, {{applying}} the convolution or the recurrent time {{steps on the}} DER state does not seem plausible. Instead, our classification <b>CNN</b> processes <b>the</b> DER state in layers after the convolution (e.g., see Fig.  3 a). <b>The</b> <b>CNNs</b> for generating load profiles process the DER state in the first fully-connected layer (e.g., see Fig.  3 b). The RNN converts the DER state into initial states of the memory units (e.g., see Fig.  3 c).|$|R
30|$|Other black-box {{attacks that}} require no {{internal}} {{knowledge about the}} target systems such as gradients, have also been proposed. Papernot et al. proposed the first black-box attack against CNN which consists in training a local model to substitute for <b>the</b> target <b>CNN,</b> using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by <b>the</b> target <b>CNN.</b> <b>The</b> local duplication is then used for crafting adversarial examples which are found being successfully misclassified by <b>the</b> targeted <b>CNN</b> [6]. Narodytska et al., implemented a greedy local search to perturb a small set of pixels of an image which treats <b>the</b> target <b>CNN</b> as a miracle [17].|$|R
40|$|Convolutional neural {{networks}} (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in image classification tasks for benchmark and practical uses. <b>The</b> <b>CNNs</b> with deeper architectures have achieved higher performances recently {{thanks to their}} robustness to parallel shift of objects in images aw well as their numerous parameters and resulting high expression ability. However, <b>the</b> <b>CNNs</b> have a limited robustness to other geometric transformations such as scaling and rotation. This problem is considered to limit performance improvement of <b>the</b> deep <b>CNNs</b> {{but there is no}} established solution. This study focuses on scale transformation and proposes a novel network architecture called weight-shared multi-stage network (WSMS-Net), consisting of multiple stages of <b>CNNs.</b> <b>The</b> WSMS-Net is easily combined with existing deep CNNs, such as ResNet and DenseNet, and enables them to acquire a robustness to scaling of objects. The experimental results demonstrate that existing deep <b>CNNs</b> combined with <b>the</b> proposed WSMS-Net achieve higher accuracy for image classification tasks only with a little {{increase in the number of}} parameters...|$|R
5|$|CNN {{reported}} {{that at least}} two men and altogether five persons set themselves on fire after pouring gasoline over themselves. They did not see a child among the self-immolators. <b>The</b> <b>CNN</b> crew began filming the events from a distance, but were quickly intercepted by military police, who detained the journalists and confiscated their equipment. The authorities then put out the flames consuming the other four people's clothing. A police van came to collect the badly burnt man, and two ambulances arrived almost 25 minutes later to collect the other four. The square was completely closed, and security was tight the next day, the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. Police monitored public access to the square for the New Year celebrations, had fire extinguishers ready, and prevented Falun Gong practitioners from opening banners.|$|E
5|$|Fifty {{people are}} interviewed in the film, {{including}} investigative journalist Paul Radu of Bucharest, Katherine Chon of the Polaris Project, and Iana Matei of Reaching Out Romania. Don Brewster of Agape International Missions {{says that all}} of the girls they have rescued from child sex tourism in Cambodia identify Americans as the clients who were the most abusive to them. The film was dedicated to Richard Young, its cinematographer and co-director, after he died in December 2010. It had its premiere the following month at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City. The narration was completely rerecorded in 2011, replacing Ashley Judd's voice with that of Glenn Close. The version of the film that was aired by CNN International as part of <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> Freedom Project was shorter than the version shown at the premiere. In 2014, a re-edited version of the film was released.|$|E
5|$|In February 2006, {{during the}} interim between the show's GLAAD Media Award {{nomination}} and the awards ceremony, T.J. Jourian {{was interviewed by}} Larry King on <b>the</b> <b>CNN</b> talk show Larry King Live, along with trans man Aiden Key; trans women Brenda Chevis and Jennifer Finney Boylan; sexologist Michelle Angello; and Felicity Huffman, star of the 2005 film Transamerica. Jourian talked about his past, cultural barriers to acceptance, {{and what it means}} to be a trans man. The interviews were parodied in a comedy sketch on the March 4 episode of Saturday Night Live, in which Natalie Portman played Jourian. T.J. Jourian has since become a speaker and consultant concerned with the needs and interests of students, queer and transgender people, and people of color.|$|E
