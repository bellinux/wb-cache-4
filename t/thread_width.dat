40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} implant design factors in terms of bone integrity and implant stability. Materials and methods. A 3 D parametric CAD model was developed. Then, once domain settings and boundary conditions were defined, a 3 D FEM model was created. To simulate the physical interaction at the bone–implant interface, identity pairs were introduced. After generating different design scenarios with a DOE approach, the most significant design factors were obtained. Results. This study showed that the geometry of the screw thread highly influenced the implant stability. In particular the degree of bone damage became minimal when adopting 0. 40 mm for the <b>thread</b> <b>width</b> and 0. 05 mm for the thickness. Significance. <b>Thread</b> <b>width</b> and thickness {{play a crucial role}} to reduce induced stresses and damage in bone. Considering these preliminary results, future improvements should focus on investigating also two-factor and higher interactions to better understand the implant loading mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Non-thermal plasma (NTP) {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{over the last few}} years as a promising after- treatment system for nitrogen oxides and particulate matter removal from diesel exhaust. NTP technology has not been commercialised as yet, due to its high rate of energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to seek out new methods to improve NTP performance. Residence time is a crucial parameter in engine exhaust emissions treatment. In this paper, different electrode shapes are analysed and the corresponding residence time and NOx removal efficiency are studied. An axisymmetric laminar model is used for obtaining residence time distribution numerically using FLUENT software. If the mean residence time in a NTP plasma reactor increases, there will be a corresponding increase in the reaction time and consequently the pollutant removal efficiency increases. Three different screw thread electrodes and a rod electrode are examined. The results show the advantage of screw thread electrodes in comparison with the rod electrode. Furthermore, between the screw thread electrodes, the electrode with the <b>thread</b> <b>width</b> of 1 mm has the highest NOx removal due to higher residence time and a greater number of micro-discharges. The results show that the residence time of the screw thread electrode with a <b>thread</b> <b>width</b> of 1 mm is 21 % more than for the rod electrode...|$|E
40|$|Circumstances {{concerning}} the possible illegal exploitation of sea trout in two western fishery districts {{in which the}} fish are {{an important component of}} the salmonid catch are reviewed. Legal methods of capture in the districts are described. The illegal fishery consists largely of nets fixed close inshore. The meshings available are described in terms of colour, size, <b>thread</b> <b>width</b> and materials. The meshes belong to one of two size groups. The larger of these is suitable for salmon and only trout of more than four sea winters are likely to be caught in them; these fish are relatively rare on the western seaboard. The group of smaller meshes would be effective in the capture of sea trout and fish of one sea winter would be particularly susceptible. Unfortunately the mesh marks inflicted by such nets would be similar to those made by a draft net, used legally. The greater part of the illegal salmonid fishery is apparently directed at salmon...|$|E

40|$|Plasma flows within prominences/filaments {{have been}} {{observed}} {{for many years and}} hold valuable clues concerning the mass and energy balance within these structures. Previous observations of these flows primarily come from H-alpha and cool EUV lines (e. g., 304 A) where estimates {{of the size of the}} prominence threads has been limited by the resolution of the available instrumentation. Evidence of `counter-steaming' flows has previously been inferred from these cool plasma observations but now, for the first time, these flows have been directly imaged along fundamental filament threads within the million degree corona (at 193 A). In this work we present observations of an active region filament observed with Hi-C that exhibits anti-parallel flows along adjacent filament threads. Complementary data from SDO/AIA and HMI are presented. The ultra-high spatial and temporal resolution of Hi-C allow the anti-parallel flow velocities to be measured (70 - 80 km/s) and gives an indication of the resolvable thickness of the individual strands (0. 8 '' +/- 0. 1 ''). The temperature distribution of the plasma flows was estimated to be log T(K) = 5. 45 +/- 0. 10 using EM loci analysis. We find that SDO/AIA cannot clearly observe these anti-parallel flows nor measure their velocity or <b>thread</b> <b>width</b> due to its larger pixel size. We suggest that anti-parallel/counter-streaming flows are likely commonplace within all filaments and are currently not observed in EUV due to current instrument spatial resolution.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} facilitating property variability in biological adhesives may promote biomimetic innovations. Spider gluey silks {{such as the}} spiral threads in orb webs and the gumfoot threads in cobwebs, both of which comprise of an axial thread coated by glue, are biological adhesives that have variable {{physical and chemical properties}}. Studies show that the physical and chemical properties of orb web gluey threads change when spiders are deprived of food. It is, however, unknown whether gumfoot threads undergo similar property variations when under nutritional stress. Here we tested whether protein deprivation induces similar variations in spiral and gumfoot thread morphology and stickiness. We manipulated protein intake for the orb web spider Nephila clavipes and the cobweb spider Latrodectus hesperus and measured the diameter, glue droplet volume, number of droplets per mm, axial <b>thread</b> <b>width,</b> thread stickiness and adhesive energy of their gluey silks. We found that the gluey silks of both species were stickier when the spiders were deprived of protein than when the spiders were fed protein. In N. clavipes a concomitant increase in glue droplet volume was found. Load-extension curves showed that protein deprivation induced glue property variations independent of the axial thread extensions in both species. We predicted that changes in salt composition of the glues were primarily responsible for the changes in stickiness of the silks, although changes in axial thread properties might also contribute. We, additionally, showed that N. clavipes ’ glue changes color under protein deprivation, probably as...|$|E
40|$|Objectives : Implant design {{features}} such as macro- and micro-design may influence overall implant success. Limited information is currently available. Therefore, it {{is the purpose of}} this paper to examine these factors such as thread pitch, thread geometry, helix angle, thread depth and width as well as implant crestal module may affect implant stability. Search Strategy : A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE to identify studies, from simulated laboratory models, animal, to human, related to this topic using the keywords of implant thread, implant macrodesign, thread pitch, thread geometry, helix angle, thread depth, <b>thread</b> <b>width</b> and implant crestal module. Results : The results showed how thread geometry affects the distribution of stress forces around the implant. A decreased thread pitch may positively influence implant stability. Excess helix angles in spite of a faster insertion may jeopardize the ability of implants to sustain axial load. Deeper threads seem to have an important effect on the stabilization in poorer bone quality situations. The addition of threads or microthreads up to the crestal module of an implant might provide a potential positive contribution on bone-to to-implant contact as well as on the preservation of marginal bone; nonetheless this remains to be determined. Conclusions : Appraising the current literature on this subject and combining existing data to verify the presence of any association between the selected characteristics may be critical in the achievement of overall implant success.

40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of the orthopedic screws engineering design such as profile shape and geometrical parameters on its biomechanical compatibility in terms of load sharing with adjacent bone tissue was investigated. The study was conducted on a set of three-dimensional finite element design models. A dimension less Stress Transfer Parameter (STP) was utilized for gauging the performances of the different screws according to its load sharing capabilities. Stress-transfer behavior was found to be linear for varying load magnitudes. The geometric properties investigated; pitch, <b>thread</b> length, <b>width,</b> major diameter and thread angle showed different influences on the three different profiles studied (triangular, trapezoidal and rectangular). The results indicated that 13 out of 32 screw designs produced were to achieve STP values greater than 0. 3 of these, 6 were the rectangular profile. The best design was of the rectangular profile (Design no. 24) with an STP value of 0. 4344. It was concluded that the best biomechanical properties were found in rectangular screw profiles. However, due to mix trends for the different properties, the careful combination and consideration towards pullout strength was necessary to obtain a design with the highest biocompatibility...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of forced-convection heat transfer and associated pressure drops {{was conducted with}} air flowing through electrically heated Inconel tubes having various degrees of square-thread-type roughness, an inside diameter of 1 / 2 inch, and a length of 24 inches. were obtained for tubes having conventional roughness ratios (height of thread/radius of tube) of 0 (smooth tube), 0. 016, 0. 025, and 0. 037 over ranges of bulk Reynolds numbers up to 350, 000, average inside-tube-wall temperatures up to 1950 deg R, and heat-flux densities up to 115, 000 Btu per hour per square foot. Data The experimental data showed that both heat transfer and friction increased with increase in surface roughness, becoming more pronounced with increase in Reynolds number; for a given roughness, both heat transfer and friction were also influenced by the tube wall-to-bulk temperature ratio. Good correlation of the heat-transfer data for all the tubes investigated was obtained by use of a modification of the conventional Nusselt correlation parameters wherein the mass velocity in the Reynolds number {{was replaced by the}} product of air density evaluated at the average film temperature and the so-called friction velocity; in addition, the physical properties of air were evaluated at the average film temperature. The isothermal friction data for the rough tubes, when plotted in the conventional manner, resulted in curves similar to those obtained by other investigators; that is, the curve for a given roughness breaks away from the Blasius line (representing turbulent flow in smooth tubes) at some value of Reynolds number, which decreases with increase in surface roughness, and then becomes a horizontal line (friction coefficient independent of Reynolds number). A comparison of the friction data for the rough tubes used herein indicated that the conventional roughness ratio is not an adequate measure of relative roughness for tubes having a square-thread-type element. The present data, {{as well as those of}} other investigators, were used to isolate the influence of ratios of <b>thread</b> height to <b>width,</b> <b>thread</b> spacing to <b>width,</b> and the conventional roughness ratio on the friction coefficient. A fair correlation of the friction data was obtained for each tube with heat addition when the friction coefficient and Reynolds number were defined on the basis of film properties; however, the data for each tube retained the curve characteristic of that particular roughness. The friction data for all the rough tubes could be represented by a single line for the complete turbulence region by incorporating a roughness parameter in the film correlation. No correlation was obtained for the region of incomplete turbulence...|$|R

METHODS: Images of the active tips of the mini-implants were obtained with a Zeiss optical microscope, Stemi 200 -C with magnification of 1. 6 X. The images of the surface were viewed with the Axio Vision program (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) to calculate linear and angular measures. Mini-implant morphology and the details of tips and threads were also evaluated through Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) (JEOL, model JSM 5800 LV - JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with magnifications of 90 X and 70 X, respectively. The evaluation of the mini-implant taper shape was assessed using to the formula: (b - a) / (2 x D).

40|$|International audienceAmong animal constructions, the orb webs of spiders {{are perfect}} {{geometrical}} architectural models. Webs are constructed {{by means of}} a succession of behaviours, which are often considered as instinctive and stereotyped. Anomalies in web structure are considered to be a consequence of variability in behaviour. In order to assess the variability in web structure, the spider Zygiella x-notata was allowed to build webs in the laboratory under standardized conditions. Webs (n = 127) were examined for anomalies, which were defined as modifications in the geometrical structure. Ten anomalies in the structure of webs produced by females, aged from 16 to 21 days after their adult moult, are described. The frequency of anomalies per web varies from 5 to 98. A very low percentage of the spiral elements of a web (less than 5 %) were affected. Anomalies in the radii were less numerous (mean = 3 +/- 3) than those in the sticky spiral (mean = 21 +/- 11). Anomalies in the sticky spiral were different and more frequent in the peripheral than central parts of the webs. They were also relatively more numerous in the upper than in {{the lower part of the}} webs. Total number of anomalies was positively correlated with particular web characteristics (capture area, length of capture <b>thread,</b> <b>width</b> of the lower part of the web and mean distance between two spiral turns in the lower part) but not to the physical characteristics of the spiders (mass and size). Our results indicate that the orb webs of spiders, which are considered to be perfect geometrical structures, include anomalies mainly in the structure of the sticky spiral. These anomalies were the result of variability in behaviour during web building. In conclusion, their identification and description enable one to use them in spider webs as an index of behavioural variability...|$|E
40|$|The High {{resolution}} Coronal Imager (Hi-C) {{has provided}} the sharpest view of the EUV corona to date. In this paper we exploit its impressive resolving power to provide the first analysis of the fine-scale structure of moss in an active region. The data reveal that the moss {{is made up of}} a collection of fine <b>threads,</b> that have <b>widths</b> with a mean and standard deviation of 440 ± 190 km (Full Width Half Maximum). The brightest moss emission is located at the visible head of the fine-scale structure and the fine structure appears to extend into the lower solar atmosphere. The emission decreases along the features implying the lower sections are most likely dominated by cooler transition region plasma. These threads appear to be the cool, lower legs of the hot loops. In addition, the increased resolution allows for the first direct observation of physical displacements of the moss fine-structure in a direction transverse to its central axis. Some of these transverse displacements demonstrate periodic behaviour, which we interpret as a signature of kink (Alfvénic) waves. Measurements of the properties of the transverse motions are made and the wave motions have {{means and standard deviations of}} 55 ± 37 km for the transverse displacement amplitude, 77 ± 33 s for the period and 4. 7 ± 2. 5 km/s for the velocity amplitude. The presence of waves in the transition region of hot loops could have important implications for the heating of active regions. Comment: 34 Pages, 10 Figures, 1 Table - accepted in Ap...|$|R
5000|$|Wadmal was {{the main}} export of Iceland, where length, <b>width,</b> <b>thread</b> count, and weight for {{different}} grades were fixed by law. Iceland was also the largest producer of wadmal in the North Atlantic. Producing and selling inadequate wadmal was punishable by law in Iceland; for instance, in Ljósvetninga Saga, one individual is outlawed for selling wadmal full of holes. Wadmal was a dominant form of legal currency in Iceland - both within Iceland {{and to some extent}} in the Icelanders’ foreign trade - from the 11th (at the earliest) to 17th century (at the latest). According to archeologist Michele Hayeur Smith, wadmal was significant enough in Iceland “that its production nearly eliminated other textile types from the island’s woven repertoire.” Some have argued that, given the importance of wadmal in Iceland and the fact that women primarily produced it, that gender relations in Iceland may have been more equal than was previously thought: [...] "making vaðmál was making money and this may have provided women with a source of power that was socially understood, as the weavers knew best the differences between good and poor-quality vaðmál. This seeming symbiosis may stem from the small size of the Icelandic colony, the harsh nature of the North Atlantic environment and the need for collaboration between the sexes to guarantee survival. This {{is not to say that}} resistance did not exist, but it may have been subtle and reflected in the values and symbolic associations connected to the making of cloth".|$|R
5000|$|The dying {{process is}} done before weaving, {{with the most}} common {{technique}} being the ikat method, sometimes called “amarrado” (lit. stingy) In the most traditional work, thread is dyed with natural colors, with colors such as black, blue, red, purple and green but synthetic dyes are now often used. The patterns of the garment are determined by a sequence of colors dyed into the thread, with color changes made similar to tie-dying. Groups of threads are tied together tightly at intervals so that the dye cannot enter some areas. After dying, the knots are cut off. The weaving begins by cutting the warp threads {{to the length of}} the final product. The number of <b>threads</b> determines the <b>width.</b> They are woven on both backstrap looms and European style looms. The groups of warp threads are then placed on the loom in order to work out the design that the body of the cloth will have. [...] After weaving, the last rows of the weft are finger weaved to secure them, which is complicated and meticulous work, often done by women specialized in this. [...] Isabel Rivera and Julia Sánches of Santa María have won national and international awards for their work, with the ability to weave letters into the fringes of rebozos. In some areas, after they are finished, rebozos are “smoked” with rosemary branches or are stored with apples or quince in order to make them smell good.There are a number of locations in Mexico which produce traditional rebozos including, Zamora, Ahuirán, Turícuaro, Angahuan, Santa Cruz, Tocuaro, Zitácuaro, Cuanajo, Arocutín and Tangancícuaro in Michoacán, [...] Moroleón and Uriangato in Guanajuato, the Altos de Chiapas region, Xochistlahuaca in Guerrero, the Sierra Norte de Puebla, San Pedro Cajonos, Pinotepa de Don Luis, Yalalag, and Santa María Tlahuitoltepec in Oaxaca as well as the Cooperativa Textil Artesanal in the city of Oaxaca and Chiautempan, Tlaxcala, However, there are several important locations whose work are featured in important collections such as that of the Rockefeller family. These include Santa María del Río, Tenancingo and La Piedad.Santa María del Río is a small rural town in the state of San Luis Potosí, containing country homes for the well-to-do in the city of San Luis Potosí. The entrance arch of the town states “Santa María del Río, cuna del rebozo” (Santa María del Río, cradle of the rebozo). [...] Even the local baseball team is named after rebozo weavers, called the “Reboceros.” It is known for its production of finely woven rebozos especially in silk and rayon, with cotton ones made as well. Weaving was introduced to the area shortly after the conquest and gained fame by the 17th century. Silk production was introduced originally in Oaxaca by the Dominicans. Despite prohibitions, Junípero Serra introduced their cultivation into the region in the 18th century, with silk production and weaving becoming widespread by the late 19th century into the 20th. The variety of silk traditionally used in these rebozos is called “catiteo.” After the Mexican Revolution, the haciendas producing silk were broken up and many weavers turned to rayon and very few are still made with pure silk. Their production is done by families, but only by the women, with a number winning national awards for their work. In Santa María the use of various browns is a distinguishing characteristic of the region. Other common colors are black, blue, red, purple and green along occasional white threads which appear as flecks in the final product. There are a number of traditional color combinations and designs with names such as calabrote, Rosita, rosarito, culebrilla calado and more. Santa Maria hosts a Feria del Rebozo in August and is home to the Escuela de Rebozo (Rebozo School) and a cooperative called the Taller Escuela de Rebocería.|$|R
40|$|Stress Engineering Services (SES) was {{contracted}} by Mr. John Watts to {{test his}} ''WW'' threaded connection developed for oilfield oil and gas service. This work was a continuation of testing performed by SES as reported in August of 1999. The connection design tested was identified as ''WW''. The samples were all integral (no coupled connections) and contained a wedge thread form with 90 {sup o} flank angles relative to the pipe centerline. The wedge thread form is a variable <b>width</b> <b>thread</b> that primarily engages on the flanks. This thread form provides very high torque capacity and good stabbing ability and makeup. The test procedure selected {{for one of the}} samples was the newly written ISO 13679 procedure for full scale testing of casing and tubing connections, which is currently going through the ISO acceptance process. The ISO procedure requires a variety of tests that includes makeup/breakout testing, internal gas sealability/external water sealability testing with axial tension, axial compression, bending, internal gas thermal cycle tests and limit load (failure) tests. This test procedure was performed with one sample. Four samples were tested to failure. Table 1 contains a summary of the tasks performed by SES. The project started with the delivery of test samples by Mr. Watts. Pipe from the previous round of tests was used for the new samples. Figure 1 shows the structural and sealing results relative to the pipe body. Sample 1 was used to determine the torque capacity of the connection. Torque was applied to the capacity of SES's equipment which was 28, 424 ft-lbs. From this, an initial recommended torque range of 7, 200 to 8, 800 ft-lbs. was selected. The sample was disassembled and while there was no galling observed in the threads, the end of the pin had collapsed inward. Sample 2 received three makeups. Breakouts 1 and 2 also had collapsing of the pin end, with no thread galling. From these make/breaks, it was decided {{to reduce the amount of}} lubricant applied to the connection by applying it to the box or pin only and reducing the amount applied. Samples 3 and 4 received one makeup only. Sample 5 initially received two make/breaks to test for galling resistance before final makeup, No galling was observed. Later, three additional make/breaks were performed with no pin end collapse and galling over 1 / 2 a thread occurring on one of the breakouts. During the make/break tests, the stabbing and hand tight makeup of the WW connection was found to be very easy and trouble free. There was no tendency to crossthread, even when stabbed at an angle, and it screwed together very smoothly up to hand tight. During power tight makeup, there was no heat generated in the box (as checked by hand contact) and no jerkiness associated with any of the makeups or breakouts. Sample 2 was tested in pure compression. The maximum load obtained was 1, 051 kips and the connection was beginning to significantly deform as the sample buckled. Actual pipe yield was 1, 226 kips. Sample 3 was capped-end pressure tested to failure. The capped-end yield pressure of the pipe was 16, 572 psi and the sample began to leak at 12, 000 psi. Sample 4 was tested in pure tension. The maximum load obtained was 978 kips and the connection failed by fracture at the pin critical section. Actual pipe yield was 1, 226 kips. Sample 5 was tested in combined tension/compression and internal gas pressure. The sample was assembled, setup and tested four times. The first time was with a torque of 7, 298 ft-lbs and the connection leaked halfway to ISO Load Point 2 with loads of 693 kips and 4, 312 psi. The second time the torque was increased to 14, 488 ft-lbs and a leak occurred at 849 kips and 9, 400 psi, which was ISO Load Point 2. The third time the makeup torque was again increased, to 20, 456 ft-lbs, and a leak occurred at 716 kips and 11, 342 psi, ISO Load Point 4. The fourth test was with the same torque as before, 20, 617 ft-lbs, and the connection successfully tested up to load step 56, ISO Load Point 6 (second round) before leaking at 354 kips and 11, 876 psi. At this point, time and funds prevented additional testing to be performed...|$|R
