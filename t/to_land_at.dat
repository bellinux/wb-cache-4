On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>at</b> Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>at</b> Penshurst due to a combination of the weather and running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921.

5|$|The Director Task Force's commander—Brigadier General Julian W. Cunningham—issued {{orders for}} the landing on 4December. He {{directed}} that the Task Force would initially capture the Arawe Peninsula and its surrounding islands and establish an outpost on the trail leading to the Pulie River. The {{main body of the}} Director Task Force was <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>at</b> House Fireman Beach on the Arawe Peninsula at about dawn. Two troop-sized forces would conduct separate operations about an hour before the main landing. One troop was to capture Pitoe Island to the peninsula's south, as it was believed that the Japanese had established a radio station and a defensive position there which commanded the entrance to Arawe Harbor. The other troop was <b>to</b> <b>land</b> <b>at</b> Umtingalu and establish a blocking position on the coastal trail east of the peninsula. Once the beachhead was secure, amphibious patrols would be conducted {{to the west of the}} peninsula in an attempt to make contact with the Marines at Cape Gloucester. U.S.Navy personnel on the planning staff were concerned about these subsidiary landings, as a night-time landing conducted at Lae in September had proven difficult.|$|E
