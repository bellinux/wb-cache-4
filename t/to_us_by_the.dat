No dates are known for any of these writings. Since Hanaoka himself made only manuscript copies and none were ever published, it is doubtful if many copies of his surgical writings are now extant.|$|E
25|$|Next to {{the study}} of the Scriptures which I earnestly inculcate, I exhort my pupils to peruse Calvin’s Commentaries, which I extol in loftier terms than Helmich himself (a Dutch divine, 15511608); for I affirm that he excels beyond {{comparison}} in the interpretation of Scripture, and that his commentaries ought to be more highly valued than all that is handed down <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> library of the fathers; so that I acknowledge him to have possessed above most others, or rather above all other men, what may be called an eminent spirit of prophecy. His Institutes ought to be studied after the (Heidelberg) Catechism, as containing a fuller explanation, but with discrimination, like the writings of all men.|$|E

With the {{permission}} of the court, Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at his home, where the recently arrived Reverend John Davenport was also staying. [...] All week the two ministers worked with her and, under their supervision, she had written out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that had formerly brought objection. [...] Hutchinson stood at the next meeting, on Thursday, 22 March, and read her recantation in a subdued voice to the congregation. [...] She admitted to having been wrong about the soul and spirit, wrong about the resurrection of the body, wrong in prophesying the destruction of the colony, wrong in her demeanour toward the ministers, and, most remarkably, agreed that sanctification could be evidence of justification (a covenant of works) [...] "as it flowes from Christ and is witnessed <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Spirit".

The origin of the obsolete term [...] "plastique" [...] dates back to the Nobel 808 explosive introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British in 1940. The samples of explosive brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>U.S.</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Tizard Mission had already been packaged <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SOE ready for dropping via parachute container to the French Resistance and were therefore labelled in French, as Explosif Plastique.

At the same time, according to the reports presented at its 1922 congress, the FPSR claimed 12,000 members, of which 6,000 in Banat, 2,000 in Transylvania and 2,000 in Bukovina.

2500|$|On 29 June {{the armed}} constabulary began arresting the ploughmen. Large squads pounced on the {{ploughing}} parties, who offered no resistance. Dozens a day were arrested, but their places were immediately taken by {{others who had}} travelled {{from as far away}} as Waikanae. Te Whiti directed that those of the greatest mana, or prestige, should be the first to put their hands to the ploughshares, so among the first arrested were the prominent figures Titokowaru, Te Iki and Matakatea. As Taranaki jails became full, ploughmen were sent to the Mt Cook barracks in Wellington. By August almost 200 prisoners had been taken. By then, however, the protest action seemed to be having some success, with Sheehan, the Native Minister, telling Parliament on 23 July: [...] "I was not aware ...what the exact position of those lands on the west coast was. It has only been made clear <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> interruption of the surveys. It turns out that from the White Cliffs to Waitotara the whole country is strewn with unfulfilled promises." [...] A former Native Minister, Dr Daniel Pollen, also warned of the consequences of firmer government action against the Parihaka ploughmen: [...] "I warn my honourable friend that there are behind Te Whiti not two hundred men, but a great many times two hundred men." [...] All the prisons of New Zealand would not be big enough to hold them, he warned.|$|E
