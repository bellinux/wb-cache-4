50|$|Tributyltin (TBT) is an {{umbrella}} {{term for a}} class of organotin compounds which contain the (C4H9)3Sn group, with a prominent example being <b>tributyltin</b> <b>oxide.</b> For 40 years TBT {{was used as a}} biocide in anti-fouling paint, commonly known as bottom paint, applied to the hulls of ocean going vessels. Bottom paint improves ship performance and durability as it reduces the rate of biofouling (the growth of organisms on the ship's hull). Unfortunately, the TBT slowly leaches out into the marine environment where it is highly toxic toward nontarget organisms.

In future, improved cost-effective use of molluscicides will require more precise knowledge of schistosomiasis transmission patterns in each endemic area and improved application techniques. In snail control studies using controlled-release formulations only the organotins, especially <b>tributyltin</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO), have given satisfactory long-term results. However, large-scale field trials of organotin formulations have not been implemented and their use cannot be recommended as their chronic toxicity in mammals has not yet been determined.

Recently, {{questions have been raised}} regarding the potential adverse environmental impact of organotin compounds, particularly the <b>tributyltin</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO) and the tributyltin chloride (TBTC), as residues leached from ships and boats treated with antifouling paints containing these two compounds.

40|$|There {{is still}} {{concern about the}} effects of organotin {{compounds}} (OTs) on marine organisms, and especially on their reproductive systems.

The primary {{purpose of this study is}} to find biomarkers for evaluation of the effects of TBTO on fish spermatogenesis. We used cDNA subtraction and differential display methods to clone genes differentially expressed in the mummichog testis by TBTO exposure. Six downregulated genes have been identified to date. A GenBank homology search revealed that these genes were homologous to the arginase II gene, a testicular type of creatine kinase gene, two different types of dynein heavy-chain genes, a mitochondrial carrier gene, and a functionally unidentified gene. Real-time PCR revealed that exposure of the fish to 4 m g/L of TBTO significantly reduced expression of at least three of the six genes: those encoding creatine kinase, a dynein heavy chain, and the functionally unidentified gene in the testis. In the 4 m g/L exposure group, significant reduction in spermatogenic cell proliferation and significant increase in numbers of apoptotic germ cells in the testis were observed. These genes can therefore be used as biomarkers for evaluating the effects of TBTO on fish spermatogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Previously, {{we studied}} {{the effects of}} {{deoxynivalenol}} (DON) and <b>tributyltin</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO) on whole genome mRNA expression profiles of human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells. These studies indicated that DON induces ribotoxic stress and both DON and TBTO induced ER stress which resulted into T-cell activation and apoptosis. The first goal {{of the present study}} was to provide final proof for these mode of actions by comparing the effects of 6 h exposure to DON and TBTO on mRNA expression to those of positive controls of ribotoxic stress (anisomycin), ER stress (thapsigargin) and T cell activation (ionomycin). Genes affected by anisomycin and the majority of genes affected by thapsigargin were affected in the same direction by DON and TBTO, respectively, confirming the expected modes of action. Pathway analysis further sustained that DON induces ribotoxic stress and both DON and TBTO induce unfolded protein response (UPR), ER stress, T cell activation and apoptosis. The second goal was to assess whether DON and/or TBTO affect other pathways above those detected before. TBTO induced groups of genes that are involved in DNA packaging and heat shock response that were not affected by thapsigargin. DON did not affect other genes than anisomycin indicating the effect of DON to be restricted to ribotoxic stress. This study also demonstrates that comparative gene expression analysis is a very promising tool for the identification of modes of action of immunotoxic compounds...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tributyltin</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO) is an organotin {{compound}} that {{is widely used}} as a biocide in agriculture and as an antifouling agent in paints. TBTO is toxic for many cell types, particularly immune cells. The present study aimed to identify the effects of TBTO on the human T lymphocyte cell line Jurkat. Cells were treated with 0. 2 and 0. 5 µM TBTO for 3, 6, 12 and 24 h and then subjected to whole genome gene expression microarray analysis. The biological interpretation of the gene expression profiles revealed that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is among the earliest effects of TBTO. Simultaneously or shortly thereafter, oxidative stress, activation of NFKB and NFAT, T cell activation, and apoptosis are induced. The effects of TBTO on genes involved in ER stress, NFAT pathway, T cell activation and apoptosis were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Activation and nuclear translocation of NFATC 1 and the oxidative stress response proteins NRF 2 and KEAP 1 were confirmed by immunocytology. Taking advantage of previously published microarray data, we demonstrated that the induction of ER stress, oxidative stress, T cell activation and apoptosis by TBTO is not unique for Jurkat cells but does also occur in mouse thymocytes both ex vivo and in vivo and rat thymocytes ex vivo. We propose that the induction of ER stress leading to a T cell activation response {{is a major factor}} in the higher sensitivity of immune cells above other types of cells for TBTO...|$|E
40|$|A {{toxicogenomics}} {{approach was}} applied to assess {{the usefulness of the}} mouse cytotoxic T cell line CTLL- 2 for in vitro immunotoxicity testing. CTLL- 2 cells were exposed for 6 h to two model immunotoxic compounds: (1) the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON, 1 and 2 µM), a ribotoxic stress inducer, and (2) the organotin compound <b>tributyltin</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO, 100 and 200 nM), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducer. Effects on whole-genome mRNA expression were assessed by microarray analysis. The biological interpretation of the microarray data indicated that TBTO (200 nM) induced genes involved in T cell activation, ER stress, NF¿B activation and apoptosis, which agreed very well with results obtained before on TBTO exposed Jurkat cells and mouse primary thymocytes. Remarkably, DON (2 µM) downregulated genes involved in T cell activation, ER stress and apoptosis, which is opposite to results obtained before for DON-exposed Jurkat cells and mouse primary thymocytes. Furthermore, the results for DON in CTLL- 2 cells are also opposite to the results obtained for TBTO in CTLL- 2 cells. In agreement with the lack of induction of ER stress and apoptosis, viability assays showed that CTLL- 2 cells are much more resistant to the toxicity of DON than Jurkat cells and primary thymocytes. We propose that CTLL- 2 cells lack the signal transduction that induces ER stress and apoptosis in response to ribotoxic stress.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to assess the {{potential}} of the mouse thymoma EL- 4 cell line in screening for chemical induced immunotoxicity. Therefore, EL- 4 cells were exposed to two well-known immunotoxicants, organotin compound <b>tributyltin</b> <b>oxide</b> (TBTO, 0. 5 and 1 µM for 3 or 6 h) and the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON, 0. 25, 0. 5 and 1 µM for 3, 6 or 11 h). Previous studies in human Jurkat T cells and mouse thymus in vivo showed that the primary mode of action of TBTO is induction of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, T cell activation and apoptosis. DON induces ribotoxic stress and, similarly to TBTO, induces ER stress, T cell activation and apoptosis. In the present study, the effects of TBTO and DON on EL- 4 mRNA expression were assessed by whole genome microarray analysis. The microarray data were then compared to those obtained with mouse thymuses in vivo, mouse thymocytes in vitro, and CTLL- 2 cells and human Jurkat cells in vitro exposed to TBTO or DON. Analysis at the level of gene sets revealed that part of the previously detected modes of action of TBTO and DON were not observed in the EL- 4 cell line. In EL- 4 cells, TBTO induced genes involved in calcium signalling and ER stress but did not induce genes involved in T cell activation and apoptosis. DON induced RNA related processes and ribosome biogenesis. Furthermore, DON downregulated ER stress, T cell activation and apoptosis which is opposite to the mechanism of DON observed in the mouse thymus in vivo and in Jurkat T cells in vitro. Apparently, EL- 4 cells lack factors that are necessary to link ribotoxic stress to ER stress. In addition, of the lack of T cell activation response of EL- 4 cells to TBTO is likely due to the fact that these cells are in a constitutively activated state already. Based on the results obtained for TBTO and DON, it can be concluded that the EL- 4 cell line has limited value for immunotoxicogenomics based screening...|$|E
40|$|Within this {{investigation}} a more environmentally friendly strategy was pursued to obtain antifouling compounds with higher biocompatibility {{based on the}} chemical defenses of sessile marine organisms. Marine algae and cyanobacteria have {{shown to be a}} good example of them representing actually a rich source of potential natural high value antifouling compounds. During this work, it was desired to evaluate or demonstrate the technical feasibility to obatain natural antifouling compounds using an approach through the development of a bioprocess. To achieve this goal it was necessary to aboard several involved aspects from the perspective of different disciplines such as microbiology, chemistry, and biochemical engineering. The brown alga Sargassum muticum and cyanobacteria Geitlerinema sp. were evaluated as producers of bioactive natural antibiofouling compounds and extractions methods were developed to get a preconcentration of these compounds into crude extracts. These experiments comprised a comparison of antimicrobial activity of culture medium extracts (from the cyanobacterial strain Flo 1) obtained using two polymeric resins (AmberliteTM XAD- 16 and XAD- 1180) for pre-concentration of exometabolites as well as physiological studies relating growth with excretion of these bioactive compounds. Concerning to the first point, the yield of extraction of crude medium extract (mg of crude extract mL- 1 of supernatant) was calculated for cultures of different ages and the two mentioned resins. In all the cases, {{it was found that the}} obtained culture media extracts of Geitlerinema sp. exhibited antimicrobial activity after one week of cultivation. The potential of these crude extracts as potential antifouling agent was demonstrated by the determination of their antimicrofouling activity upon a number of bacteria and fungi, using microdilution methods and taking as reference the chemical biocides TBTO (bis (<b>tributyltin)</b> <b>oxide)</b> and zinc pyrithione. The task to develop antifouling compounds from natural sources were supported by the establishment of analytical methods-(ESI) MS/MS, GC-FID, GC-MS) which enabled the identification and quantification of bioactive substances present in the crude extracts. Several exometabolites produced by Geitlerinema sp could be identified (harmane, norharmane and 4, 4 -dihydroxybiphenyl). The synthesis of bioactive compounds with antimicrobial activity, excreted by marine organisms, strongly depends on their growth conditions, therefore also the effect of cultivation conditions of microorganisms on the production and excretion of antimicrobial metabolites have been investigated. To improve the light uptake rate from the photosyntetic cells a flat-photo bioreactor module for the cultivation of filamentous cyanobacteria was designed. It was evaluated the production of antimicrobial compounds using cyanobacterial cells forming a biofilm on the surface of a flat-fotobioreactor operating in batch-modus under different conditions of illumination. From these results, it can be concluded that the technical feasibility (basic design) for the continuous production of antifouling compounds from the culture of marine bacteria is possible, but it needs to be improved with respect to: (i) the stability on the production and excretion of the metabolites by the microorganisms, (ii) a better understanding the mechanisms that regulate their expression and (iii) the yield and grade of recovery during the separation of the compounds...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was the {{improvement}} of the assessment of the natural function of soils as a habitat for soil organisms. The first sub-goal was to derive soil values for the path ‘soil – soil organisms’. Using the DIBAEX-method soil values (HC 5) were derived separately based on NOEC/EC 0 - 20 - and EC 30 - 60 -values for soil invertebrates, plants and microbial processes for 8 heavy metals and 4 organic compounds. The calculated values were checked for plausibility according to various parameters. For five of the heavy metals the calculated soil values were plausible for both effect levels, for another two metals the values were plausible with restrictions. For chrome the calculated values were regarded as not plausible and were not considered when further using the soil values {{in the course of the}} work. The soil values for the four organic compounds were all plausible with restrictions. The HC 5 based on NOEC/EC 0 - 20 data for BaP and the HC 5 based on EC 30 - 60 data for PAH were regarded as not plausible and were also not further considered. The second sub-goal was the application of ecotoxicological tests with earthworms and springtails as an example. First, dose-response tests were performed with zinc nitrate and <b>tributyltin</b> <b>oxide</b> in nine natural soils and OECD artificial soil and second, six contaminated soils from different legacy sites were assessed. Earthworm and springtail reproduction tests and earthworm avoidance tests were performed in the laboratory according to internationally standardized ISO guidelines. Additionally, in parallel and in comparison to the earthworm reproduction test the bait lamina method was used as a screening test. The results (e. g., EC 50) of the dose-response tests differed between the different soils. The earthworm avoidance test was similar in sensitivity in the tests with zinc nitrate compared to the earthworm reproduction test while the latter was mostly more sensitive in the tests with TBT-O. The bait lamina test was comparable in sensitivity to the earthworm reproduction test and might be used as a future screening method in the laboratory. In the contaminated field soils the chronic earthworm and springtail tests showed clear effects in two of the six soils since no juveniles were produced by either species. Another two soils caused a strong effect in the earthworm tests as the reproduction was less than 50 % of the control. For the remaining two soils no effects were observed. According to the results of the earthworm avoidance tests two soils showed an effect on the avoidance behaviour. The results were mostly confirmed by the bait lamina method. Based on these results the habitat function in three of the six soils was regarded as not fulfilled. Another soil was regarded as conspicuous. Finally, the third sub-goal was the application of the results and findings obtained so far on a total of 20 soils of different contamination from two remediation sites in Hamburg, Germany. These soils were assessed regarding exceeding of the previously derived soil values and the results of the practical testing in the laboratory. The comparison of both assessments showed that exceeding of soil values frequently predicted effects on soil animals. However, in many cases the results of the laboratory testing led to a different assessment than the exceeding of soil values. This could mean that despite low contamination the habitat function of the soil was still considered as not fulfilled. On the other hand strong nominal contamination in some cases did not necessarily lead to a toxic effect on soil organisms. The latter was a good example for results of ecotoxicological tests being also able to relieve a soil in its assessment. The combined assessment of the soils led to the conclusion that in 12 of 20 cases the habitat function was regarded as not fulfilled. In five cases the habitat function was considered to be fulfilled. In three cases no final assessment was possible and further investigations would be needed. In an outlook chapter precise recommendations could be given regarding a future concept for the chemical biological assessment of the habitat function of soils based on the TRIAD approach and need for further research and development efforts was identified. The combination of ecotoxicological testing and chemical-analytical investigations in comparison with soil values derived on the basis of ecotoxicological data may considerably improve the assessment of the habitat function of soils...|$|E
