50|$|Moving to a {{monocoque}} body usually {{has a negative}} impact on towing capacity. The new Explorer will be available with an optional <b>trailer</b> <b>tow</b> package. The package includes a Class III trailer hitch, engine oil cooler, trailer electrics connector, trailer sway control (TSC), wiring harness and a rear-view camera with trailer alignment assistance to help in backing up to a trailer. If equipped with the <b>trailer</b> <b>tow</b> package the new 2011 Explorer will be able to tow up to 5000 lb of braked trailer. That is 1500 lb greater than the towing capacity stated for the Explorer America concept and 2115 lb less than the outgoing Explorer's towing capacity, although that was only available with the 4.6 L V8 engine.|$|E
50|$|Some unique {{points to}} {{highlight}} of the 2008, 2009 & 2010 F-450 with a regular production pickup bed, which was only offered as a chassis cab before. It has 2 available axle ratios of 4.30 and 4.88:1. The F-450 Super Duty with the optional 'High Capacity <b>Trailer</b> <b>Tow</b> Package' increases the GCWR from 26,000 to 33000 lb. Maximum payload is 6120 lb. Maximum towing is 24500 lb (4.88 axle ratio) / 20500 lb (4.30 axle ratio). It comes standard with Crew Cab, 8 ft long bed, DRW (Dual Rear Wheels), Limited Slip rear axle, 10-lug 19.5 in Forged wheels made by Alcoa, <b>Trailer</b> <b>Tow</b> package, and the TowCommand TBC (Trailer Brake Controller). The only engine offered in the F-450 Super Duty is the 6.4 L V8 Power Stroke Sequential turbo diesel. The F-450 {{is equipped with a}} standard 6-speed manual or optional 5-speed TorqShift automatic transmission.|$|E

50|$|Engine choices {{include the}} all new 3.6 L Pentastar V6 and 5.7 L Hemi V8. The Hemi V8 retains the Multiple Displacement System (MDS) that shuts down four {{cylinders}} in low-power driving situations. And the V8 remains {{coupled with the}} multi-speed automatic transmission which includes Electronic Range Selection (ERS) to manually limit the high gear operating range. <b>Trailer</b> <b>tow</b> is rated 7400 lb for Hemi models and 5000 lb for Pentastar models.|$|E
50|$|For 2013, the F-150 {{received}} {{minor changes}} such as 3 new grilles (replacing all 4 previous grilles), new optional 18-, 20-, or 22-inch wheels, Sync with MyFord, MyFord Touch navigation system, new power-folding and telescoping <b>trailer</b> <b>tow</b> mirrors (taken from the Super Duty models), high-intensity discharge headlamps, 3 new color options (Blue Jeans Metallic, Kodiak Brown Metallic and Ruby Red Clearcoat Metallic), new Alcantara seats in the FX Appearance Package, black or pecan leather in Platinum, {{the return of the}} Limited model and the 6.2-liter V8 being made available in XLT, FX2, and FX4 (SuperCab and SuperCrew only).|$|E
50|$|Additionally, many {{pickup trucks}} come {{equipped}} with {{one to three}} mounting holes placed in the center area of the rear bumper to accommodate the mounting of <b>trailer</b> <b>tow</b> balls. The ones on the extreme left or right are often used by drivers in rural areas who tow wide farm equipment on two-lane roads. The far side mounting allows for the item (trailer, etc.) being towed to be further away from {{the opposite side of}} the road (oncoming traffic, etc.). Caution must be taken when using the bumper of a pickup truck for towing rather than using a frame mounted receiver hitch, as the bumper does not provide for as much strength and therefore is generally used to tow lighter loads. Weight ratings for both bumper-mounted and frame-mounted receiver hitches can be found on bumper of pickup trucks (for bumper-mounted tow balls) and on the receiver hitch (for frame-mounted receiver hitches). Many pickup trucks without frame-mounted receiver hitches often use the rear bumper, especially if the pickup truck is a light duty (not full size) pickup truck.|$|E

5000|$|Styled by Andrew Jacobson (designer of the 1997 Ford F-150) and Moray Callum, {{aside from}} taillamp lenses and the tailgate, the Super Duty F-Series trucks share no visible {{exterior}} parts with the Ford F-150. Under the skin, only the base-equipment 5.4L V8 and 4R100 transmission are shared. While sharing the similar aerodynamic cab design of its smaller counterpart, {{the exterior of}} the Super Duty trucks are much different forward of the windshield. While an influence often to the 1994-2001 Dodge Ram, the Super Duty also derives elements of styling from much larger Ford trucks, including the Ford LTL-9000 and Aeromax, with a raised hoodline, large grille, and low fenders. A feature drawn from 1996 redesign of the Louisville/Aeromax was {{in the design of the}} side window openings: the front portion is lowered, allowing for increased side visibility (as well as larger sideview mirrors). To improve aerodynamics over metal-framed mirrors, manual-telescoping <b>trailer</b> <b>tow</b> mirrors were available as an option. As an industry first, 2 large complete ring-style front tow hooks were included. A minor update occurred in the 2002 model year which saw a new instrument cluster with a digital odometer.|$|E
