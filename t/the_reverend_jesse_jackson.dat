40|$|This essay {{addresses}} the {{significant changes in}} power relationships {{brought about by the}} candidacy of <b>the</b> <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> Louis <b>Jackson</b> for President of the United States. Specifically, it will attempt to focus on themes or issues reflecting the impact of his entry into the contest for the Democratic nomination as a viable Black candidate in November 1983, and the consequent redefinition of power relationships which occurred not only within the Democratic Party, but between Blacks and Whites, Blacks and Jews, Black elected and appointed officials, and his effort on relative deprivation among the people in the Rainbow coalition that he represented. Therefore, issues of racism, coalition building, networking (specifically, within the Black church), leverage, pluralistic politics, {{and the role of the}} media in image- making and image-breaking will be touched upon...|$|R

25|$|Despite poor showings in the Iowa caucus (1.6%) and the New Hampshire primary (8%), Brown soon {{managed to}} win narrow {{victories}} in Maine, Colorado, Nevada, and Vermont, {{but he continued}} {{to be considered a}} small threat for much of the campaign. It was not until shortly after Super Tuesday, when the field had been narrowed to Brown, former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, and front-runner then-Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, that Brown began to emerge as a major contender {{in the eyes of the}} press. On March 17, Brown forced Tsongas from the race when he received a strong third-place showing in the Illinois primary and then defeated the senator for second place in the Michigan primary by a wide margin. Exactly one week later, he cemented his position as a major threat to Clinton when he eked out a narrow win in the bitterly fought Connecticut primary. As the press focused on the primaries in New York and Wisconsin, which were both to be held on the same day, Brown, who had taken the lead in polls in both states, made a gaffe: He announced to an audience of various leaders of New York City's Jewish community that, if nominated, he would consider <b>the</b> <b>Reverend</b> <b>Jesse</b> <b>Jackson</b> as a vice-presidential candidate. Jackson, who had made a pair of anti-semitic comments about Jews in general, and New York City's Jews in particular, while running for president in 1984, was still mistrusted within the Jewish community. Jackson also had ties to Louis Farrakhan, infamous for his own anti-semitic statements, and with Yasir Arafat, the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Brown's polling numbers suffered. On April 7, he lost narrowly to Bill Clinton in Wisconsin (37%–34%), and dramatically in New York (41%–26%).|$|E
