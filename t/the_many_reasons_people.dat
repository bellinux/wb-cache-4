While metropolitan areas − primarily on the peripheries of the Plains − have expanded, significant interior portions have experienced decades of outmigration and the challenges that accompany the exodus. Geographers have explored the interplay between rural population loss and service consolidation, <b>the</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>people</b> leave, the age-specific dynamics of those leaving, and the varied strategies being employed at different scales to coax people back. The vantage point of the residents who remain in emptying spaces has received little attention, however. Grounded theory guided a sequential mixed method approach {{to gain a better}} perspective on the aspects of place that contribute to an individual’s rootedness in the most rural and depopulating portions of the central Great Plains. Questionnaires were mailed in 2015 to 1, 000 randomly-sampled households in ten counties of Kansas and Nebraska. Counties were selected on the most rural USDA ERS Rural-Urban Continuum and Urban-Influence Codes, ERS typology identifying population loss, and the most geographically-remote USDA Frontier and Remote Area designation. Focus groups were conducted after the mailed questionnaires in the county seats of three of counties that received the mailed survey. Correlation and contingency analyses were used to explore relationships within the closed-ended questionnaire responses for statistical significance. Open-ended responses provided depth to the closed-ended material. Results of the focus groups provided rich qualitative data that triangulated with quantitative results and offered a holistic view of the aspects of place encouraging someone to remain in a depopulating region. The elements of place encouraging rootedness were similar between the responses on the mailed questionnaire and those from the participants in the three focus groups. Rootedness was most associated with a sense of belonging. Rooted respondents also indicated that they felt good about where they live. In addition, many rooted individuals perceive themselves to be insiders in the community and view community spirit to be strong. Questionnaire results suggest that being involved with the community had a positive relationship with levels of rootedness. Rooted respondents {{were also more likely to}} perceive the visual appearance of their nearby surroundings favorably. A significant concern was the need for more vocational services within the focal study counties. A lack of sufficient trained individuals was seen as a reflection of institutional fast-tracking of students out of the area combined with a lack of support for motivating young people to apply their skills locally. Communities within the study area are not in danger of disappearing anytime soon, but their populations’ continued downward trajectory undermines their viability over the long term. Strategies like a shift in local educational approaches and inclusive activities aimed at those more likely to leave may encourage new roots to be put down or nurture roots to grow deeper, thus helping to curb outmigration...|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> why <b>people</b> {{eat what}} they eat are complex. Many health {{challenges}} are attributable to diet. Knowledge about {{the underlying causes of}} people's diet can be used in health promotion activities that can empower the population {{to be able to make}} healthy choices. Method: This study looks at the relationship between habits, socioeconomic status and intake of vegetables, fruit, soda and sweets, and compares the diet in a group of participants at the age of 13 and 30. Data were obtained from The Norwegian Longitudinal Health Behavior Study", a longitudinal cohort from 22 schools in Hordaland County in Norway. Results: The higher education the participants' mother had, the higher vegetable intake the participants had. Participants with higher income at the age of 30 had higher intake of fruit and soda, and lower intake of vegetables and sweets compared to participants with lower income. The higher intake of fruit, vegetables and sweets the participants had at the age of 13, the higher intake they had of the same food group at the age of 30. Participants with higher vegetable intake at the age of 13 had a lower soda intake at the age of 30, compared with participants with lower vegetable intake at the age of 13. Conclusion: Socioeconomic status and habits are associated with diet. Programs to help children form good habits are needed.

However, in the United States, the high cost of desalination has historically hindered interest in seawater as a possible fresh water supply. Sensitive to the issue of cost as a limitation to realizing large scale implementation of seawater desalination, engineers, scientists, and the manufacturing industry have worked {{over the last two decades}} to reduce both the capital and operating cost associated with desalinated water. The Affordable Desalination Collaboration (ADC) is a California non-profit organization composed of a group of leading companies and agencies in the desalination industry that have agreed to pool their resources and share their expertise in the mission to realize the affordable desalination of seawater. Using a combination of proven technologies, the ADC has demonstrated that seawater reverse osmosis can be used to produce water at an affordable cost comparable to other supply alternatives. As a result, the ADC is pleased to announce their mission is a success. Desalination is affordable and can provide another cost effective tool to water agencies seeking a diverse water supply portfolio. The ADC’s demonstration scale seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) plant completed over six months of testing at the US Navy’s Seawater Desalination Test Facility in Port Hueneme, California in March of 2006. Three membranes were tested while varying flux and recovery to estimate the most affordable operating point.

40|$|Hunting {{and fishing}} are {{important}} parts of Nebraska’s rich heritage. These time-honored outdoor pursuits are important to overall lifestyle, well-being and natural resources {{of the citizens of}} Nebraska. The North American Model for Conservation was based primarily on the activism from our nation’s hunters and anglers. Their role helped develop and instill the seven basic premises of the model: Wildlife is to be held in public trust, there should be an elimination of market hunting, wildlife should be allocated by law, there should be hunting/angling opportunities for all citizens, wildlife should only be killed for legitimate reasons, wildlife should be considered an international resource, and science should be the basis for wildlife policy. This model of conservation has been holding strong for over 150 years in this country, and although other groups have taken an active interest in conservation, it has primarily been our hunters and anglers that have taken the greatest activist and financial role in continuance of this conservation effort (RMEF 2006). In 1937, the Pittman-Robertson Act and in 1950 the Dingell-Johnson Act established a secure and highly supportive source of funding for fish and wildlife management, greatly enhancing the North American Conservation Model’s ability to sustain nationwide conservation efforts. Along with hunters and anglers paying for conservation via permits and excise taxes, they contributed $ 75 billion to the economy nationwide in 2006 (USFWS 2007). In Nebraska, Fishing and Hunting impacted the economy with nearly $ 376 million in 2006 (USFWS 2007). Unfortunately, this tidal wave of funding and economic impact will not continue unless we maintain one of our most important stakeholders, our hunters and anglers. Total numbers of hunters and anglers per state have been recorded by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for many years, in part, to help in the distribution of federal excise taxes between states. These numbers have fluctuated throughout the years, with record highs in the 1960 s, and lows in the mid 1980 s. In the past ten years (1997 - 2007) there has been a loss of 18, 579 hunters and 36, 272 anglers (USFWS Online Federal License Certification). Although the west-north central region has not seen as great a decline in hunters as other regions, it is still alarming the rate at which our hunters and anglers are leaving the sport. In an effort to get a better idea of who Nebraska hunters and anglers were, data analysis of four years (2002 - 2005) of permit information was completed for both hunting and fishing (DJ Case 2007, Southwick 2006). Along with basic demographic information, “Tapestry” software was used to identify the Lifemodes and Segments of our hunters and anglers. Tapestry software uses a combination of geographic information software and Census Bureau Information to find common attributes of neighborhoods. This information can then be used to target certain segments more effectively, whether by a specific media type or having general understanding a neighborhoods socio-demographics. The top lifemode group of Nebraska anglers and hunters was called “Factories and Farms” a group that is described as: “Small towns often in America’s breadbasket states, lower income, married, employed in agriculture and manufacturing. ” The top segment of Nebraska anglers and hunters is “Prairie Living” described as: “Midwest small farms mostly, average age 40, married, half have kids, typical income, pets, country music, hunts and fishes. ” The segment with the greatest opportunity to increase hunting and fishing participation is “Prairie Living” (described above), and “Green Acres” described as: “Married with kids, blue collar baby boomers with college education, above average income, suburban fringe, do-it-yourselfers, outdoor types. ” This information should help our agency to focus on the correct group of people in the most efficient manner. <b>The</b> <b>many</b> <b>reasons</b> why <b>people</b> do or do not hunt and/or fish are referred to as motivations or constraints. Current literature cites that hunters are motivated to participate in the sport because they enjoyed that type of recreation, like the meat they harvested, enjoyed being in nature, have an investment in the sport, and like being with friends and family (Duda et al. 1995), and further, {{they are more likely to}} continue if they gain multiple satisfactions from hunting (Hendee 1974). Constraints to hunting can be seen at the individual and/or macro levels. Macro level constraints include distance from good hunting or fishing locations, public access for the type of hunting or fishing pursued and urbanization. At the individual level, constraints include lack of social support, having time to hunt or fish, poor health, and financial situations (Duda et al. 1995, Enck et al. 2000). More in depth information has been provided within the various goals in the “Issues” section of the plan. Along with the more traditional reasons to hunt and fish, there is a worldwide movement that emphasizes the mental and physical benefits to being in the outdoors (Louv 2005). There has been a link to stress reduction after being in a natural environment (Wells and Evans 2003). Dr. Paul Quinett preaches that the act of fishing is something that helps to instill and maintain hope and relieve stress, which leads to a lower incident of suicide by participants (Quinnett 1994). Still other studies promote unstructured “play” in the outdoors for children as a way to battle obesity, Attention Deficit Disorder, and depression (Taylor et al 2001). Studies also show that outdoor “play” adds to cognitive and intellectual abilities (Wells 2000). While outdoor activities such as soccer and golf are positive, activities such as hunting, fishing, and camping, promote stronger relationships to adult environment attitudes (Wells, N. M. and K. S. Lekies, 2006). These studies all point to the greater benefits of hunting and fishing. Although these studies may not directly affect the constraints cited for hunting and fishing, they may be used to educate and encourage participation as the best use of free time and/or time spent as a family...|$|R
