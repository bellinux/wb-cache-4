The world record cable <b>tool</b> <b>well</b> was drilled in New York {{to a depth}} of almost 12,000 ft. The common Bucyrus-Erie 22 can drill down to about 1,100 ft. Since cable tool drilling does not use air to eject the drilling chips like a rotary, instead using a cable strung bailer, technically there is no limitation on depth.|$|E

30|$|Central to our claims {{regarding}} {{the effectiveness of}} Varanus as a cloud monitoring tool {{is the notion of}} elasticity. Elasticity: the propensity for cloud VMs to rapidly change in scale and composition is problematic for many monitoring activities. Elasticity has significant implications for a monitoring system and can disrupt services, interfere with failure detection, introduce latencies and incur computational costs. Any monitoring <b>tool</b> <b>well</b> suited for cloud monitoring must therefore tolerate elasticity.|$|E
