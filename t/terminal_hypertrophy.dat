40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{test the}} effects of {{sequential}} exposure to FGF 2, 9 and 18 on human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSC) differentiation during in vitro chondrogenesis. DesignControl and FGF 2 -expanded hMSC were cultured in aggregates {{in the presence of}} rhFGF 9, rhFGF 18 or rhFGFR 3 -specific signaling FGF variants, starting at different times during the chondroinductive program. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunocytochemistry were performed at different stages. The aggregate cultures were switched to a hypertrophy-inducing medium along with rhFGFs and neutralizing antibodies against FGFR 1 and FGFR 3. Histological/immunohistochemical/biochemical analyses were performed. ResultsFGF 2 -exposed hMSC during expansion up-regulated Sox 9 suggesting an early activation of the chondrogenic machinery. FGF 2, FGF 9 and 18 modulated the expression profile of FGFR 1 and FGFR 3 in hMSC during expansion and chondrogenesis. In combination with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), FGF 9 and FGF 18 inhibited chondrogenesis when added {{at the beginning of the}} program (≤d 7), while exhibiting an anabolic effect when added later (≥d 14), an effect mediated by FGFR 3. Finally, FGFR 3 signaling induced by either FGF 9 or FGF 18 delayed the appearance of spontaneous and induced hypertrophy-related changes. ConclusionsThe stage of hMSC-dependent chondrogenesis at which the growth factors are added impacts the progression of the differentiation program: increased cell proliferation and priming (FGF 2); stimulated early chondrogenic differentiation (TGF-β, FGF 9 /FGF 18) by shifting the chondrogenic program earlier; augmented extracellular matrix (ECM) production (FGF 9 /FGF 18); and delayed <b>terminal</b> <b>hypertrophy</b> (FGF 9 /FGF 18). Collectively, these factors could be used to optimize pre-implantation conditions of hMSC when used to engineer cartilage grafts...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Synovial explants furnish an in-situ {{population}} of mesenchymal stem cells for the repair of articular cartilage. Although {{bone morphogenetic protein}} 2 (BMP- 2) induces the chondrogenesis of bovine synovial explants, the cartilage formed is neither homogeneously distributed nor of an exclusively hyaline type. Furthermore, the downstream differentiation of chondrocytes proceeds to the stage of <b>terminal</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> which is inextricably coupled with undesired matrix mineralization. With a view to optimizing BMP- 2 -induced chondrogenesis, the modulating influences of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF- 2) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-ß 1) were investigated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Explants of bovine calf metacarpal synovium were exposed to BMP- 2 (200 ng/ml) for 4 (or 6) weeks. FGF- 2 (10 ng/ml) or TGF-ß 1 (10 ng/ml) was introduced {{at the onset of}} incubation and was present either {{during the first week of}} culturing alone or throughout its entire course. FGF- 2 enhanced the BMP- 2 -induced increase in metachromatic staining for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) only when it was present during the first week of culturing alone. TGF-ß 1 enhanced not only the BMP- 2 -induced increase in metachromasia (to a greater degree than FGF- 2), but also the biochemically-assayed accumulation of GAGs, when it was present throughout the entire culturing period; in addition, it arrested the downstream differentiation of cells at an early stage of hypertrophy. These findings were corroborated by an analysis of the gene- and protein-expression levels of key cartilaginous markers and by an estimation of individual cell volume. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE TGF-ß 1 enhances the BMP- 2 -induced chondrogenesis of bovine synovial explants, improves the hyaline-like properties of the neocartilage, and arrests the downstream differentiation of cells at an early stage of hypertrophy. With the prospect of engineering a mature, truly articular type of cartilage in the context of clinical repair, our findings will be of importance in fine-tuning the stimulation protocol for the optimal chondrogenic differentiation of synovial explants...|$|E
40|$|Duncan, Randall L. Funanage, Vicky L. Metatropic {{dysplasia}} (MD) is {{a severe}} skeletal dysplasia {{that results in}} {{a significant impact on}} quality of life in patients diagnosed with disease. MD is characterized by striking skeletal changes which include general shortening of long bones, widened metaphysis, and halberd shaped pelvis. Over time, patients display wedging of vertebral bodies (platyspondyly), and progressive kyphoscoliosis. These spinal changes result in reduced spinal integrity with cervical vertebrae instability, spinal stenosis and a reduced respiratory capacity. Mutations in non-selective cation channel, Transient Receptor Potential Channel Vanilloid 4 (TRPV 4) have been found to cause MD. TRPV 4 associated channelopathies also include peripheral neuropathies and other skeletal dysplasias that range in clinical severity and symptomatic phenotype. As a result, causation, classification and development of TRPV 4 channelopathies are very complex. TRPV 4 channel activity is integral in the Ca 2 + mediated response to a large variety of sensory stimulation from the extracellular environment. TRPV 4 activity can also be regulated by changes in temperature, nociception and natural and synthetic ligands, such as arachidonic acid metabolites and phorbol esters. It is most classically studied as a regulator of Ca 2 + response to changes in osmotic and mechanical forces. The spatial, temporal and intensive properties of [Ca 2 +]i as well as spontaneous Ca 2 + oscillations can {{have a profound effect on}} cell behavior. In the musculoskeletal system, TRPV 4 Ca 2 + signaling regulates the chondrogenic response to osmotic signals and anabolic chondrogenic response under mechanical loads. TRPV 4 also plays a chondroprotective role in normal articular cartilage and is imperative to maintaining joint health. Loss of TRPV 4 often results in osteoarthritis. Whereas most information pertains to normal TRPV 4 physiology and signaling, the effect of TRPV 4 mutation in terms on skeletal development has only recently been studied. Histological analysis of growth plates from lethal variants of MD revealed a highly unorganized growth plate with reduced hypertrophic regions and delayed endochondral ossification, suggesting that mutational TRPV 4 activity disrupts ordered chondrogenesis. Expression of TRPV 4 mutations in numerous cell types alludes to gain-of function activity that results in increased basal and stimulated intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) activity, as well as constitutively open channel gating. However, most studies have been performed in non-endogenous cell types that are either transfected or transformed. To better understand channel properties directly affected by disease, we studied the effect of two TRPV 4 mutations, p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp on Ca 2 + channel activity and chondrocyte function in cells directly isolated from patients with metatropic dysplasia. P. Pro 799 Leu is considered a mutational hotspot and there is a high prevalence of this specific mutation in disease, whereas p. Gly 800 Asp is a novel severe mutation identified by our group. We hypothesize that MD mutations will exhibit increased basal and stimulated [Ca 2 +]i activity that results in improper terminal differentiation of chondrocytes. We further hypothesize that this increase in channel activity is from a direct result of alteration with C-terminal regulatory domains that occur within and immediately prior to mutational occurrence. We observed temperature-dependent [Ca 2 +]i oscillations in both intact and MD chondrocytes; however, MD mutations exhibited increased peak magnitudes of [Ca 2 +]i during oscillations. We have also found increased baseline [Ca 2 +]i in MD primary cells, as well as increased [Ca 2 +]i response to either hypotonic swelling or the TRVP 4 -specific chemical agonist, GSK 1016790 A. Oscillations and stimulation responses could be blocked with TRPV 4 -specific antagonist, GSK 205. Analysis of [Ca 2 +] i response kinetics reveals that MD chondrocytes have significantly increased frequency of temperature-sensitive oscillations, as well as increased magnitude and duration of [Ca 2 +]i responses to given stimuli. Additionally, duration of the response of the novel p. Gly 800 Asp mutation to stimulation was significantly greater than the p. Pro 799 Leu mutation. The altered [Ca 2 +]i activity caused by these TRPV 4 mutations indicates that this region of the channel is essential for proper [Ca 2 +]i regulation and that these mutations result in a gain of Ca 2 + channel activity. TRPV 4 activity has been shown to mimic the expression pattern of chondrogenic markers, Col 2 a 1 and aggrecan, and modulate Sox 9 promotor activity. These data suggest that TRPV 4 is an essential regulator of chondrogenesis. We postulate that MD mutations would result in increased proliferation and reduced terminal differentiation compared to intact chondrocytes. Basally, the proliferative capacity of MD chondrocytes was unaltered compared to WT, yet both p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp chondrocytes display altered chondrogenic differentiation compared to intact chondrocytes. Proteoglycan production was dysregulated in both p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp chondrocytes with both an increase and decrease in proteoglycan production observed, respectively. Expression of chondrogenic markers after bead culture mirrored the effect observed in micromass proteoglycan production. Differential gene expression was observed in that p. Pro 799 Leu chondrocytes upregulated proliferative chondrocyte makers, COL 2 A 1, AGGRECAN and SOX 9 whereas p. Gly 800 Asp chondrocytes were downregulated in all chondrogenic markers. While the mutational effect appeared to result in opposing dysregulation, both MD chondrocytes p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp mutations exhibited decreased markers of <b>terminal</b> <b>hypertrophy,</b> COL 10 A 1 and RUNX. Therefore, while the mechanism behind regulation of TRPV 4 in chondrogenesis appears differential between, p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp, both mutations result in a disruption of normal chondrogenesis. Mutations of p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp occur directly in or prior to important regulatory domains within the C-terminal end of TRPV 4. In this region, TRPV 4 has been shown to interact with cytoskeletal proteins, MAP 7, actin and tubulin as well as proteins involved in Ca 2 + sensing, including calmodulin (CaM). We have found that similar to what was observed during chondrogenesis, dysregulation of interaction with C-terminal binding partners occurs differentially between the two mutations compared to intact chondrocytes. Actin regulation and binding was lost in p. Pro 799 Leu chondrocytes; however, microtubule binding was increased in p. Gly 800 Asp chondrocytes. Depolymerization of actin with Cytochalasin D results in a reduction in basal and stimulated Ca 2 + activity that was not observed in p. Pro 799 Leu chondrocytes. Additionally, we observed increased CaM binding in p. Pro 799 Leu that was not observed in p. Gly 800 Asp or intact chondrocytes. Abolishment of microtubules with Vincristine results in a loss of response to HTS; however, it had no effect on basal TRPV 4 activity. These data suggest a role for both actin and tubulin in the regulation of TRPV 4 activity that seems to be stimulation and mutation-dependent. In this study, we present differential modes of regulation for two metatropic dysplasia-causing mutations in the C-terminal end of the protein, p. Pro 799 Leu and p. Gly 800 Asp. Overall, our findings indicate the complex regulation of TRPV 4 activity in terms of Ca 2 + signal and downstream chondrogenic effects. We also present several possible modes of TRPV 4 channel regulation through interaction with both cytoskeletal proteins and calmodulin. Understanding the mechanisms of TRPV 4 regulation presents multiple avenues of interest for not only skeletal dysplasia causing mutations, but for future study into the maintenance of articular cartilage. In the case of osteoarthritis, the variety of signaling mechanisms we've studied provides several different approaches that could be used to target TRPV 4 as a possible therapeutic for the promotion of overall joint health.

40|$|Thyroid hormones exert a {{profound}} effect on development, growth, and metabolism of skeleton. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of thyroxine (T 4) and growth hormone (GH) on the terminal differentiation of rib growth plate chondrocytes in three-dimensional pellet culture. T 4 (30 ng/ml) stimulated the expressions of type II and X collagens, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. On the other hand, the expression of chondrogenic transcription factor Sox 9 in the T 4 treatment group decreased sig-nificantly compared to the control group. T 4 downregulates Sox 9 and promotes hypertrophy. After day 7, T 4 increases dramatically the synthesis of type X collagen mRNA, ALP activity, and cellular hypertrophy. Addition of GH does not modify the action of T 4. Thus, T 4 acts directly on chondrocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrated that T 4 enhances the cellular and molecular events of <b>terminal</b> differentiation and <b>hypertrophy</b> of chondrocytes in the three-dimensional cultures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Neurogenic Para-Osteo-Arthropathy (NPOA) {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of central nervous system injuries or some systemic conditions. They are characterized by bone formation around the main joints. Methods In order to define some biological features of NPOAs, histological and immunohistological studies of the soft tissue surrounding osteoma and Ultrasound examination (US) of NPOA before the appearance of abnormal ossification on plain radiographs were performed. Results We have observed a great number of ossifying areas scattered in soft tissues. US examination have also shown scattered ossifying areas at the early stage of ossification. A high osteogenic activity was detected in these tissues and all the stages of the endochondral process were observed. Mesenchymal cells undergo chondrocytic differentiation to further <b>terminal</b> maturation with <b>hypertrophy,</b> which sustains mineralization followed by endochondral ossification process. Conclusion We suggest that periosteoma soft tissue reflect early stage of osteoma formation and could be a model to study the mechanism of osteoma formation and we propose a mechanism of the NPOA formation in which sympathetic dystony and altered mechanical loading induce changes which could be responsible for the cascade of cellular events leading to cartilage and bone formation. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractInteractions between motoneurons {{and muscles}} {{influence}} {{many aspects of}} neuromuscular development in all animals. These interactions can be readily investigated during adult muscle development in holometabolous insects. In this study, {{the development of the}} dorsolongitudinal flight muscle (DLM) and its innervation is investigated in the moth, Manduca sexta, to address the specificity of neuromuscular interactions. The DLM develops from an anlage containing both regressed larval template fibers and imaginal myoblasts. In the adult, each fiber bundle (DLM 1 – 5) is innervated by a single motoneuron (MN 1 –MN 5), with the dorsal-most fiber bundle (DLM 5) innervated by a mesothoracic motoneuron (MN 5). The DLM failed to develop following complete denervation because myoblasts failed to accumulate in the DLM anlage. After lesioning MN 1 – 4, MN 5 retained its specificity for the DLM 5 region of the anlage and failed to rescue DLM 1 – 4. Thus specific innervation of the DLM fiber bundles does not depend on interactions among motoneurons. Myoblast accumulation, but not myonuclear proliferation, increased around the MN 5 <b>terminals,</b> producing a <b>hypertrophied</b> adult DLM 5. Therefore, motoneurons compete for uncommitted myoblasts. MN 5 terminals subsequently grew more rapidly over the hypertrophied DLM 5 anlage, indicating that motoneuron terminal expansion is regulated {{by the size of the}} target muscle anlage...|$|R

We randomized SHR at 3 – 4 months to oral hydralazine (25 mg/kg), enalapril (40 mg/kg), or placebo. Age matched Wistar Kyoto rats were controls. Group average systolic blood pressure (mmHg) at baseline was 207 (Plac), 223 (Hydrl), 225 (Enal), and 156 (Cntrl). Rats were studied after 3 months of treatment. Echocardiographic LVmass (LVM) was from the cubic function: LVM (mg) = 1. 04 [(EDD+PWT+IVS) 3 – EDD 3], corrected for body weight (LVMI), since echocardiography permits better identification of differing patterns of <b>hypertrophy.</b> <b>Terminal</b> hemodynamics were volumetric aortic flow (mean: MAF, ml/min) and Millar aortic pressure (mean: MAP). Systemic arterial resistance (SAR) and LV contractility (+dp/dt) was derived from digitized waveforms.

30|$|Therapeutic gene-based {{modification}} of bone marrow aspirates prior to re-implantation in sites of injury may enhance the chondroreparative processes {{to promote the}} formation of an improved cartilage repair tissue (Cucchiarini et al. 2014; Frisch & Cucchiarini 2016). Among the different factors reported for their chondrogenic properties (transforming growth factor beta - TGF-β, bone morphogenetic proteins - BMPs, basic fibroblast growth factor - FGF- 2, insulin-like growth factor I - IGF-I, zinc finger protein 145 - ZNF 145, Indian hedgehog - Ihh, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein - COMP) (Cucchiarini et al. 2011; Frisch et al. 2015 a; Frisch et al. 2016 a; Haleem-Smith et al. 2012; Ivkovic et al. 2010; Kawamura et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2011; Neumann et al. 2013; Pagnotto et al. 2007; Steinert et al. 2012), the sex-determining region Y-type high-mobility group box 9 (SOX 9) transcription factor might be the best suited candidate to achieve this goal. Remarkably, this transcription factor promotes both chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation (Bi et al. 1999) while advantageously restricting <b>terminal</b> differentiation and <b>hypertrophy</b> (Akiyama et al. 2004) and displays superior reparative activities in cartilage lesions in vivo over TGF-β and IGF-I (Frisch et al. 2016 b). Interestingly, sox 9 gene transfer has been already performed to initiate chondrogenic pathways in isolated human MSCs via nonviral (Babister et al. 2008) and adenoviral vectors (Kupcsik et al. 2010), but the use of such vectors for human gene therapy purposes remains limited by their relatively low and/or short-term efficacy and potential immunogenicity (Frisch et al. 2015 b). In contrast, recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors that allow to achieve higher and prolonged levels of transgene expression may be more adapted for translational approaches (Frisch et al. 2015 b). In this regard, we provided evidence of the capability of this vector class to target isolated human bone marrow-derived MSCs (Venkatesan et al. 2012) and most notably of human bone marrow aspirates (Rey-Rico et al. 2015 a) maintained in static conditions. As chondrogenic processes in the bone marrow in vivo are subjected to mechanical forces (O’Conor et al. 2013; Terraciano et al. 2007), the goal {{of the present study was}} thus to further investigate the potential chondrogenic effects mediated by sox 9 gene transfer via rAAV in human bone marrow aspirates upon continuous mechanical stimulation, using dynamic conditions that aim at reproducing a more natural environment (Madry et al. 2013).|$|R
