An extensive computational experiment shows that the gap between the costs of the heuristic solution and the lower bound is small in general (on average 1. 5 %), and that computation times are limited (e. g., 3 minutes for instances with 20 - 100 items and 5 customer classes).

The concept of baseline load is emphasized for ACL control in this paper. To obtain the <b>target</b> <b>aggregated</b> power of ACLs, an algorithm based on the principle of low-pass filter (LPF) is derived. For better robustness of the control strategy, feedback of the states of indoor temperatures is introduced for baseline load correction. A transactive control method is then put forward to allocate the <b>target</b> <b>aggregated</b> power to each ACL. This method can satisfy customers' differentiated requirements for comfort, protect the privacy and enhance the security of the controlled appliances. For the microgrid control center, it can simplify the downlink control and avoid measuring the power of uncontrolled loads which reduces the implementation cost.

40|$|For the {{investigation}} of collisions among protoplanetesimal dust aggregates, we performed microgravity experiments in which the impacts of high-porosity mm-sized dust aggregates into 2. 5 cm-sized high-porosity dust aggregates can be studied. The dust aggregates consisted of micrometer-sized dust grains and were produced by random ballistic deposition with porosities between 85 % and 93 %. Impact velocities ranged from ~ 0. 1 m/s to ~ 3 m/s and impact angles were almost randomly distributed. We also used "molded" <b>target</b> <b>aggregates</b> such that the radii of the local surface curvatures corresponded to the projectile radii. The experiments showed that impacts into the highest-porosity targets almost always led to sticking, whereas for the less porous dust aggregates, the collisions with intermediate velocities and high impact angles resulted in the bouncing of the projectile with a mass transfer from the target to the projectile aggregate. Sticking probabilities for the impacts into the "molded" <b>target</b> <b>aggregates</b> were considerably decreased. For the impacts into smooth targets, we measured the depth of intrusion and the crater volume and could derive some interesting dynamical properties which can help to derive a collision model for protoplanetesimal dust aggregates.

For this purpose a rigorous statistical method, known as Randomized Branching Sampling (RBS), has been applied for the direct assessment of carbon pools, fluxes (Net Primary Productivity) and plant surface areas in three forests. RBS is an unequal probability selection scheme that is design unbiased and efficient. Through its theory and design, RBS provides an unbiased estimate of uncertainties both at single tree and ecosystem scales. RBS designed samplings proved to be less time-consuming than traditional ones by lowering the number of sample branches needed to achieve the target precision levels and by getting rid of fresh weight measurements in the field. RBS estimates of C pools were compared and discussed to traditional estimates achieved by allometric functions fitted using the power equation Y ¼ b Xa revealing good agreement; differences between the RBS and allometric approaches were higher in older or more structured forests. Optimal scaling exponents for foliage, branch and stem components, for pool, flux and surface parameters in European beech, Scots pine and Norway spruce stands were estimated by analysis of the precision of <b>target</b> <b>aggregate</b> estimators.

One-and-half years on, the strategy is making good progress but not yet complete. Confidence in the exchange rate was maintained, the banking system was supported by its parent banks, external imbalances and inflation have largely disappeared, competitiveness is improving, and fiscal deficits are gradually being brought back towards pre-crisis levels.

40|$|Two Marshall-designed asphalt {{mixtures}} were developed with common coarse aggregate, added filler (1 % hydrated lime) and bituminous binder (5. 8 % acid-modified bitumen). The <b>target</b> <b>aggregate</b> grading and overall volumetrics {{were not significantly}} different. Different fine aggregate (dust sources) were used in each asphalt mixture. Dust A contained predominantly Nontronite clay minerals while 82 % of the Dust B clay minerals were identified as Hisingerite. Hisingerite is a rarely encountered and poorly studied clay mineral. Specialist geotechnical interpretation of its unique properties indicated potentially adverse impact on mastic stability and asphalt shear response. This research assessed the impact of Hisingerite clay on otherwise identical asphalt mastic, {{as an indicator of}} the impact of Hisingerite-rich dust sources on asphalt performance. Six M 1000 (acid-modified) bitumen samples were each used to manufacture two mastic samples, one containing each fine aggregate. The same hydrated lime was added, and all mastic samples were manufactured with constant proportions of bitumen, added filler and fine aggregate, representative of the asphalt mixture designs. Wheel tracking, resilient modulus, tensile strength and moisture resistance testing did not indicate any detrimental effects from Hisingerite-rich Dust B nor did mastic complex modulus master curves. Multiple stress creep recovery testing found the Dust B mastic to deform less than Dust A mastic under cyclic shear. This was concluded to likely reflect the lower density and higher absorption of the Dust B fine aggregate. Despite the concerning physical properties, it was concluded that the incorporation of Hisingerite-rich fine aggregate presented no risk to asphalt performance. It follows that there is no basis for additional routine testing of potential dust sources to identify Hisingerite content. This research also highlighted the importance of controlling mastic composition during testing, with further testing at a constant ‘effective’ binder volume required. Maintaining the filler dosage constant relative to the mass (or volume) of the dust (or the bitumen) must also be considered. © 2016 Taylor & Franci...|$|E

One widely explored therapeutic strategy for these conditions {{is the use of}} antibodies to <b>target</b> <b>aggregated</b> ɑS, although a detailed molecular-level mechanism of the action of such species remains elusive. Here, we characterize ɑS aggregation in vitro in the presence of two ɑS-specific single-domain antibodies (nanobodies), NbSyn 2 and NbSyn 87, which bind to the highly accessible C-terminal region of ɑS. Results We show that both nanobodies inhibit the formation of ɑS fibrils. Furthermore, using single-molecule fluorescence techniques, we demonstrate that nanobody binding promotes a rapid conformational conversion from more stable oligomers to less stable oligomers of ɑS, leading to a dramatic reduction in oligomer-induced cellular toxicity. Conclusions The results indicate a novel mechanism by which diseases associated with protein aggregation can be inhibited, and suggest that NbSyn 2 and NbSyn 87 could have significant therapeutic potential...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} Generalized Taylor Economy (GTE) {{framework}} {{in which there are}} many sectors with overlapping contracts of different lengths to analyze the design of monetary policy. We derive a utility based objective function of a central bank for this economy and use it to evaluate the performance of alternative simple rules. We find that a simple rule that targets an index that gives more weight to the sectors which have longer contracts and are more important in the aggregate index yields a welfare outcome nearly identical to the optimal policy. However, we find that potential gains in targeting sector specific inflation rates rather than the aggregate inflation rate is very sensitive to the shape of the distribution. We show that except for the cases where prices/wages are reoptimized very frequently, the performance of the sectoral rule can be closely approximated by a simple rule that <b>targets</b> <b>aggregate</b> inflation.
