25|$|To {{eliminate}} Faizani's {{strong influence}} among the upper echelons of Afghan society (especially among the military elites), in 1973 President Daoud of Afghanistan and his Communist advisors accused the Hizb-i Tawheed of organizing a coup d'etat. This accusation {{led to the}} final imprisonment of Faizani and hundreds of his disciples. It was during this last imprisonment that he suffered <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> tortures, including having his beard plucked out one hair at a time, being continually whipped, electrocuted, and having his teeth crushed.|$|E
25|$|Physicians for Human Rights {{describe}} one tactic {{employed by}} Barre's troops {{used in their}} campaign against the Isaaq people of the north:One of <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> – and clearly unlawful – tactics used by Siad Barre's troops was the deliberate mining of civilian homes. In 1988, government forces shelled and bombed the capital of Hargeisa. Before fleeing, many residents buried their valuables in holes dug in the floors or courtyards of their homes. Upon discovering these stashes, soldiers removed the jewellery and other valuables and placed booby-traps or mines in these hiding places. After the fighting ceased, {{many of those who}} had fled returned to their homes in the first months of 1991 only to be injured or killed by these hidden explosives... Some families were said to be squatting outside their houses because they were afraid to enter.... Siad Barre's forces deliberately mined wells and grazing lands in an effort to kill and terrorize nomadic herders whom the army viewed as protectors of the SNM. While direct evidence is not available, most observers agree that Siad Barre's forces undertook this extensive mining to prevent resettlement by the predominantly Isaak nomads and agriculturists. The British mine-clearing company Rimfire, contracted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to conduct de-mining activities has identified land-mines from 24 different countries in Somalia. The majority were from the Czech Republic, Russia, Pakistan and Belgium.|$|E

The episode opens with a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche's 1883–1885 treatise Thus Spoke Zarathustra—"Man is <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> animal". Guest star Donnelly Rhodes, who portrayed Peter Dumont, would later make an appearance in the third season episode [...] "...Thirteen Years Later" [...] in an unrelated role.|$|E

He stated, [...] "... for five years, {{there was a whole}} list of actors and directors who kind of marched through it. Billy Bob and I were set to do these roles in 1997, and then it fell apart. That was <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> twist for an actor, to get a part you dreamed you'd get and then they decide to scrap the whole thing." [...] Rudin considered casting Anne Heche as Hank's wife Sarah Mitchell.

Madonna is also shown in the bejeweled corset flapping around a red cape. For the final verses and chorus, Madonna in the nude corset dances among the Minotaurs, and ultimately slays them all. The last visual shows the singer standing among the slain bodies of the Minotaurs, throwing off the cape while holding a pair of horns in her left hand. Red roses fall around her and sound of applause is heard as a quote by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche flashes on screen, [...] "Man is <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> animal.

500|$|The track [...] "Junkie's Promise", sung by Moore, was {{described}} as a [...] "heroin vignette". It was originally interpreted by many as a tribute to Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. However, Moore later clarified that the song [...] "is purely about the emotional relationship between friends, one of which is a user. Any individual involved with drug addiction will lie to his friends for the self-serving need. It's <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> truth of the situation. Kurt may fit this profile and he was surely in my mind as I wrote but the song is not a specific dedication to him". Other songs such as [...] "Becuz" [...] and [...] "No Queen Blues" [...] were built upon [...] "numb grooves with slivers of melody, power, and gorgeously crafted noise". The final track on the album, [...] "The Diamond Sea", {{was described}} as a [...] "Neil Young-esque ballad billowing into an epic noise excursion". It is considered the longest track on any Sonic Youth album, excluding Sonic Youth Recordings releases. Due to its long duration, the song was edited down to 5:15 for release as a single, which also included an alternative 25-minute version as an additional track.|$|E
500|$|Having made no {{progress}} in Rome, Momolo and Marianna Mortara returned to Bologna in early December 1858, and soon afterwards moved to Turin, in Piedmont. The case—an anti-Catholic [...] "publicist's dream", to quote Kertzer—had by {{now become a}} massive controversy in both Europe and the United States, with voices across the social spectrum clamouring for the Pope to return Edgardo to his parents. Mortara became a cause célèbre not only for Jews but for Protestant Christians as well, particularly in the United States, where anti-Catholic sentiment abounded—The New York Times published more than 20 articles on the case in December 1858 alone. In Britain, The Spectator presented the Mortara case {{as evidence that the}} Papal States had [...] "the worst government in the world—the most insolvent and the most arrogant, <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> and the meanest". The Catholic press both in Italy and abroad steadfastly defended the Pope's actions. The pro-Church articles often took on an overtly anti-Semitic character, charging for example that if coverage in Britain, France or Germany was critical this was hardly a surprise [...] "since currently the newspapers of Europe are in good part {{in the hands of the}} Jews". Scazzocchio suggested that the press storm attacking the Church was actually counter-productive for the Mortara family's cause, as it angered the Pope and thereby steeled his resolve not to compromise.|$|E

2500|$|On March 29, 2001, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County charged Minsky with offenses {{committed}} against eight women between June and October 1998.

[...] Minsky's defense attorneys argued that his actions may have been morally wrong, but that he broke no law. In October 2000, the jury convicted Minsky of multiple charges of rape, oral copulation, and grand theft. On November 30, 2001, {{he was sentenced to}} 146 years to life in prison by Superior Court Judge Marsha N.

[...] His purpose, according to Seldes, was to perpetrate a pre-planned hoax that he triggered by sending an [...] "apparently harmless" [...] telegram from Madrid to Paris. The following day, American newspapers published an erroneous report that Flynn had been killed at the Spanish front. [...] "The next day he left Spain ... There were no ambulances, no medical supplies, no food for the Spanish Republic, and not one cent of money. The war correspondents said bitterly that it was <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> hoax of the time. Flynn ... had used a terrible war just to advertise one of his cheap movies", Seldes wrote.|$|E

2500|$|Mirroring the {{widening}} of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, {{the island of}} Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional Balinese caste system, and those rejecting these traditional values, particularly the PKI. Communists were publicly accused of working towards {{the destruction of the}} island's culture, religion, and character, and the Balinese, like the Javanese, were urged to destroy the PKI. Government jobs, funds, business advantage and other spoils of office had gone to Communists during the final years of Sukarno's presidency. Disputes over land and tenants' rights led to land seizures and killings, when the PKI promoted [...] "unilateral action". As Indonesia's only Hindu-dominated island, Bali did not have the Islamic forces involved in Java, and it was upper-caste PNI landlords who instigated the elimination of PKI members. High Hindu priests called for sacrifices to satisfy spirits angered by past sacrilege and social disruption. Balinese Hindu leader, Ida Bagus Oka, told Hindus: [...] "There can be no doubt [...] the enemies of our revolution are also <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> enemies of religion, and must be eliminated and destroyed down to the roots." [...] Like parts of East Java, Bali experienced a state of near civil war as Communists regrouped.|$|E

Ciardi writes, [...] "as they wallowed in blood during their lives, so they are immersed in the boiling blood forever, each according to the degree of his guilt". The Centaurs, commanded by Chiron and Pholus, patrol the ring, shooting arrows into any sinners who emerge higher out of the boiling blood than each is allowed. The centaur Nessus guides the poets along Phlegethon and points out Alexander the Great, [...] "Dionysius" [...] (either Dionysius I or Dionysius II, or both; they were bloodthirsty, unpopular tyrants of Sicily), Ezzelino III da Romano (<b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> of the Ghibelline tyrants), Obizzo d'Este, and Guy de Montfort. The river grows shallower until it reaches a ford, after which it comes full circle back to the deeper part where Dante and Virgil first approached it; immersed here are tyrants including Attila, King of the Huns (flagello in terra, [...] "scourge on earth", line 134), [...] "Pyrrhus" [...] (either the bloodthirsty son of Achilles or King Pyrrhus of Epirus), Sextus, Rinier da Corneto, and Rinier Pazzo.

[...] Mulian becomes a Buddhist and uses his new powers to travel to heaven. There his father informs him that his mother is suffering extremely in the Avīci Hell, <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> of the purgatories. Mulian descends and meets ox-headed devils who force sinners to cross the river to hell and to embrace hot copper pillars that burn away their chests. But by the time Mulian locates his mother she has been nailed down with forty-nine iron spikes. [...] He seeks Buddha's help and is given a rod to smash prison walls and release the prisoners of hell to a higher reincarnation, but his mother is not released. Mulian's mother is reborn as a hungry ghost who can never eat her fill because her neck is too thin. Mulian tries to send her food by placing it on the ancestral altar, but the food bursts into flame just as it reaches her mouth. To rescue her from this torture, the Buddha instructs Mulian and all filial sons to provide a grand feast of [...] "yülan bowls" [...] on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the time when monks emerge from their summer retreat.

2500|$|Moulay Rashid's {{successor}} was {{his brother}} Ismail (Moulay Ismail) (1672), one of <b>the</b> <b>cruelest</b> of tyrants. On his accession Ismail appointed his Jewish adviser Joseph Toledani, son of Daniel Toledani, Moulay Raschid's counselor, {{to be his}} minister, in which capacity Joseph concluded a peace between Morocco and Holland. Under Ismail's rule the ruined synagogues were rebuilt, although his taxes on Jews were oppressive. One day, he threatened to compel them to accept Islam if their Messiah did not come within a definite time. The Jews understood the hint and satisfied his pious zeal with a very large sum of money. The Jews, who served as tax-collectors on the whole coast, used to give Ismail a golden riding-outfit as an annual [...] "present"—an inducement {{to keep them in}} office—and a hen and a dozen chickens fashioned in gold as a tax payment for the whole Jewish community. Ismail had another way of securing money: for a certain sum he would sell to an aspirant for honors the position and wealth of one of his favorites. In one such transaction Maimaran, who was chief ruler over the Jews of the realm, feared a rival in Moses ibn 'Attar, and offered the sultan a certain sum for his head. Ismail then let Moses ibn 'Attar know how much had been offered for his head, whereupon Ibn 'Attar offered double the sum for the head of his opponent. The sultan took the money from both, called them fools, and reconciled them to each other, whereupon Ibn 'Attar married a daughter of Maimaran and shared with his father-in-law reign over the Jews. The same Moses ibn 'Attar was Moorish plenipotentiary in the making of a compact with Great Britain in 1721.|$|E
