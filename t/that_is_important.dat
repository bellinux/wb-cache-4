5|$|People {{with cancer}} may not report pain due to costs of {{treatment}}, {{a belief that}} pain is inevitable, an aversion to treatment side effects, fear of developing addiction or tolerance, fear of distracting the doctor from treating the illness, or fear of masking a symptom <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for monitoring progress of the illness. People {{may be reluctant to}} take adequate pain medicine because they are unaware of their prognosis, or may be unwilling to accept their diagnosis. Failure to report pain or misguided reluctance to take pain medicine can be overcome by sensitive coaching.|$|E

The absorption in the Herzberg continuum and Schumann–Runge bands in the ultraviolet produces atomic oxygen <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in the chemistry of the middle atmosphere.

5|$|Among the lanthanides, {{lanthanum}} is exceptional as it {{does not}} have any 4f electrons; indeed, the sudden contraction and lowering of energy of the 4f orbital <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for the chemistry of the lanthanides only begins to happen at cerium. Thus it is only very weakly paramagnetic, unlike the strongly paramagnetic later lanthanides (with the exceptions of the last two, ytterbium and lutetium, where the 4f shell is completely full). Furthermore, since the melting points of the trivalent lanthanides are related to the extent of hybridisation of the 6s, 5d, and 4f electrons, lanthanum has the second-lowest (after cerium) melting point among all the lanthanides: 920°C. The lanthanides become harder as the series is traversed: as expected, lanthanum is a soft metal. Lanthanum has a relatively high resistivity of 615nΩm at room temperature; in comparison, the value for the good conductor aluminium is only 26.50nΩm. Lanthanum is the least volatile of the lanthanides. Like most of the lanthanides, lanthanum has a hexagonal crystal structure at room temperature. At 310°C, lanthanum changes to a face-centered cubic structure, and at 865°C, it changes to a body-centered cubic structure.|$|E

5|$|Humans, horses, and orangutans {{are among}} the few species that may grow their head hair very long. Humans are {{believed}} to have lost their fur 2.5–3 million years ago as hominids when transitioning from a forest habitat to the open savanna, as an effect of natural selection, since this development made it possible to run fast and hunt animals close to the equator without getting overheated. An exception was however head hair, which was kept to provide thermal insulation of the scalp from the sun, to protect against ultra-violet radiation exposure, and also to provide cooling (when sweat evaporates from soaked hair). The ability to grow straight hair, has been observed among Homo sapiens sub-groups in less sunny regions further away from the equator. Relative to kinky Afro-textured hair, straight hair allows more UV light to pass to the scalp (which is essential for the production of vitamin D, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for bone development).|$|E

25|$|The {{continued}} use of racial categories has been criticized. Apart from the general controversy regarding race, some argue that the {{continued use}} of racial categories {{in health care and}} as risk factors could result in increased stereotyping and discrimination in society and health services. Some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities. For example, some racial groups are less likely than others to receive adequate treatment for osteoporosis, even after risk factors have been assessed. Since the 19th century, blacks have been thought to have thicker bones than whites have and to lose bone mass more slowly with age. In a recent study, African Americans were shown to be substantially less likely to receive prescription osteoporosis medications than Caucasians. Men were also significantly less likely to be treated compared with women. This discrepancy may be due to physicians' knowledge that, on average, African Americans are at lower risk for osteoporosis than Caucasians. It may be possible that these physicians generalize this data to high-risk African-Americans, leading them to fail to appropriately assess and manage these individuals' osteoporosis. On the other hand, some of those who are critical of race as a biological concept see race as socially meaningful group <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> to study epidemiologically in order to reduce disparities.|$|E

The fractional change in t is very large, and in units where t is fixed the shift looks infinite.|$|E

25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{speculate that}} abnormalities or {{deficiencies in the}} receptors for certain neurotransmitters may contribute to some forms of myoclonus. Receptors {{that appear to be}} related to myoclonus include those for two important inhibitory neurotransmitters: serotonin, which constricts blood vessels and brings on sleep, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which helps the brain maintain muscle control. Other receptors with links to myoclonus include those for benzodiazepines, drugs that induce sleep, and for glycine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> for the control of motor and sensory functions in the spinal cord.

The Twenty-seventh Amendment was proposed as part of the Bill of Rights in 1791, but failed to be ratified by the required number of states for two centuries, eventually being ratified in 1992. An original intent inquiry might ask what the framers understood the amendment to mean when it was written, though some would argue that it was the intent of the latter-day ratifiers <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important.</b> An original-meaning inquiry would ask what the plain, public meaning of the text was in 1992 when it was eventually ratified.|$|E
25|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{excision repair}} (NER) pathway is {{a mechanism to}} repair damage to DNA. ERCC2 is involved in transcription-coupled NER and is an integral member of the basal transcription factor BTF2/TFIIH complex. ERCC3 is an ATP-dependent DNA helicase that functions in NER. It also is a subunit of basal transcription factor 2 (TFIIH) and, thus, functions in class II transcription. XPG (ERCC5) forms a stable complex with TFIIH, which is active in transcription and NER. ERCC6 encodes a DNA-binding protein <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> in transcription-coupled excision repair. ERCC8 interacts with Cockayne syndrome type B (CSB) protein, with p44 (GTF2H2), a subunit of the RNA polymerase II transcription factor IIH, and ERCC6.
