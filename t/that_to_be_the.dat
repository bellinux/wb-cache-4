5|$|Isaac Newton had demonstrated, using prisms, {{that white}} lights, such as sunlight, are {{composed}} {{of a number of}} monochromatic components which could then be recombined into white light. Newton also showed that an orange paint made of yellow and red could look exactly like a monochromatic orange light, although being composed of two monochromatic yellow and red lights. Hence the paradox that puzzled physicists of the time: two complex lights (composed of more than one monochromatic light) could look alike but be physically different, called metameres. Thomas Young later proposed that this paradox could be explained by colours being perceived through a limited number of channels in the eyes, which he proposed to be threefold, the trichromatic colour theory. Maxwell used the recently developed Linear algebra to prove Young's theory. Any monochromatic light stimulating three receptors should be able to be equally stimulated by a set of three different monochromatic lights (in fact, by any set of three different lights). He demonstrated <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case, inventing colour matching experiments and Colourimetry.|$|E

The corpses were pelted with vegetables, spat at, urinated on, shot at and kicked; Mussolini's face was disfigured by beatings. An American eye witness described the crowd as [...] "sinister, depraved, out of control". After a while, the bodies were hoisted up on to the metal girder framework of a half-built Standard Oil service station, and hung upside down on meat hooks. This mode of hanging {{had been used in}} northern Italy since medieval times to stress the [...] "infamy" [...] of the hanged.

Further inspiration came from Cleaves's temporary employment while studying experimental {{psychology at the}} University of Oxford. During the summer, Cleave painted underpasses, gardened and picked up litter, and hoped to use this experience to write a book. His final job was at Campsfield House in Oxfordshire, an immigration detention centre. Cleave spent three days serving food to residents from war zones including Somalia, Eritrea and the Balkans. He explained: [...] "I got talking {{with some of them}} and said why are you here? Why are you in prison? It's not illegal and yet we concentrate them in these places. It's a text-book definition of a concentration camp. The conditions are appalling. I was shocked enough for <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of my light comedy book of my amusing summers working as a labourer."

500|$|Usher had {{initially}} planned {{to release the}} album entitled All About U, as his third studio album on October 31, 2000. The album was to follow his successful My Way (1997) which to date, has sold over seven million copies. On March 13, 2000, multiple tracks from the album had leaked on to online music store Napster several months prior to its release, including [...] "T.T.P.", [...] "U R the One" [...] and [...] "Pop Ya Collar". Following the event, the album's release was delayed twice, on December 5, 2000 to July 17, 2001. During the taping of MTV Icon Janet Jackson special, Usher explained that {{he returned to the}} studios to record new songs, stating [...] "I didn't want <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> way my record was remembered or the way I would present that to my fans [...] It turned out a lot better" [...] while adding that tracks that were available for download on the site {{were not going to be}} included on the new album. With new tracks produced, Usher's publicist announced a new name for the album, under the title 8701, who claims that it is [...] "practically a new album". The origin of its new name was initially unknown, with speculation that it subsides with its US release of August 7, 2001 (8/7/01), though Usher's publicist claimed that this was purely coincidental, and was not the reasoning for the title. Usher hinted that it was derived after something significant to him, and he would disclose it in the upcoming months. Eventually, his spokesperson revealed that the '87' segment of the title refers to the year 1987, when Usher sang in public for the first time at his church in Atlanta, with the '01' referring to the year 2001.|$|E

He also said the future plans as of now are, they are going to go on The Parental Advisory Tour with 2 Live Crew, Onyx, Geto Boys and they were trying to also get Necro throughout the month of June leading up to the Gathering of the Juggalos. Then after the GOTJ, Shaggy 2 Dope will embark on the F.T.F.O.M.F. Tour to promote his third solo album F.T.F.O.M.F. While Shaggy 2 Dope is on tour Violent J is going to form the skeleton of the next Joker Card, and when Shaggy 2 Dope gets back from tour, then they will start putting the [...] "nerves, muscle, tissue, skin etc. together and then bring the entity to life". He also stated that ICP will also go on a 20th Anniversary: The Great Milenko Tour, after the Juggalo March On Washington (September 16 – 17, 2017) which will lead up to their 24th Annual Hallowicked Show, and then they will tour England mid to late November (13–20).
