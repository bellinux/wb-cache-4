30|$|Several {{techniques}} {{have been used}} for the deposition of TiNi SMA <b>thin</b> <b>films,</b> such as sputtering [2, 6 – 10], pulsed laser deposition [11 – 15], flash evaporation [16], and cathodic arc plasma ion plating [17]. One of the major problems in fabricating TiNi <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> is the composition control. The composition control is essential to adjust the working temperature of the microdevice as the composition ratio strongly influences the transformation temperature of the TiNi SMA [18]. Another major obstacle related to the growth of TiNi <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> is the crystallization of TiNi <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> since only crystalline TiNi <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> have the shape memory effect. Most researchers have fabricated TiNi <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> using conventional sputtering methods, wherein it is difficult to control the composition of TiNi <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> [19].

40|$|AbstractThe {{uniaxial}} tension {{behavior of}} polycrystalline <b>thin</b> <b>films,</b> {{in which all}} grain boundaries (GBs) are penetrable by dislocations, is investigated by two-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) method with a penetrable dislocation-GB interaction model. In order to study thickness effect on the tensile strength of <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> with and without surface treatment, three types of <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> are comparatively considered, including the <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> without surface treatment, with surface passivation layers (SPLs) of nanometer thickness and with surface grain refinement zones (SGRZs) consisting of nano-sized grains. Our results show that thickness effects and their underlying dislocation mechanisms are quite distinct among different types of <b>thin</b> <b>films.</b> The thicker <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> without surface treatment are stronger than the thinner ones; however, opposite thickness effects are captured in the <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> with SPLs or SGRZs. Moreover, the underlying dislocation mechanisms of the same thickness effects of <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> with SPLs and SGRZs are different. In the <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> with SPLs, the thickness effect {{is caused by the}} sharp increase of dislocation density near the film-passivation interface, while it is mainly due to the sharp decrease of dislocation density within the refined surface grains of the <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> with SGRZs. No matter in what type of <b>thin</b> <b>films,</b> thickness effect gradually disappears when the number of grains in the thickness direction is large enough. Our analysis reveals that general mechanism of those thickness effects lies in the competition between the exterior surface-constraint and interior GB-constraint on gliding dislocations...|$|R

The x-ray diffraction {{results show that the}} higher FGA temperature results in a larger degree of deterioration of crystal quality of the BFO <b>thin</b> <b>films.</b> This change can be attributed to a loss of oxygen from the BFO <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> and the incorporation of hydrogen atoms into the lattice of the BFO <b>thin</b> <b>films</b> during FGA at a high temperature.
