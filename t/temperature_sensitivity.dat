5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit {{bodies have}} been shown to have significant antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts have been made to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts {{have been shown}} to slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E
5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson interferometers exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot interferometers or Lyot filters. Michelson interferometers have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson interferometers have a relatively low <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> On the negative side, Michelson interferometers have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|E

The results obtained reveal that the strain and <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivities</b> of the two gratings are different. Based on these results, we demonstrate a technique which enables discrimination of strain and temperature in a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) with a linear response. The present technique allows for an easy implementation of the sensor by providing a direct access to the grating region in the fiber and demands only a simple interrogation system...|$|R

25|$|A patient's {{metabolic}} rate may change, causing an {{increase or decrease}} in weight and energy levels, changes to sleep patterns, and <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Androgen deprivation leads to slower metabolism {{and a loss of}} muscle tone.

25|$|However, early MEMS {{resonators}} did {{not have}} sufficiently stable frequencies {{to be used for}} timing references or clock generation. The metallic resonator elements tended to shift frequency with time (they aged) and with use (they fatigued). Under temperature variation they tended to have large and not entirely predicable frequency shifts (they had large <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity)</b> and when they were temperature cycled they tended to return to different frequencies (they were hysteretic).|$|E

40|$|Transmission {{characteristics}} of microtapered long-period fiber gratings (MTLPGs) and their strain and <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivities</b> with {{variations in the}} waist diameters are investigated theoretically and experimentally. Transmission {{characteristics of}} MTLPGs strongly depend on the waist diameter of the tapered optical fiber (TOF) because of the modification of the effective index difference between the core and the cladding modes. Based on the photoelastic effect, the resonant wavelengths of MTLPGs with variations in strain shift to shorter wavelengths. The strain sensitivity of the MTLPG with a waist diameter of 25 μm is improved {{by a factor of}} 20 compared with that of a 125 μm long-period fiber grating.

25|$|Isotopic {{composition}} of precipitation {{can be used}} to infer changes in air temperature based on the Rayleigh process. Lower temperature corresponds to lower saturation vapor pressure, which leads to more condensation that drives the residual vapor toward isotope depletion. The resulting precipitation thus has a more negative δD and δ18O value at lower temperature. This precipitation isotope thermometer is more sensitive at lower temperatures, and widely applied at high latitudes. For example, δD and δ18O were found to have a <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 8‰/°C and 0.9‰/°C in Antarctic snow, and a sensitivity of 5.6‰/°C and 0.69‰/°C across Arctic sites. δD and δ18O of ice cores in Greenland, Antarctica and alpine glaciers are important archives of temperature change in the geological past.|$|E
25|$|Between 30 and 40 {{percent of}} {{patients}} undergoing chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes progressing to the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. Whether CIPN arises, and to what degree, {{is determined by the}} choice of drug, duration of use, the total amount consumed and whether the patient already has peripheral neuropathy. Though the symptoms are mainly sensory – pain, tingling, numbness and <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity</b> – in some cases motor nerves are affected, and occasionally, also, the autonomic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} criteria, {{stability}} {{is the critical}} consideration in evaluating the effect of orbital and rotational characteristics on planetary habitability. Orbital eccentricity {{is the difference between}} a planet's farthest and closest approach to its parent star divided by the sum of said distances. It is a ratio describing the shape of the elliptical orbit. The greater the eccentricity the greater the temperature fluctuation on a planet's surface. Although they are adaptive, living organisms can stand only so much variation, particularly if the fluctuations overlap both the freezing point and boiling point of the planet's main biotic solvent (e.g., water on Earth). If, for example, Earth's oceans were alternately boiling and freezing solid, {{it is difficult to imagine}} life as we know it having evolved. The more complex the organism, the greater the <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The Earth's orbit is almost wholly circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.02; other planets in the Solar System (with the exception of Mercury) have eccentricities that are similarly benign.|$|E

30|$|The step-corrected {{accelerations}} {{are highly}} correlated with temperature, which is demonstrated in Fig.  6. Consequently, {{it is difficult to}} estimate the scale factor s reliably together with the <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivities</b> b_A and b_B in a fit against non-gravitational accelerations from POD. For this reason, we designed a special satellite maneuver for the scale factor calibration.|$|R
25|$|The carbon-bonded {{hydrogen}} {{isotopic composition}} of cellulose, as inherited from leaf water, {{has the potential}} of preserving the original meteoric water signal. This was first demonstrated in the 1970s. In a systematic survey across North America, tree cellulose δD was found to have a <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 5.8‰/°C, similar to precipitation δD sensitivity of 5.6‰/°C. This spatial correlation may be complicated by local effects of soil evaporation and leaf transpiration, and the spatial gradient may not be representative of temporal changes in tree ring cellulose at a single place. The mechanism that generates the δD signal in cellulose from meteoric water is not completely understood, but at least includes leaf water transpiration, synthesis of carbohydrates, synthesis of cellulose from photosynthetic sugars, and exchange of sugars with xylem water. Modeling studies show that observed tree ring cellulose δD can be produced when 36% of the hydrogen in sugars can exchange with xylem water, and effects such as humidity and rainfall seasonality may complicate the cellulose δD proxy. Despite these complications, tree ring δD have been used for paleoclimate reconstructions of the past few millennia. For example, a tree ring cellulose δD records from pine trees in the White Mountains, California shows a 50‰ depletion from 6800 year ago to present. The cooling trend since the mid-Holocene thermal maximum is consistent with ice core and pollen records, but the corresponding magnitude of cooling is elusive due to complicated influences from local effects such as humidity and soil water composition. The meaning of isotopes in cellulose and its applications is still an area of active study.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{improvement}} in performance of chirp pulse generation and compression systems was achieved {{with the development}} of SAW filters. [...] These allowed much more precision in the synthesis of filter characteristics and consequently in the radar performance. [...] The inherent <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the quartz substrates was overcome by mounting both the transmit and receive filters in a common package, so providing thermal compensation. [...] The increased precision offered by SAW technology, enabled time sidelobe levels approaching -30dB to become achievable by radar systems. [...] (In actual fact, the performance level now achievable was set more by limitations in the system hardware than in SAW shortcomings).|$|E
2500|$|Many {{flowering}} plants use the pigment phytochrome to sense seasonal changes in day length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed photoperiodism. Broadly speaking, {{flowering plants}} {{can be classified}} as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length. [...] Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to starts flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism, though some may use <b>temperature</b> <b>sensitivity</b> (vernalization) instead.|$|E

The thermal system pertaining to a shunt regulator in a spacecraft is considered. For thermal sensitivity analysis, design parameters such as internal heat dissipation, optical properties of an optical solar reflector, emittance of black paint, and emittance of low-emittance tape are considered. The numerical results indicate that the absorptance of the optical solar reflector is the most important parameter in the thermal control of a shunt regulator. An appropriate thermal shield and an increase in the black painted area are suggested as suitable design strategies to control the temperature of the shunt regulator...|$|R
