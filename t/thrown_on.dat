5|$|As in {{previous}} years, the spectators tried to assist their preferred riders {{by trying to}} impede their opponents. On the first stage, nails had been <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> the road, and all cyclists except Lucien Petit-Breton punctured. This stage was won by Emile Georget in a sprint.|$|E
5|$|I {{might have}} adduced for this same purpose the {{differences}} between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.|$|E
5|$|It {{seemed to}} me {{sufficient}} to indicate, in {{the first edition of}} my 'Origin of Species,' that by this work 'light would be <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham died {{suddenly}} from acute meningitis at Auckland in September 1927, and his funeral {{was attended by}} a number of dignitaries, including representatives of the New Zealand, Auckland, New South Wales and Thames Rugby Unions. His pallbearers were all former All Blacks, and included fellow Original All Blacks George Tyler, George Nicholson and George Gillett. After his casket had been lowered into its grave at Hillsborough Cemetery, an Auckland representative jersey was <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> top.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2009, {{at least}} three people, {{including}} two Mexicans and one American, entered the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces, including the four La Venta colossal heads. The vandals were all members of an evangelical church and {{appeared to have been}} carrying out a supposed pre-Columbian ritual, during which salts, grape juice, and oil were <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> the heads. It was estimated that 300,000 pesos (US$21,900) would be needed to repair the damage, and the restoration process would last four months. The three vandals were released soon after their arrest after paying 330,000 pesos each.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's wife, Catherine, {{had become}} {{well known in}} Oxford for her piety and {{ministry}} to expectant mothers. She also enjoyed carving faces into plum stones. She had died childless in the February before Vermigli left. Soon after Vermigli's departure, Cardinal Pole had her disinterred and <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> a dungheap. Following the accession of Protestant Queen Elizabeth in 1558, she was re-interred with the relics of Saint Frithuswith in Christ Church Cathedral.|$|E

5|$|After Lincoln's {{assassination}} in April 1865, {{black ink}} was <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> Fillmore's house {{as it was}} not draped in mourning like others, though he was apparently out of town {{at the time and}} put black drapes in the windows once he returned. Although he retained his position as Buffalo's leading citizen and was among those selected to escort the body when Lincoln's funeral train passed through Buffalo, there was still anger against him for his wartime positions. Fillmore supported President Andrew Johnson's Reconstruction policies, feeling that the nation needed to be reconciled as quickly as possible. Most of his time was devoted to his civic activities. He aided Buffalo in becoming the third American city, after Boston and Philadelphia, to have a permanent art gallery with the Buffalo Fine Arts Academy.|$|E
5|$|By late 1943, Miller {{has been}} based at RAF South Cerny in Gloucestershire. One night, he was pulled over by his {{commanding}} officer, whom he detested, for not wearing his uniform cap. An altercation resulted, and Miller posed {{as though he were}} about to punch his officer. The result was that Miller was charged with insubordination and sentenced to a three-week disciplinary course with hard labour, from 18 October to 9 November. In mid-November he was posted to Ouston near Newcastle upon Tyne where he was trained in the use of radar using Anson and Oxford aircraft. During his stay there, Miller was <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> his back during a wrestling match, sustaining an injury that caused him recurring problems in later years, diminishing his ability to bowl.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{came to be}} {{regarded}} as a sin in Christian Europe and was condemned at the Council of Arles in 452 as the work of the Devil. In the Middle Ages, the Church had drawn-out discussions as to when the desire for martyrdom was suicidal, {{as in the case of}} martyrs of Córdoba. Despite these disputes and occasional official rulings, Catholic doctrine was not entirely settled on the subject of suicide until the later 17th century. A criminal ordinance issued by Louis XIV of France in 1670 was extremely severe, even for the times: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.|$|E

5|$|The Romans {{launched}} {{an assault on}} Sparta and took the walls, but their advance was initially impeded by the narrowness of the roads in the city's outskirts. However, the streets grew wider as they advanced into the city's center, and the Spartans were forced further and further back. Nabis, seeing his defenses collapsing, tried to flee, but Pythagoras rallied the soldiers and ordered them to {{set fire to the}} buildings closest to the walls. Burning debris was <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> the coalition's soldiers entering the city, causing many casualties. Observing this, Flamininus ordered his forces to withdraw to their base. When the attack was renewed later, the Spartans managed to hold off the Roman assaults for three days before Nabis, seeing that the situation was hopeless, decided to send Pythagoras with an offer of surrender. At first, Flaminius refused to see him, but when Pythagoras came to the Roman camp a second time Flamininus accepted the surrender, with the conditions of the treaty being the same as Flamininus had previously proposed. The treaty was later ratified by the Senate.|$|E

25|$|In October 1928, the Grand Mufti {{organised}} {{new construction}} next to {{and above the}} Wall.

A muezzin was appointed to perform the Islamic call to prayer directly next to the Wall, creating noise exactly when the Jews were conducting their prayers. The Jews protested at these provocations and tensions increased.|$|E
25|$|Innocent III's {{efforts were}} {{taken up by}} Gregory IX, who belonged to the {{powerful}} Family of Conti di Anagni. On September 29, 1227 in Anagni's Cathedral he excommunicated Emperor Frederick II, who had abandoned the Crusade that the Emperor himself had proclaimed.

60|$|Presently, when B.'s {{boat was}} just right for his anglers to see {{everything}} my way, I felt a tug on my line. I leaped up, let the reel run. Then I <b>threw</b> <b>on</b> my drag and leaned over to strike. But he let go. Quickly I threw off the drag. The sailfish came back. Another tug! I let him run. Then <b>threw</b> <b>on</b> the drag and got ready. But, no, he let go. Again I threw off the drag and again he came back. He was hungry, but he was cunning, too, and too far back for me to see. I let him run fifty feet, <b>threw</b> <b>on</b> the drag, and struck hard. No go! I missed him. But again I threw off the drag, let out more line back to him, {{and he took the}} bait the fourth time, and harder than ever. I let him run perhaps a hundred feet. All the time, of course, my boat was running. I had out a long line--two hundred yards. Then I <b>threw</b> <b>on</b> the drag and almost cracked the rod. This time I actually felt the hook go in.|$|R
25|$|The {{body was}} {{normally}} <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> the potter's wheel, with large vases often thrown in sections and luted together. Templates were used, and sometimes moulds, including two-part moulds, and moulds including decoration. Unglazed biscuit relief sections were achieved either by sprigging the reliefs over a glazed area before firing, where the surface would be flat in the kiln, or {{by adding a}} resist of wax or grease before glazing, when the sides of a vase were decorated.|$|E
25|$|It {{was common}} {{knowledge}} that Arthur Morris, after failing {{in the first two}} Tests, was in grave danger of being dropped, and Meuleman was his obvious successor. In the first innings Arthur made 21 and we all thought Ken's chances were sky high. Arthur scored 155 in the second innings and saved his place. Meuleman, twelfth man in the first two Tests...was instantly dropped. And he has never been asked to play since. If ever a man was <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> the scrap heap it was Ken.|$|E
25|$|Mabinogi uses an instanced dungeon system, with random map generation, {{that allows}} dungeon {{exploration}} by multiple players {{at the same}} time. When a player enters a dungeon, he will find a lobby with a statue of the goddess, and a platform before it. A separate dungeon instance is created for every unique type of item <b>thrown</b> <b>on</b> the platform (for dungeon passes, a unique instance is created for each instance of pass dropped). Depending on what the player drops, he might {{end up in a}} dungeon instance with players already in it.|$|E
