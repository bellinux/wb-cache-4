500|$|When the aircraft's SDU {{responds}} to messages sent {{from the ground}} station, it uses the aircraft's navigation system to determine the aircraft's position, track, and ground speed and adjusts the <b>transmit</b> <b>frequency</b> {{to compensate for the}} Doppler shift on the uplink signal, based on the satellite being located in its nominal position in geostationary orbit (35786 km above the equator) at 64.5°E. The initial analysis was calculated with the satellite at its nominal location in geostationary orbit, [...] above the equator at 64.5°E longitude. However, the Inmarsat-3F1 satellite was launched in 1996 with an expected life span of 13 years and to extend its lifespan by conserving remaining fuel, it was allowed to drift from its nominal location into a slightly inclined orbit. A map of the sub-satellite points—the location on Earth's surface directly beneath the satellite—shows that the satellite moves counterclockwise in an oval shape between 1.6°S–1.6°N and 64.45–64.58°E. As a result, the adjustments made by the SDU only partially compensate for the Doppler shift on the uplink. This error is [...] "immaterial" [...] to the performance of the satellite network, but was crucial to eliminate the northern corridor during the initial analysis.|$|E

30|$|Figure  4 {{shows that}} the {{amplitude}} ratios and phase differences of the signals in two receiver coils increase gradually as the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> increases from 200  kHz to 2  MHz, and the variations are more obvious {{in the case of}} low-resistivity formation. When the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> is larger than 600  kHz, the polarization angle emerge in amplitude ratios and phase difference curves noticeably. According to Fig.  4, we find that the optimum <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> is equal to 2  MHz, because when f is equal to 2  MHz the amplitude ratios and phase difference curves have the best resolution. When the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> is fixed at 2  MHz and the dielectric constant of an earth formation is changed during the procedure of numerical simulation, there are also changes in the amplitude ratios and phase differences of the receiving signal and these variations in the high-resistivity formation are more sensitive than in low-resistivity formation. However, increase the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> can enhance the detection resolution of low-resistivity formation, but the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> is not the larger the better. Because with the the increase of the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency,</b> the calculated amount of higher-order vector FEM must increase, the computation errors may also increase. In practice, improvement in the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> may lead to skin effect influence on the transmitter coil and receiving signals; therefore, the precision of the measurement results will be impacted.|$|R
30|$|It {{is shown}} in Fig.  6 that with the {{increases}} of <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency,</b> the real part of the electromagnetic wave signals received by the receiver coil R 1 increases, but the imaginary part of the electromagnetic wave signals received by the receiver coil R 1 decreases. That is to say, with the increases of <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency,</b> the resolution of instrument to the high-resistivity thin layer will gradually increase. When the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> f is equal to 5  MHz, the imaginary part of electromagnetic wave signals is not approximately a straight line, that is to say, the transmitter coil is strongly affected by the skin effect. As the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> increases, the potential differences received by two receiver coils gradually increase, {{and then at the}} interface of formations the distribution of electric field is uneven. Therefore, the polarization angle emerging in amplitude ratios and phase differences are easily influenced by different <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequencies.</b> If the <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> is very large, the transmitter coil may be noticeably affected by the skin effect; so it may lead to the distortion caused by the polarization angle, which may affect the accuracy of the measurement results.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{by using}} higher-order vector FEM, we have {{successfully}} investigated {{the impact of}} the measurement results by changing the T–R 1 spacing, R 1 –R 2 spacing, <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency</b> and the structure of resistivity LWD tool. The antenna system is the important part of the resistivity LWD tool, and the measurement results of the instrument would be strongly affected by different T–R 1 spacing, R 1 –R 2 spacing and <b>transmitting</b> <b>frequency.</b> Numerical simulation results show that the change of T–R 1 spacing has obvious influence on the investigation depth and detecting precision of the resistivity LWD tool, and the change of R 1 –R 2 spacing may affect the resolution of the thin-layer distinguish.
