5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a thin layer of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E
5|$|The Laue back {{reflection}} mode records X-rays scattered backwards {{from a broad}} spectrum source. This is useful if the sample is <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> for X-rays to transmit through it. The diffracting planes in the crystal are determined by knowing that the normal to the diffracting plane bisects the angle between the incident beam and the diffracted beam. A Greninger chart {{can be used to}} interpret the {{back reflection}} Laue photograph.|$|E
5|$|Edziza's rounded, steep-sided lava domes {{were built}} by eruptions of very thick light-coloured magma, {{including}} trachyte. Such magmas are typically <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> to move {{far from the}} vent it extrudes from, causing it to solidify quickly and build on previous volcanic extrusions, creating a characteristic dome-like shape. The thickness of the magma is attributed {{to high levels of}} silica, a naturally occurring silicon dioxide found in various crystalline and amorphous forms. Edziza's domes reach heights of several hundred metres, and grew slowly and steadily for months to years. The sides of these structures are composed of unstable rock debris. Due to the possibility of the building of gas pressure, the dome can experience more explosive eruptions over time. When part of a lava dome collapses while it still contains molten rock and gases, it can produce a pyroclastic flow, a super-heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice.|$|E

25|$|Elevators are {{characteristic}} to skyscrapers. In 1852 Elisha Otis introduced the safety elevator, allowing convenient and safe passenger movement to upper floors. Another crucial development {{was the use}} of a steel frame instead of stone or brick, otherwise the walls on the lower floors on a tall building would be <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> to be practical. Today major manufacturers of elevators include Otis, ThyssenKrupp, Schindler, and KONE.|$|E

25|$|Spiders stop feeding at {{some time}} before moulting, usually for several days. The {{physiological}} processes of releasing the old exoskeleton from the tissues beneath typically cause various colour changes, such as darkening. If the old exoskeleton is not <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> {{it may be possible}} to see new structures, such as setae, from outside. However, contact between the nerves and the old exoskeleton is maintained until a very late stage in the process.|$|E
25|$|The {{challenge}} for the designers of DualDisc was to produce a dual-sided disc which was not <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> to play reliably in slot-loading drives, while the CD side was not too thin to be tracked easily by the laser. DVDplus, though conceptually similar, used a thicker CD layer and thus {{is more likely to}} get stuck in a slot-loading player (although this appears to be almost unknown); DualDisc took the other course by thinning the CD layer.|$|E
25|$|Alkanes from nonane to, for instance, {{hexadecane}} (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids {{of higher}} viscosity, {{less and less}} suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of diesel and aviation fuel. Diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number, cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> to flow correctly.|$|E

60|$|She made no answer, {{but so far}} as her {{expression}} counted for anything at all, {{she was a little}} surprised. Her eyes considered him for a moment. Hamel was tall, well over six feet, powerfully made, with good features, clear eyes, and complexion unusually sunburnt. He wore a flannel collar of unfamiliar shape, and his clothes, although they were neat enough, were of a pattern and cut obviously designed to afford the maximum of ease and comfort with the minimum regard to appearance. He wore, <b>too,</b> very <b>thick</b> boots, and his hands gave one the impression that they were seldom gloved. His voice was pleasant, and he had the easy self-confidence of a person sure of himself in the world. She put him down as a colonial--perhaps an American--but his rank in life mystified her.|$|R
25|$|The {{light crude}} oil spilled in the Mega Borg {{incident}} was brown and evaporated much quicker than the {{heavy crude oil}} in spills such as the Exxon Valdez. This means that the oil {{is less likely to}} heavily coat nearby beaches, flora and fauna, however the tanker was carrying more oil than the Exxon Valdez incident spilled in total, so {{there was a lot of}} concern about the oil not being able to evaporate if the slick became <b>too</b> <b>thick.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{paper towel}} {{has the same}} {{purposes}} as conventional towels such as drying hands, wiping windows, dusting, cleaning up spills. However, paper towels can only be used once after they blot wet surfaces. A school teacher in Ashland, Ohio, named Kurt Klier, gave students individual paper squares, so that the single towel in the bathroom would not be infected with germs. When Arthur Scott, head of the Scott Paper Company heard about it, he {{decided to try to}} sell a load of paper that had been made <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> to use as toilet paper.|$|E

By the end of November, the drillships would be escorted back for winter lay-up and Robert LeMeur would carry out final supply runs to the drilling islands. Although the vessel would typically be laid up for winter in mid-December, she was capable of continuing supply operations through the winter. In some years, Robert LeMeur was involved {{in research and development}} projects during the winter months or drydocked on Canmar's floating dock for inspection and repairs.|$|E

25|$|Gold is, however, a {{difficult}} material to counterfeit without detection {{due to its}} unique density and colour. Gold {{is one of the}} densest metals and therefore much heavier (for equivalent size or volume) than the common metals such as lead, brass, copper and steel that are used to make fake bullion coins. Fake gold coins are either oversize or underweight, or both. A fake made from lead to exactly the same thickness and diameter as a genuine sovereign would be 35% lighter than the genuine coin. If made the correct weight and diameter, it would be 54% <b>too</b> <b>thick.</b>|$|E
25|$|Silica can {{be drawn}} into fibers at {{reasonably}} high temperatures, and has a fairly broad glass transformation range. One other advantage is that fusion splicing and cleaving of silica fibers is relatively effective. Silica fiber also has high mechanical strength against both pulling and even bending, provided that the fiber is not <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> and that the surfaces have been well prepared during processing. Even simple cleaving (breaking) of {{the ends of the}} fiber can provide nicely flat surfaces with acceptable optical quality. Silica is also relatively chemically inert. In particular, it is not hygroscopic (does not absorb water).|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacture}} of economical, reliable ballpoint pens {{as we know}} them arose from experimentation, modern chemistry, and precision manufacturing capabilities of the early 20th century. Patents filed worldwide during early development are testaments to failed attempts at making the pens commercially viable and widely available. Early ballpoints did not deliver the ink evenly; overflow and clogging were among the obstacles inventors faced toward developing reliable ballpoint pens. If the ball socket was too tight, or the ink <b>too</b> <b>thick,</b> it would not reach the paper. If the socket was too loose, or the ink too thin, the pen would leak or the ink would smear. Ink reservoirs pressurized by piston, spring, capillary action, and gravity would all serve as solutions to ink-delivery and flow problems.|$|E

25|$|This {{pattern in}} turn {{suggests}} the following method of creating models of iterations of the Heighway dragon curve by folding {{a strip of}} paper. Take a strip of paper and fold it in half to the right. Fold it in half again to the right.

Fold the strip in half again to the right, and the turn sequence of the unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL – the third iteration of the Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half {{to the right to}} create further iterations of the Heighway dragon (in practice, the strip becomes <b>too</b> <b>thick</b> to fold sharply after four or five iterations).|$|E

25|$|In 1995, an RAF {{board of}} inquiry ruled {{that it was}} {{impossible}} to establish the exact cause of the accident. This ruling was subsequently overturned by two senior reviewing officers, who stated the pilots were guilty of gross negligence for flying too fast and <b>too</b> low in <b>thick</b> fog. This finding proved to be controversial, especially in light of irregularities and technical issues surrounding the then-new Chinook HC.2 variant which were uncovered. A Parliamentary inquiry conducted in 2001 found the previous verdict of gross negligence on the part of the crew to be 'unjustified'. In 2011, an independent review of the crash cleared the crew of negligence.|$|R
