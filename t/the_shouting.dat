25|$|The couple {{comes out}} of the cabin, {{observed}} by Arturo, who overhears that they plan to leave together the next day. Arturo concludes that they are lovers, and after Alaide has returned to her cabin, he confronts Valdeburgo furiously and demands revenge.

25|$|The University was {{the site}} of social {{upheaval}} during the 1960s and 1970s, when nationalist students protested for civil rights, the independence of Puerto Rico, and taking the ROTC out of the campus. In 1970 Antonia Martínez was murdered by the police when they repressed students. As <b>the</b> <b>shouting</b> started in the street, everyone in the building she was in, on Ponce de León Avenue, went to the balconies to see what was happening. She was, like many others, watching the events, saw policemen attacking at the students, and allegedly shouted at the police ¡Asesinos! (Assassins!). A policeman turned and shot her in the head, killing her and injuring a roommate. A mural of her and her story existed on the College of Humanities, until administrative personnel covered it with paint. Other stories claim that she was shot by mistake.|$|E
