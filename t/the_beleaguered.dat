5|$|By {{the time}} the Khmer Rouge {{initiated}} their dry-season offensive to capture <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network {{had been reduced to}} air and water systems, the rice harvest had been reduced by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater fish (the chief source of protein) had declined drastically. The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels and unemployment was not even measured anymore.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealanders' {{defensive}} positions {{had been}} improved despite {{the weather and}} the harassment from German artillery, which killed Fulton, the original commander of the Rifle Brigade, when a barrage targeted his headquarters. The division undertook the first offensive action by the British forces during the Spring Offensive when three battalions seized the high ground of La Signy farm on 30 March. This success, although relatively trivial to the New Zealanders, was a morale booster for the rest of <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> Third Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} was confusing {{for both}} sides, {{and the view}} was soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships on both sides were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships met up with Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now had control of the seas, forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.|$|E
60|$|All {{this time}} Gustavus was in {{constant}} communication with his generals outside, his messengers {{making their way}} by speed or stratagem through <b>the</b> <b>beleaguering</b> Croats, and kept up the spirits of his men by daily reviews and by the cheerful countenance which he always wore.|$|R
25|$|During {{the reign}} of Helm Hammerhand, Rohan was {{attacked}} by Dunlendings from across the river Isen. Edoras was taken, and Helm {{and many of his}} people retreated to Súthburg. Because Helm always blew a great horn before riding out to fight <b>the</b> <b>beleaguering</b> Dunlendings, <b>the</b> keep was renamed Hornburg. During the War of the Ring, the Hornburg was the refuge of the Rohirrim as they defended Helm's Deep.|$|R
60|$|Then, one by one, the battleships of Helium {{succeeded in}} {{rising above the}} Zodangans, and {{in a short time}} a number of <b>the</b> <b>beleaguering</b> battleships were {{drifting}} hopeless wrecks toward the high scarlet tower of greater Helium. Several others attempted to escape, but they were soon surrounded by thousands of tiny individual fliers, and above each hung a monster battleship of Helium ready to drop boarding parties upon their decks.|$|R
5|$|The {{next morning}} the three {{companies}} of 4-503 were chosen to set out and relieve the men on Hill 875. Because of intense PAVN sniper and mortar fire (and the terrain) it took until nightfall for the relief force to reach <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> battalion. On the afternoon of 21 November both battalions moved out to take the crest. During fierce, close-quarters fighting, some of the paratroopers {{made it into the}} PAVN trench line but were ordered to pull back as darkness fell.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, Sharon arrived {{after missing}} the entire conference. Speaking with Gonen {{and the other}} commanders after Elazar had left, Sharon {{recommended}} an immediate assault to relieve <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> strongpoints. Gonen pointed out that this had been the Israeli course of action for the past 14–16 hours, to no avail. However he did not reject Sharon outright, and indeed told him to prepare for such an attack, promising a final decision on the matter before 6:00 at dawn. Nevertheless, Sharon would conform to the original plan for a limited attack on the following day.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Kursk, Novikov {{introduced}} new innovations such as shaped-charge bombs, night {{fighters and}} ground-attack aircraft. The Battle of Königsberg saw 2,500 combat aircraft under Novikov being {{made available to}} the besieging armies, with the Soviet air marshal recommending low level heavy night bombers being used. 514 of these dropped 4,440 tons of bombs on <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> city. For his part in the operation Novikov was made Hero of the Soviet Union, and on June 24, 1944 the United States awarded him a Legion of Merit. Novikov then transferred to the Pacific Theatre to fight against Japan, where he was made Hero of the Soviet Union a second time for his work in forming large air armies to bomb Japanese forces in China and Korea.|$|E
60|$|The {{music was}} dying away along the street, and its dismal strains were {{mingled with the}} knell of midnight from the steeple of the Old South, and with the roar of artillery, which {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>beleaguering</b> army of Washington had intrenched itself upon a nearer height than before. As the deep boom of the cannon smote upon his ear, Colonel Joliffe raised himself to the full height of his aged form, and smiled sternly on the British General.|$|R
50|$|Gascoigne had {{the command}} {{of one of the}} regiments of horse which took {{possession}} of Colchester in Essex on 12 June 1648, leading to the siege of Colchester. He took part in the ineffectual attempt made on 15 July to break through <b>the</b> <b>beleaguering</b> forces, and was taken prisoner when the town was surrendered to Thomas Fairfax on 28 August He was condemned to be shot on the following day with Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle. His life was spared at the last moment, because the council of war feared the long-term consequences.|$|R
50|$|To {{material}} largely quarried {{from the}} Carolingian and Arthurian cycles, Boiardo added a superstructure {{of his own}} making. As the plot is not woven around a single pivotal action, the inextricable maze of most cunningly contrived episodes are seen to be linked, first, with the quest of beautiful Angelica by love-smitten Orlando and the other enamored knights, then with the defense of Albracca by Angelica's father, the King of Cathay, against <b>the</b> <b>beleaguering</b> Tartars, and, finally, with the Moors' siege of Paris and their struggle with Charlemagne's army.|$|R
5|$|By 1801, {{the troops}} in Egypt were in an {{increasingly}} desperate situation: supplies were low, reinforcement from France almost non-existent and disease was rife. In addition they were subject to constant attack by Ottoman and irregular Egyptian forces, culminating in the assassination of General Jean Baptiste Kléber. Bonaparte, conscious of his promises to send reinforcements to <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> army in Egypt, planned a series of expeditions to the region to restore morale and numbers to the expeditionary force, drawn from troops and naval units available on the French Atlantic coast. The largest force consisted of 5,000 soldiers and nine ships under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume and sailed from Brest in January 1801, but this squadron had been preceded by two frigates from Rochefort, Africaine and Régénérée.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of war between North Korea and South Korea on June 25, 1950, the United States mobilized a large contingent of troops to send into <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> country. Initially, units occupying Japan were called into the country, but forces were eventually dispatched from the United States. In August 1950, Kouma, who was then a Sergeant First Class, sailed for Korea along {{with much of the}} 2nd Infantry Division. It arrived there in late August and was moved into line at the Pusan Perimeter, where US troops were fighting a tight defensive line around the port city of Pusan.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} period, the Sicilian Muslims also {{established}} footholds in the Italian mainland. The Muslims {{were asked to}} assist <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> Duchy of Naples against Sicard of Benevento in 839, but then they sacked Brindisi and, following Sicard's murder and the outbreak of {{civil war in the}} Principality of Benevento, seized Tarentum in 840 and Bari in 847, which they made their bases. Until well into the 880s, the Muslims would launch destructive raids along the coasts of Italy and into the Adriatic Sea from their bases on the Italian mainland — most notably from the Emirate of Bari, until its destruction in 871.|$|E

50|$|The Regiment, {{with the}} {{division}} {{to which it}} belonged, did not join in the rapid pursuit of the enemy which followed the great victory, and did not take part, consequently in the Battle of Black River Bridge, the next day, where the Twenty-first and Twenty-third Iowa regiments won the first honors and suffered the saddest losses. It joined <b>the</b> <b>beleaguering</b> army soon, however, and bore its full share in the siege of the rebel stronghold. When Vicksburg surrendered, there were few regiments in all the army which had accomplished more, or suffered more, in bringing about the great victory the Twenty-fourth.|$|R
60|$|He repulsed their attacks, but the {{situation}} was desperate. Provisions ran short. He was unable to summon help, and at last determined, with his little body of followers, to endeavour to cut his way out through the besiegers. The attack was sudden and fierce. The Flemings, who, knowing the smallness of his force, had made no preparations to repel an attack, were seized with a panic at the fierce appearance and the wild cries of the Welsh, who fell upon them with such fury that two hundred of the Flemings were slain, and the Welsh cut their way through <b>the</b> <b>beleaguering</b> line.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, 5 Platoon was in dire straits and was {{beginning}} to run low of ammunition, while a number of its M60 machine-guns were also beginning to fail because of the prolonged firing. Moving to outflank the heavily outnumbered Australians, Viet Cong were observed emerging from their bunkers. Indeed, only heavy indirect fire and effective suppressing fire from helicopter gunships prevented them from being overrun. Attempting {{to gain a better}} position to direct the fire, the B Company Forward Observer, Lieutenant Ian Mathers, moved forward to 5 Platoon, and was killed almost immediately. However, by 09:15 the remainder of B Company was able to link up with <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> platoon, and after an aerial resupply of ammunition, stabilised the situation temporarily.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 August, the British Harwich Force, {{supported}} by the battlecruisers of Vice Admiral David Beatty's 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, broke into the Heligoland Bight and attacked the II Scouting Group patrols. In the confused action, Mainz and Cöln were sunk, by light cruisers and battlecruisers, respectively. The majority of crewmen from Mainz were {{picked up by the}} British ships, but Cöln was lost with only one survivor. Kolberg was stationed in port during the attack, and steamed out to support <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> German forces, but the British had departed by the time she reached the scene.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Civil War in April 1861 immediately affected the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. On April 19, two days after Virginia's secession, a violently pro-Southern mob in Baltimore attacked Union soldiers en route to Washington, D.C. as the troops marched through the city's streets between railroad stations. Thereafter known as the Baltimore riot of 1861, the resulting loss of life and local unrest also threatened the , a U.S. Navy ship in Baltimore at the time. Later that same day, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company declined to transport Union forces from Baltimore to <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> Union naval yard facility at Portsmouth, Virginia.|$|E

5|$|This {{situation}} was transformed in AD 793 when ferocious Viking raids began on monasteries like Iona and Lindisfarne, creating fear and confusion across the kingdoms of North Britain. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles eventually {{fell to the}} Norsemen. The King of Fortriu, Eógan mac Óengusa, and the King of Dál Riata Áed mac Boanta, were among the dead in a major defeat {{at the hands of}} the Vikings in 839. A mixture of Viking and Gaelic Irish settlement into south-west Scotland produced the Gall-Gaidel, the Norse Irish, from which the region gets the modern name Galloway. Sometime in the ninth century <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> Kingdom of Dál Riata lost the Hebrides to the Vikings, when Ketil Flatnose is said to have founded the Kingdom of the Isles.|$|E
5|$|After her commissioning, {{she served}} with the II Scouting Group, part of the {{reconnaissance}} forces of the High Seas Fleet. She was assigned to patrols off the island of Heligoland at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914. At the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers. Mainz was initially stationed {{in support of the}} forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> German forces, and encountered a much stronger force of British cruisers and destroyers. They scored several damaging hits with gunfire and a torpedo that disabled Mainz and prompted her commander to abandon ship. The British rescued 348 men from the crew before the ship rolled over and sank. Eighty-nine men were killed in the battle, including her commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|As {{the relief}} army {{approached}} Tyana, it {{was confronted by}} the Arabs, and in the ensuing battle, the Byzantines were routed. According to Theophanes, the two Byzantine generals quarrelled among themselves, and their attack was disorderly. The Byzantines lost many thousand dead, and the captives also numbered in the thousands. The Arabs captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had brought along for <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> city, allowing them to continue the siege. The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour, and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender. The Arabs promised {{to allow them to}} depart unharmed, and the city capitulated after a siege of nine months (in March according to Michael the Syrian, in May–June according to al-Tabari). Theophanes reports that the Arabs broke their promise and enslaved the entire population, which was deported to the Caliphate, but no other source confirms this. After looting the town, the Arabs razed it to the ground.|$|E

5|$|At 02:45 on 10 May, in {{conjunction}} with the ground assault on the Ngok Tavak outpost, elements of the VPA 2nd Division subjected Khâm Đức to a heavy barrage of mortar fire. The North Vietnamese 21st Regiment, later reinforced by the VC 1st Regiment, were in position to attack the U.S.-led Detachment A-105. At 08:30, the Americal Division activated Operation Golden Valley to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> Khâm Đức Special Forces Camp, and at 8:45am the division requested permission from III MAF to change the reaction force so the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, 196th Light Infantry Brigade (2–1st Inf) would replace the 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment, 198th Light Infantry Brigade (1–46th Inf). In the meantime, however, Company A of 1–46th Inf provide the needed reinforcement, until the 2–1st Inf was in position. At around 10:50 Company A of 1–46th Infantry – led by Lieutenant Bobby Thompson – arrived in Khâm Đức along with some supporting artillery and ammunition, and they were immediately assigned to their task.|$|E
5|$|Cöln was {{assigned}} to patrols off the island of Heligoland at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass.

She inadvertently turned back toward them, however, and was quickly disabled when the battle resumed. The crew abandoned Cöln, but German vessels did not search the area for three days, and only one man survived.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{three of}} the militia's horses wandered off; the next day, June 25, three men {{went in search of}} the animals while the rest stayed behind. At the cabin, seven Native American braves {{appeared}} in the distance. The troops immediately began pursuing the natives, who fled into the woods, instead of reporting the sighting to Dement. The Native American warriors, as had been done other times {{during the course of the}} war, set an ambush for the militia men in the forest. The militia pursued the natives into the woods and, as they entered the forest, the natives opened fire, the volley instantly killed two militia men and wounded another. The militia retreated and formed a battle line but the native forces would not relent. The rest of Dement's company attempted to rescue the outmatched militia men but were unable to beat back the native warriors. Black Hawk's band attacked the militia men, again forcing <b>the</b> <b>beleaguered</b> force to fall back to the Kellogg cabin and barn.|$|E
50|$|Xin Wenli was {{the general}} {{guarding}} the Hongni Pass. His weapon was an iron Shuo (槊, a spear-like weapon with a big spearpoint). He was called the General of Eight Horses, not because he had eight horses for riding, but because his physical strength was superb enough to stop a cab towed by eight horses. His stories were similar to Shang Shitu’s because they usually fight together. The most famous thing associated to Xin Wenli was that the famous warrior Pei Yuanqing was killed by bombs and fires from his troop. He died under <b>the</b> <b>beleaguering</b> of Wagong warriors including Qin Shubao, Cheng Yaojin, Wang Bodang and Shan Xiongxin. His sister, Xin Yue’e (新月娥), was a well-known female warrior at that time.|$|R

As Amuba approached a deafening shout of welcome was raised; the gates of the prisons had been thrown open, and those arrested the previous day, and many others of the principal captains of his father's army, thronged round him and greeted him as their king.|$|R
