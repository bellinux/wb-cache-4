50|$|Boundary {{representation}} {{has also}} been extended to allow special, non-solid model types called non-manifold models. As described by Braid, normal solids found in nature have the property that, at every point on the boundary, a small enough sphere around the point {{is divided into two}} pieces, one inside and one outside the object.

50|$|This is a {{different}} approach to data collection than using landmarks and semilandmarks. In this approach, deformation grids are used to capture the morphological shape differences and changes. The general idea is that shape variations can be recorded from one specimen to another based on the distortion of a grid. Bookstein proposed the use of a <b>thin-plate</b> spline (TPS) interpolation, which is a computed deformation grid that calculates a mapping function between two individuals that measures point differences. Basically, the TPS interpolation has a template computed grid that is applied to specimens and the differences in shape can be read from the different deformations of the template. The TPS can be used for both two- and three-dimensional data, but has proved less effective for visualizing three-dimensional differences, but it can easily be applied to the pixels of an image or volumetric data from CT or MRI scans.|$|E
50|$|With {{the purpose}} of {{detecting}} individual gamma rays ranging from 30 MeV to 30 GeV, EGRET was equipped with a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence dome, spark chamber, and calorimeter. Starting from {{the outside of the}} telescope, scientists covered EGRET with a plastic scintillator anti-coincidence dome. The dome acted as a shield, blocking any unwanted energy waves from entering the telescope and skewing the data. To actually create recordable, usable data, scientists used a process called electron-positron pair production, which is creating an electron and positron simultaneously near a nucleus or subatomic particle. In order to induce this process, scientists assembled a multilevel <b>thin-plate</b> spark chamber within the telescope. A spark chamber is basically a chamber with many plates of metal and gases such as helium or neon. Finally, to record the data from the electron or positron about the gamma ray, scientists equipped EGRET with a thallium-activated sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) calorimeter at its base. The calorimeter captured the resolution of the gamma rays that entered EGRET.|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} {{desirable}} {{to build a}} statistical emulator of a complex computer simulator in order to perform analysis which would otherwise be computationally infeasible. We propose methodology to model multivariate output from a computer simulator taking into account output structure in the responses. The utility {{of this approach is}} demonstrated by applying it to a chemical and biological hazard prediction model. Predicting the hazard area that results from an accidental or deliberate chemical or biological release is imperative in civil and military planning and also in emergency response. The hazard area resulting from such a release is highly structured in space and we therefore propose the use of a <b>thin-plate</b> spline to capture the spatial structure and fit a Gaussian process emulator to the coefficients of the resultant basis functions. We compare and contrast four different techniques for emulating multivariate output: dimension-reduction using (i) a fully Bayesian approach with a principal component basis, (ii) a fully Bayesian approach with a <b>thin-plate</b> spline basis, assuming that the basis coefficients are independent, and (iii) a "plug-in" Bayesian approach with a <b>thin-plate</b> spline basis and a separable covariance structure; and (iv) a functional data modeling approach using a tensor-product (separable) Gaussian process. We develop methodology for the two <b>thin-plate</b> spline emulators and demonstrate that these emulators significantly outperform the principal component emulator. Further, the separable <b>thin-plate</b> spline emulator, which accounts for the dependence between basis coefficients, provides substantially more realistic quantification of uncertainty, and is also computationally more tractable, allowing fast emulation. For high resolution output data, it also offers substantial predictive and computational advantages over the tensor-product Gaussian process emulator...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} elastic {{image registration}} {{based on a}} set of corresponding anatomical point landmarks and approximating <b>thin-plate</b> splines. This approach is an extension of the original in-terpolating <b>thin-plate</b> spline approach and allows to take into ac-count landmark localization errors. The extension is important for clinical applications since landmark extraction is always prone to error. Our approach is based on a minimizing functional and can cope with isotropic as well as anisotropic landmark errors. In par-ticular, in the latter case it is possible to include different types of landmarks, e. g., unique point landmarks as well as arbitrary edge points. Also, the scheme is general with respect to the image di-mension and the order of smoothness of the underlying functional. Optimal affine transformations as well as interpolating <b>thin-plate</b> splines are special cases of this scheme.
