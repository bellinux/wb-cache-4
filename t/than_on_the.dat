5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, several US Highways in Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula {{were to be}} designated. However, the routings for two highways were different in Michigan in 1925 <b>than</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final 1926 map. In the original plan, US102 was supposed to replace M-15 from US2 at Rapid River, continue via Marquette into Baraga County, and end at US41 near Covington. At the same time, US41 was to have followed US2 from Powers to Crystal Falls and continued north to Covington. However, when the final plan was approved and implemented on November 11, 1926, US41 took the eastern routing through Rapid River and Marquette, and US102 was routed between Crystal Falls and Covington. In both plans, US 141 was only routed between Milwaukee and Green Bay, replacing WIS17 and WIS16. At the time the two US Highways were created, WIS57 was left untouched between Abrams and Niagara. The next year, the M-57 designation was assigned to connect WIS57 to Quinnesec, and US8 was extended to follow US141 to US2 near Iron Mountain.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} the reorganized Lithuanians {{returned}} to the battle, attacking von Jungingen from the rear. The Teutonic forces were by then becoming outnumbered by the mass of Polish knights and advancing Lithuanian cavalry. As von Jungingen attempted {{to break through the}} Lithuanian lines, he was killed. According to Cronica conflictus, Dobiesław of Oleśnica thrust a lance through the Grand Master's neck, while Długosz presented Mszczuj of Skrzynno as the killer. Surrounded and leaderless, the Teutonic Knights began to retreat. Part of the routed units retreated towards their camp. This move backfired when the camp followers turned against their masters and joined the manhunt. The knights attempted to build a wagon fort: The camp was surrounded by wagons serving as an improvised fortification. However, the defense was soon broken and the camp was ravaged. According to Cronica conflictus, more Knights died there <b>than</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> battlefield. The battle lasted for about ten hours.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges <b>than</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E

40|$|We treated 22 hirsute {{women with}} {{spironolactone}} {{in an open}} trial {{to determine whether it}} caused objective changes in hair growth. Among them, 18 women completed 12 months therapy with 200 mg spironolactone daily. During this period, the mean daily linear growth rates of hair <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face, abdomen, and thigh were reduced to 66 % (P less than 0. 001), 75 % (P less than 0. 01), and 72 % (P less than 0. 001) of their pretreatment values. The mean hair shaft diameters were reduced to 83 % (P less <b>than</b> 0. 01) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face, 88 % (P less <b>than</b> 0. 001) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arm, 74 % (P less <b>than</b> 0. 01) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abdomen, and 80 % (P less <b>than</b> 0. 001) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thigh. Daily hair volume production was calculated from the diameter and daily growth rate; it was reduced to 60 % (P less <b>than</b> 0. 01) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face, 52 % (P less <b>than</b> 0. 01) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arm, 34 % (P less <b>than</b> 0. 001) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abdomen, and 48 % (P less <b>than</b> 0. 001) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thigh. Six of the 18 women who completed the study developed midcycle vaginal bleeding, and 3 women had previously irregular menstrual cycles regulated. We conclude that spironolactone is effective and well tolerated for hirsute women...|$|R
5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> motivations for the bombing or {{the discussion of the}} bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E
5|$|Early {{experiments}} with floating petroleum {{on the sea}} and igniting it were not entirely successful: the fuel was difficult to ignite, large quantities were required to cover even modest areas and the weapon was easily disrupted by waves. However, the potential was clear. By early 1941 a flame barrage technique was developed. Rather than attempting to ignite oil floating on water, nozzles were placed above high-water mark with pumps producing sufficient pressure to spray fuel which produced a roaring wall of flame over, rather <b>than</b> <b>on,</b> <b>the</b> water. Such installations consumed considerable resources and although this weapon was impressive, its network of pipes was vulnerable to pre-landing bombardment; General Brooke did not consider it effective. Initially ambitious plans were cut back to cover {{just a few miles}} of beaches.|$|E
5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> details of the treatments.|$|E

5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} often curious about divers {{when they first}} enter the water and may {{approach}} quite closely, though they lose interest on repeat dives. They can become dangerous {{in the presence of}} food, and tend to be more aggressive if encountered in open water rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> reef. There have been several known attacks on spearfishers, possibly by mistake, when the shark struck at the speared fish close to the diver. This species will also attack if pursued or cornered, and divers should immediately retreat (slowly and always facing the shark) if it begins to perform a threat display. Photographing the display should not be attempted, as the flash from a camera is known to have incited at least one attack. Although of modest size, they are capable of inflicting significant damage: during one study of the threat display, a grey reef shark attacked the researchers' submersible multiple times, leaving tooth marks in the plastic windows and biting off one of the propellers. The shark consistently launched its attacks from a distance of , which it was able to cover in a third of a second. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed seven unprovoked and six provoked attacks (none of them fatal) attributable to this species.|$|E
5|$|In Anglo-Saxon England, Witenagemot was {{an early}} {{equivalent}} to the Privy Council of England. During the reigns of the Norman monarchs, the English Crown was advised by a royal court or curia regis, which consisted of magnates, ecclesiastics and high officials. The body originally concerned itself with advising the sovereign on legislation, administration and justice. Later, different bodies assuming distinct functions evolved from the court. The courts of law took over the business of dispensing justice, while Parliament became the supreme legislature of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the Council retained the power to hear legal disputes, either {{in the first instance}} or on appeal. Furthermore, laws made by the sovereign on the advice of the Council, rather <b>than</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> advice of Parliament, were accepted as valid. Powerful sovereigns often used the body to circumvent the Courts and Parliament. For example, a committee of the Council—which later became the Court of the Star Chamber—was during the 15th century permitted to inflict any punishment except death, without being bound by normal court procedure. During Henry VIII's reign, the sovereign, on the advice of the Council, was allowed to enact laws by mere proclamation. The legislative pre-eminence of Parliament was not restored until after Henry VIII's death. Though the royal Council retained legislative and judicial responsibilities, it became a primarily administrative body. The Council consisted of forty members in 1553, but the sovereign relied on a smaller committee, which later evolved into the modern Cabinet.|$|E
