[...] Frank O'Connor comically noted that at a Gamestop conference, the Bungie team was told to wear business casual, to which O'Connor replied [...] "We [...] don't do business casual." ...|$|E
500|$|Goddard {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} Brad Snyder on As the World Turns, {{and though he}} was not cast in the part, Barbara Bloom, the senior vice-president of CBS Daytime, recommended Goddard to The Young and the Restlesss head writer and executive producer, Latham. After testing for the character of Cane for Latham and casting director Karen Rea, Goddard received the role. The Australian actor auditioned with an American accent, but when the writers found out about his Australian background, that influenced Cane's backstory. The actor stated that, [...] "The concept of Cane {{was that he was}} given away at birth. So he could have been from Mongolia. It just worked out luckily for me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> right person for the job." [...] Since the producers could not understand the actor's real Australian accent, Goddard [...] "Americanized" [...] it while portraying the character.|$|E
500|$|By October, the Foundation's {{financial}} affairs {{had reached}} a crisis point. According to his public relations assistant, Barbara Klowden, Hubbard became increasingly paranoid and authoritarian due to [...] "political and organizational problems with people grabbing for power." [...] He began an affair with the twenty-year-old Klowden, much to the annoyance of Northrup, who was clearly aware of the liaison. Klowden recalled that Northrup [...] "was very hostile to me. We were talking about guns and {{she said to me}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> type to use a Saturday night special" [...] (a very cheap [...] "junk gun"). One evening he arranged a double-date with his wife and Klowden, who was accompanied by Hollister, an instructor in the Los Angeles Dianetic Foundation. The dinner party backfired drastically; Northrup began an affair with Hollister, a handsome 22-year-old who was college-educated and a noted sportsman.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} several elaborate CGI scenes. The {{first scene}} with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. Alex Krycek {{was killed by a}} CGI bullet straight through the head, which again was Manners' idea. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, [...] "when they came to me and told me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad." [...] Manners later called it one of his [...] "favorite scenes [...] ever directed" [...] and one of the [...] "best scenes [...] {{seen in a long time}} on television." ...|$|E
500|$|Near the {{beginning}} of the episode, Praise plays a Russian grandmaster at chess. The Complete X-Files notes that the [...] "chess motif" [...] was carried on throughout the episode, most notably in the fact that The Smoking Man [...] "plays Mulder to a checkmate, using Jeffrey as a pawn." [...] Because of this, and his past actions, many perceived The Smoking Man as the true villain of the story. William B. Davis, who played The Smoking Man, however, felt that the character was the hero of the story. He noted, [...] "I used to go to conventions and try to convince everyone <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> hero of the series and Mulder was the bad guy. [...] I got a lot of laughs, but it's certainly true of how one plays the character. Nobody thinks they're evil." ...|$|E
500|$|There was a {{backlash}} in India, which forced Gilchrist to clarify his position. Gilchrist later {{insisted that he}} did not accuse Tendulkar of lying in his testimony. He also denied calling the Indian a [...] "bad sport" [...] in regards to the handshake issue. Tendulkar responded by saying that [...] "those remarks came from someone who doesn't know me enough. I think he made loose statements...I reminded him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first person to shake hands after the Sydney defeat." [...] The autobiography also blamed the ICC for allowing Sri Lankan cricketer Muralitharan to bowl; Gilchrist believes that ICC changed the throwing law to legitimise a bowling action that he regards as illegitimate. The law change was described as [...] "a load of horse crap. That's rubbish." [...] Gilchrist claimed that Muralitharan threw the ball and alleged that the ICC protected him because Sri Lankan cricket authorities portrayed any criticism of the bowler's legitimacy as racism and a witchhunt conducted by whites. In response to these comments, former Sri Lankan captain Marvan Atapattu said that by questioning the credentials of players like Muralitharan and Tendulkar, Gilchrist had done no good to his own reputation.|$|E

500|$|Hunger {{and desperation}} {{eventually}} forced Sitting Bull, and 186 {{of his family}} and followers, to return to the United States and surrender on July 19, 1881. Sitting Bull had his young son Crow Foot surrender his Winchester lever-action carbine to Major David H. Brotherton, commanding officer of Fort Buford, Sitting Bull said to Major David H. Brotherton, [...] "I wish it to be remembered <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> last man of my tribe to surrender my rifle." [...] To the Oglala Lakotas, Dakotas and Nakota, [...] "to surrender my rifle" [...] in this context meant [...] "We have killed enough white men with your own rifles so I give this rifle back to you, for Tunkasila Wakantanka (Grandfather Great Mystery) will use a different way to help us overcome the white man." [...] In the parlor of the Commanding Officer's Quarters in a ceremony the next day, he told the four soldiers, 20 warriors and other guests in the small room that he wished to regard the soldiers and the white race as friends but he wanted to know who would teach his son the new ways of the world. Two weeks later, after waiting in vain for other members of his tribe to follow him from Canada, the Army transferred Sitting Bull and his band to Fort Yates, the military post located adjacent to the Standing Rock Agency. This reservation straddles the present-day boundary between North and South Dakota.|$|E
500|$|Jones {{was cast}} as Rooney {{based on his}} role in Amadeus, where he played the emperor; Hughes thought that character's modern {{equivalent}} was Rooney. [...] "My part was actually quite small in the script, but {{what seemed to be}} the important part to me was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only one who wasn't swept along by Ferris", recalls Jones. [...] "So I {{was the only one in}} opposition, which presented a lot of opportunities, some of which weren't even in the script or were expanded on. John was receptive to anything I had to offer, and indeed got ideas along the way himself. So that was fun, working with him." [...] "Hughes told me at the time — and I thought he was just blowing his own horn — he said, 'You are going to be known for this for the rest of your life.' And I thought, 'Sure'... but he was right." [...] To help Jones study for the part, Hughes took him to meet his old vice principal. [...] "This is the guy I want you to pay close attention to," [...] Jones explained to Hughes' biographer Kirk Honeycutt. While meeting him, the VP's coat momentarily flew open revealing a holster and gun attached to the man's belt. This made Jones realize what Hughes had envisioned."The guy was 'Sign up for the Army quick before I kill you!'" [...] Jones exclaimed.|$|E
500|$|On 20 May, two {{flights of}} F-86 Sabres {{encountered}} multiple MiG-15s in MiG Alley, and through radio communications, two additional flights of F-86 Sabres joined the battle, including Jabara. In {{preparation for the}} oncoming battle, Jabara and the other F-86 Sabre pilots were ordered to jettison their auxiliary fuel tanks to improve their maneuverability. Jabara's fuel tank failed to separate from his wing, and protocol required he return to base as the aircraft would be impeded by the extra weight and imbalance, and limit his potential to match off with a MiG. However, Jabara decided to continue to the air battle, where {{he was able to}} still handle his aircraft well enough to be credited with shooting down two MiG-15s with [...]50 caliber machine gun fire. The first was in a group of three MiGs and the other was the last in a six-plane group. Jabara was able to see the first aircraft explode from his gunfire, but he only saw his second victory go into a tailspin as he was avoiding being targeted by another MiG. His fifth and sixth victories made Jabara the first American in history to use jet aircraft to become an ace. The Americans said the 20-minute air battle had included 36 F-86 Sabres against nearly 50 MiG-15s (Russian data shows 30 MiGs), and the American pilots recorded Jabara's two victories and another pilot's [...] "probable". While returning to base, Jabara's F-86 Sabre was so low on fuel, he turned off the engine and glided towards the base before turning it on prior to landing. Data-matching with Soviet records made available {{since the end of the}} Cold War has since shown that only one MiG was lost in the combat, and that Jabara's jet-versus-jet tally was four at best. Nevertheless, American military forces claimed that Jabara was the first jet-versus-jet ace. Jabara later stated in an interview, [...] "That was my bag for the day, and it made me feel pretty good to know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first jet ace in the history of aerial warfare." [...] The mission was his 63rd Korean mission of an eventual 163; he was awarded a Distinguished Service Cross, the nation's second-highest decoration.|$|E
