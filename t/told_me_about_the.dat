500|$|Director John Ford {{said that}} when he was a prop boy {{in the early days of}} silent pictures, Earp would visit pals on the sets he knew from his Tombstone days. [...] "I used to give him a chair and a cup of coffee, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fight at the O.K. Corral. So in My Darling Clementine, we did it exactly the way it had been." [...] When Ford was working on his last silent feature Hangman's House in 1928, which {{included}} the first credited screen appearances by John Wayne, Earp used to visit the set. John Wayne later told Hugh O'Brian that he based his Western lawman walk, talk and persona to his acquaintance with Wyatt Earp, who was good friends with Mix. [...] "I knew him... I often thought of Wyatt Earp when I played a film character. There's a guy that actually did what I'm trying to do." [...] Wyatt Earp's character has been the central figure in 10 films and featured in many more. Among the best-known actors who have portrayed him are Randolph Scott, Guy Madison, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, Hugh O'Brian, Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner.|$|E
500|$|... "Cool" [...] was {{originally}} written by Dallas Austin {{after listening to}} Stefani's group No Doubt's song [...] "Underneath It All" [...] (2002). Austin commented {{that he was trying}} to write his version of No Doubt's [...] "Simple Kind of Life", but he was unable to finish the song. He later asked Stefani if she wanted to co-write lyrics. During a studio session together, they finished [...] "Cool" [...] in 15 minutes. Stefani commented, [...] "When he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> track and where it came from for him, it just triggered something in me." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] reflect Stefani's former relationship with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal. Although their romantic relationship ended, the lyrics portray Stefani's attitude that it is [...] "cool" [...] that they still remain very good friends. Stefani and Kanal's relationship had provided the inspiration for No Doubt's [...] "Don't Speak" [...] (1996), and while [...] "Cool" [...] presents an amicable friendship between former lovers, [...] "Don't Speak" [...] is about a failing relationship and never arrives at a solution for the couple. Stefani said that she had never intended to include [...] "personal" [...] material on Love. Angel. Music. Baby., and commented, [...] "but no matter what you do, things just come out. It just ended this whole thing for me in my head, and it puts an end to a chapter in a really nice way." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Cool" [...] sum up the evolution of their relationship with the line [...] "After all that we've been through, I know we're cool".|$|E
2500|$|S.A. Dange and C. Rajeswara Rao {{have both}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{meeting with the}} leaders of the CPSU.

2500|$|Madelyn Dunham (née Madelyn Lee Payne) was Obama's {{maternal}} {{grandmother who}} worked in banking and became vice president of a bank in Hawaii. Obama grew up with her and remembered {{that when he was}} a child, his grandmother [...] "read me the opening lines of the Declaration of Independence and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> men and women who marched for equality because they believed those words put to paper two centuries ago should mean something." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commissioned ensign on June 7, 1918, he was {{assigned}} to the destroyer , operating out of Brest, France as part of the destroyer force tasked with anti-submarine patrols against German U-boats in European waters. He made a poor impression almost immediately. [...] "They never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lack of space on destroyers. My baggage filled the whole wardroom. I was a very unpopular young officer for that." [...] Nevertheless, he was promoted to lieutenant (junior grade) in September.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fate of {{most black}} fighters, ones with white {{managers}}, who wound up burned-out and broke {{before they reached}} their prime. The white managers {{were not interested in}} the men they were handling but in the money they could make from them. They didn't take the proper time to see that their fighters had a proper training, that they lived comfortably, or ate well, or had some pocket change. Mr. Roxborough was talking about Black Power before it became popular.|$|E
6000|$|You had not <b>told</b> <b>me</b> before <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fatuous {{person who}} thought Roads like Ruskin--surely the vaguest of {{contemporaneous}} humanity. Again my letter writing {{is of an}} enfeebled sort.--Ever your affectionate son, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aren't you {{a little}} over-modest?" [...] he asked. [...] "You haven't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> much <b>about</b> <b>the</b> social side of this new era which you propose to inaugurate, but I imagine that intellect {{will be the only}} aristocracy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Jack. That is, he has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> a {{good many}} things. Of course I don't suppose he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> some of <b>the</b> tricks they played." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for a long moment -- and then <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I didn't {{catch his}} name---Rotherwood was mumbling in his quick way--- indeed, I {{am not sure}} {{he did not think}} I knew him.

60|$|For {{the rest}} of the voyage {{up-channel}} Mr. M'Leod talked to me of the assembling, preparation, and sale of the rarer furs; and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> things <b>about</b> <b>the</b> manufacture of fur-lined coats which quite shocked me. Somehow or other, when we landed on Wednesday, I found myself pledged to spend that week-end with him at Holmescroft.|$|R

6000|$|... "I guess I'm going to," [...] Lucy laughed. [...] "Still, you won't want it for {{two hours}} yet, and {{it looks as if}} there's {{something}} {{to be done in the}} meanwhile. I didn't come over for supper or to talk to you; I met Farquhar on the prairie, and he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>the</b> thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{be sure he}} could! <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{old folks}} at home; and {{described}} our house as natural as if he'd a-been there.

6000|$|... 'Provided {{always that}} the said Harold Ashurst Tillington does not marry----leave a blank there, Miss Cayley.

6000|$|She said stubbornly: [...] "She {{came and}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> it. <b>The</b> boy is dead, as you know. Yes, terrible, isn't it?" [...] And {{she looked at}} him. His face was almost comic, so {{wrinkled}} up with incredulity.|$|R
6000|$|...

6000|$|... "Mr. Maxwell was {{on board}} the steamer," [...] she said, with a calmness that puzzled her aunt.

6000|$|She went on, glad {{to escape}} the man.
