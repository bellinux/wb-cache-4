5|$|This mirrors {{tropical}} cyclone genesis near <b>these</b> <b>features,</b> as genesis clusters in 2–3weeks of activity followed by 2–3weeks of inactivity. Tropical cyclones can form in outbreaks around <b>these</b> <b>features</b> under special circumstances, tending {{to follow the}} next cyclone to its poleward and west.|$|E
5|$|Holes {{and windows}} require special {{consideration}} when die casting because the perimeters of <b>these</b> <b>features</b> will grip to the die steel during solidification. To counteract this affect, generous draft {{should be added}} to hole and window features.|$|E
5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then <b>these</b> <b>features</b> can be tracked {{to estimate the}} rotation rate. However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that <b>these</b> <b>features</b> can actually vary the rotation rate of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to what was}} built, the original plans also called for a multi-story parking garage, a 550-seat conventional movie theatre, and a direct underground link to the Museum subway stop. <b>These</b> <b>features</b> were deemed too costly and were never built.|$|E
5|$|The 'core' neuroacanthocytosis syndromes are chorea acanthocytosis and McLeod syndrome. Acanthocytes {{are nearly}} always present in these {{conditions}} and they share common clinical features. Some of <b>these</b> <b>features</b> are also seen in the other neurological syndromes associated with neuroacanthocytosis.|$|E

5|$|A {{course of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be completed}} {{in less time than}} other radiotherapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance for surviving cancer-cells to divide and grow in the intervals between each radiotherapy dose. Patients typically have to make fewer visits to the radiotherapy clinic compared with EBRT, and may receive the treatment as outpatients. This makes treatment accessible and convenient for many patients. <b>These</b> <b>features</b> of brachytherapy mean that most patients are able to tolerate the brachytherapy procedure very well.|$|E

5|$|Arachnids lack some {{features}} of other chelicerates, including backward-pointing mouths and gnathobases ("jaw bases") at {{the bases of}} their legs; both of <b>these</b> <b>features</b> {{are part of the}} ancestral arthropod feeding system. Instead, they have mouths that point forwards and downwards, and all have some means of breathing air. Spiders (Araneae) are distinguished from other arachnid groups by several characteristics, including spinnerets and, in males, pedipalps that are specially adapted for sperm transfer.|$|E
5|$|Architecturally, Plas Mawr {{is almost}} {{unchanged}} from the 16th century, {{making it a}} very rare survival from this period. The architectural style {{is a product of}} the broader Renaissance influences prevalent across Europe at the time. Robert Wynn spent time in Germany, and the style of Plas Mawr makes use of North German Gothic themes, particularly in its use of symmetry, the pedimented windows at the front of the house, faceted finials and crow-stepped gables. <b>These</b> <b>features</b> were already popular in England when the house was built, and indeed Plas Mawr is very similar in design to Eastbury Manor House, the two possibly being based off the same architectural plan. Some of <b>these</b> <b>features</b> had already begun to spread into Wales – crow-stepped gables, for example, were already being used in Flintshire by the 1580s – but others were ground breaking in Wales, such as the use of ovolo-moulded and dormer windows. Nonetheless, Robert Wynn was only an emerging member of the gentry, and his house was not as large or as sophisticated as contemporary grander Renaissance properties built in larger rural settings.|$|E
5|$|At Middle Hope a {{sequence}} of carboniferous limestone is exposed, which includes thick volcanic tuffs and lavas, demonstrating Tournaisian carbonate sections. The site contains a Pleistocene-aged fossil cliff and shore platform. <b>These</b> <b>features</b> {{have led to the}} designation of Middle Hope as a regionally important geological site (RIGS).|$|E

5|$|At {{least in}} some species, {{juvenile}} ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm {{for as long as}} they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. <b>These</b> <b>features</b> make ctenophores capable of increasing their populations very quickly.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{neurologist}} C. Miller Fisher {{described the}} variant {{that bears his}} name in 1956. British neurologist Edwin Bickerstaff, based in Birmingham, described the brainstem encephalitis type in 1951 with Philip Cloake, and made further contributions with another paper in 1957. Guillain had reported on some of <b>these</b> <b>features</b> prior to their full description in 1938. Further subtypes have been described since then, such as the form featuring pure ataxia and the type causing pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness. The axonal subtype was first described in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Cases of {{epilepsy}} may {{be organized}} into epilepsy syndromes by the specific {{features that are}} present. <b>These</b> <b>features</b> include the age that seizure begin, the seizure types, EEG findings, among others. Identifying an epilepsy syndrome is useful as it helps determine the underlying causes {{as well as what}} anti-seizure medication should be tried.|$|E

5|$|For guitars {{with six}} strings, every major-third tuning repeats its three open-notes in two octaves, so {{providing}} many options for fingering chords. By repeating open-string notes and by having uniform intervals between strings, major-thirds tuning simplifies learning by beginners. <b>These</b> <b>features</b> also facilitate advanced guitarists' improvisation, precisely {{the aim of}} jazz guitarist RalphPatt when he began popularizing major-thirds tuning between 1963 and 1964.|$|E
5|$|In development, {{significant}} {{attention was}} given to the Tornado's short-field take-off and landing (STOL) performance. Germany, in particular, encouraged this design aspect. For shorter take-off and landing distances, the Tornado can sweep its wings forwards to the 25-degree position, and deploy its full-span flaps and leading edge slats to allow the aircraft to fly at slower speeds. <b>These</b> <b>features,</b> in combination with the thrust reverser-equipped engines, give the Tornado excellent low-speed handling and landing characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{architectural}} features {{found among}} the settlements of Supe, including subterranean circular courts, stepped pyramids and sequential platforms, as well as material remains and their cultural implications, excavated at Aspero and the valley sites we are digging (Caral, Chupacigarro, Lurihuasi, Miraya), are shared with other settlements of the area that participated in {{what is known as}} the Kotosh Religious Tradition. Most specific among <b>these</b> <b>features</b> are rooms with benches and hearths with subterranean ventilation ducts, wall niches, biconvex beads, musical flutes, etc.|$|E
