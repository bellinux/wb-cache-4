5|$|The P-3 was powered {{with the}} same DB601A-1 engines. The {{aircraft}} was also designed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> with a land catapult (KL-12). A towing hook {{was added to the}} fuselage under the cockpit for the cable. Just eight examples were produced, all without bomb equipment.|$|E
5|$|The light {{aircraft}} was a 1976-built 6-seat Piper PA-32R-300 Cherokee Lance piloted by Steven Altman with 2 passengers. Altman was given clearance {{from the tower}} at Teterboro Airport in Teterboro, New Jersey at 11:48a.m. <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> It departed at 11:49a.m., and was headed for Ocean City, New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|A second British raid, {{which had}} been {{scheduled}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> from 08:00 on 17 July, was cancelled two minutes before the aircraft were to begin launching when fog began to build up near the carriers, and the British fleet turned south to return to Scapa Flow.

5|$|After a {{telephone}} discussion with a Casper weather briefer, Reid decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> despite the worsening {{conditions at the}} airport, {{and to try to}} escape the poor weather by turning immediately eastward. He decided to file a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan, and depart under VFR, to be better able to cope with the heavy weather in his immediate takeoff path and the vicinity of the airport.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} construction {{effort in}} the face of wet weather, the airbase was completed and proved useful. Whereas the base at Nadzab was surrounded by mountains and was therefore unsuited for missions that had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> after dark, there was no such problem at Saidor. During March 1944, B-24 Liberator bombers staged through Saidor for night attacks on Hollandia.|$|E
5|$|As {{the project}} name suggests, the mobile robot is a cobot – a {{collaborative}} robot. During phases of navigation and inspection, a human operator accompanies the robot; {{he can take}} control if necessary, add inspection tasks, note a defect {{that is not in}} the list of robot checks, or validate the results. In the case of pre-flight inspections, the diagnosis of the walk-around is sent to the pilot who decides whether or not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

5|$|Asch was {{notable for}} a chance event. The 390th Squadron of the 366th Fighter Group had {{launched}} two fighter sweeps that morning, which {{played a crucial role}} in the failure of JG 11′s attack. The leader of the 487th squadron, 352nd Fighter Group, John Charles Meyer, anticipated German activity and had a flight of 12 P-51s about <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> on a combat patrol when the attack began. They took off under fire.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 10:00, {{the runway}} at Khâm Đức was cleared of the wrecked helicopter. Moments later, a C-130 piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Daryl D. Cole touched {{down on the}} runway under heavy fire, which flattened one tire and caused extensive damage to the wing tanks. Almost immediately, Cole's aircraft was rushed by hysterical Vietnamese civilians from ditches along the runway, filling the aircraft so the loadmaster was prevented from unloading the aircraft's cargo. Under heavy fire, Cole decided to navigate his aircraft down the cratered and shrapnel-littered runway, in order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> However, the combined weight of the cargo and civilians, {{in addition to the}} damage sustained during landing, prevented the aircraft from gathering enough speed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> So the aircrew aborted the take off, offloaded the civilians, and proceeded to cut off the blown tire to stop it from flapping and slowing down the aircraft. They were able to cut off the rubber with the bayonet, and were able to cut through the steel beading thanks to the engineers carefully cutting the steel cords with a blowtorch. A fire extinguisher was kept handy because of fear of catching the magnesium wheel on fire. About two hours later, realizing that enemy artillery rounds were coming closer to his aircraft, Colonel Cole tried <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> for the second time, and managed to get the C-130 into the air. This time his only passengers were three members of Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT), whose radio equipment had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Development of the prototypes of {{what are}} {{now known as the}} 'Air Gates' began in 2002 and renowned Hungarian pilot Péter Besenyei {{successfully}} completed the first test flight through them. After two years in planning and development, the first official Red Bull Air Race was ready <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> in Zeltweg, Austria in 2003. A second was staged the same year near Budapest in Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a crash barrier aft of the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was intended to prevent landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> and stop them from falling into the open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E

The freeway was closed until August 18, and a memorial was later installed near the interchange between I-94 and Middlebelt Road.|$|E
