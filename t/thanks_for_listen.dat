Schuyler deserves special credit, both for his help and criticism, and for encouraging me to pursue this study. Dr. Henry H. Glassie and Dr. James Deetz also deserve special <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>listening</b> to my ideas for endless hours and providing me with invaluable insights. I wish to thank Ms. Lois Burch-Gauci for all of her help with the interpretation of the forms of these gravestones.

The completion of this thesis and related publications {{would not have been}} possible without the encouragement and assistance from Dr. Haq. Thank you again. This 2 nd thesis is again, dedicated to my parents. Thank {{you for all}} the wisdom along the journey. My brothers, Anom and Ari, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>listening</b> and all the inputs. This is yours too! My dearest old friends, Stephanie, Arthi, Neerja, Andre, and Feli for sticking up and helping out with lots of my emotional burden.

40|$|Acknowledgement I {{would like}} to thank those people whose support, encouragement, and {{inspiration}} have sustained me throughout this project. First of all, I {{would like to}} thank my children for their love and for being there for me to love, providing perspective and balance to my life. My daughter, Heather, whose dissertation process has coincided with mine, deserves <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>listening,</b> <b>for</b> casting me in the role of good example, and for introducing me to the work of Ken Wilber. I thank my son, David, for his moral support, fine cuisine, and most of all, for sharing his perspective and helping me to see things in new ways. Thank you also to my daughter, Diana, for lovingly anticipating my needs, for critiquing my case study, and for offering me the joys of grandmotherhood, {{in the midst of the}} dissertation process, by producing a miracle in the form of my new grandson, Charles. Thanks to my mentor and friend, John Presley, for helping me make space in my life for this dissertation, but more importantly, for his unwavering confidence in me and for an occasional push, just when I needed it...|$|R
40|$|The {{polyhedron}} model provides {{one possible}} approach to model-based program analysis and transformation. Over the years, it has undergone many improvements {{in order to}} handle a still growing class of programs. A recent approach enabled the use of non-linear parameters, which was in that generality not possible before. While this new framework uses real quantifier elimination, the present work examines possibilities to describe the integral solutions to certain problems occurring in the polyhedron model exactly. In particular, we study the solvability of systems of linear Diophantine equations in one and several non-linear integral parameters and demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} developed methods for Banerjee’s data dependence analysis. Acknowledgements First of all, I want to thank my friend and tutor Armin Größlinger for giving me the opportunity and the initial impulse to dive into the problems that led to this work, for all the illuminating discussions and his clear comments and suggestions. I would like to thank Dr. Martin Griebl for providing and forming a sound platform to present those ideas: the LooPo-Team, to which I say <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>listening</b> and the feed-back...|$|R
40|$|My life’s {{journey is}} filled with {{experiences}} where people, in very unique ways and beautiful selves, have contributed to what I am now. They are remembered and cherished in whatever time space they are; thanks to all. I dedicate this work in memoriam to my father, Maximino Ramos, who taught me that living with a disability was {{not a sign of}} weakness, but a human condition that allows discovering life’s richness from a different angle. Gracias pa’, tu eres mi héroe, te extraño tanto. As a traveler far from home I am most grateful to my family, notably to my mother Rosa who stood as beacon for me to follow. Gracias Mami tu eres mi joya. Also, to my brothers, Hector Ramos and Edwin Ramos, who always were there when I needed them. Both of them carried the torch of caring for others and had the ability to listen and soothe in moment of pain, a value passed on by our loving parents. To my sister-in-law, Mickey, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> caring; to my sister-in-law, Clary, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>listening.</b> I am eternally grateful to my soul sister Gloria Curtin.

40|$|The good {{folks at}} KRUA 88. 1 {{made the mistake}} of {{actually}} letting us on the air unsupervised for a real broadcast. With little preparation and an unimaginable lack of training we hit the Anchorage airways at 4 pm. [...] [...] Without apology we had no focus or script to work from. The show went loose and fast, but we think folks enjoyed it. We had a number of callers saying how much they loved the show, and only one complaint. Well, it actually wasn’t a complaint as much as it was a request to bring the show before us back on the air. LOL. [...] [...] Joining the show today was Keith Berggren, UAA’s eLearning: Distance Student Services Coordinator. Keith talked about the services available to UAA’s distance students. From distance test proctoring to orientation to Blackboard tutorials the Distance Student Services office is here to help. [...] [...] Josh the Intern also stopped by. He enlightened us with talk about YouTube vloggers and did a little monologue from a class of his. Rumor has it that he was {{the best part of the}} show.

Finally, I thank CAPES for full support. i Resumo Nesta tese serão analisados dois problemas relacionados a espaços do tipo AdS 4 × M.

6000|$|Three days afterward, {{she wrote}} to the clergyman, asking him to call on her. She had come, she said, {{to live in the}} parish, and hoped to be able, with his assistance, to be of some use among the people. She would hardly know how to act without some counsel from him. The schools might be all that was excellent, but if there was {{anything}} required she hoped he would tell her. On the following morning the clergyman called, and, with many <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> her generosity, <b>listened</b> to her plans, and accepted her subsidies. But he was a married man, and he said nothing of his wife, nor during the next week did his wife come to call on her. She was to be left desolate by all, because men had told lies of her! ...|$|R
