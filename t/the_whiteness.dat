5|$|The {{tree was}} well known to Māori before its {{scientific}} discovery. The generic Māori language term for plants in the Cordyline genus is tī, and names recorded as specific to C.australis include tī kōuka, tī kāuka, tī rākau, tī awe, tī pua, and tī whanake. Each tribe had names for the tree depending on its local uses and characteristics. Simpson reports that the names highlight {{the characteristics of the}} tree that were important to Māori. These include what the plant looked like—whether it was a large tree (tī rākau, tī pua), <b>the</b> <b>whiteness</b> of its flowers (tī puatea), whether its leaves were broad (tī wharanui), twisted along the edges (tī tahanui), or spiky (tī tarariki). Other names refer to its uses—whether its fruit attracted birds (tī manu), or the leaves were particularly suitable for making ropes (tī whanake) and nets (tī kupenga). The most widely used name, tī kōuka, refers {{to the use of the}} leaf hearts as food.|$|E
25|$|Masks {{may also}} {{indicate}} a culture's ideal of feminine beauty. The masks of Punu of Gabon have highly arched eyebrows, almost almond-shaped {{eyes and a}} narrow chin. The raised strip running {{from both sides of}} the nose to the ears represent jewellery. Dark black hairstyle, tops the mask off. <b>The</b> <b>whiteness</b> of the face represent <b>the</b> <b>whiteness</b> and beauty of the spirit world. Only men wear the masks and perform the dances with high stilts despite the masks representing women. One of the most beautiful representations of female beauty is the Idia's Mask of Benin in present-day Edo State of Nigeria. It is believed to have been commissioned by a king of Benin in memory of his mother. To honor his dead mother, the king wore the mask on his hip during special ceremonies.|$|E

The flag colors of the island are dark blue, traditionally identified with the sea that surrounds the island, and white for <b>the</b> <b>whiteness</b> of the snow-covered peaks of Mount Teide during winter.

25|$|This {{account is}} {{consistent}} with teleological explanations of life, which account for phenomena in terms of purpose or goal-directedness. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>whiteness</b> of the polar bear's coat is explained by its purpose of camouflage. The direction of causality (from the future to the past) is in contradiction with the scientific evidence for natural selection, which explains the consequence {{in terms of a}} prior cause. Biological features are explained not by looking at future optimal results, but by looking at the past evolutionary history of a species, which led to the natural selection of the features in question.|$|E
25|$|Ivory, both {{then and}} now, connotes royal wealth, power, and purity. Ivory, already a luxury {{commodity}} in Africa, became increasingly coveted {{with the growth}} of the European ivory trade. When an elephant was killed in Benin, the Oba received one tusk as a gift and was offered the other in sale. Thus, the Oba had many tusks and controlled the ivory trade. Ivory is associated with the Edo orisha of the sea, Olokun. As this orisha gives wealth and fertility, it the spirit world's equivalent of the Benin Oba. Ivory gave wealth similar to Olokun, as it enticed the Portuguese merchants who, in turn, returned wealth to Benin. The Portuguese belonged to Olokun, having arrived from the sea. <b>The</b> <b>whiteness</b> of ivory also reflects the symbolism of white chalk, whose ritual purity is associated with Olokun.|$|E
25|$|It {{follows from}} {{theory that the}} Kalman filter is the optimal linear filter in cases where a) the model {{perfectly}} matches the real system, b) the entering noise is white (uncorrelated) and c) the covariances of the noise are exactly known. Several methods for the noise covariance estimation have been proposed during past decades, including ALS, mentioned in the section above. After the covariances are estimated, {{it is useful to}} evaluate the performance of the filter; i.e., whether it is possible to improve the state estimation quality. If the Kalman filter works optimally, the innovation sequence (the output prediction error) is a white noise, therefore <b>the</b> <b>whiteness</b> property of the innovations measures filter performance. Several different methods can be used for this purpose. If the noise terms are non-Gaussian distributed, methods for assessing performance of the filter estimate, which use probability inequalities or large-sample theory, are known in the literature.|$|E

By analogy, nearly Planckian light sources such as certain fluorescent or high-intensity discharge lamps can be judged by their correlated color temperature (CCT), the color temperature of the Planckian radiator that best approximates them. For light source spectra that are not Planckian, color temperature is not a well defined attribute; the concept of correlated color temperature was developed to map such sources as well as possible onto the one-dimensional scale of color temperature, where [...] "as well as possible" [...] is defined {{in the context of}} an objective color space.|$|E

2500|$|The cost of {{tin oxide}} rose {{considerably}} during the 1918-1918 war {{and resulted in}} a search for cheaper alternatives. The first successful replacement was zirconia and later zircon. Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective opacifiers as tin oxide, their relatively low price has led to a gradual increase in their use, with an associated reduction in the use of tin oxide. <b>The</b> <b>whiteness</b> resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more [...] "clinical" [...] than that from tin oxide and is preferred in some applications. [...] Nevertheless, tin oxide still finds use in ceramic manufacture and has been widely used as the opacifier in sanitaryware, with up to 6% used in glazes. Otherwise, tin oxide in glazes, often in conjunction with zircon compounds, is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.|$|E

2500|$|Ruiz’s view on racialization is nuanced, as she proves <b>the</b> <b>whiteness</b> of Californios {{to create}} a gap between Californios and laboring Mexicans, Indians, and blacks. Furthermore, the disdain of Indians from the Californio’s {{point of view is}} {{discussed}} which indicates the hierarchy of class, intelligence, and importance. Californios appear to be the middle man in sense of racial hierarchy because the strive to embraced by the Anglo community is apparent, but unachievable which also applies to the Indians. This “conscious drive towards assimilation… reveals Mexican American particularity” and calls for readers to “ of basic analytic categories such as… nations and nationalism.” When taking into account Ruiz’s descriptions of the body, this work strays away from the Mexican American particularity and towards dismodernity. Dismodern “relies on the malleability of the human body and identity.” It “emphasizes physical difference and disability as unifying, ethical norm from whence new subjective categories and political identities will emerge,” and argues for “an ideology of interdependent bodies enjoying a symbiotic relationship with technology.” When one views Ruiz’s work as a Latino dismodern, the “frailty of characters’ bodies is a direct reflection of the frailty of the nation.” ...|$|E

[...] "We talked about {{the world we live in}} and the issues that face our culture.

2500|$|Togas were {{relatively}} uniform in pattern and style but varied {{significantly in the}} quality and quantity of their fabric, and the marks of higher rank or office. The highest status toga, the solidly purple, gold-embroidered toga picta could be worn only at particular ceremonies by the highest ranking magistrates. Tyrian purple [...] was supposedly reserved for the toga picta, the border of the toga praetexta, and elements of the priestly dress worn by the inviolate Vestal Virgins. It was colour-fast, extremely expensive and the [...] "most talked-about colour in Greco-Roman antiquity". Romans categorised it as a blood-red hue, which sanctified its wearer. The purple-bordered praetexta worn by freeborn youths acknowledged their vulnerability and sanctity under law. Once a boy came of age (usually at puberty) he adopted the plain white toga virilis; this meant that he was free to set up his own household, marry, and vote. Young girls who wore the praetexta on formal occasions put it aside at menarche or marriage, and adopted the stola Even <b>the</b> <b>whiteness</b> of the toga virilis was subject to class distinction.

2500|$|The {{first known}} {{specimens}} of B.victoriae {{may have been}} seeds sent to England in the early 1830s. These seeds were distributed {{to a number of}} gardens, and by 1835 three gardens had successfully raised plants to flowering: the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the garden of George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland, and that of Henry Berens of Sidcup. In that year, the second of these was painted by Sarah Drake, and included as Plate 1728 in Edwards's Botanical Register. In the accompanying text, John Lindley identified the plant as B.speciosa (Showy Banksia), but commented [...] "We found neither <b>the</b> <b>whiteness</b> of the under side of the leaves, nor the faintness of the veins, which are supposed to be characteristic of the species". Doubts were raised about the identity of the species in 1857, when Walter Hood Fitch painted B.victoriae based on a cut flower provided by David Moore of Glasnevin Botanical Garden. Fitch's painting appeared as Plate 4906 in Volume 82 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine, and was accompanied by the text: [...] "There can, I think, be no doubt of its being the same with the B.speciosa above quoted in the Bot. Reg., but not the B.speciosa of Br. and Hook., Bot. Mag. t. 3052; and equally certain does it appear to be the B.Victoriæ of Meisner." [...] Thus it was implied that 1835 plate was in fact B.victoriae, a suggestion that was supported by George Bentham in his treatment of the species in his 1870 Flora Australiensis.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{article is}} a {{theoretical}} discussion that links Marcuse’s concept of one-dimensional society and the Great Refusal with critical race theory {{in order to achieve}} a more robust interrogation of <b>whiteness.</b> <b>The</b> author argues that {{in the context of the}} United States, the one-dimensionality that Marcuse condemns in One-Dimensional Man is best illuminated by <b>the</b> concept of <b>whiteness,</b> which posits that <b>whiteness</b> in <b>the</b> context of white supremacy is an ideological manifestation of capitalism in the United States. The author furthers that the values Marcuse wants to break with or refuse in An Essay on Liberation can be more concretely captured if it is made clear that <b>the</b> ideology of <b>whiteness</b> represents a key part of the normative order of advanced industrial society that must be ‘Refused’. <b>The</b> reproduction of <b>whiteness</b> in educational structures serves to oppress raced, gendered, and classed individuals and communities who deviate from the norms established by <b>the</b> ideology of <b>whiteness.</b> Thus, in <b>the</b> context of education, the author proposes that the crucial theoretical tools we have to challenge one-dimensional education and refuse whiteness are critical race theory and critical multicultural education...|$|R
