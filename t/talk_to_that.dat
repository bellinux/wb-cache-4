25|$|The Walking Dead is {{a graphic}} adventure, played from a third-person {{perspective}} {{with a variety}} of cinematic camera angles, in which the player, as protagonist Lee Everett, works with a rag-tag group of survivors to stay alive {{in the midst of a}} zombie apocalypse. The player can examine and interact with characters and items, and must make use of inventory items and the environment. Throughout the game, the player is presented with the ability to interact with their surroundings, and options to determine the nature of that interaction. For example, the player may be able to look at a character, <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> character, or if they are carrying an item, offer it to the character or ask them about it. According to Robert Kirkman, The Walking Dead game is focused more on developing characters and story, and less on the action tropes that tend to feature in other zombie-based games, such as Left 4 Dead.|$|E
2500|$|The real FBI {{operatives}} {{were concerned}} that DIA's harsh methods and impersonation of FBI agents would complicate the Bureau's ability {{to do its job}} properly, saying [...] "The next time a real Agent tries to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> guy, you can imagine the result." [...] A subsequent military inquiry countered FBI's allegations by saying that the prisoner treatment was degrading but not inhuman, without addressing the allegation of DIA staff regularly impersonating FBI officers—usually a felony offense.|$|E

6000|$|... 'When {{you were}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> miller. A man was looking from the laurel- tree as jealously {{as if he}} could have eaten you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's true," [...] the Boy went on, [...] "but the Adjustment Committee gave our {{helpless}} victims a <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{was worth}} another hundred to hear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Then, please, go {{and speak}} to him at once!’ she pleaded. He is there—do you see?—at {{the upper end of}} the room, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> girl in pink.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is the way}} to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> young person--clearly," [...] said Peter to himself, {{listening}} to Tommy's footsteps dying down the stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I couldn't induce him," [...] said Mrs. Miller very gently. [...] "He {{wants to}} talk to the waiter. He likes to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> waiter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd like to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man," [...] said Chet, and {{watching}} his chance, {{he called to}} the individual. The fellow called back, and when his work was ended, {{walked over to the}} boys.|$|E
60|$|MRS. MARCHMONT. I {{am afraid}} Lord Goring {{is in the}} camp of the enemy, as usual. I saw him <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> Mrs. Cheveley when he came in.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{disappeared}} while I was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> good Miss Penwell! You must {{be pleased}} now, Alick, you see {{she is really}} going to see about going to Scotland." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what did}} you want at Brennan's, Myles?" [...] said she, playfully shaking his {{shoulder}} with her hand; [...] "it's <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> pretty girl in the shop you're after." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{walking for}} several hours he met a fox, who seemed {{inclined}} to be friendly, and the boy was so glad to have anyone to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{he sat down and}} entered into conversation.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. You must {{remember}} I {{was in a}} hurry to catch the train. Hang the luck! I wish I hadn't stopped to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man," [...] went on the fat salesman.|$|E
6000|$|The {{old lady}} {{began to cry}} softly. [...] "It's a {{judgment}} on me," [...] she says. [...] "I used to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> dog {{as if it had}} been a Christian, and now this thing has happened as a punishment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, please, go {{and speak}} to him at once!" [...] she pleaded. [...] "He is there--do you see?--at {{the upper end of}} the room, <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> girl in pink." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I suppose," [...] {{his mother}} went on, [...] "after {{spending}} {{half the night}} wading about in the salt water, you spent the other half <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> terrible Mr. Furley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} myself," [...] put in Sam. [...] "Don't you {{remember}} how he was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> barker, just {{as if they were}} friends? It was surely Sobber who played that trick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll go and <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Lord, and I'll {{come and}} see you again after we get into town," [...] said the little miss, as she hurried away to tell the candy vender {{what she thought of}} him.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you're {{the worst}} I ever heard, Anne," [...] protested Gilbert, who, {{not being a}} mother but only a father, was not wholly {{convinced}} yet that Sir Oracle was wrong. [...] "I never heard anything {{like the way you}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall amuse myself," [...] was the prompt reply. [...] "First of all, I {{am going}} to {{undertake}} a little mission on Reginald's account. I am going over to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> ridiculous old man Vont. Afterwards, I shall walk across to Broomleys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{much fun}} in <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> horsey fellow. I'm sorry for him, but I can't do {{anything}} to amuse him," [...] objected Thorny, pulling himself up from the sofa with a great yawn.|$|R
60|$|Bridge {{and the boy}} {{realized}} that she was not <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> them--that for the moment she had lost sight of their presence--she was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> father whose heart would be breaking with the breaking of the new day, trying <b>to</b> convince him <b>that</b> his little girl had done no wrong.|$|R
5000|$|I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him <b>that</b> week, but I didn’t TALK-TO-HIM-talk-to-him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, Jesse," [...] {{father said}} to me, tearing a strip from {{the sheet and}} {{fastening}} it to an ox-goad. [...] "Take this {{and go out and}} try to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> man. Don't tell him anything about what's happened to us. Just try to get him to come in and talk with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would say}} so, of course--very natural. As {{a matter of}} fact I haven't heard very much. Strictly speaking, it was Martin. He {{collects}} information, and so on. You don't suppose I would <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> Schomberg animal more than I could help? It was Martin whom he took into his confidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Now don't {{you worry}} about that,' said Sam. 'You jes say all you've got to say to her, and hear all she's got to say, but don't sign no papers and take her aboard until you <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> other girl. Now hurry up, and walk along the beach a little further off.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Denham, you're so {{different}} from me. You never give yourself away. I watched you this evening with Katharine Hilbery. My instinct is to trust the person I'm <b>talking</b> <b>to.</b> <b>That's</b> why I'm always being taken in, I suppose." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{said nothing}} to this and I made her walk again. For some minutes she {{remained}} silent; then, rather unexpectedly, she began: 'I've seen you <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> lady who sits at our table--the one who has so many children.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain," [...] {{the young}} lady said, as she went upon deck, [...] "I have been <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> young {{carpenter}} of yours. I am quite interested in him. Is he really a carpenter? He does not talk a bit like one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> lad about bein' weak-kneed {{after you}} have shown the courage he has within the past four an' twenty hours. You an' your mutinous comrades prate loudly of bravery {{when there is no}} enemy in sight; but I'll lay odds that not one out of an hundred like you would dare go alone from here to the fort!" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was this}} {{individual}} who condescended {{to take a}} paternal interest in myself. After declaring my resolution {{with respect to the}} ship unalterable, I was proceeding to withdraw, in compliance with a sign from the consul, when the stranger turned round to him, saying, [...] "Wait a minute, if you please, Mr. Wilson; let me <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> youth. Come here, my young friend: I'm extremely sorry to see you associated with these bad men; {{do you know what it}} will end in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He broke off, and in {{a changed}} tone, [...] "I'll give you two hundred rupees now, Marlow, and you just <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> chap. Confound him! I wish he had never come out here. Fact is, I rather think some of my people know his. The old man's a parson, and I {{remember}} now I met him once when staying with my cousin in Essex last year. If I am not mistaken, the old chap seemed rather to fancy his sailor son. Horrible. I can't do it myself--but you [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{said nothing}} to this and I made her walk again. For some minutes she failed to speak; then, rather abruptly, she began: [...] "I've seen you <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> lady who sits at our table--the one who has so many children." ...|$|R

60|$|One day Sir Robert {{was going}} up the stairs with another knight, and met the two coming down. He was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> knight earnestly, indignantly: and somehow, as he passed Leofric and Martin he thought fit to raise his voice, {{as if in a}} great wrath.|$|R
