5|$|The {{run up to}} the 1968 presidential {{election}} saw the incumbent president, Lyndon B. Johnson, serving {{during a period of}} great social unrest.

5|$|When the Nationalists {{came into}} power in December 1928, Kent Hughes was {{appointed}} Cabinet Secretary and Government Whip but resigned his positions in July 1929, ostensibly in protest over a government subsidy to a freezing works company but more likely in reaction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> boneheadedness {{of his fellow}} parliamentarians.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, {{aircraft}} development became increasingly expensive, resulting in major projects often becoming mired in {{political and economic}} concerns. The development of TSR-2 saw increasing cost overruns, combined {{with the presence of}} a potentially cheaper alternative then under development in the United States, the F-111. The P.1154 was subject <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> inter-service rivalry between the Royal Navy and RAF, which led to two wildly differing specifications being submitted for the aircraft that were impossible to fulfill with a single airframe.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, Hellenic Nomarchy points <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> {{successful}} {{struggle of}} the Serbs against the Ottoman rule, which began in 1804. The author states that the Orthodox clergy was holding back the national aspirations of the Greek people, while the educated and dynamic elements of Greek society and the mercantile diaspora should return to Greece and join the movement of national liberation.|$|E
5|$|Most workers {{accepted}} {{the reduction in}} pay, but the firemen and those who ran the freight trains resolved to stop work in protest. However, the number of unemployed along the line was so great, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> economic problems, {{that the company had}} no difficulty replacing the absent strikers. In response, the strikers resolved to occupy portions of the rail line, and to stop trains from passing unless the company rescinded the wage cuts.|$|E

5|$|The Easter Rising of 1916 {{was carried}} out by the latter group {{together}} with a smaller socialist militia, the Irish Citizen Army. The British response, executing fifteen leaders of the Rising over a period of ten days and imprisoning or interning more than a thousand people, turned the mood of the country in favour of the rebels. Support for Irish republicanism increased further due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> war in Europe, as well as the Conscription Crisis of 1918.|$|E

5|$|France even {{linked the}} issue of the seat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> dispute {{regarding}} the seat of the European Parliament. Frankfurt was criticised as symbolising German dominance, although the Deutsche Bundesbank had effectively been running the Communities currencies for the previous years, while Luxembourg has a banking tradition that wasn't so careful. London was discredited because the UK remained outside the eurozone. It was also seen as important to locate the bank in a city not already hosting a national government or EU institution, in order to emphasise its independence. Others, such as {{the former head of the}} Bundesbank Karl Otto Pöhl, favoured a small country with a stable currency. The advantages of hosting the Bank were also in dispute by some economists. While there was seen by some as little to gain in terms of attracting other banks and financial institutions, others saw it as affecting which cities would be financial hubs in the years to come.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey is {{mentioned}} {{again in the}} campaigns of the early 1270s, when Palaiologos sent a new commander to the Morea, Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos. In 1270, Geoffrey and his neighbour, the Baron of Akova, joined the Prince's army with 150 horsemen and 200 infantry. The Latin force raided the Byzantine holdings in Laconia, but Philanthropenos avoided being drawn into a pitched battle. A period of relative peace followed due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> Second Council of Lyon, but in 1275, the mutual truce was broken by the Greeks. Prince William entrusted a force of 50 horse and 200 crossbowmen to Geoffrey, who stationed them to keep watch over the defiles of Skorta, but he died of dysentery in late 1275. After his death, Karytaina was increasingly subject to the attacks of the Byzantines, and finally fell to them in 1320.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{response}} to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Yatsenyuk announced his intentions to resume the bid for NATO integration on 29 August 2014, and in December 2014, Ukraine's parliament voted to drop the non-aligned status that it adopted in 2010. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has stated that NATO membership is still an option for Ukraine, and support for NATO membership has risen to 63.9 percent in government-controlled Ukraine according to a July 2015 poll. Previous polls had shown that the decline in opposition to membership was linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> Russian intervention.|$|E

5|$|In 1814, Egan (now {{bishop of}} Philadelphia) {{promoted}} de Barth {{to the position}} of Vicar General. Egan died shortly thereafter. Until a suitable bishop could be found, Carroll, now Archbishop of Baltimore, appointed de Barth as the apostolic administrator. De Barth tried to refuse this assignment, likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> disputes in Philadelphia between the clergy and the lay trustees of the city's parishes over who should control the churches, but he eventually accepted and took temporary control of the diocese. He spent little time in the city, leaving day-to-day control of the parishes there to Terrence McGill, a local priest.|$|E
5|$|In June 1951, Kennedy {{enlisted in}} the United States Army and signed up for an {{optional}} four-year term which was shortened to the minimum two years after his father intervened. Following basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey, he requested assignment to Fort Holabird in Maryland for Army Intelligence training, but was dropped without explanation after a few weeks. He went to Camp Gordon in Georgia for training in the Military Police Corps. In June 1952, Kennedy {{was assigned to the}} honor guard at SHAPE headquarters in Paris, France. His father's political connections ensured that he was not deployed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> Korean War. While stationed in Europe, he traveled extensively on weekends and climbed the Matterhorn in the Pennine Alps. He was discharged after 21 months in March 1953 as a private first class.|$|E
5|$|Nine years later, French {{explorer}} La Salle led {{an expedition}} south from the Illinois River {{to the mouth}} of the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico, claiming the entire valley for France. La Salle named the Mississippi river basin La Louisiane (Louisiana) after King Louis XIV; the region between and near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers was named the Illinois Country. As part of a series of forts in the Mississippi valley, the French built settlements at Cahokia and Kaskaskia, Illinois. French trading companies also built towns during the 1720s and 1730s, including Fort de Chartres and Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, the first European town in Missouri west of the Mississippi. From 1756 to 1760, fighting in the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War) halted settlement building. The economy remained weak through 1762 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ongoing</b> war, in which Britain defeated France the following year.|$|E
