5|$|Shortly before writing Shakugan no Shana, Takahashi {{made his}} debut {{as an author}} with A/B Extreme, which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, he set out <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love {{was not one of}} the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor.|$|E
5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were trying to capture.|$|E
5|$|Setting out <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> on an epic scale, Martin {{projected}} to write three books of 800 manuscript {{pages in the}} very early stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to immerse himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E

25|$|Software {{developer}} Michael Abrash {{was inspired}} by Snow Crash's Metaverse and its networked 3D world. He left Microsoft for Id Software <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> in that direction, the result being Quake. The story for the 3DO game Immercenary was also heavily influenced by Snow Crash.|$|E
25|$|Going back {{to those}} studio days for me and John Paul Jones, {{the one thing you}} didn't do was speed up, because if you sped up you wouldn't be seen again. Everything had to be right on the meter all the way through. And I really wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> which did speed up, and took the emotion and the {{adrenaline}} with it, and would reach a sort of crescendo. And that was the idea of it. That's why it was a bit tricky to get together in stages.|$|E

5000|$|His last {{project as}} a {{director}} was in the film Der Millionenraub im Rivieraexpreß (1927). From then on, he devoted himself <b>to</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>something</b> he had dabbled in since 1892. By {{the time of his}} death in 1935 he had written several novels and short stories, and many newspaper articles. Besides detective stories and non-fiction work about his experiences with animals, he also wrote adventure and crime novels. With [...] "Der Ritt auf dem Funken" [...] (1928) he published a futuristic science fiction novel about the possibility of travelling with vehicles on electric currents in the near future.|$|R

25|$|Goldman {{returned}} to novels, writing The Thing of It Is... (1967). He went {{to teach at}} Princeton, and wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> but could {{not come up with}} an idea for a novel. So he decided to write his first original screenplay, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, which he had been researching for eight years. He sold it for $400,000, then the highest price ever paid for an original screenplay. The resulting movie was a massive critical and commercial success and earned Goldman an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.|$|E
500|$|Opeth {{returned}} to Sweden after touring {{in support of}} Blackwater Park, and began writing for the next album. At first, Åkerfeldt had trouble putting together new material: [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> heavier than we'd ever done, still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn't {{want to go to}} waste." [...] Jonas Renkse of Katatonia, a long-time friend of Åkerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums—one heavy and one soft.|$|E

He was provided a tape of orchestration written by the composer of the film score, Michael Kamen. With this, he and Lange used a section of Michael's orchestration and created [...] "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You", which was then placed deep into the closing credits of the film when it opened on June 14, 1991.|$|E

5000|$|After {{starting}} his writing career by writing for true-confession style pulp magazines such as True Story, writer A. E. van Vogt decided <b>to</b> switch <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> <b>something</b> he enjoyed, science fiction (SF). He {{was inspired by}} the August 1938 issue of Astounding Science Fiction, which he picked up at a newsstand. The story [...] "Who Goes There?" [...] led him <b>to</b> <b>write</b> [...] "Vault of the Beast", which he submitted to that same magazine. [...] "I read half of it standing there at the news-stand before I bought the issue and finished it. That brought me back into the fold with a vengeance. I still regard that as the best story Campbell ever wrote, and the best horror tale in science fiction." ...|$|R
500|$|Writers Glen Morgan and James Wong {{developed}} the episode specially for Kristen Cloke, both for her experience as {{the protagonist of}} their series , to translate Morgan's feelings as his friendship with Cloke became an emotional relationship, and for showcasing her acting. Morgan stated, [...] "I knew she {{did a lot of}} characters and voices, so I wanted to incorporate that ... I wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> for her that challenged her". Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew. Morgan also stated that he [...] "wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> for David Duchovny that challenged him." [...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter." [...] Michael Massee wanted his characterization of Ephesian to be [...] "normal looking" [...] and [...] "nondemonic", explaining, [...] "You have to believe that he believes his own rap. When he speaks, he's just explaining that 'this is the way it is' – and that's when it gets very scary." [...] The name [...] "Vernon" [...] comes from cult leader David Koresh's real name, and [...] "Ephesian" [...] is taken from one of the books of the Bible.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} co-designed and {{illustrated}} by Mark Crowe, creator of the Space Quest series, and co-programmed by Ken Williams. An accomplished jazz musician (The Lounge Lizards being a jazz band's name), Lowe also wrote the main theme music (called [...] "For Your Thighs Only"), {{and some of his}} compositions appear in later entries of the series. The theme, inspired by Irving Berlin's 1929 song [...] "Alexander's Ragtime Band", was composed within 20 minutes. Lowe said it [...] "sounded so unusual, so different, so fresh compared to most computer game music, that I decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> with the same pep, simplicity, humor, and out-of-sync attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Although The Viceroy of Ouidah {{received}} good reviews, it did {{not sell}} well. Nicholas Shakespeare said that the dismal sales caused Chatwin to pursue a completely different subject for his next book. In response to his growing reputation as a travel writer Chatwin said he [...] "decided <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> about people who never went out." [...] His next book, On the Black Hill (1982), is a novel of twin brothers who live all {{of their lives in}} a farmhouse on the Welsh borders. For this book Chatwin won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and the Whitbread Prize for Best First Novel, even though he considered his previous book, The Viceroy of Ouidah, a novel. It was made into a film in 1987.|$|E

500|$|Stephenson {{incorporates}} 17th century sentence {{structure and}} orthography throughout Quicksilver, most apparent in {{his use of}} italicization and capitalization. He adapts a combination of period and anachronistic language throughout the books, mostly to good effect, while allowing diction from modern usage, such as [...] "canal rage" [...] an allusion to road rage. Stephenson chose not to adapt period language for the entire text; instead he allowed such language to enter his writing when it was appropriate, often turning to modern English and modern labels for ideas familiar to modern readers. Stephenson said [...] "I never tried to entertain the illusion that I was going <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> that had {{no trace of the}} 20th or the 21st century in it." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN's regular Fringe {{reviewer}} Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode 8/10. He compared the plot to Lost, remarking [...] "Apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted TV series wasn't enough... But hey, I understand why J.J. and his Fringe collaborators... {{might have done}} this. They had kind of written themselves into a corner {{where one of the}} universes had to go, and they couldn't stretch that storyline out forever. A restart like this {{is a good way to}} allow themselves room <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> new, even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately." [...] Isler had trouble rating the finale, noting that he had to see how the events are explained in the fourth season before he can make a complete judgment.|$|E
500|$|Carl Sagan {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} Contact in 1979. The same year, Lynda Obst, one of Sagan's closest friends, was hired by film producer Peter Guber to be a studio executive for his production company, Casablanca FilmWorks. She pitched Guber the idea for Contact, who commissioned a development deal. Sagan and Ann Druyan (who later became his wife) wrote a 100+ page film treatment, finishing in November 1980. Druyan explained, [...] "Carl's and my dream was <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> {{that would be a}} fictional representation of what contact would actually be like, that would convey something of the true grandeur of the universe." [...] They added the science and religion analogies as a metaphor of philosophical and intellectual interest in searching for the truth of both humanity and alien contact.|$|E

500|$|The songwriting session—held at Absolute's studio {{located on}} Tagg's Island near Chertsey—did {{not seem to}} go well at the beginning, as the duo was heavily into R music at the time, while the group {{according}} to Wilson was [...] "always very poptastic". After two sessions the duo phoned their managers {{and told them that}} the musical association between them and the group was not working. At this point, the duo heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time, Wilson remembers: [...] "We listen to it, and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought, 'How's this gonna work? We're not the right people to be doing this band.'" [...] For the next session the group wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> uptempo and a bit more fun. A full-on disco backing track came up, and [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] evolved from there. Wilson commented about that session: ...|$|E
500|$|This {{changed in}} 1989 when ABC comedy {{producer}} Ted Robinson {{invited them to}} appear on a new comedy show, The Big Gig. They became a popular feature on the series and appeared in every episode until 1991. [...] In 1989 the group also released a book entitled Book, which was a collection of dark short stories. [...] Many of the stories had been written several years prior, even before the three had started performing together, and adopted a markedly different tone to their comedic, largely ad libbed live shows. [...] Ferguson {{said that they had}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> that people could read and enjoy without having seen DAAS perform. [...] Book sold 30,000 copies in England within {{the first two weeks of}} publication before being banned when DAAS refused to release an edited version of the book or permit a warning sticker on the cover. [...] The issue was taken to court in the same year, where the ban was overturned.|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats". She explained that the album was completed in three weeks, which is the reason most of the record, including [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] sounds aggressive. She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had that tough vibe, like the guy had cheated, and I wanted <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and you end up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, and the thought of having to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E
