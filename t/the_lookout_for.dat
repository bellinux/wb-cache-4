5|$|Hartebeest {{are remarkably}} alert and {{cautious}} animals with highly developed brains. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual stays on <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> danger, often {{standing on a}} termite mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, leopards, hyenas and wild dogs; cheetahs and jackals target juveniles. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.|$|E

Mansell ordered an attack and off Dungeness; Moon, Samson and the Answer charged at the galleys. Spinola seeing this decided to swing his galleys round {{to face the}} South East, {{the direction of the}} Flanders coast but in so doing the lead ship San Felipe (St. Philip) ran straight into the Victory and Hope forcing the galleys inadvertently further East.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, 2007 at {{approximately}} 10 AM, Howard and Maureen Cotterman drove from Mexico to the Lukeville Port of Entry (POE). Upon arrival, the inspector checked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection electronic database {{and found a}} computer-generated alert, based upon Howard Cotterman's prior conviction for child sex crimes in 1992. The alert advised the inspector to be on <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> child pornography and due to the warning, the Cottermans were sent to a secondary inspection area.|$|E

5|$|Stone {{had fallen}} ill with {{appendicitis}} {{during the previous}} leg of the voyage; he was hospitalised in Dakar and took no further part in the adventure. Orsborne was able to obtain further fuel and water, but Girl Pats arrival {{attracted the attention of}} the local Lloyd's agent, who had been on <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> the vessel. On 26 May he saw Orsborne and inspected the log book, where he discovered the false names and other inconsistencies. Orsborne was asked to present the ship's papers at the British consulate but, on the pretext that he needed to test the engines, he rapidly put to sea. The appearance of Girl Pat in Dakar—the first confirmation since Corcubión that the vessel was still afloat—was widely reported. Relatives of the crew members were relieved that those aboard were safe but were apprehensive about what might lie ahead.|$|E
5|$|Charles met Frederick Kemp, a {{land agent}} newly arrived in Poulton {{from his native}} Essex, and {{introduced}} him to his brother, who was on <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> a steward or agent. Kemp, well-dressed and charming, made a good impression on Hesketh, who employed him immediately. At {{the meeting of the}} railway committee Hesketh put forward a persuasive argument. Despite opposition from the Lytham contingent the committee decided that Rossall Point was the best place for the railway terminus to be built, and the Railway and Port Company was formed. In the early 19th century it was thought that steam locomotives would be unable to negotiate hilly terrain, and that Lake District hills like Shap Fell would prevent the railway from reaching Scotland. The Fylde terminus would have even more importance than Hesketh had hoped, providing a sea link for passengers from London to travel on to Scotland. Initially Hesketh had considered naming his new town New Liverpool or Wyreton, but after changing his name to Hesketh-Fleetwood in 1831 he decided to call it Fleetwood. With a new career in parliament to prepare for, he readily handed over financial management of the project to his manager, Frederick Kemp.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals on <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case}} of stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign they are aware of its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E
50|$|In Brittany, the {{dovecote}} {{was sometimes}} built {{directly into the}} upper walls of the farmhouse or manor-house. In rare cases, it was built into the upper gallery of <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> tower (<b>for</b> example at the Toul-an-Gollet manor in Plesidy, Brittany). Dovecotes of this type are called tour-fuie in French.|$|R
60|$|The {{squad of}} men to which Dorn belonged {{had to be on}} <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> {{continually}} <b>for</b> an attack that was inevitable.

5000|$|Engel {{later became}} {{best known as}} one of the most {{eccentric}} promoters in baseball history. In late 1929, Griffith sent Engel to Chattanooga, Tennessee, to take over operations of Griffith's newly acquired farm team, <b>the</b> Chattanooga <b>Lookouts.</b> Engel immediately constructed one of the minor leagues' finest stadiums and named it Engel Stadium for himself. He remained with <b>the</b> <b>Lookouts</b> <b>for</b> 34 years. One year, Engel had his players parade into the ball park on elephants for Opening Day. He traded a shortstop for a turkey, roasted it and served it to local sportswriters who had been [...] "giving him the bird." [...] He raffled off houses and automobiles, and had canaries singing in the grandstands. When the New York Yankees went to Chattanooga to play a pre-season exhibition game with his Lookouts, Engel located a female 17-year-old left-handed pitcher, Jackie Mitchell, who struck out both Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>lookout</b> {{and target}} {{designation}} facilities {{were similar in}} principle to Dunkerques. <b>The</b> lower <b>lookout</b> station <b>for</b> close-range contacts was on platform 3 of the fore tower.

50|$|Baibars al-Bunduqdari's {{constructive}} piety set {{a precedent}} for others. Over the late medieval period, hostels for travellers were built on adjacent to the shrine, and the hospice {{in its present form}} was completed in the decade between 1470 and 1480. Gradually, <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> point <b>for</b> Moses' distant gravesite beyond the Jordan was confused with Moses' tomb itself, laying the ground for the cultic importance Nabi Musa was to acquire in the Sunni Arab reverence of saints (walis).|$|R
50|$|The Penyal d'Ifac (in Spanish Peñón de Ifach) was <b>the</b> natural <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{inhabitants}} {{that lived}} in the surrounding areas. Another <b>lookout</b> was <b>the</b> Morro de Toix Mountain, from which the Mascarat Ravine, an essential passage along the coast, could be controlled. The area gained in importance during the Romanization of the Iberian Peninsula. The township's proximity to the sea favoured marine trade and fish factories. Evidence is at the historical site Els Banys de la Reina (the Queen's Baths).|$|R

In particular, they spent two hours shooting Sam lifting Frodo on to his back with cross-camera coverage.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{testimony}} {{indicated that}} Detective Scott inquired of a railroad engineer named Rush, where {{would be the}} worst place for a train wreck. Rush pointed out the high bridge where, if a rail was pulled, the train would crash three or four hundred feet down an embankment, killing or injuring all on the train. Scott told Rush to be on <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> <b>for</b> damaged track that night at that spot. Later that evening Rush stopped his train, walked ahead on the track and discovered that spikes had been pulled.|$|E
