5|$|The {{cultural}} {{impact of}} extraterrestrial contact is the corpus of changes to terrestrial science, technology, religion, politics, and ecosystems resulting from {{contact with an}} extraterrestrial civilization. It is closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), which attempts to locate intelligent life as opposed to analyzing the implications of contact with that life.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> {{the remains}} of the ship herself, there was considerable Australian interest in locating relics of the ship's south Pacific voyage. In 1886, the Working Men's Progress Association of Cooktown sought to recover the sixcannons thrown overboard when Endeavour grounded on the Great Barrier Reef. A £300 reward was offered for anyone who could locate and recover the guns, but searches that year and the next were fruitless and the money went unclaimed. Remains of equipment left at Endeavour River were discovered in around 1900, and in 1913 the crew of a merchant steamer erroneously claimed to have recovered an Endeavour cannon from shallow water near the Reef.|$|E
5|$|The Search for Spock {{opened on}} June 1, 1984. In its {{first week of}} release, the film grossed over $16 million from almost 2,000 theaters across North America. It went on to gross $76 million at the {{domestic}} box office, {{with a total of}} $87 million worldwide. Critical reaction <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Search</b> <b>for</b> Spock was positive, but notably less so than the previous film. Reviewers generally praised the cast and characters, while criticism tended to focus on the plot; the special effects were conflictingly received. Roger Ebert called the film a compromise between the tones of the first and second Star Trek films. The Search for Spock has since been released on multiple home video formats, including VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray high definition discs. Nimoy went on to direct The Search for Spocks sequel, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home.|$|E

5|$|Varis zos Galvus is crowned Garlean {{emperor and}} begins {{consolidating}} power, lending new urgency <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> Ivy. The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured {{at the gates}} of a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and cleaving them with a blast of pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven children, has rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as a test of the player's worth. The Ascian Nabriales takes advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate the Scions' headquarters in pursuit of Louisoix's staff. Moenbryda sacrifices herself to create the blade of light necessary to completely destroy the Ascian.|$|E

25|$|A few meteorites {{were found}} in Antarctica between 1912 and 1964. In 1969, the 10th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition found nine meteorites on a blue ice field near the Yamato Mountains. With this discovery, came the {{realization}} that movement of ice sheets might act to concentrate meteorites in certain areas. After a dozen other specimens {{were found in}} the same place in 1973, a Japanese expedition was launched in 1974 dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> meteorites.

25|$|In 2015, a new {{paradigm}} for multi-objective optimization based on novelty was presented using evolutionary algorithms. This {{new paradigm}} searches for novel solutions in objective space (i.e., novelty search on objective space) in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> non-dominated solutions. Novelty search is like stepping stones guiding the search to previously unexplored places. It is specially useful in overcoming bias and plateaus as well as guiding the search in many-objective optimization problems. Subpopulation Algorithm based on Novelty is the first algorithm based on this paradigm.|$|E
25|$|When it {{was first}} {{proposed}} in 1956, in The Prehistory of Eastern Europe, Part 1, Marija Gimbutas's contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> Indo-European origins was an interdisciplinary synthesis of archaeology and linguistics. The Kurgan model of Indo-European origins identifies the Pontic-Caspian steppe as the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) urheimat, {{and a variety of}} late PIE dialects are assumed to have been spoken across the region. According to this model, the Kurgan culture gradually expanded until it encompassed the entire Pontic-Caspian steppe, Kurgan IV being identified with the Yamna culture of around 3000 BC.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Marvell’s seventeenth-century poem The Garden is a lyric of nine stanzas {{in which}} he rejects all forms of {{activity}} {{in the world in}} favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirement—an ancient Roman concept related to otium. The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics see that he shows otium to mean peace, quiet and leisure—a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized otium with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> the lost heaven on earth.|$|E

25|$|In Sri Lanka Theravadins {{were looking}} at Western culture to find means to revitalize their own tradition. Christian missionaries were {{threatening}} the indigenous culture. As a reaction to this, Theravadins started to propagate Theravāda Buddhism. They were aided by the Theosophical Society, who were dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> wisdom within ancient sources, including Buddhism and the Pāli Canon. Anagarika Dharmapala {{was one of the}} Theravāda leaders with whom the Theosophists sided. Dharmapala tried to reinstate vipassanā, using the Visuddhimagga and the Pali Canon as a foundation. Dharmapala reached out to the middle classes, offering them religious practice and a religious identity, which were used to withstand the British imperialists. As a result of Dharmapapla's efforts lay practitioners started to practise meditation, which had been reserved specifically for the monks.|$|E
25|$|Although {{macroscopic}} {{concepts are}} essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics has been devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view {{that this is the}} goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may be overly optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.|$|E

In September 2011, the original Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo organization became embroiled in a major corruption scandal over alleged money laundering and fraud with government housing funds granted. On 26 January 2012, former Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde criticized Hebe de Bonafini for openly supporting the Basque separatist group ETA and the Colombian left-wing FARC guerrilla movement.|$|E

25|$|Lin also seriously {{attempted}} {{to withdraw from}} the nomination, but was not able to do so because Mao had made Lin's appointment a decision of the Central Committee, so rejecting the position would violate Party procedure and would risk ending Lin's political career. Lin was not present at the conference where it was decided to name him vice chairman. After Lin was named, he met with Mao and begged him personally not to name him to the position, but Mao criticized him, comparing Lin to the Ming emperor Shizong, who devoted so much of his time <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> longevity medicines that he neglected his government responsibilities. In 1966 all other candidates for the position were removed, and Lin accepted the position as sole Vice-Chairman, replacing Liu Shaoqi as Mao's unofficial successor. After his appointment, Lin again {{attempted to}} submit a formal written request to Mao, asking Mao to rescind Lin's appointment to the position of vice-chairman, but Mao again rejected this request. When Lin received the rejection letter, he was so angry that he tore the letter up and threw it in the garbage.|$|E
500|$|After Australian {{federation}} in 1901, the {{upsurge in}} nationalism led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> an official national floral emblem.
