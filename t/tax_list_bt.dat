Comparison is provided with other Hearth <b>Tax</b> <b>lists</b> and with contemporary records such as the poll tax returns, and also from later records such as early census information. The Hearth Tax is also compared with different Wigtownshire records from earlier and later periods (Wigtownshire Charters, parish records and the statistical accounts). The significance of the high proportion and distribution of recognisably Gaelic surnames apparent in the Wigtownshire hearth taxlists is also highlighted. The edition also includes an index of surnames, place-names, tabular information and illustrations...|$|R
