He also translated many foreign authors, notably Heinrich Heine, Heinrich Dernburg, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton's The Last Days of Pompeii, and Hungarian poet József Kiss's later poetry and verse novel which dealt mainly with urban topics but were noteworthy for its Jewish subject matter, like Jehovah (1887), a love ballad.|$|E

Likewise, he and a companion, Al Janssen, visited Hamas and PLO leaders including Ahmed Yassin and Yasser Arafat, handing out Bibles. Further on, there is a portrait of a project called Musalaha, which was founded by the Palestinian Evangelical leader Salim Munayer.

The Conférence Permanente held its first assembly in Strasbourg on 28 February 1958. Initial members were national association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and Netherlands.

5000|$|The {{first step}} of {{analysis}} is to filter the raw data to remove very high frequency data (called [...] "micro-roughness") since it can often be attributed to vibrations or debris on the surface. Filtering out the micro-roughness at a given cut-off threshold also allows <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>closer</b> the roughness assessment made using profilometers having different stylus ball radius e.g. 2 µm and 5 µm radii. Next, the data is separated into roughness, waviness and form. This can be accomplished using reference lines, envelope methods, digital filters, fractals or other techniques. Finally, the data is summarized using one or more roughness parameters, or a graph. In the past, surface finish was usually analyzed by hand. The roughness trace would be plotted on graph paper, and an experienced machinist decided what data to ignore and where to place the mean line. Today, the measured data is stored on a computer, and analyzed using methods from signal analysis and statistics.|$|E

The project was under the direction of José Antonio García Rodríguez, president of the top-tier Primera Division at the time. He envisioned the new division to be joined by the best teams of the Segunda and include teams from the United States (Los Angeles Salsa and San Jose Black Hawks expressed desire to join). Upon review, FIFA did not authorize such integration. As a result, the new league was created instead with the best Second Division teams. The 1994-1995 season began with 15 teams: Acapulco, Atlético Celaya, Atlético San Francisco, Atlético Yucatán, Caimanes de Tabasco, Coras, Gallos de Aguascalientes, Halcones de Querétaro, Inter Tijuana, Irapuato, La Piedad, Marte, Pachuca, San Luis and Zacatepec. Cobras de Ciudad Juárez, which would have been the sixteenth team, declined to participate due to financial problems.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his first}} ministerial role, as Scottish Office Minister for Education and Industry, he had {{responsibility}} for the Highlands and Islands which allowed him to deliver {{on some of the}} issues that he had campaigned for over a long period. He established the Community Land Unit and the Fund on which community buy-outs of crofting estates was based. He was Scotland's first designated Minister for Gaelic, initiating the process that led to the establishment of a Gaelic television channel. Along with the Irish President, Mary Robinson, he launched Iomairt Cholm Cille in an effort <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>closer</b> together the Gaelic-speaking communities of Scotland and Ireland. As Scottish Education Minister, he took a particular interest in Special Educational Needs and established the Beattie Committee to bring forward proposals, many of which were subsequently introduced, to improve post-school provision and strengthen SEN links with Further Education colleges. As Energy Minister, he was a strong supporter of both renewable energy—which he had long championed as a journalist—and nuclear power, not least because of his familiarity with Hunterston nuclear power stations in his own constituency. According to one's point of view, he is either credited or blamed for doing more than any other politician to [...] "keep the nuclear option open" [...] through the early years of the Labour government, when many of his colleagues were determined to kill it off once and for all in Britain. As Energy Minister, Wilson always advocated what he termed a [...] "balanced" [...] power generation policy—including nuclear, coal pollution mitigation, natural gas and renewables—which eventually became the catch-phrase of government after his departure. Speaking at the Institute of Civil Engineers in June 2008, he joked that if he had remained in politics, he would have been [...] "knocked down in the rush" [...] as his former foes on the nuclear issue—including the likes of Gordon Brown and Margaret Beckett—adopted the same position.|$|E
