5|$|After the {{valuable}} coins were issued, Lépes demanded the tithe {{for the previous}} years in one sum. Historians estimate that the peasant families were required to pay six to nine gold florins, although {{the value of an}} average peasant lot was only about 40 florins. Most peasants were unable to pay <b>this</b> <b>amount,</b> especially because they also had to pay the seigneurial taxes to the owners of their parcels.|$|E

When asked to approve <b>this</b> <b>amount,</b> Goebbels did so citing the importance of the film and the need for a high-caliber cast to ensure its success.|$|E
