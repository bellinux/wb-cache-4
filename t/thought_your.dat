500|$|Post editor Ben Hibbs said of Speech and Worship, [...] "To me {{they are}} great human {{documents}} {{in the form of}} paint and canvas. A great picture, I think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The Four Freedoms did— and do." [...] Walt Disney wrote, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>your</b> Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it." [...] Rockwell believed that Freedom of Worship and Freedom of Speech were his better results in the series. Laura Claridge has written that the inspirational phrase [...] "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience" [...] is a [...] "platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the Thirteen Articles of Faith by Joseph Smith." [...] In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published. The expression [...] "according to the dictates of his conscience" [...] (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.|$|E

In 1967 alone, the year I {{supposedly}} made that comment, we recorded Wild Honey, an R album that was entirely different from anything we'd ever done, and I cowrote ten songs and sang three leads." [...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great. He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I <b>thought</b> <b>your</b> lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except who the fuck knows what you're talking about!' That's exactly how I talk to him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand I {{have a sense of humor}} that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, so I get labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E
