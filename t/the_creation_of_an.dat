Jason Lee chaired the first meeting organised {{to discuss the matter}} on the 17th. He proposed <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> authority over the pioneers centered on a governor.

Homer announced <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> advisory panel headed by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

5|$|Britain's {{fears of}} war with Germany were {{realised}} in 1914 with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa. In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and Samoa respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement. This agreement was not divulged to the Sharif of Mecca, who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> independent Arab state.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the uproar}} over the poll tax {{as a factor}} in jury selection, the tax {{remained}} in Virginia until the ratification of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution outlawed it in 1964. Pauli Murray was deeply affected by her experience working on the case and was inspired to pursue her career in civil rights law. Governor Darden, influenced by the popular sentiment that the case had evoked, began a reform of the Virginia penal system, including <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official Pardon and Parole Board with the authority to commute sentences.|$|E
5|$|During this period, {{education}} and charity was {{a focus of}} the diocese.

Albanians opposed the nationalist character of the movement and led local uprisings in 1910 and 1912. During the latter they managed to seize most of Kosovo and took Skopje on 11 August.

5|$|Heat {{generated}} from the Farallon Plate subducting below the North American Plate led to <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> island arc of volcanoes {{on the west coast}} of proto-North America between the late Devonian and Permian periods.

5|$|Imagining <b>the</b> <b>creation</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artistic {{community}} at Upton, Morris helped develop {{plans for a}} second house to be constructed adjacent to Red House in which Burne-Jones could live with his family; the plans were abandoned when Burne-Jones' son Philip died from scarlet fever. By 1864, Morris had become increasingly tired of life at Red House, being particularly unhappy with the 3 to 4 hours spent commuting to his London workplace on a daily basis. He sold Red House, and in autumn 1865 moved {{with his family to}} No. 26 Queen Square in Bloomsbury, the same building to which the Firm had moved its base of operations earlier in the summer.|$|E
