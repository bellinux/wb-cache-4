5|$|Raymond Harvey played 40 matches for Victoria. He was an attacking {{and talented}} batsman, {{but failed to}} reach {{international}} standards and only managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a regular position in the Victorian team in two seasons in the 1950s. This failure to match the standards set by his Test-capped brothers was often attributed {{to a lack of}} single-mindedness and hunger.|$|E
5|$|The Nice were {{primarily}} a live band. Their stage performances were bold and violent, with Emerson incorporating feedback and distortion. He manhandled his Hammond L-100 organ, wrestling it and attacking it with daggers (which he used <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> keys and sustain notes during these escapades). Emerson's playing {{was inspired by}} Jimi Hendrix, Billy Ritchie of Clouds, and Don Shinn as well as earlier figures such as pianist Jerry Lee Lewis.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the end of}} Melissenos's revolt, it left a {{profound}} legacy: although Melissenos himself submitted to Alexios Komnenos, the towns he had occupied and garrisoned with Turkish soldiers in Ionia, Phrygia, Galatia, and Bithynia remained in their hands. Thus, by becoming involved in the Byzantine civil wars as mercenaries and allies – especially through their use by Botaneiates and Melissenos during their respective revolts <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> various cities for them – the Turks completed their relatively peaceful take-over of central and western Asia Minor.|$|E

5|$|Raymond Harvey (born 3 January 1926) is {{a former}} Australian {{first-class}} cricketer who played for Victoria in the 1940s and 1950s. He was the brother of Australian Test batsmen Merv and Neil and first-class cricketer and umpire Mick Harvey. Ray Harvey was an attacking and talented batsman but failed to reach international standards and only managed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a regular position in the Victorian team in two seasons in the 1950s. This failure to match the standards set by his Test-capped brothers was often attributed {{to a lack of}} single-mindedness and hunger.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1926–27 season, the {{departure}} of club captain Jimmy Blair saw Keenor appointed the new captain of the Bluebirds and he led the team to a second FA Cup final in 1927. However Keenor came close to never playing in the match as, having been struggling <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a first team place due to injury, he handed in a transfer request in January 1927 but a proposed move to Severnside rivals Bristol Rovers later collapsed. Instead, he returned to the starting eleven that beat Arsenal 1–0 with a goal from Hughie Ferguson, being praised for his leadership of the team's defence during the match and earning plaudits from opposing captain Charlie Buchan. By winning the trophy, Cardiff had become the first team outside England to win the FA Cup and Keenor, as captain, was handed the trophy by King George V.|$|E
5|$|Brandon, however, {{remained}} at Bradford for the 2009–10 season and he scored his first goal {{for his hometown}} club with a late goal in a 2–0 victory against his former side Torquay United in late August. The following month, his second goal for the club again came against one of Brandon's former teams, as he once again came off the substitutes' bench to score in a 3–0 victory over Chesterfield. However, he continued to struggle <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a regular first-team place and when new manager Peter Taylor took over, Brandon {{was one of a}} number of players released early from his contract. He had played just 31 games during his two seasons with City, scoring three goals.|$|E

5|$|He {{began his}} {{football}} career with Joe Public {{in his native}} Trinidad and Tobago. He moved to W Connection in 2002, {{and he was a}} utility player in the Trinidad and Tobago team in 2003 against Finland. In 2004, he joined Southampton, where he was converted to a striker. He was later loaned to Sheffield Wednesday and Stoke City during the 2004–05 season. In 2007, he joined Sunderland for £6 million where he spent three seasons before he signed for Stoke City in August 2010. In his first season at Stoke Jones scored 12 goals and played in the 2011 FA Cup Final. Following the arrival of Peter Crouch in August 2011, Jones struggled <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a regular place in the side which saw him score just four more league goals in the next three seasons. In January 2014 he joined Cardiff City in a player-exchange with Peter Odemwingie.|$|E
5|$|In September 1989, Ferguson signed left-winger Danny Wallace from Southampton. Wallace {{was not a}} {{particularly}} successful buy for United, and was soon himself struggling <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> {{a place in the}} first team, but the progression of Lee Sharpe meant that Milne was forced out of the first team picture at Old Trafford in 1989–90, making one substitute appearance in the league. During that season, as United struggled in the league but won the FA Cup, Milne was loaned out to Lou Macari's West Ham United, where he made the final appearance of his career in a League Cup tie on 24 January 1990 away to Derby County at the age of 28. His season was ended shortly afterwards after he picked up groin injury that required surgery. Despite being given a new one-year contract he began missing reserve team games during the 1990–91 season and instead spent his time drinking.|$|E
5|$|McEvilly {{signed for}} Garry Flitcroft's Chorley {{at the start}} of the 2011–12 season. He scored his first goal in a 6–0 home victory over Frickley Athletic and went on to play 12 league games for the club, scoring four times. However, on 13 October, McEvilly was {{released}} after failing <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a first team spot. He subsequently joined Colwyn Bay on 27 October 2011. He signed for AFC Fylde in February 2012 to work with Dave Challinor again, but was released at the end of the campaign. In August 2012, McEvilly signed for Warrington Town, the fourteenth different club of his career. After being released by Warrington in December 2012 he spent time training with Barrow and officially joined the club on non-contract terms on 31 January 2013—the start of his third spell with the Cumbrian outfit.|$|E

5|$|The {{son of a}} {{dairy farmer}} and hotel owner, Brown was born in Toowoomba, Queensland. Aged three, {{business}} failure hit the family, and they moved to Marrickville in inner Sydney. The family's poor financial position meant that {{they lived in a}} one-bedroom home, with Brown and his brother sharing a bed. Educated at Dulwich Hill and Petersham High Schools in Sydney, Brown started playing cricket as a wicket-keeper, before changing his focus to opening the batting. He left high school after two years, but was unable to find regular full-time work amid the Great Depression. In 1929–30, Brown played grade cricket for Marrickville Cricket Club, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a regular place. He {{was on the verge of}} leaving Sydney when an innings of 172 for his Shire team reinvigorated his career. He progressed through the grades and reached the club's First XI, where he performed steadily to earn selection for New South Wales in 1932–33.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two seasons, after Sheffield Wednesday signed an influx of foreign players such as Paolo Di Canio and Benito Carbone, Humphreys failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a regular place and he only played a total of 31 matches in those two seasons. Humphreys was sent on loan to Scunthorpe United on 13 August 1999, where he played six matches and again scored twice. He was then sent on loan to Cardiff City where he played 11 matches, scoring twice. After a brief return to the Wednesday team for the 2000–01 season, Humphreys decided to leave Wednesday to play more first team {{football}} was allowed to join Cambridge United on trial. Humphreys impressed on trial, scoring 3 goals in 7 appearances, and it looked likely that Cambridge manager Roy McFarland was going to offer him a contract. However, Humphreys' trial was cut abruptly after he broke his foot. After the sacking of Roy McFarland, new Cambridge manager John Beck was reluctant to offer Humphreys a new contract until he had seen him play.|$|E
5|$|Nix started Bradford's {{first two}} games of the 2008–09 season in place of Joe Colbeck, who was {{suspended}} following a red card against Milton Keynes Dons {{at the end of}} the previous campaign. However, when Colbeck was available again, Nix was dropped to the substitutes' bench, with new signing Paul McLaren partnering Lee Bullock, who had returned from injury, in central midfield. Nix struggled for form but was also playing with an ankle injury, which eventually forced him to take a hospital scan in November. He was one of six club midfielders to be injured at the time. He returned to action later that month as a second-half substitute against his father's former team Rotherham United, at the Don Valley Stadium. However, he struggled <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a regularly place in the side because of new midfielders signed during the course of the season, and he was released {{at the end of the}} campaign having played less than half the games that he played in his first year at City. Nix was offered the chance to return to Bradford by McCall if he could not find a new club but he rejected the invitation.|$|E

50|$|Like the {{traditional}} Hulk, he possesses superhuman strength and stamina. However, {{he appears to}} be stronger than any of the previously-introduced Hulks; when he attempted to escape while Banner was being treated for a presumably-incurable disease, it took both the Savage Hulk and the Joe Fixit Hulk personas <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> him <b>down.</b> However, since this confrontation took place on the mental plane, it is most likely simply reflecting the force of the Devil's will compared to the more child-minded Hulks and the subsequent effort needed for their weaker-willed personas <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> him <b>down</b> rather than providing a clear indication of their actual physical strength.|$|R
5|$|On {{his return}} to Sheffield Wednesday in May 2005, Foster was {{released}} and later joined League Two side Lincoln City on a one-year contract ahead of the 2005–06 season. Foster made his debut for Lincoln in the club's {{first game of the}} season, a 2–1 defeat to Notts County. However, he failed <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a first-team place and had to wait a month to make another appearance for the club – coming on as a 73rd-minute substitute in Lincoln's 2–0 win against Stockport County. However, he was unable to string a series of appearances together throughout the campaign, and made 17 appearances, scoring once in a 5–0 win against Grimsby Town on 25 March 2006. Despite a lack of first-team appearances, Foster signed an extended one-year contract {{at the end of the}} season. However, Foster did not feature again for Lincoln during the 2006–07 campaign and after training with York City, he joined the Conference National team on a one-month emergency loan on 5 October 2006 due to injuries to defenders, making his debut for the club the following day in a 1–0 win against Aldershot Town. This loan deal was extended for a second month in November, but after Foster suffered an ankle injury during the last week of the loan, he returned to his parent club in December. He made his last appearance for York in the club's 1–0 loss to League One side Bristol City in the FA Cup first round. He made seven appearances for York during a two-month loan spell with the club.|$|E
5|$|With {{effect from}} 27 June 2002, Pedra Branca was {{declared}} a protected area within {{the meaning of}} the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act. Consequently, a permit from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is required for access to the island, and unauthorised presence there is a criminal offence. On 6 October 2008, a Singaporean man, Roger Lee, was convicted of illegally landing on Pedra Branca. In court documents, he said he had gone to Batam, Indonesia, in 1998. He later married and started a family with an Indonesian woman, but she left him in 2007 due to his unstable income and inability <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>down</b> a job. As he had illegally overstayed in Indonesia, and had been cheated of his passport and other personal documents by a friend, Lee hatched a plan to pretend to be a lost fisherman {{in the hope that the}} Police Coast Guard would rescue him and take him back to Singapore. On 5 February 2008 he paid a boatman to transport him out to sea in a motorised sampan. As he did not see any coast guard or navy patrols he disembarked on Pedra Branca and was arrested by staff stationed there. Lee pleaded guilty to illegally entering Singapore via an unauthorised landing place. A second charge of being found in a protected place without permission was taken into consideration for sentencing purposes. In mitigation, Lee's pro bono lawyer said that there was no sign on Pedra Branca warning against trespassing on the island. Lee was sentenced to six weeks' imprisonment.|$|E
