5|$|After {{receiving}} numerous {{death threats}} in the mail, Bart becomes paranoid. It is revealed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> is his enemy, Sideshow Bob, who is incarcerated in Springfield State Prison. The next day, Sideshow Bob's parole hearing is held; {{the parole board}} is easily convinced that Sideshow Bob {{is no longer a}} threat. When the Simpson family goes to the cinema, Sideshow Bob sits {{in front of them and}} acts obnoxiously. The Simpsons then realize that it was he who sent the letters, and Marge angrily tells him to stay away from Bart.|$|E
5|$|Siregar {{described}} Kartodikromo as {{the first}} Indonesian writer to openly criticise the Dutch colonial government and the traditional form of feudalism practised in the country; he also notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> w{{as the first}} Indonesian to consciously depict class struggles in his works. As Siregar considered Indonesian literature {{to have been born}} from a nationalist understanding, he considered Marco one of the first truly Indonesian writers.|$|E
5|$|The Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer is the Hugo Award given {{each year}} for writers of works related to science fiction or fantasy which {{appeared}} in low- or non-paying publications such as semiprozines or fanzines or in generally available electronic media during the previous calendar year. There is no restriction <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> is not also a professional author, and several such authors have won the award for their non-paying works. The award was first presented in 1967 and has been awarded annually.|$|E
50|$|It {{is perhaps}} not {{surprising}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> of Moby Dick, The American Practical Navigator, and Two Years Before the Mast were Merchant Mariners. It might be surprising <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> of Borat, A Hard Day's Night, and Cool Hand Luke were.|$|R

50|$|Dalene Rovenstine from Paste Magazine {{rated the}} episode with 8.8/10 but stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> wasted <b>the</b> talent of Wendi McLendon-Covey by not given her many lines.|$|R
5|$|Before Moffat left Pola Jones for Hartswood, Ptaszynski {{produced}} Chalk, {{the series}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> had pitched {{to him at}} the beginning of the decade. Set in a comprehensive school and starring David Bamber as manic deputy head Eric Slatt and Nicola Walker as Suzy Travis, the show was based on Moffat's three years as an English teacher. The studio audience responded so positively to the first series when it was taped that the BBC commissioned a second series before the first had aired. However, it was met less enthusiastically by critics upon transmission in February 1997, who had taken exception to the BBC's publicity department comparing the show to the highly respected Fawlty Towers. In an interview in the early 2000s, Moffat refuses to even name the series, joking that he might get attacked in the street.|$|E
5|$|In early 1891, Berlin society {{erupted in}} scandal {{after a series}} of {{anonymous}} letters circulated to prominent members of the court, including Wilhelm and his wife Dona. The letters were written in the same handwriting, and featured salacious gossip, accusations, and intrigues among the court's powerful. Some included pornographic images layered upon royal photographs. Several hundred letters were sent over a four-year period. Wilhelm ordered an investigation, but the writer (or writers) were never identified. Some contemporaries speculated that Charlotte, known for her sharp tongue and love of gossip, may have been responsible. Historians have since suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> may have been Dona's brother Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein in collaboration with his mistress. It is clear that the author had an intimate understanding of the many personalities within the royal family, likely making him or her either a family member or courtier.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{was based on}} Ten Nights in a Bar-Room and What I Saw There by Timothy Shay Arthur. The plot focused {{on the dangers of}} alcoholism and the downfall of those taken in by its effects. In the 1850s, sales of the novel were second only to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. The {{production was}} adapted for the stage in 1858 and while it did not perform well on Broadway, it proved to be a lasting success. Dozens of productions would cross the United States for the next sixty years and the play proved to be a major influence on the Temperance movement, resulting in the passage of temperance laws. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> of the scenario was Lloyd Lonergan. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Only the roles of Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline are known. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.|$|E
50|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> episode gave Ted {{lessons about}} commitment. She added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> {{found a way}} to put in Tyson's {{appearance}} into the story.|$|R
50|$|Donovan also {{revealed}} that he was honored and flattered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> thought he could take such a story and handle {{it in the way}} it was written.|$|R
50|$|Jen from TV Overmind gave a good {{review to}} <b>the</b> episode stating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> did not {{disappoint}} with the brothers reunion scene and {{it could not have}} been better.|$|R
25|$|Although Masterman ran the system, he {{credited}} MI5 with originating the idea. It {{is widely}} assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> Ian Fleming, himself involved in wartime intelligence, adapted Masterman's {{name for the}} (female) character of Jill Masterson in his James Bond novel Goldfinger (1959).|$|E
25|$|The Phoenician abjad was {{a radical}} {{simplification}} of phonetic writing, since hieroglyphics required the writer {{to pick a}} hieroglyph starting with the same sound <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> wanted to write in order to write phonetically, much as man'yougana (Chinese characters, or kanji, used solely for phonetic use) was used to represent Japanese phonetically before the invention of kana.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with this, Poporanist critic Garabet Ibrăileanu argued that Caragiale actually hated {{the people who}} inspired his works, and claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> had made this clear during one of their conversations. His account was considered doubtful by researcher Ştefan Cazimir, who believed that Ibrăileanu was using it to back a polemic and singular overview of Caragiale's work.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2008 interview, Beale {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> eclectically extended <b>the</b> historical-grammatical {{method of}} exegesis, seeking a [...] "biblical-theological perspective that really {{goes beyond the}} traditional understanding of grammatical-historical." ...|$|R
5000|$|Libertarians {{criticism}} of the IGF tends to be tied to a belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> do {{not go far enough}} in advocating for reducing government regulations that limit citizens personal and economic life. Yet, a second source of criticism, among libertarians is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> IGF <b>writers</b> do not advocate election law reforms <b>that</b> would allow <b>the</b> Libertarian Party to freely compete for votes in elections.|$|R
5000|$|In {{regards to}} reintroducing Gendry to the story, Hill stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> were {{uncertain}} {{on when he}} should be reintroduced. Hill noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> always intended to bring Gendry back, {{and that they had}} originally planned to bring him back in the previous season. They eventually settled on bringing him back in [...] "Eastwatch" [...] in order to place him into the storyline he referred to as [...] "the big mission," [...] with Jon Snow beyond the Wall. He continued by saying, [...] "It made sense that Davos would want to save this boy who's like a surrogate son." ...|$|R
25|$|In his Church History, Eusebius records <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> of this gospel was a {{man named}} Mark who was Peter’s interpreter. It was {{believed}} that his accounts of Jesus were historically accurate, but {{that there was some}} chronological distortion. It is further agreed that this gospel was originally composed in Koine Greek, near Rome.|$|E
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> makes about the whole affair (and he is right in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all to face the fact cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E
25|$|Kept at {{the city}} morgue, the body was {{assigned}} to Urmuz's brother-in-law and fellow clerk C. Stoicescu, who stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> had been suffering from neurosis. Urmuz was buried on November 26, in his family plot at Bellu cemetery. On the day, the event was publicized by a small obituary in Dimineața daily, signed with the initial C (presumably, for Ciprian). Both this and other press notices failed {{to mention that the}} grefier and the published author were one and the same, and the general public was for long unaware of any such connection. Story goes that an anonymous woman visited the family shortly after the burial, inquiring as to whether the deceased had left any letters.|$|E
50|$|Burgess {{has said}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> <b>that</b> he {{read as a}} teenager, such as Alfred Jarry, Comte de Lautréamont, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Genet, Alain Robbe-Grillet and André Gide made the biggest {{impression}} on him.|$|R
5000|$|In April 2015, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> of [...] "Oops Up Side Your Head" [...] had had their names added to the writing credits of Mark Ronson's hit single [...] "Uptown Funk".|$|R
25|$|During {{production}} of Supernaturals third season, Kripke stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> sometimes discussed <b>the</b> {{possibility of a}} prequel series. Set in the Old West, the spin-off would follow Samuel Colt {{and a group of}} hunters.|$|R
25|$|What {{served to}} launch Beuys {{into the public}} {{consciousness}} was that which transpired following his performance at the Technical College Aachen in 1964. As part of a festival of new art coinciding with the 20th anniversary of an assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, Beuys created a performance or Aktion. The performance {{was interrupted by a}} group of students, one of whom attacked Beuys, punching him in the face. A photograph of the artist, nose bloodied and arm raised, was circulated in the media. It was for this 1964 festival that Beuys produced an idiosyncratic CV, which he titled Lebenslauf/Werklauf (Life Course/Work Course). The document was a self-consciously fictionalised account of the artist's life, in which historical events mingle with metaphorical and mythical speech (he refers to his birth as the ‘Exhibition of a wound;’ he claims his Ulysses Extension to have been carried out ‘at James Joyce's request’ – impossible, given <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> was, by 1961, long dead). This document marks a blurring of fact and fiction that was to be characteristic of Beuys' self-created persona, as well as the source of much controversy (although, significantly, there is no mention here of the famous plane crash).|$|E
25|$|Duke Snider {{finished}} second to teammate Campanella in the MVP voting by just five points, 226–221, with each man receiving eight first place votes. The voting {{then as now}} was conducted by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Each voting member, one from each major league city, filled out a ballot selecting ten men. A player receiving a first place vote got 14 points, 9 points for second, and then values of 8–7–6–5–4–3–2–1 for those in places 3 through 10. A writer from Philadelphia who was sick and who had become hospitalized had turned in a ballot with Campanella listed in position number 1 as well as position number 5. The assumption had been <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> had meant to write Snider's name {{into one of those}} slots. Unable to get a clarification from the ill writer the BBWAA, after considering disallowing the ballot, decided to accept it, count the first place vote for Campanella and count the fifth place vote as though it were left blank. Had the ballot been disallowed, the vote would have been won by Snider by three points. Had Snider gotten the fifth place vote, the final vote would have favored Snider 227–226. Duke did, however, win the Sporting News National League Player of the Year Award for 1955 and the Sid Mercer Award.|$|E
500|$|Hendrik Maier, a {{lecturer}} at Leiden University, writes that Kartodikromo was [...] "primarily inspired by dreams and ideals", noting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> intended {{to create a}} community of politically aware Indonesians to work against the colonial government in solidarity and equality. Kartodikromo described his ideal political state as having [...] "" [...] ("the same standards, the same feelings").|$|E
50|$|Showrunner Erica Messer {{has stated}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> {{considered}} having Reid relapse and start abusing Dilaudid again. However, {{it has been}} confirmed that Reid will not relapse {{and that he will}} be wiser about it.|$|R
50|$|Subjects read essays for {{and against}} Fidel Castro, {{and were asked to}} rate the pro-Castro attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>writers.</b> When <b>the</b> {{subjects}} believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> freely chose positions for or against Castro, they naturally rated the people who spoke in favor of Castro as having a more positive attitude towards Castro. However, contradicting Jones and Harris' initial hypothesis, when the subjects were told <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer's</b> positions were determined by a coin toss, they still rated writers who spoke in favor of Castro as having, on average, a more positive attitude towards Castro than those who spoke against him. In other words, the subjects were unable to properly see the influence of the situational constraints placed upon the writers; they could not refrain from attributing sincere belief to <b>the</b> <b>writers.</b> Therefore, <b>the</b> experimental group provided more internal attributions towards <b>the</b> <b>writer.</b>|$|R
40|$|By {{classifying}} Japanese sentences {{into eight}} categories, this paper discusses {{the problems of}} Japanese to English translation. By way of illustration, Japanese compositions written by a Japanese first-grader are used. The eight categories into which the sentences are classified are as follows: 1. sentences structured into “there is” or “there are”; 2. sentences <b>that</b> indicate <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> observations; 3. sentences <b>that</b> describe <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> actions; 4. sentences <b>that</b> express <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> feelings; 5. sentences <b>that</b> describe <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> state and intentions; 6. sentences that describe events; 7. statements of generalization; and 8; other. The short analyses of each category {{shed light on the}} difficulties of translating Japanese into English and, at the same time, provide us with useful insights which can be used when translating Japanese into English. 研究ノー...|$|R
500|$|Poe's writing {{reflects}} his literary theories, which he presented in his criticism {{and also in}} essays such as [...] "The Poetic Principle". He disliked didacticism and allegory, though he believed that meaning in literature should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface. Works with obvious meanings, he wrote, cease to be art. He believed that work of quality should be brief and focus on a specific single effect. To that end, he believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> should carefully calculate every sentiment and idea.|$|E
500|$|Salinger died {{of natural}} causes at his home in New Hampshire on January 27, 2010. He was 91. Salinger's {{literary}} representative told The New York Times <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> had broken his hip in May 2009, but that [...] "his health had been excellent until a rather sudden decline after the new year." [...] The representative believed that Salinger's death was not a painful one. His third wife and widow, Colleen O'Neill Zakrzeski Salinger, and Salinger's son Matt became the executors of his estate.|$|E
500|$|Crane himself {{later wrote}} about the novel: [...] "I don't think The Red Badge to be any great shakes but then the very theme of it gives it an {{intensity}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer</b> can't [...] reach every day." [...] For the remainder of Crane's short career (he died from tuberculosis {{at the age of}} 28) The Red Badge of Courage served as the standard against which the rest of his works were compared. Appleton republished the novel again in 1917, shortly after the US entered World War I, reissuing it three additional times that same year.|$|E
5000|$|Marta was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} an environmentalist and fill the role of opposition to the Ewing's plans to drill for oil on the Southfork Ranch. Varela told a writer from El Mercurio that [...] "Marta is a sophisticated woman, educated, smart and professional. Immediately I identified with her." [...] She added that she would find her own life experiences useful while playing Marta. When Varela auditioned for the role she was unaware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> had planned for Marta to be manipulative. She told Gabrielle Chung of Celebuzz <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> had been [...] "sneaky bastards" [...] and not told her how the storyline would develop.|$|R
5000|$|In a 2003 interview, Seth MacFarlane stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> {{thought it}} would be funny to give Chris a {{childhood}} fear that is actually real, since he has [...] "a childlike mind".

5000|$|Co-writer Eylon Aslan-Levy has {{revealed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> music [...] "very often sprang {{out of the}} philosophy itself", and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> used <b>the</b> rhythm of lines of philosophical texts, such as The Social Contract, for inspiration.
