5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>knee</b> joint <b>joins</b> <b>the</b> thigh {{with the}} leg and {{consists}} of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia (tibiofemoral joint), and one between the femur and patella (patellofemoral joint).

Through a single incision at <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> one nail was inserted retrograde into the femur and the other, ante-grade into the tibia; the two nails were <b>joined</b> at <b>the</b> level of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> by a conical couple and were secured with locking screws. The diameters of the nails were different, to accommodate the dissimilar sizes of the tibial and femoral intramedullary canals...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: Chondromalacia Patellae is the "softening of the {{articular}} cartilage of the knee-cap. The {{articular cartilage}} {{refers to the}} cartilage lining under <b>the</b> knee-cap that <b>joins</b> with <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint, <b>the</b> condition {{is more common in}} girls. The closed and open chain exercises are beneficial in strengthening of the quadriceps muscles and management of chondromalacia patellae. This study was conducted to compare between closed chain exercises and open chain exercises in management of chondromalacia Patellae patients. Subjects and methods: The study included fourty patients and divided randomly into two groups. The first group followed a physical therapy program of closed chain exercises, three sessions per week for three months (mean age = 18. 25 ± 1. 66 years). The second group submitted to a physical therapy program of open chain exercises, three sessions per week for three months (mean age, 17. 75 ± 1. 44 years). Outcome measures were rating score system of the japanese orthopaedic association for measuring daily living activities (up and down stairs), universal goniometer to detect range of motion of knee extension from 90 º- 0 º, and visual analogue scale to measure the pain severity. Results: There was a significant improvement in the first group (t. of pain = 0. 004, t. of ROM = 0. 005, t. of ADL = 0. 006) than in the second group (t. of pain = 0. 02, t. of ROM = 0. 03, t. of ADL = 0. 04). Discussion and Conclusion: This study provides that closed chain exercise is very effect more than open chain exercises in management of chondromalacia Patellae patients...|$|R
50|$|Lack of {{stability}} in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is a {{main cause of}} rupturing the ACL in <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> Most advanced athletes struggle to gain enough stability within <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> while exercising causing the possibility of injury. The ACL exists to provide <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> stability {{but it is the}} athletes duty to make sure <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> is stable {{enough to be able to}} play out the game.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>knee</b> has a {{more complex}} {{movement}} pattern compared to the hip. At heel contact <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> extensor and flexor muscles co-contract to provide stability for <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint since it is almost maximally extended {{at that point in}} time. Shortly after, as the foot becomes flat on <b>the</b> ground, <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> gradually flexes approximately 10-15 degrees reaching the maximum at about 15% of the gait cycle. This small amount of knee flexion is controlled eccentrically by <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> extensor muscles which serve the purpose of cushioning the rate of loading on the lower-limb and preventing excessive knee flexion. Following through to mid-and terminal stance, <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> gradually extends with concentric activity of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> extensor muscles and approaches near full extension as heel off occurs (30-40% of gait cycle). At this point <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> flexor muscles concentrically flex <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> again for swing phase. <b>The</b> maximum <b>knee</b> flexion that occurs during swing is about 60 degrees.|$|R

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint {{contains}} excess fluid, it {{may become}} difficult or painful to bend or straighten. Fluid may also show under <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> when straightened. Icing may help to decrease swelling. Heat may help relax the muscles of <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{anterior}} cruciate ligament {{is one of the}} four crucial ligaments in <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> It originates from the lateral condyle of the femur and goes to the intercondyloid eminence of the tibia.

It also restrains excessive forward movement in the leg and limits rotational movements in <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|R
50|$|A knee {{orthosis}} (KO) or {{knee brace}} is a brace that extends {{above and below}} <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint and is generally worn to support or align <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> In <b>the</b> case of diseases causing neurological or muscular impairment of muscles surrounding <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> a KO can prevent flexion or extension instability of <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> In <b>the</b> case of conditions affecting the ligaments or cartilage of <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> a KO can provide stabilization to <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> by replacing <b>the</b> function of these injured or damaged parts. For instance, knee braces {{can be used to}} relieve pressure from the part of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint affected by diseases such as arthritis or osteoarthritis by realigning <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint into valgus or varus. In this way a KO may help reduce osteoarthritis pain. However, a knee brace is not meant to treat an injury or disease on its own, but is used as a component of treatment along with drugs, physical therapy and possibly surgery. When used properly, a knee brace may help an individual to stay active by enhancing the position and movement of <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> or reducing pain.|$|R
50|$|An ACL rupture is {{the most}} common injury that takes place in <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> <b>The</b> ACL is very small, smaller than some might think; the average length is 38mm and only 11mm wide. <b>The</b> <b>knee</b> is formed by the {{connection}} of the femur (upper leg bone) and the Tibia (lower leg bone) with another two bones been the fibula (small bone next to the tibia) and <b>the</b> patella (<b>the</b> <b>knee</b> cap). Within these two main bones tendons attach the bones to the muscles that give <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> movement, while <b>the</b> ligaments provide <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> with stability. <b>The</b> ACL looks like a mixture of an oval and triangle shape, and is located in a very compact area within <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> <b>The</b> ACL fibers are in place to give direction for <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> to move, such as a kicking or twisting motion. If an ACL rupture occurs, it immediately forces an increase for not only the anterior tibial translation but also the internal tibial rotation as the femur is pushed back to rotate, this creates trauma to <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> as it is not stabilised. The ACL is there to create rotational stability within <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> to be able to produce different motions. Importantly the ACL restraints the anterior tibial translation, providing 85-87% total retraining force.|$|R
