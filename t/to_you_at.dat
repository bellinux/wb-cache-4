500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>At</b> least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{specific}} Classical influence in Chrétien's romances {{the likes of which}} (The Iliad, The Aeneid, Metamorphoses) were [...] "translated into the Old French vernacular during the 1150s". Foster Guyer argues that specifically Yvain, the Knight of the Lion contains definite Ovidian influence: [...] "Yvain was filled with grief and showed the Ovidian love symptoms of weeping and sighing so bitterly that he could scarcely speak. He declared that he would never stay away a full year. [...] Using words like those of Leander in the seventeenth of Ovid's Epistles he said: 'If only I had the wings of a dove/to fly back <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> will/Many and many a time I would come'." ...|$|E
2500|$|You know – & I believe saw {{once that}} odd-headed girl – who {{introduced}} herself to me shortly before I left England – {{but you do}} not know – that I found her with Shelley and her sister at Geneva – I never loved her nor pretended to love her – but a man is a man – & if a girl of eighteen comes prancing <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> all hours of the night – there is but one way – the suite of all this is that she was with child – & returned to England to assist in peopling that desolate island... This comes of [...] "putting it about" [...] (as Jackson calls it) & be dammed to it – and thus people come into the world.|$|E

2500|$|Maclean {{wondered}} whether officials in Cairo [...] "quite realised {{the difficulties of}} travel in German-occupied Europe", when he was told in an official signal {{that he was to}} go to Cairo immediately but that the Partisan delegation could follow later if required... (it turned out that the British delegation was returning from the conference at Teheran via Cairo). While away down the coast Maclean was amazed to receive a garbled message from Cairo, with a clear sentence [...] "King now in Cairo, Will be dropped <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> first opportunity." [...] He thought that as part of London's gradual rapprochement policy between King Peter of Yugoslavia and the Partisans, the King was to be [...] "dropped headlong into the seething centre of the Jugoslav cauldron." [...] Later he was told that the message referred to their new signals officer, whose surname was King.|$|E
2500|$|The jury {{took just}} 16 minutes to convict Nodder of Tinsley's abduction. In his summary to the court, Justice Swift paid {{reference}} to Nodder's {{refusal to testify}} at this trial, stating: [...] "Nobody knows what has become of that little girl... Whatever happened to her, how she fared, who looked after her, where she slept. There is one person in this court who knows, and he is silent... he is silent! He says nothing <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> all... He sits there and never tells you a word. In passing sentence, Justice Swift added: [...] "What you did with that little girl, what became of her, only you know. It may be that time will reveal the dreadful secret you carry in your breast. I cannot tell, but, I am determined that, as far as have part or lot in that dreadful tragedy, I will keep you in custody." [...] He was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment, to be served at Lincoln Prison.|$|E

2500|$|On December 19, 2006, GoDaddy {{received}} {{a third party}} complaint of invalid domain contact information in the WHOIS database for the domain FamilyAlbum.com. GoDaddy {{wrote a letter to}} the owner of FamilyAlbum.com saying, [...] "Whenever we receive a complaint, we are required by ICANN regulations to initiate an investigation as to whether the contact data displaying in the WHOIS database is valid data or not... On 12/19/2006 we sent a notice <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> the admin/tech contact email address and the account email address informing you of invalid data in breach of the domain registration agreement and advising you to update the information or risk cancellation of the domain. The contact information was not updated within the specified period of time and we canceled the domain." [...] The editor of [...] "Domain Name Wire" [...] said that since domain names are valuable it was reasonable to expect that the registrar would try to contact the domain owner by phone or postal mail. On February 28, 2007, GoDaddy offered to get the domain name back for the previous owner if he would indemnify GoDaddy from legal action by the new registrant. GoDaddy stated that the new owner paid $18.99 for the domain, the price of a backorder, not a regular registration. On November 2, 2007, Domain Name Wire reported that it appears that GoDaddy no longer cancels domains for invalid WHOIS. The editor on Domain Name Wire {{received a}} message from a reader who is trying to acquire a domain with obviously false WHOIS information. The message from GoDaddy said, [...] "The domain has been suspended due to invalid WHOIS. The domain will remain in suspension through expiration, including the registry's redemption period, unless the owner updates the contact information before that time." ...|$|E
