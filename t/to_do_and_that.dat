500|$|... "The List" [...] premiered on the Fox {{network in}} the United States on October 20, 1995. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 10.8, with a 19 share, meaning that roughly 10.8 percent of all television-equipped {{households}}, and 19 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was watched {{by a total of}} 16.72 million viewers, and was later nominated for several International Monitor Awards, including nominations for best director, best editing, and best color correction. [...] "The List" [...] later won the award for best director. Story editor Frank Spotnitz said of the episode, [...] "I think this is a vastly underrated episode. I also think it was a very brave and different show <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it will weather the test of time very well. I think it was brave because {{there is not a single}} likable character - nobody you can root for. Mulder and Scully do not solve the case, and that is something I had been interested in doing for some time." [...] Chris Carter was nominated for an award by the Directors Guild of America for his work on this episode.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Erica Green, who {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation in May 2007, {{thought she might}} be more forgiving in hindsight as she knows that the follow-ups to [...] "Datalore" [...] were great episodes. She thought it was reminiscent of the evil twin of Captain James T. Kirk in [...] episode [...] "" [...] and the mirror universe version of Spock seen in [...] "". She felt that Lore lacked any motivation for what he was intending <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the crew were made to look [...] "pretty stupid" [...] by their inaction to the Lore threat. She thought that the ending was shocking, as transporting the villain into space would never have occurred if they were human, and [...] "a moment of utter inconsistency" [...] as Lore had only just told the entity to attack when the shields drop following a transporter activation. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] valued the episode for providing backstory to Data, but said that [...] "no one is smart enough to realize the obvious. None of the crew except Boy Wesley realizes that Lore is impersonating Data — and when Wesley (who is always somehow more observant than the silly adults) brings this to their attention, we get helpful lines like, [...] "Shut up, Wesley," [...] which lead to even more helpful lines of would-be teenage rebellion when Wesley complains about the officers not listening to him. Quite simply, this is annoying material, continuing in season one's trend of Wesley's child status as a plot device. Meanwhile, all the adults look terminally clueless." [...] He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E
2500|$|These {{and several}} other party roles merit further mention because they {{influence}} significantly the leader's overarching objective: retake majority control of the House.

500|$|Southey {{intended}} Madoc {{to rival}} {{the works of}} Homer, and Coleridge believed that the poem {{would be better than}} the Aeneid. However, Madoc received mixed reviews from critics; while one critic believed it was comparable to John Milton's Paradise Lost, another felt that it was unreadable. In letter written by William Wordsworth on 3 June 1805, he claimed that he was [...] "highly pleased with it; it abounds in beautiful pictures and descriptions happily introduced, and there is an animation diffused through the whole story though it cannot perhaps be said that any of the characters interest you much, except perhaps young Llewllyn whose situation is highly interesting, and he appears to me the best conceived and sustained character in the piece [...] The Poem fails in the highest gifts of the poet's mind Imagination in the true sense of the word, and knowledge of human Nature and human heart. There is nothing that shows the hand of the great Master". He followed this with a letter on 29 July 1805 saying [...] "Southey's mind does not seem strong enough to draw the picture of a Hero. The character of Madoc is often very insipid and contemptible [...] In short, according to my notion, the character is throughout languidly conceived". Dorothy Wordsworth, William's sister, wrote on 11 June 1805 to claim that [...] "We have read Madoc with great delight [...] I had one painful feeling throughout, that I did not care as much about Madoc as the Author wished me <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the characters in general are not sufficiently distinct to make them have a separate after-existence in my affection." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was known}} for his essays, most {{particularly}} The Power of the Powerless, in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to [...] "live within a lie" [...] under the communist regime. In describing his role as a dissident, Havel wrote in 1979: [...] "...we never decided to become dissidents. We have been transformed into them, without quite knowing how, sometimes we have ended up in prison without precisely knowing how. We simply went ahead and did certain things that we felt we ought <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> seemed to us decent to do, nothing more nor less." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ocean {{later said}} of {{his work at the}} time, [...] "There was a point where I was {{composing}} for other people, and it might have been comfy <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> enjoy <b>that</b> income stream <b>and</b> the anonymity.

And we kept it very much between the three of us, without including {{too many people in}} terms of labels and management and so on. Which gives you a certain freedom <b>and</b> flexibility. So <b>that</b> was the only sort of thing that we had; have fun, let's have no inhibitions, no limitations <b>and</b> <b>do</b> whatever we want <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that's</b> why we made a 10-minute track with saxophone."

Comedian David Letterman became a fan of Heenan after seeing him in WWA. WWE Hall of Fame commentator Jim Ross selected Heenan as the greatest talent {{in the history of the}} wrestling business. Ross praised Heenan's ability as a color commentator, stating: [...] "He was naturally funny ... and enhanced every single talent, including the heroes, even though Bobby did not support the fan favorites as the bad guy announcer. [...] did what every announcer should strive <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> is to make talent bigger stars than they are and to embellish every talent’s TV persona." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fimber Bravo and Charles Hayward {{were asked}} to {{collaborate}} on the album and Taylor said they immediately created unexpected material. Taylor described Hayward as [...] "very capable of coming up with his own stuff" [...] and stated that {{he was responsible for}} the drumming in the background of the final chorus of [...] "Hand Me Down Your Love", which Taylor labelled as [...] "explosive". He stated that it was not something the band would have thought <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> it worked [...] "tremendously well". The recordings Hayward did only lasted for a few hours and Taylor stated, [...] "we were kind of just left to our own devices {{to see if we could}} make use of it".

Not that I stood toe to toe with him, but I tried to take the shot and I came up short." [...] Futch opined that Spinks was undone because he {{abandoned}} his gameplan of boxing and moving early on and instead tried to win Tyson's respect. Spinks later conceded that [...] "fear was knocking at my door big time." [...] Tyson said [...] "The first punch I threw, he wobbled a bit. I knew right there I had him," [...] adding [...] "my trainer told me before the fight that he bet both our purses that I would knock {{him out in the}} first round.

2500|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Mullin leader Patrick Nee, Paul McGonagle was {{thoroughly}} livid over {{the murder of}} his brother and, believing that O'Sullivan was responsible, received permission to kill him. On March 28, 1971, after having dinner with his wife at Jimmy's Harborside Restaurant, O'Sullivan dropped his wife off at their home and told her that he had an errand <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> he would be back in an hour. Shortly after midnight, Mary noticed that his car was parked in the driveway in front of their house at the bottom of their driveway, it was surrounded by a group of neighbors. She went out to see what her neighbors were looking at and she saw her husband's bullet riddled body. She at first did not recognize his body but made positive identification from the suit that he wore. O'Sullivan had been shot by several gunmen numerous times as he sat behind the wheel of his car and was hanging half out of the car with the driver's door open.|$|E
2500|$|Mario Kart Wii was well-received, earning {{praise for}} its online {{capability}} {{and the large}} number of tracks, characters and karts. Joe Sinicki of Blast Magazine comments: [...] "While it still does suffer from some of the problems of the older games, Mario Kart Wii takes the simple and accessible formula set by its predecessors and tweaks it enough to make it feel fresh and fun, creating one of the most entertaining and rewarding gaming experiences in quite some time." [...] Official Nintendo Magazine UK commented that the Wii Wheel worked very effectively and loved the different multiplayer modes. GameSpot producer Lark Anderson praised the game for being easy to jump into for players of any skill level and stated that motorcycles provide a great alternative to go-karts, and IGN commented that [...] "Nintendo has delivered one of the best console Karts in years." [...] Plugged In stated that the racing is easy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> [...] "the Grand Prix Cup events and several team battle modes keep things interesting" [...] while Classic Game Room praised the game for its high production value and great replay value. They also liked that the online play was a major strength of the game.|$|E
2500|$|Ms. Splosion Man was {{announced}} December 3, 2010 via {{a press release}} and teaser trailer. [...] "I think with Splosion Man a follow up was something we really wanted <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> is why you never saw DLC for that game. We could have churned out new levels, but we wouldn't have {{had the time to}} add in new gameplay puzzles or cool new character stuff. But we didn't just want to do Splosion Man 2, it had to be something a little more interesting. That is why we decided to do MSM," [...] stated Josh Bear of Twisted Pixel Games. [...] The team chose a female variation on 'Splosion Man as an homage to Ms. Pac-Man, which, according to Bear, the game pays homage to. [...] Bear continued by explaining that as Ms. Pac-Man was an improvement on Pac-Man so Ms. Splosion Man is meant to be an advancement on Splosion Man. [...] He stated the goal was to ensure that the game [...] "stands out on its own as a much bigger and better game overall, not to be confused as an over-priced DLC pack which I think a lot of retail [...] "sequels" [...] can be a lot of the time."

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it.

2500|$|Sebastian {{said in an}} {{interview}} in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album. He said he didn't feel that was right for the Australian market, [...] "I ended up with a new record of original songs that didn't have quite the right production, like it all sounded quite old school, it didn't really have a modern edge to it. I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare. I mean [...] "Like It Like That" [...] for example was really old school, like real drums, real organic, so we reproduced that and we got it to sound a little more modern, in your face I guess, the way it is now and we did that with a lot of the tracks so yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare getting to the final product". Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> I've wanted to do for so long.

2500|$|In 1793, the Duke of York {{was sent}} to Flanders {{in command of the}} British {{contingent}} of an allied force destined for the invasion of France. In June 1794, Wellesley with the 33rd regiment set sail from Cork bound for Ostend as part of an expedition bringing reinforcements for the army in Flanders. They arrived too late and joined the Duke of York as he was pulling back towards the Netherlands. On 15 September 1794, at the Battle of Boxtel, east of Breda, Wellington, in temporary command of his brigade, had his first experience of battle. During General Abercromby’s withdrawal in the face of superior French forces, the 33rd held off enemy cavalry, allowing neighbouring units to retreat safely. During the extremely harsh winter that followed, Wellesley and his regiment formed part of an allied force holding the defence line along the Waal River. The 33rd, {{along with the rest of}} the army, suffered heavy losses from sickness and exposure. Wellesley’s health was also affected by the damp environment. Though the campaign was to end disastrously, with the British army driven out of the United Provinces into Germany, Wellesley was to learn several valuable lessons, including the use of steady lines of infantry against advancing columns and of the merits of supporting sea-power. He understood that the failure of the campaign was due in part to the faults of the leaders and the poor organisation at headquarters. He remarked later of his time in the Netherlands that [...] "At least I learned what not <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> <b>and</b> <b>that</b> is always a valuable lesson".|$|E
