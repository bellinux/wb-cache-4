5|$|Harris {{reportedly}} {{joined the}} cast of Prometheus in February 2011 with Idris Elba and Kate Dickie. Harris described Fifield as an audience surrogate who is very cautious and questions dangerous situations. Jon Spaihts, author of Alien: Engineers (the original prequel), wrote Fifield as changing directly into an Alien from the black mutagen, tying the film into the Alien canon. During its evolution into Prometheus, Ridley Scott decided to diverge from the previous films and establish a separate canon. In a deleted take of Fifield's mutated face he is more deformed and reminiscent of an Alien, with an elongated cranium under <b>the</b> <b>melted,</b> translucent helmet, long arms and sharp teeth. The character's final depiction retained Fifield's human appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when it was believed that the key to the successful storage to ice was the construction of underground ice houses, where it was believed, incorrectly, that it would always be cool enough to store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that ice was held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off <b>the</b> <b>melted</b> water, as this water would further melt the remaining ice much faster than warm air would do.|$|E
5|$|By November, {{proponents of}} the peace coin had {{realized}} that congressional approval was not necessary—as the Morgan dollar had been struck for more than 25 years, it was eligible for replacement {{at the discretion of}} the Secretary of the Treasury under an 1890 act. The Morgan design was then being used for large quantities of silver dollars as the Mint struck replacements for <b>the</b> <b>melted</b> coins under the Pittman Act. Though Congress had not yet convened, Baker contacted Fraser in early November to discuss details of the design competition. According to Burdette, Baker's newfound enthusiasm came from the fact that President Harding was about to formally declare an end to the war with Germany—a declaration needed because the US had not ratified the Treaty of Versailles. In addition, the Washington Conference on disarmament, for which the administration had great hopes, was soon to convene. On November 19, Fraser notified competition participants by personal letter, sending official rules and requirements four days later, with submissions due by December 12. Competition participants included Hermon MacNeil, Victor D. Brenner, and Adolph Weinman, all of whom had designed previous U.S. coins.|$|E

25|$|During deglaciation, <b>the</b> <b>melted</b> {{ice water}} {{returns to the}} oceans, thus sea level in the ocean {{increases}} again. However, geological records of sea level changes show that the redistribution of <b>the</b> <b>melted</b> ice water {{is not the same}} everywhere in the oceans. In other words, depending upon the location, the rise in sea level at a certain site may be more than that at another site. This is due to the gravitational attraction between the mass of <b>the</b> <b>melted</b> water and the other masses, such as remaining ice sheets, glaciers, water masses and mantle rocks and the changes in centrifugal potential due to Earth's variable rotation.|$|E

40|$|A {{process and}} {{apparatus}} is disclosed for growing a crystal ribbon of a substance of theoretically infinite length from a <b>melt</b> of <b>the</b> substance.

25|$|Melts {{can stay}} in place long enough to melt to 20% or even 35%, but rocks are rarely melted in excess of 50%, because {{eventually}} <b>the</b> <b>melted</b> rock mass becomes a crystal-and-melt mush that can then ascend en masse as a diapir, which may then cause further decompression melting.|$|E
25|$|On 3 November 2011 TEPCO {{said that}} the tiny amounts of xenon-135 {{detected}} in the reactor's containment vessel atmosphere came from spontaneous nuclear fission with curium-242 and curium-244, substances that {{were present in the}} nuclear fuel. A critical fission would have caused much higher concentrations of xenon isotopes.

30|$|With a {{modified}} effective computational method {{in terms of}} the maximum temperature in the mesh and the electrical resistivity, the electrical failure of a metallic nanowire mesh due to Joule heating (i.e., melting) was investigated. As an example, <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> process of an Ag nanowire mesh under specific working conditions was analyzed via monitoring of the temperature in the mesh and determining <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> current that triggers <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> of a mesh segment.

25|$|At {{the level}} of initiation, RNA {{polymerase}} in prokaryotes (bacteria in particular) binds strongly to the promoter region and initiates a high basal rate of transcription.

Chromatin greatly impedes transcription in eukaryotes. Assembly of large multi-protein preinitiation complex is required for promoter-specific initiation. Promoter melting in eukaryotes requires hydrolysis of ATP. As a result, eukaryotic RNA polymerases exhibit a low basal rate of transcription initiation.|$|E

25|$|Erupting volcanoes {{can pose}} many hazards, {{not only in}} the {{immediate}} vicinity of the eruption. One such hazard is that volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; <b>the</b> <b>melted</b> particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere (or troposphere); however, they also absorb heat radiated from the Earth, thereby warming the upper atmosphere (or stratosphere). Historically, volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines.|$|E

The pitch was melted out, areas of pattern were gilded, and the eyes of the larger figures were inlaid with glass. The plates were probably worked in a flat form and later bent into curves to solder them together.|$|E
