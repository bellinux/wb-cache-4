5000|$|Index {{keys are}} stored in {{normalized}} form which can be, in many cases, denormalized to the original column value. Normalization is not always reversible. For example, Text and Long <b>Text</b> <b>column</b> types cannot be denormalized [...] In addition, index keys may be truncated when column data is very long. In cases where columns cannot be retrieved directly from secondary indexes, the record can always be accessed to retrieve the necessary data.|$|E
5000|$|The {{manuscript}} contains three author portraits (Folios 3v, , and [...] ). These portraits show a {{reliance on}} the early papyrus scroll tradition of manuscript portraits. They are inserted into the <b>text</b> <b>column</b> within a frame. The portraits show Vergil sitting on a chair between a lectern and a locked chest. The portrait on folio 3v has the lectern on Vergil's right on the chest on his left, which is reversed {{in the other two}} portraits.|$|E
50|$|Indexes {{can also}} be defined to include one entry for each sub-string of a Text or Long <b>Text</b> <b>column.</b> These indexes are called tuple indexes. They are used to speed queries with sub-string {{matching}} predicates. Tuple indexes can only be defined for Text columns. For example, if a <b>Text</b> <b>column</b> value is “I love JET Blue”, and the index is configured to have a minimum tuple size of 4 characters and a maximum tuple length of 10 characters, then the following sub-strings will be indexed:Even though tuple indexes can be very large, they can significantly speed queries of the form: find all records containing “JET Blue”. They {{can be used for}} sub-strings longer than the maximum tuple length by dividing the search sub-string into maximum tuple length search strings and intersecting the results. They can be used for exact matches for strings as long as the maximum tuple length or as short as the minimum tuple length, with no index intersection. For more information on performing index intersection in ESE see Index Intersection. Tuple indexes cannot speed queries where the search string is shorter than the minimum tuple length.|$|E

50|$|The Cotton Genesis (London, British Library, MS Cotton Otho B VI) is a 4th- or 5th-century Greek Illuminated {{manuscript}} {{copy of the}} Book of Genesis. It was {{a luxury}} manuscript with many miniatures. It {{is one of the}} oldest illustrated biblical codices to survive to the modern period. Most of the manuscript was destroyed in the Cotton library fire in 1731, leaving only eighteen charred, shrunken scraps of vellum. From the remnants, the manuscript appears to have been more than 440 pages with approximately 340-360 illustrations that were framed and inserted into the <b>text</b> <b>column.</b> Many miniatures were also copied in the 17th century and are now in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris (Ms. fr. 9530).|$|E
50|$|There are 76 {{surviving}} {{leaves in}} the manuscript with 50 illustrations. If, as was common practice at the time, the manuscript contained all of the canonical works of Virgil, the manuscript would originally had about 440 leaves and 280 illustrations. The text was written by a single scribe in rustic capitals. As was common at the time, there is no separation between words. The scribe worked first leaving spaces for the illustrations. The illustrations were added by three different painters, all of whom used iconographic copybooks. The illustrations are contained within frames and include landscapes and architectural and other details. The miniatures are set within the <b>text</b> <b>column,</b> although a few miniatures occupy a full page. The human figures are painted in classical style with natural proportions and drawn with vivacity. The illustrations often convey the illusion of depth quite well. The gray ground of the landscapes blend into bands of rose, violet, or blue {{to give the impression}} of a hazy distance. The interior scenes are based on earlier understanding of perspective, but occasional errors suggest that the artists did not fully understand the models used. The style of these miniatures has much in common with the surviving miniatures of the Quedlinburg Itala fragment and have also been compared to the frescos found at Pompeii.|$|E

30|$|On one hand, the {{previous}} qualitative findings are {{confirmed by the}} quantitative table. Nineteen cases in the <b>text</b> <b>column</b> of the multicultural categories have twelve of the cases as textual referents, and they emphasized these referents with ‘pictures’ (multimedia). Thus the texts’ column represented the concrete social policies of the respective agencies, and each policy in the twelve cases is strongly emphasized by the supporting pictures. On the other hand, cases that used ethno-pictorial images ambiguously to portray multiculturalism are in the pictures’ column of the table. Among the eighteen uncategorized cases, where ‘pictures’ are the only referents to portray multiculturalism, there apparent ambiguity is uncovered as their references to liberal multiculturalism might have different meanings in non-liberal welfare regime countries. Hence those on franchise are seemingly used as extension of neo-liberalism to other types of welfare regimes, an apparent process of globalizing the liberal ideology, which would subsequently have multicultural implications. In other words, their usage can be subjected to ambiguous symbolic interpretations {{when there are no}} textual explanations of multiculturalism on their websites, or in their national social policy documents.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{researches}} {{support that}} graphs are relevant decision aids to tasks {{related to the}} interpretation of numerical information. Moreover, literature shows that different types of graphical information can help or harm the accuracy on decision making of accountants and financial analysts. We conducted a 4 × 2 mixed-design experiment {{to examine the effects}} of numerical information disclosure on financial analysts' accuracy, and investigated the role of overconfidence in decision making. Results show that compared to <b>text,</b> <b>column</b> graph enhanced accuracy on decision making, followed by line graphs. No difference was found between table and textual disclosure. Overconfidence harmed accuracy, and both genders behaved overconfidently. Additionally, the type of disclosure (text, table, line graph and column graph) did not affect the overconfidence of individuals, providing evidence that overconfidence is a personal trait. This study makes three contributions. First, it provides evidence from a larger sample size (295) of financial analysts instead of a smaller sample size of students that graphs are relevant decision aids to tasks related to the interpretation of numerical information. Second, it uses the text as a baseline comparison to test how different ways of information disclosure (line and column graphs, and tables) can enhance understandability of information. Third, it brings an internal factor to this process: overconfidence, a personal trait that harms the decision-making process of individuals. At the end of this paper several research paths are highlighted to further study the effect of internal factors (personal traits) on financial analysts' accuracy on decision making regarding numerical information presented in a graphical form. In addition, we offer suggestions concerning some practical implications for professional accountants, auditors, financial analysts and standard setters...|$|E
