5|$|A feature {{coming into}} wide use in modern shortwave {{receivers}} is DSP technology, short for digital signal processing. DSP {{is the use}} of digital means <b>to</b> <b>process</b> signals, and a primary benefit in shortwave receivers is the ability to tailor the bandwidth of the receiver to current reception conditions and to the type of signal being listened to. A typical analog-only receiver may have a limited number of fixed bandwidths, or only one, but a DSP receiver may have 40 or more individually selectable filters.|$|E
5|$|A {{national}} tour began in Cleveland, Ohio, in April 1950; it ran {{for five years}} and starred Richard Eastham as Emile, Janet Blair as Nellie and Ray Walston as Billis, a role Walston would reprise in London and in the 1958 film. For the 48,000 tickets available in Cleveland, 250,000 requests were submitted, causing the box office to close for three weeks <b>to</b> <b>process</b> them. Jeanne Bal and Iva Withers were later Nellies on this tour. A scaled-down version toured military bases in Korea in 1951; by the request of Hammerstein and Rodgers, officers and enlisted soldiers sat together to view it.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every aspect}} of the battle would be managed by the DCDPS at the MAR base. The reason for this {{centralization}} was two-fold; one was that the radar system was extremely complex and expensive and could not be built in large numbers, the second was that the transistor-based computers needed <b>to</b> <b>process</b> the data were likewise very expensive. Nike-X thus relied on a few very expensive sites, and many greatly simplified batteries.|$|E

5|$|An {{interest}} in farming came naturally to William Halliday. Besides teaching, his father, Samuel, farmed successfully in Scotland {{and in the}} United States. Halliday owned a prosperous cotton plantation in Arkansas in addition to several thousand cultivated acres not connected with the model town. The 3500 cultivated acres surrounding the village provided important staples for the town. Forage for the mine mules as well as food for mining families came from company farms. In order <b>to</b> <b>process</b> its own meat, the company operated a slaughterhouse. By using this system the store was able to sell fresh meat at affordable prices.|$|E

5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are <b>to</b> <b>process</b> molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E
5|$|One {{suitable}} {{method for}} purification for the raw platinum, which contains platinum, gold, {{and the other}} platinum-group metals, is <b>to</b> <b>process</b> it with aqua regia, in which palladium, gold and platinum are dissolved, whereas osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium stay unreacted. The gold is precipitated {{by the addition of}} iron(II) chloride and after filtering off the gold, the platinum is precipitated as ammonium chloroplatinate by the addition of ammonium chloride. Ammonium chloroplatinate can be converted to platinum by heating. Unprecipitated hexachloroplatinate(IV) may be reduced with elemental zinc, and a similar method is suitable for small scale recovery of platinum from laboratory residues. Mining and refining platinum has environmental impacts.|$|E

5|$|Scarborough's {{drinking}} water is {{supplied by the}} R.C. Harris Filtration Plant {{at the foot of}} Victoria Park Avenue and the F.J. Horgan Filtration Plant.
