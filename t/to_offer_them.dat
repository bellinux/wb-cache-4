5|$|On 8 January 1999, Pakistan's Judicial Commission held {{a hearing}} in Melbourne into bribery and match-fixing. The {{commission}} had originally summoned Waugh and Warne to Pakistan but the ACB instead decided <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them</b> court privileges in Australia. Both Warne and Waugh gave evidence at the public hearing. Waugh seemed nervous and uncertain, whereas Warne appeared assured and confident. They were questioned for approximately 80 and 45 minutes respectively. The Pakistani investigators attempted to link the Australians' dealings with John to various games between Pakistan and Australia in 1994, over which they had suspicions of match-fixing.|$|E
5|$|When Sodh was {{twenty-two years}} old, he was ordained at Wat Songpinong in his {{hometown}} and was given the Pāli language monastic name Candasaro. Phra (phra meaning 'monk, venerable') Candasaro studied both under masters of the oral meditation tradition as well as experts in scriptural analysis, which was uncommon during that period. In his autobiographical notes, he wrote that he practiced meditation every day, {{from the first day}} following his ordination. In his first years as a monk, he had difficulty obtaining food on traditional alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for laypeople <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them</b> food. This hardship led him to resolve that he would one day built a kitchen for monastics, who would then enjoy convenience in the spiritual life. After his third rainy season (third year after monk's ordination), Phra Candasaro traveled far and wide in Thailand to study scriptures and meditation practice with teachers from established traditions. He learnt about a broad range of things, and was in the habit of respecting all spiritual things. He studied scriptures at Wat Pho and learnt about meditation at eight centers, among which Wat Ratchasittharam. At Wat Ratchasittharam he studied a visualization meditation method with Luang Por Aium, and experienced a development in meditation regarded as important, when he perceived a sphere of light. Buddhist Studies scholars Kate Crosby and Catherine Newell believe Wat Ratchasittharam to be crucial in Luang Pu Sodh's development of Dhammakaya meditation.|$|E

When the Turko-German Niedermayer-Hentig expedition was welcomed to Kabul in 1915 (despite promises to the Viceroy of India that the expedition would be arrested), Nasrullah provided a friendly ear to the mission after Habibullah reaffirmed Afghanistan's neutrality. Nasrullah was involved in introducing the expedition to journalist Mahmud Tarzi, whose papers began taking an increasingly anti-British stance. He also continued to entreat the mission to remain in Kabul despite Habibullah's unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them</b> a solid alliance. Finally in 1916 Nasrullah offered to remove Habibullah from power and {{take charge of the}} frontier tribes in a campaign against British India, but by then the mission realised such action would be fruitless and declined.|$|E

25|$|Two Athenians, Theseus and Pirithous, {{thought that}} {{since they were}} both sons of gods, both of them should have divine wives; they thus pledged {{to help each other}} abduct two daughters of Zeus. Theseus chose Helen, and Pirithous vowed to marry Persephone, the wife of Hades. Theseus took Helen and left her with his mother Aethra or his {{associate}} Aphidnus at Aphidnae or Athens. Theseus and Pirithous then traveled to the underworld, the domain of Hades, to kidnap Persephone. Hades pretended <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them</b> hospitality and set a feast, but, as soon as the pair sat down, snakes coiled around their feet and held them there. Helen's abduction caused an invasion of Athens by Castor and Pollux, who captured Aethra in revenge, and returned their sister to Sparta.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, Lowe {{believed}} {{that in order}} to keep control of his company, he had to always own a majority of its stock, but from nearly the beginning, he began offering shares of voting stock to his officers. Later, when the first major cash crisis moved him to approach his employees with the problem, and <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them</b> a chance to invest in the company, the stock they received had no voting rights connected to it. In the early 1960s, Lowe began to offer more and more voting stock to his officers and to depend on their participation in major decisions. In 1964, as Jack Lowe Jr. entered the company, Lowe Sr. gave up his controlling ownership position. Still, he remained the dominant force in the company. In 1978, {{the decision was made to}} extend voting rights to all company stock on a one-share, one-vote basis. Texas Distributor’s stock plan was designed so that it benefitted most those who had been with the company the longest and who held the greatest responsibility.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{purports to}} be a memoir written in 1900 by Kwasi Boachi, {{one of two}} Ashanti princes taken from their {{homeland}} to the Netherlands in 1837 to receive a Christian education. It is mostly based on historical fact, and set partly in the nineteenth-century Dutch Gold Coast. Kwasi and his fellow Ashanti prince Kwame Poku are pestered at their school in Delft and attract a measure of attention from the royal court, which views the boys as curiosities and, while favoring them for the while, fails <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them</b> continued support. Kwasi and Kwame grow apart; Kwasi chooses to assimilate himself into Dutch culture and deny his African background, while Kwame is unable to adapt to his new environment. He returns to Africa, but finds himself an outcast there as he has by now forgotten his native language; no longer accepted by his own people, whom he never sees again. Almost three years are spent waiting in Fort Elmina for permission {{to return to his}} people while he slowly appears to sink into delusion, then commits suicide. Meanwhile, Kwasi attempts to seek his fortune in the Dutch East Indies but fails, owing in part to the prevalence of racism and a personal grudge held by one of his former classmates, who is his superior in the East Indies.|$|E

500|$|Although {{practitioners}} typically {{live within}} Christian majority societies, they often express {{the view that}} Christianity has little <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them.</b> In referring to Heathens in the U.S., Snook, Thad Horrell, and Kristen Horton noted that practitioners [...] "almost always formulate oppositional identities" [...] to Christianity. Through her research, Schnurbein found that during the 1980s many Heathens had been motivated to join the religion in part by their own anti-Christian ethos, but that this attitude had become less prominent among the Heathen community as {{the significance of the}} Christian churches had declined in Western nations after that point. Many Heathens are also involved in historical reenactment, focusing on the early medieval societies of Germanic Europe, although others are critical of this practice, believing that it blurs the boundary between life and fantasy. Some Heathens also practice other Pagan religions as well, such as Wicca or Druidry.|$|E

[...] High replies that it is true there are a pretty large number of men there, adding many more have yet to arrive, yet that [...] "there will seem too few when the wolf comes." [...] However, High adds that food is not a problem because there will never be too many people in Valhalla that the meat of Sæhrímnir (which he calls a boar) cannot sufficiently feed. High says that Sæhrímnir is cooked every day by the cook Andhrímnir in the pot Eldhrimnir, and is again whole every evening. High then quotes the stanza of Grímnismál mentioning the cook, meal, and container in reference.|$|E
500|$|In May 2008, it was {{announced}} that the hotel intended to work directly with Wareing rather than through Gordon Ramsay Holdings, as the lease on Pétrus' location inside the Berkeley Hotel was due to lapse in September 2008. This deal resulted in a public war of words between Wareing and Ramsay, with Wareing opening his restaurant Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley in the space previously occupied by Pétrus, and Ramsay's holding company retaining the rights to the Pétrus name. Wareing described his new venture as being a renaming of Pétrus. Originally it was expected that the name would be transferred to another restaurant already held by the company. A spokesperson for the Michelin Guide stated that Pétrus' Michelin stars would stay with the property, expecting [...] "that things will change very little" [...] when it was reviewed for the 2009 guide. Before Pétrus closed at The Berkeley to be rebranded, all of the potential customers in the reservations book were contacted to say that their reservations had been cancelled and <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them</b> a place at another Ramsay restaurant.|$|E

500|$|Some {{children}} {{were trained in}} skills valuable to the area. [...] In Shrewsbury, the boys {{were placed in the}} workhouse's workshop, while girls were tasked with spinning, making gloves and other jobs [...] "suited to their sex, their ages and abilities". [...] At St Martin in the Fields, {{children were}} trained in spinning flax, picking hair and carding wool, before being placed as apprentices. [...] Workhouses also had links with local industry; in Nottingham, children employed in a cotton mill earned about £60 a year for the workhouse. [...] Some parishes advertised for apprenticeships, and were willing to pay any employer prepared <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Such agreements were preferable to supporting children in the workhouse: apprenticed children were not subject to inspection by justices, thereby lowering the chance of punishment for neglect; and apprenticeships were viewed as a better long-term method of teaching skills to children who might otherwise be uninterested in work. [...] Supporting an apprenticed child was also considerably cheaper than the workhouse or outdoor relief. [...] Children often had no say in the matter, which could be arranged without the permission or knowledge of their parents. [...] The supply of labour from workhouse to factory, which remained popular until the 1830s, was sometimes viewed as a form of transportation. [...] While getting parish apprentices from Clerkenwell, Samuel Oldknow's agent reported how some parents came [...] "crying to beg they may have their Children out again". [...] Historian Arthur Redford suggests that the poor may have once shunned factories as [...] "an insidious sort of workhouse".|$|E
500|$|Adam Levine was {{introduced}} to Ryan Dusick by a mutual friend and guitarist, Adam Salzman. Levine was 15 years old and Dusick was 16. Three of the {{five members of the}} band started playing together at age 12. The four original members of the band met while attending Brentwood EMH School in Los Angeles. While attending Brentwood EMH School, Adam Levine and Jesse Carmichael joined up with Mickey Madden and Ryan Dusick to form Kara's Flowers, a rock band. The name was taken from a girl that went to their high school that the band had a [...] "collective crush" [...] on. In 1997, when the band was playing at a beach party in Malibu, independent producer Tommy Allen heard them play and offered to manage them and record a complete record with his partner, songwriter John DeNicola, who is known for his work on Dirty Dancingincluding [...] "(I've Had) The Time of My Life". Producer Rob Cavallo's management team heard the record Allen and DeNicola produced, which eventually led Cavallo <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them</b> a deal with Reprise Records, re-recording the album. However, after the release of The Fourth World, during Levine and Madden's {{senior year of high school}} in 1997, it had morphed into a band with a style reminiscent of 1960s Britpop. Despite high expectations from the band and record company, the album failed to catch on and their lead single, [...] "Soap Disco", was a failure. According to Levine, the failure of the album was [...] "a huge disappointment" [...] that nearly led them to break up. The album sold around 5,000 copies and the band was dropped after six months in early 1998.|$|E
500|$|The show's {{directors}} {{were attached to}} locations instead of episodes and with several countries appearing in every episode, in reality none of them has a singular director. During the first season the Wachowskis were responsible for directorial duties in scenes shot in Chicago and San Francisco along with London and Iceland, two places which were initially announced to be helmed by Straczynski. Straczynski eventually opted <b>to</b> <b>offer</b> <b>them</b> to the siblings because of the extensive action scenes involved in those locations and instead focused his energy on post-production. James McTeigue (V for Vendetta, Ninja Assassin) worked on the Mexico City and Mumbai parts along with some in Reykjavík and German director Tom Tykwer (Cloud Atlas), whose Nairobi Half Life production impressed the Wachowskis, helmed Berlin and Nairobi. Dan Glass, {{who had been the}} visual effects supervisor for every Wachowski film since The Matrix Reloaded, reprised his role in Sense8 while also making his directorial debut in the Seoul part of the story. Even though there were times that units located in different countries were simultaneously shooting, the Wachowskis would travel to the various locations and have collaborations with the attached directors. Reportedly the Wachowskis directed such segments in locations where a different director was otherwise attached as the stunts the character of Silvestre performed for his action movie in Mexico City and in Nairobi car chase scenes with the [...] "Van Damn" [...] bus along with a fight scene involving machetes. In total, the Wachowskis were credited for directing seven episodes, McTeigue and Tykwer two each, and Glass one. During filming of the first season of Sense8 the Wachowskis were shooting ten to fifteen pages a day, which was much faster than the two to three pages a day pace they were used to on the typical large budget film. They commented it put {{a lot of pressure on}} them, but Lilly also called it exciting learning how to adapt to it. Tykwer said he had to be moving at a pace of completing seven minutes per day, which he similarly found highly unusual coming from the world of film.|$|E
