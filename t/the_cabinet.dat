5|$|The Constitution {{defines the}} Government of Singapore as the President and <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> of Singapore. The {{executive}} authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him or by <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> of Singapore or any Minister authorized by <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet.</b> However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial {{role in the}} executive branch of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> and Parliament of Singapore, he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> or of a Minister acting under the general authority of <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet.</b> It is <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> that has the general direction and control of the Government. As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet.</b> At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> that outlines what <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> intends to achieve in the session.|$|E

5|$|The Executive {{branch of}} Japan {{is headed by}} the Prime Minister.

Explicitly defined to be the source of executive power, it is in practice, however, mainly exercised by the Prime Minister. The practice of its powers is responsible to the Diet, and as a whole, should <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> lose confidence and support to be in office by the Diet, the Diet may dismiss <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> en masse with a motion of no confidence.|$|E
5|$|The Government of Singapore {{is defined}} by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore to mean the Executive branch of government, which is made up of the President and <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> of Singapore.

It is <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> composed of the Prime Minister and other Ministers appointed on his advice by the President, that generally directs and controls the Government. <b>The</b> <b>Cabinet</b> is formed by the political party that gains a simple majority in each general election.|$|E

5|$|The McMahon {{government}} had consisted of 27ministers, twelve of whom comprised <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet.</b> In {{the run-up to}} the election, the Labor caucus had decided that should the party take power, all 27ministers were to be Cabinet members.

To give himself greater control over <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet,</b> in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees (with the members appointed by himself, not the caucus) and took full control of <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> agenda.|$|E
5|$|The Ministries of Japan (行政機関) {{consist of}} eleven {{ministries}} and <b>the</b> <b>Cabinet</b> Office.
