Allie Reynolds of the Yankees was tough, and I might <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> for 24 hours before a game, but Robert Feller: I'd <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> for three days."

2500|$|Japanese Metabolist architects {{produced}} a manifesto in 1960 which outlined goals to [...] "encourage active metabolic development of our society" [...] through design and technology.

2500|$|Between 1983 and 1986, Landy charged about $430,000 annually. When he {{requested}} more money, Carl Wilson {{was obliged to}} give away a quarter of Brian's publishing royalties. In 1988, Wilson said that [...] "Dr. Landy doesn't like {{me to be in}} touch with my family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." [...] Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're a far cry from friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other. We're just Beach Boys, but we don't need to be friends.' And that's true. Although, whenever I <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>him,</b> I feel rotten." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shakespeare's sonnet cycle has {{overarching}} {{themes of}} great {{love and the}} passage of time. In this sonnet, the speaker is now concentrating on his own death and how the youth is to mourn him after he is deceased. The speaker tells the youth not to mourn {{for him when he}} is dead, and that the youth should only <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>him</b> {{for as long as it}} takes to tell the world of his death. The speaker then tells his beloved youth that if even reading this sonnet will cause him to suffer, he should forget the hand that wrote the poem. Joseph Pequigney writes that the sonnet is a [...] "persuasive appeal to be recalled, loved and lamented…a covert counterthesis". Stephen Booth calls this sonnet [...] "a cosmic caricature of a revenging lover." [...] While many critics agree with Peguiney and Booth, and have said that this sonnet is a veiled attempt on the part of the speaker to actually invoke the youth to mourn him, some critics believe differently. Helen Vendler writes that [...] "There are also, I believe, sonnets of hapless love--intended as such by the author, expressed as such by the speaker." ...|$|E
