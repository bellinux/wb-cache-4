2500|$|Stating that [...] "children {{need two}} parents" [...] and that [...] "children have a {{fundamental}} human {{right to an}} opportunity and relationship with both their mother and father", members of the fathers' rights movement call for greater equality in parental responsibility following separation and divorce. They call for laws creating a rebuttable presumption of 50/50 shared custody after divorce or separation, so that children would spend equal time with each parent unless there were reasons against it. They point to studies showing that children in shared custody settings are better adjusted and have fewer social problems such as low academic achievement, crime, pregnancy, substance abuse, depression and suicide, and state that shared parenting is in fact {{in the best interests}} of the child. Warren Farrell states that for children, equally shared parenting with three conditions (the child has about equal time with mom and dad, the parents live close enough to each other that the child does not need to forfeit friends or activities when visiting the other parent, and there is no bad-mouthing) is the second best family arrangement to the intact <b>two-parent</b> <b>family,</b> followed by primary father custody and then primary mother custody, and he adds that if shared parenting cannot be agreed upon, children on average are better off psychologically, socially, academically, and physically, have higher levels of empathy and assertiveness, and lower levels of ADHD, if their father is their primary custodial parent rather than their mother.|$|E

Then in subsequent generations the sons retain the patrilineal half of this double surname when they marry, dropping the matrilineal half, and the daughters do the reverse, retaining the matrilineal half and dropping the patrilineal half.|$|E
50|$|In The Communist Manifesto of 1848 Karl Marx {{describes}} how the bourgeois or monogamous <b>two-parent</b> <b>family</b> has as its foundation capital and private gain. Marx {{also pointed out that}} this family existed only in its full form among the bourgeoisie or upper classes, and was nearly absent among the exploited proletariat or working class. He felt that the vanishment of capital would also result in the vanishment of the monogamous marriage, and the exploitation of the working class. He explains how family ties among the proletarians are divided by the capitalist system, and their children are used simply as instruments of labour. This is partly due to child labour laws being less strict at the time in Western society. In Marx's view, the bourgeois husband sees his wife as an instrument of labour, and therefore to be exploited, as instruments of production (or labour) exist under capitalism for this purpose.|$|E

In his chapter [...] "The Monogamous Family", Engels traces monogamous marriage back to the Greeks, who viewed the practice's sole aim as making [...] "the man supreme in the family, and to propagate, as the future heirs to his wealth, children indisputably his own". He felt that the monogamous marriage made explicit the subjugation of one sex by the other throughout history, and that the first division of labour [...] "is that between man and woman for the propagation of children". Engels views the monogamous <b>two-parent</b> <b>family</b> as a microcosm of society, stating [...] "It is the cellular form of civilized society, in which the nature of the oppositions and contradictions fully active in that society can be already studied".|$|E

50|$|Tannen {{highlighted}} the “Telling Your Day” ritual {{that takes place}} in many American families, in which, typically, the mother in a <b>two-parent</b> <b>family</b> encourages a child to share details (about his/her day which the mother has typically already heard about) with the father. She also emphasizes the common occurrence of the “troubles talk” ritual in women. This ritual involves a woman sharing details about “a frustrating experience” or other previously encountered problem with a confidant. She cites this ritual of an example of how, for many women, closeness is established through sharing personal details. As one example of gender-linked misinterpretations, Tannen points out that a man who is {{on the receiving end of}} “troubles talk” from his wife will often take the mention of a problem and how it was handled as an invitation to pass judgment, despite the fact that “troubles talk” is simply an expository experience meant to enhance emotional connections.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, a basic tax-free cash {{allowance}} {{starting at}} £665 {{for children under}} the age of ten provided a considerable amount of support for families living on low incomes, and its combination with direct taxation meant greater support to poor families than in any other country in the EEC. A <b>two-parent</b> <b>family</b> with four dependent children on 66% of average earnings gained an amount after tax and allowances equal to 49.4% of its income compared with 8.2% in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, that same year, INSEE found that at any wage level disposable income per head was still much lower in large families than those with no or very few children, while the cost of bringing up a family weighed particularly heavily on households headed by a low-paid worker. According to one estimate from the early Seventies, using 1500 francs net per month for those in full-time employment 44% of women and 24.5% of men were low paid. The percentage of workers who were low paid was particularly high in personal services such as hairdressing (74%), hotel and catering (60%) and textiles (51%).|$|E

In 2009, according to the US Census Bureau's official definition of poverty, 8.8 million US families were below the poverty line (11.1% of all families). Of these families, 5.19 million, or 58.9%, had at least one person who was classified as working. In the same year, there were 11.7 million unrelated individuals (people who do not live with family members) whose incomes fell below the official poverty line (22% of all unrelated individuals). 3.9 million of these poor individuals, or 33%, were part of the working poor. The cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 for a middle-income, <b>two-parent</b> <b>family</b> averaged $226,920 last year (not including college), according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since the mid- 1990 s, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in early childhood caries (ECC) in Australia and an increase in children living in one-parent families. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether single parenthood (mother only) affects the effectiveness of an oral health promotion programme to prevent ECC in their child. METHODS: First-time mothers were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of anticipatory guidance to prevent ECC. The intervention was applied during pregnancy and when the child was 6 and 12 months old. Mothers in the control group received no intervention. The presence of ECC was assessed at 20 months of age and compared between children from one- and <b>two-parent</b> <b>families.</b> RESULTS: Of 649 women enrolled, 441 brought their child for dental assessment. Eighty-seven (19. 7 %) had a one-parent family. Children from one-parent families had a 2. 3 times higher incidence of ECC than children from <b>two-parent</b> <b>families.</b> The intervention reduced the frequency of ECC from 8. 1 % to 1. 1 % in <b>two-parent</b> <b>families</b> (relative risk: 0. 14) and from 16. 3 % to 4. 5 % (relative risk: 0. 28) in one-parent families. One case of ECC was prevented for every nine single mothers receiving anticipatory guidance compared with one case per 15 partnered mothers. Despite a greater reduction in the absolute risk of ECC in children from one-parent families, the intervention reduced their ECC experience only 3. 5 -fold compared with sevenfold in children from <b>two-parent</b> <b>families.</b> CONCLUSION: The intervention produced a greater reduction in the frequency of ECC in children from one-parent families than in those from <b>two-parent</b> <b>families.</b> This did not reduce their disadvantage, though, as they still had a four times higher risk than children from <b>two-parent</b> <b>families.</b> Mothers and children in one-parent families need substantially more attention and support than those in <b>two-parent</b> <b>families</b> to eliminate their disadvantage in suffering ECC.

5000|$|The Basic Law {{places at}} its head its {{guarantee}} of inviolable fundamental rights.

In the event particular interests pushed for additional consideration; the Catholic Church (through CDU/CSU representatives) succeeded in inserting protection both for 'Marriage and the Family" [...] and for parental responsibility for children's education; SPD representatives then amended this to protect additionally the rights of children born outside marriage; and Elisabeth Selbert (one of only four women on the 70-strong panel) was eventually successful in a largely lone campaign to gain constitutional protection for gender equality. [...] Notwithstanding this, there was a striking disjunction between the social context of <b>two-parent,</b> <b>family</b> households assumed in the Basic Law, and the everyday reality of German society in 1949; where over half of adult women were unmarried, separated or widowed; where the effective working population was overwhelmingly female; and where millions of expelees, refugees and displaced families were still without permanent accommodation.

5000|$|She then {{considered}} and dismissed the three rationales the DPH offered for its marriage licensing policy: [...] "(1) providing a 'favorable setting for procreation'; (2) ensuring the optimal setting for child rearing, which the department defines as 'a <b>two-parent</b> <b>family</b> with one parent of each sex'; and (3) preserving scarce State and private financial resources." [...] The first, she wrote, incorrectly posits {{that the state}} privileges [...] "procreative heterosexual intercourse between married people". Rather [...] "Fertility is not a condition of marriage, nor is it grounds for divorce. People who have never consummated their marriage, and never plan to, may be and stay married." [...] The misconception that [...] "'marriage is procreation'", she wrote, [...] "confers an official stamp of approval on the destructive stereotype that same-sex relationships are inherently unstable and inferior to opposite-sex relationships and are not worthy of respect." [...] The second, the marriage {{of a man and}} a woman as the [...] "optimal setting for child rearing", a claim she said many Massachusetts statutes and the notion of [...] "the best interests of the child" [...] refuted, she found irrelevant, in that denying marriage licenses to one class of persons does not affect the marriage patterns of the other class. She turned the argument against the DPH: [...] "the task of child rearing for same-sex couples is made infinitely harder by their status as outliers to the marriage laws."
