40|$|SCIENTIFIC OPINION Scientific Opinion on {{the safety}} and {{efficacy}} of Lactobacillus buchneri (DSM 22963) as a silage additive for all species 1 EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) 2, 3 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Parma, Italy Lactobacillus buchneri is a <b>technological</b> <b>additive</b> intended to improve the ensiling process at a proposed dose of 1. 0 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material. The bacterial species L. buchneri is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the Qualified Presumption of Safety approach. As {{the identity of the}} strain has been clearly established and as no antibiotic resistance was detected, the use of the strain in the production of silage is considered safe for livestock species, consumers of products from animals fed the treated silage and for the environment. Evidence of a lack of irritancy was provided for one formulation of the additive. It is unlikely that given the nature of the alternative food grade excipients, different results would be obtained for other formulations containing this strain of L. buchneri. However, the proteinaceous nature of the active agent means its potential to be a skin/respiratory sensitizer cannot be excluded. Five studies with laboratory-scale silos are described, each lasting at least 90 days...|$|E
40|$|Potassium sorbate is {{intended}} {{to be used as a}} <b>technological</b> <b>additive</b> to improve the ensiling process in the range of 90 to 300  mg/kg fresh material. The application of potassium sorbate in the preparation of silage up to the maximum proposed dose of 300  mg/kg forage is safe for the target animals. The additive, when used in silage, is not expected to increase substantially consumer exposure to potassium sorbate. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that potassium sorbate, when used as a silage additive, is safe for consumers of food products from animals fed treated silage. Potassium sorbate is a skin and eye irritant and a potential irritant to the respiratory tract. Potassium sorbate is not regarded as a skin sensitiser. The dusting potential of the preparation tested indicates that exposure of users via inhalation is possible. In view of the irritancy of potassium sorbate and the absence of information on its inhalation toxicity, exposure to such dust is considered hazardous. There are no safety concerns for the environment resulting from the use of potassium sorbate as a silage additive. Seven laboratory-scale ensiling studies were reported, each lasting at least 90 days and using forages of different origins. Once silos were opened, aerobic stability was determined. Potassium sorbate has the potential to improve aerobic stability of silage with dry matter content between 21 and 38 % when used at the minimum concentration of 90  mg/kg fresh material...|$|E
40|$|A {{strain of}} Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is {{intended}} to be added to forages to promote the ensiling process (<b>technological</b> <b>additive,</b> functional group: silage additive). The identity of the strain and its susceptibility to relevant antibiotics has been established. However, the strain produces cyclic lipopeptides which possess potent surfactant activity, known to be involved in food intoxication. Although the strain is intended for use only in the production of silage, as a spore former it will survive the ensiling process and be ingested by target animals. The spores will also survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract of animals and be a potential source of contamination of food of animal origin and of the environment. The greatest risk would be to those handling the product on farm following oral, dermal and respiratory exposure. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that use of the strain in the production of silage presents a hazard to consumers, users and the environment, and potentially also to the target animals. A total of three laboratory experiments with laboratory-scale silos, each lasting at least 90 days, were carried out using samples of forage of differing dry matter and water-soluble carbohydrate content. In each case, replicate silos containing treated forage were compared with identical silos containing the same but untreated forage. The potential of the additive to improve aerobic stability of silages at the proposed dose of 5. 0 x 107 CFU/kg fresh materials was not convincingly demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Enterococcus faecium is a <b>technological</b> <b>additive</b> {{intended}} {{to improve the}} ensiling process at a proposed dose of 1 x 108 CFU/kg fresh material. The strain does not contain marker genes typical of hospital-associated isolates responsible for clinical infections and is susceptible to clinically relevant antibiotics. It is not expected {{that the use of}} E. faecium at the dose proposed would substantially increase the exposure to this species of animals given silage as part of their rations Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel considers that use of this strain in the preparation of silage is safe for the target animals. Since the strain does not belong to the hospital-associated clade and does not express resistance to the antibiotics tested, use of this strain in animal nutrition is not expected to raise concerns for consumers of animal products. The material safety data sheet proposed indicates that preparations containing the strain may cause irritation upon contact with skin and eyes. The dustiness of the preparation tested indicated a potential for users to be exposed via inhalation. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agent, the additive should be considered to have {{the potential to be a}} skin/respiratory sensitiser and treated accordingly. The use of the strain under the conditions proposed is considered safe for the environment. Studies with laboratory-scale silos are described made using three samples of mixed forage of differing water-soluble carbohydrate content and representing material easy, moderately difficult and difficult to ensile. In each case, replicate silos containing treated forage were compared to identical silos containing the same but untreated forage. Because of the very limited responses to treatment in two of the three forage samples tested, the FEEDAP Panel is unable to conclude on the benefit of using the strain of E. faecium as a silage additive for all forage species...|$|E

BAs are generally produced by microbial decarboxylation of amino acids in food products. The most significant BAs occurring in foods are histamine, tyramine, putrescine, cadaverine, tryptamine, 2 -phenylethylamine, spermine, spermidine and agmatine. The importance of preventing the excessive accumulation of BAs in food is related to their impact on human health and food quality. Quality criteria {{in connection with the}} presence of BAs in food and food products are necessary from a toxicological point of view. This is particularly important in fermented foods in which the massive microbial proliferation required for obtaining specific products is often relater with BA accumulation.

The fraction of slag in a large majority of the elements has the same size of 1 mm, and a larger portion of the slag, the size of which is from 2 to 6 mm. Definitely the best way is to remove the copper by means of the component B (with NaCl) and D (with KF 2).

40|$|Operational {{radioactive}} waste is generated during routine operation of NPP. Process waste is mainly generated by treatment {{of water from}} reactor or ancillaries including spent fuel storage pools and some decontamination operations. Typical process wastes of pressurized water reactors (PWR or WWER) are borated water concentrates, whereas typical process wastes of boiling and RBMK type reactors are water concentrates with no boron content. NPP operational wastes are classified as low and intermediate level waste (LILW). NPP operational waste must be solidified {{in order to ensure}} safe conditions of storage and disposal. Currently the most promising solidification method for this waste is the vitrification technology. Vitrification of NPP operational waste is a relative new option being developed for last years. Nevertheless there is already accumulated operational experience on vitrifying low and intermediate level waste in Russian Federation at Moscow SIA ''Radon'' vitrification plant. This plant uses the most advanced type induction high frequency melters that facilitate the melting process and significantly reduce the generation of secondary waste and henceforth the overall cost. The plant was put into operation by the end of 1999. It has three operating cold crucible melters with the overall capacity up to 75 kg/h. The vitrification technology comprises a few stages, starting with evaporation of excess water from liquid {{radioactive waste}}, followed by batch preparation, glass melting, and ending with vitrified waste blocks and some relative small amounts of secondary waste. First of all since the original waste contain as main component water, this water is removed from waste through evaporation. Then the remaining salt concentrate is mixed with necessary <b>technological</b> <b>additives,</b> thus a glass-forming batch is formed. The batch is fed into melters where the glass melting occurs. From here there are two streams: one is the glass melt containing the most part of radioactivity and second is the off gas flow, which contains off gaseous and aerosol airborne. The melt glass is fed into containers, which are slowly cooled in an annealing tunnel furnace to avoid accumulation of mechanical stresses in the glass. Containers with glass are the final processing product containing the overwhelming part of waste contaminants. The second stream from melter is directed to gas purification system, which is a rather complex system taking into account the necessity to remove from off gas not only radionuclides but also the chemical contaminants. Operation of this purification system leads to generation of a small amount of secondary waste. This waste stream slightly contaminated with volatilized radionuclides is recycled in the same technological scheme. As a result only non-radioactive materials are produced. They are either discharged into environment or reused. Based on the experience gained during operation of vitrification plant one can conclude on high efficiency achieved through vitrification method. Another significant argument on vitrifying NPP operational waste is the minimal impact of vitrified radioactive waste onto environment. Solidified waste shall be disposed of into a near surface disposal facility. Waste forms disposed of in a near-surface wet repository eventually come into contact with groundwater. Engineered structures used or designed to prevent or postpone such contact and the subsequent radionuclide release are complex and often too expensive. Vitrification technologies provide waste forms with excellent resistance to corrosion and gave the basic possibility of maximal simplification of engineered barrier systems. The most simple disposal option is to locate the vitrified waste form packages directly into earthen trenches provided the host rock has the necessary sorption and confinement properties. Such an approach will significantly make simpler the disposal facilities thus contributing both to enhancing safety and economic al efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} {{has been}} recently employed in industrial sectors with the fundamental requirement for zero defect parts. <b>Technological</b> developments in <b>additive</b> manufacturing notwithstanding, there {{continues to be}} a scarcity of non-destructive inspection techniques to be exploited during the manufacturing process itself, thus limiting industrial advancements and extensive applications.

Where possible standardised methods for analysis were applied. Samples of 20 commercial mycotoxin binders were collected from various companies. The following mycotoxins were included in the study: aflatoxin B 1, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin A, fumonisins B 1 and B 2, T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins. A binder (or binders combined in a group) was mixed with feed material containing the mycotoxin, and the feed material was analysed. For data evaluation, the mean values were compared by Student’s t-test (an independent two-sample t-test with unequal sample sizes and equal variance). The repeatability standard deviation of each method was used as an estimate of method variability. No significant differences (p¼ 0. 05) in mycotoxin levels between binder-free material and the material containing different binders were found. Further, the possible effects of binder addition in combination with processing (pelletising) on the amount of aflatoxin B 1 determined in feed were studied. Three commercial mycotoxin binders containing hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) as the main component were used in these experiments. Feed samples with and without mycotoxin binders were pelletised with and without steam treatment. After pelletising, materials were analysed for AFB 1.

Potential implications of AM on supply networks are discussed. Tuck et al.

40|$|The global {{occurrence}} of mycotoxins {{is considered to}} be a major risk factor for human and animal health. Contamination of different agricultural commodities with mycotoxins still occurs despite the most strenuous prevention efforts. As a result, mycotoxin contaminated feed can cause serious disorders and diseases in farm animals. A number of approaches, such as physical and chemical detoxification procedures, have been used to counteract mycotoxins. However, only a few of them have practical application. A recent and promising approach to protect animals against the harmful effects of mycotoxin contaminated feed is the use of substances for reduction of the contamination of feed by mycotoxins. These substances, so-called mycotoxin binders (MB), are added to the diet in order to reduce the absorption of mycotoxins from the gastrointestinal tract and their distribution to blood and target organs, thus preventing or reducing mycotoxicosis in livestock. Recently, the use of such substances as <b>technological</b> feed <b>additives</b> has been officially allowed in the European Union. The efficacy of MB appears to depend on the properties of both the binder and the mycotoxin. Depending on their mode of action, these feed additives may act either by binding mycotoxins to their surface (adsorption), or by degrading or transforming them into less toxic metabolites (biotransformation). Biotransformation can be achieved by mycotoxin-degrading enzymes or by microorganisms producing such enzymes. Various inorganic adsorbents, such as hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate, zeolites, bentonites, clays, and activated carbons, have been tested and used as MB. An interesting alternative to inorganic adsorbents for the detoxification of mycotoxins is the use of organic binders, such as yeast cell wall components, synthetic polymers (cholestyramine, polyvinylpyrrolidone), humic substances and dietary fibres. This paper gives an overview of the current knowledge and situation in the field of MB. The most important types of MB, mechanism of their action, and their application as a part of general strategy to counteract mycotoxins are described in this review. Recent advances in the use and study of MB, as well as data of their in vitro and in vivo effectiveness are given. Problems, potential, current trends and perspectives associated with the use of MB are discussed as well in the review. JRC. D. 6 -Food Safety and Qualit...|$|R
40|$|In {{a postmodern}} world where mass {{customization}} of products {{is a key}} driver of modern manufacturing systems design, the quick and accurate shaping of metallic shapes has acquired significant importance in key frontiers of <b>technological</b> developments. While <b>additive</b> manufacturing techniques have bridged the gap in terms of rapid manufacture of certain products, the possibility of flexible and rapid manufacture of sheet metal products {{on the other hand}} has been supported by the developments in incremental sheet deformation techniques. Specifically, single point incremental sheet forming or SPIF has come forward as a potential industrial technology of the future that can help shape sheet metal {{with the help of a}} tool and without any supporting dies, that can deform a sheet incrementally by following a defined toolpath. This toolpath, in turn, can be generated with a CAD/CAM software, for a given part geometry. The single point incremental sheet forming process comes with a number of limitations, which hinder its implementation in industry. Specifically, the process was characterized by material and process parameter specific forming limits and low accuracy at the outset of this research. The existing state of the art in incremental forming proposed a feature-based accuracy improvement system based on a broad classification of part features into planes, ruled features, freeform features and ribs. However, such a classification was not refined enough to produce accurate parts consistently and within specified tolerances. To overcome low forming limits, a laser-based dynamic heating system is available. Besides, formability can be improved by using multi-step toolpaths where a part is formed in steps starting with a part with wall angles lower than the final part and increasing the wall angles in subsequent steps. While both techniques result in improved formability, there are certain drawbacks in these techniques which need to be overcome. While the dynamic heating system can extend forming limits of specific materials, multi-step toolpaths can lead to high processing times, and non-uniform bottom surfaces. In this research, steps were taken to improve upon the existing state of the art in the incremental sheet forming process using an experimental campaign on study of behavior of part features, in-process digital image correlation (DIC) studies and developing advanced process planning tools for generating optimized toolpaths that helped improve upon the drawbacks existing at the start of the research. Specifically, to improve on the accuracy, a detailed taxonomy of 33 sheet metal feature types was created. A matrix of interactions between features was generated based on experimental studies on interactions. These details were captured in a process planning system developed in Visual C# as a continuation of previous work done in the research group, to detect and identify the features, and join the features in a network creating conceptual graphs that captures all the different interactions between features based on neighborhoodrelations. Based on this network, toolpath strategies can be selected from a database of ranked toolpath strategies, and used to generate optimized toolpaths, by sequencing and integrating partial toolpaths into continuous toolpaths. A number of case studies were conducted on parts with maximum dimensions determined by the size of the machine tool setup (180 mm x 180 mm blank size) showing average absolute deviations less than 0. 5 mm. Besides, in a number of test cases where uncompensated toolpaths result in maximum deviations larger than 4 mm, the maximum deviations were reduced to less than 1 mm using the optimized strategies. In addition, a number of toolpath strategies based on mathematical compensation techniques using multivariate adaptive response splines (MARS) based predictions, systematic multi step mesh morphing, location specific toolpaths, intelligent offsetting and bottom pre-forming were explored. Using a digital image correlation based measurement set up in collaboration with researchers from the Vrije Universiteit Brussels (VUB), the effect of material properties on the accuracy response surfaces was studied, and generic error correction functions based on material, thickness and size were proposed to improve the accuracy of parts. In order to address the second issue of forming limits, a new system was developed based on the observation of higher ductility limits at low temperatures. In this setup, an in-process cryogenic fluid was used to locally chill down the sheet material to temperatures below - 100 °C, which led to a limited increase in formability limits for aluminium alloys AA 1050, AA 3103 and AA 5754. Test cases showing this improvement were conducted. To illustrate the achievements of the above improvements in the course of the current research, a number of different applications of incremental forming were selectively undertaken as case studies. Few of these applications include a thin sheet die manufacture, a 3 D human face mask manufacture, cranial implant manufacture, and airfoils for aerospace applications, using different sheet materials such as aluminium alloys (AA 1050, AA 3103, AA 5754), low carbon steel alloy DC 01, Titanium grade 2 and stainless steel (AISI 304), where improvements in both accuracy and formability were illustrated.
