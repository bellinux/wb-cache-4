5|$|A Penrose tiling is {{an example}} of non-periodic tiling {{generated}} by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Penrose tilings are named after mathematician and physicist Sir Roger Penrose, who investigated these sets in the 1970s. The aperiodicity of prototiles implies that a shifted copy of a tiling will never match the original. A Penrose tiling may be constructed so as <b>to</b> <b>exhibit</b> both reflection symmetry and fivefold rotational symmetry, as in the diagram at the right.|$|E
5|$|Coins of Ezana {{without any}} symbol at all {{have also been}} found, along with similar symboless coins of his father, Ousanas.
