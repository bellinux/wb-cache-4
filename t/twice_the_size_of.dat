Montfort, facing such unfavourable numbers, decided to concentrate his forces on {{the centre of the}} enemy’s front, hoping to drive a wedge through the line. Though the tactics were initially successful, the baronial forces soon lost the initiative, especially as the Welsh infantry provided by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd had proved unreliable, and deserted at an early point.

40|$|Software Testing is {{the most}} used {{technique}} for software verification in industry. In the case of safety critical software, the test set can be required to cover a high percentage (up to 100 %) of the software code according to some metrics. Unfortunately, attaining such high percentages is not easy using standard automatic tools for tests generation, and manual generation by domain experts is often necessary, thereby significantly increasing the associated costs. In previous papers, we have shown {{how it is possible}} to automatize the test generation process of C programs via the bounded model checker CBMC. In particular, we have shown how it is possible to productively use CBMC for the automatic generation of test sets covering 100 % of branches of 5 modules of ERTMS/ETCS, a safety critical industrial software by Ansaldo STS. Unfortunately, the test set we automatically generated, is of lower “quality ” if compared to the test set manually generated by domain experts: Both test sets attained the desired 100 % branch coverage, but <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automatically generated test sets are roughly <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding manually generated ones.

5|$|Both {{species of}} Knoetschkesuchus {{have only two}} {{distinct}} types of teeth, uniquely among atoposaurids. Other atoposaurids have a third type of leaf-shaped teeth. The first type of teeth, found {{near the front of}} the jaw, are conical, slightly constricted at the base, and curved slightly inwards. A subtype is represented by the canine-like or pseudocaniniform teeth. They are the fourth and fifth maxillary teeth, and are enlarged (about <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the other maxillary teeth), more pointed, and more constricted at the base. The second type of teeth, which constitutes the rest of the teeth, are shaped like thin lanceheads, with a wide base and a narrower tip; in K. guimarotae all of the tips are sharp, but in K. langenbergensis they gradually become blunter.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{a two-year}} project {{to rebuild the}} {{property}} above the shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, {{carried out by the}} architects Maguire & Co., the bottom floor was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior Common Room (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students. The new JCR, about <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms.

5|$|It was {{immediately}} {{agreed that the}} 1941 season of Proms should {{be held at the}} Albert Hall. It was <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> the Queen's Hall, with poor acoustics, but a six-week series was judged a success, and the Albert Hall remained the home of the Proms. Wood, aged seventy-two, was persuaded to have an associate conductor to relieve him of some of the burden. Basil Cameron undertook the task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement, aged eighty, in 1964. The BBC brought its symphony orchestra back to London and resumed its backing of the Proms in 1942; Boult joined Cameron as Wood's associate conductor during that season. In early 1943, Wood's health deteriorated, and two days after the start of that year's season, he collapsed and was ordered to have a month in bed. Despite wartime vicissitudes, the 1943 season sold nearly 250,000 tickets, with an average audience of about 4,000 – many more than could have fitted into the Queen's Hall.|$|E

The builders {{in the second phase}} also reinforced al-Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high-quality mortar. In the third phase, higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the ground-level chamber of the northwestern bastion. The external walls of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase, though there would be further restorations in later decades.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays it is {{possible}} to prepare very sharp emitters, including emitters that end in a single atom.

5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost <b>twice</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not only is there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E

The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath, although it has been renamed in recent years.|$|E

40|$|The genomic {{structure}} and composition of an avian metapneumovirus (aMPV) recently isolated from wild Canada geese (goose 15 a/ 01) in the United States, together with its replication, virulence, and immunogenicity in domestic turkeys, were investigated. <b>The</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> seven <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eight genes, sequence identity, and genome organization of goose aMPV {{were similar to those}} of turkey aMPV subtype C (aMPV/C) strains, indicating that it belonged to the subtype.

The large G gene resulted from a 1, 015 -nucleotide insertion at 18 nucleotides upstream of the termination signal of the turkey aMPV/C G gene. Three other aMPV isolates from Canada geese had similarly large G genes, whereas analysis of recent aMPV strains circulating in U. S. turkeys did not indicate the presence of the goose virus-like strain. In vitro, the goose virus replicated to levels (2 × 105 to 5 × 105 50 % tissue culture infective dose) comparable to those produced by turkey aMPV/C strains. More importantly, the virus replicated efficiently in the upper respiratory tract of domestic turkeys but with no clinical signs in either day-old or 2 -week-old turkeys. The virus was also horizontally transmitted to naïve birds, and turkey infections with goose 15 a/ 01 induced production of aMPV-specific antibodies. Challenging day-old or 2 -week-old turkeys vaccinated with live goose aMPV resulted in lower clinical scores in 33 % of the birds, whereas the rest of the birds had no detectable clinical signs of the upper respiratory disease, suggesting that the mutant virus may be a safe and effective vaccine against aMPV infection outbreaks in commercial turkeys...|$|R
