First it uses the theory of elasticity to create the force deformation model of slot with regular shape, and analysis the deformation of the slot numerically. Then <b>draws</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the elastic deformation and the radius of the bore and the arm’s length while the force is not change, and comes an ideal shape of the bore through this relationship. It also simulates the deformation of fixture with different number of modified slots through the finite element analysis method, and optimizes the fixture for equal strength further. In summary it comes to meet the requirements of fixture theoretically. Finally through experiments the theory gets verified. From the results of experiments the conclusion can be <b>drawn</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>corrected</b> fixture is better than before...|$|R

All languages have multiple meanings of words or phrases depending on the context of their usage.

In this paper a preliminary attempt has been made towards the formulation and design of MRD in Punjabi Language using modified Lesk Algorithm which uses a simple method for relating the appropriate word sense relative to set of dictionary meanings of the word or phrase. 1...|$|R
