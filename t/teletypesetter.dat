25|$|Some {{linotype}} machines {{included a}} paper tape reader. This allowed {{the text to}} be typeset to be supplied over a telegraph line (<b>TeleTypeSetter).</b> It also allowed for several tape perforator operators to prepare paper tape to be processed by a single linotype machine, essentially decoupling the typing speed of the operators from the operating speed of the linotype machine.|$|E
5000|$|In 1951 UP {{offered the}} first <b>teletypesetter</b> (TTS) service, {{enabling}} newspapers to automatically set and justify type from wire transmissions.|$|E
50|$|Users {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the limited character set available in Baudot code. Demand for lowercase letters and more punctuation marks led to teleprinters with a 6-bit <b>TeleTypeSetter</b> (TTS) code, and later, 7-bit ASCII code.|$|E
50|$|On {{the eve of}} World War II, the Gazette {{acquired}} one of {{the last}} <b>teletypesetters</b> manufactured. With this machine, the paper could be produced with only two printers; this allowed it to remain in production at a time when Linotype operators were in short supply because of the war.|$|R
50|$|The Teletype Model 20 is an upper/lower case Type Bar Page Printer {{available}} as a receive only machine or a send-receive machine with four rows of keys, using a six-bit code for <b>TeleTypeSetter</b> (TTS) use.|$|E

5000|$|... 7. First {{automatic}} <b>teletypesetter</b> circuits {{to connect}} {{a group of}} newspapers (1942). In the midst of World War II, {{when there was a}} shortage of skilled newspaper employees, the [...] "Palmer Circuit" [...] enabled his six newspapers to pool news items without having to hire additional staff. This idea was thereafter copied by other chains and press associations.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 5-bit Baudot code and the much later seven-bit ASCII code, there was a six-bit code known as the <b>Teletypesetter</b> code (TTS) used by news wire services. It was first demonstrated in 1928 and began to see widespread use in the 1950s. Through the use of [...] "shift in" [...] and [...] "shift out" [...] codes, this six-bit code could represent {{a full set of}} upper and lower case characters, digits, symbols commonly used in newspapers, and limited typesetting instructions such as [...] "flush left" [...] or [...] "center".|$|E
5000|$|Palmer {{used the}} most modern press {{equipment}} and latest technology in his newspaper chain. In 1930, he introduced high speed telegraph service so that readers could obtain more immediate news. In 1942, Palmer established the first automatic <b>teletypesetter</b> circuits to join together a group of newspapers. In the midst of World War II, there was a shortage of workers available for the newspaper business. Palmer designed the [...] "Palmer Circuit" [...] so that his six newspapers could share news without having to hire more staff. This innovation {{was the first of}} its kind in the United States and was copied by other newspaper groups and press associations.|$|E
50|$|Text was {{encoded in}} several ways. The {{earliest}} standard character encoding was Baudot, which {{dates back to}} the nineteenth century and had five holes. The Baudot code was never used in teleprinters. Instead, modifications such as the Murray code (which added carriage return and line feed), Western Union code, International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (ITA 2), and American Teletypewriter code (USTTY), were used. Other standards, such as <b>Teletypesetter</b> (TTS), FIELDATA and Flexowriter, had six holes. In the early 1960s, the American Standards Association led a project to develop a universal code for data processing, which became known as ASCII. This seven-level code was adopted by some teleprinter users, including AT&T (Teletype). Others, such as Telex, stayed with the earlier codes.|$|E
5000|$|The Teletype Model 15 is a Baudot {{code page}} printer; the {{mainstay}} of U.S. military communications in World War II. A reliable, heavy-duty machine with a cast frame. In 1930, Sterling Morton, Howard L. Krum, and Edward E. Kleinschmidt filed an application for a U.S. patent covering the commercial form of the Model 15 page printer. Approximately 200,000 Model 15 teleprinters were built. The Model 15 stands out {{as one of a}} few machines that remained in production for many years, remaining in production until 1963, a total of 33 years of continuous production. The production run was stretched somewhat by World War II â€” the Model 28 was scheduled to replace the Model 15 in the mid-1940s, but Teletype built so many factories to produce the Model 15 during World War II that it was more economical to continue mass production of the Model 15. The Model 15, in its [...] "receive only" [...] configuration with no keyboard, was the classic [...] "news Teletype" [...] until the 1950s, when the news wire services began to move to <b>TeleTypeSetter</b> feeds. Some radio stations still use a recording of the sound of one of these machines as background during news broadcasts.|$|E
