40|$|Target of {{the work}} is to study the Latvian trade sector {{external}} and internal risks, perform risk identification, classification and assessment. In the work are used scientific research methods – analysis and synthesis methods, economic analysis method of enterprises, the special coefficient method and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> ranking method. <b>The</b> authors had studied the Latvian trade sector in the period from 2004 to 2010. In Latvian trade sector from 2004 to 2006 was observed increment of turnover, but from 2007 was observed decline of turnover. In Latvian trade sector is monopolistic competition. Many enterprises offer a market differentiated trade services. Small and medium companies are merging into trade cooperation and chain stores. The authors had studied average financial indexes of the Latvian trade sector enterprises. Average financial <b>risk</b> coefficient <b>of</b> Latvian trade sector enterprises had increased during the period from 2006 to 2009. The authors have created classification of Latvian trade sector economic and financial <b>risks</b> and classification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trade technological process <b>risks.</b> <b>The</b> authors have created the algorithms of classification and assessment of the trade sector enterprises’ <b>risks.</b> <b>The</b> economic <b>risks</b> are <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country’s economic slowdown, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> increment <b>of</b> taxes, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> reduction in consumer’s solvency, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> demand’s instability and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency of credit resources. <b>The</b> financial <b>risks</b> are <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> unpaid credit, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> financial instability, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency <b>of</b> own capital, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> liquidity and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> debtors. <b>The</b> trade technological process <b>risks</b> are <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> organization <b>of</b> selling goods, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> accounting, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ordering goods, <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> acceptance <b>of</b> goods and <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> transportation of goods.

5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce <b>the</b> <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
