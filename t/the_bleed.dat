25|$|When {{used for}} cabin pressurization, <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> {{air from the}} engine must first be cooled (as it exits the {{compressor}} stage at temperatures as high as 250°C) by passing it through an air-to-air heat exchanger cooled by cold outside air. It is then fed to an air cycle machine unit that regulates the temperature and flow of air into the cabin, keeping the environment comfortable.|$|E

(2) No changes in the serum diastase between them were noticed. (3) In the vagostigmin test, <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> from <b>the</b> gastroduodenal artery showed stronger reaction than in the normal dogs.

50|$|Treatment {{is usually}} {{supportive}} as persistent bleeding is uncommon. However cauterization or injection of epinephrine to stop <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> may be undertaken during the index endoscopy procedure. Very rarely embolization {{of the arteries}} supplying the region {{may be required to}} stop <b>the</b> <b>bleeding.</b> If all other methods fail, high gastrostomy can be used to ligate <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> vessel. It is to be noted that the tube {{will not be able to}} stop <b>bleeding</b> as here <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> is arterial and the pressure in the balloon is not sufficient to overcome the arterial pressure.|$|R
25|$|On an earning revision, JSAT {{disclosed}} {{that they had}} confirmed container deformation after Superbird-8 arrived to its launch site. On July 2016, it was published that a May 25 mishap during air transport had delayed the satellite launch by an estimated two years. A dislodged tarpaulin had blocked <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> valve on the satellite container and the spacecraft had suffer from over pressurization damage.|$|E
25|$|Shock waves {{gave rise}} to {{excessive}} boundary layer growth on the front ramp. The boundary layer was removed through the ramp bleed slot and bypassed the subsonic diffuser and engine where it would otherwise have caused excessive duct loss and unacceptable distortion at the engine. Since the ramp bleed slot was in the subsonic diffuser, and downstream of the shock system, changes in flow demanded by the engine would be accommodated with corresponding changes in <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> slot flow without significantly affecting the external shock pattern. Engine flow reductions caused by throttling or shutting down were dealt with by dump door opening.|$|E
25|$|The ported shroud is a {{performance}} enhancement {{that allows the}} compressor to operate at significantly lower flows. It achieves this by forcing a simulation of impeller stall to occur continuously. Allowing some air to escape at this location inhibits the onset of surge and widens the operating range. While peak efficiencies may decrease, high efficiency may be achieved over a greater range of engine speeds. Increases in compressor efficiency result in slightly cooler (more dense) intake air, which improves power. This is a passive structure that is constantly open (in contrast to compressor exhaust blow off valves, which are mechanically or electronically controlled). The ability of the compressor to provide high boost at low rpm may also be increased marginally (because near choke conditions the compressor draws air inward through <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> path). Ported shrouds are used by many turbocharger manufacturers.|$|E

25|$|Death {{in those}} with a GI bleed is more {{commonly}} due to other illnesses (some of which {{may have contributed to}} <b>the</b> <b>bleed,</b> such as cancer or cirrhosis) than the bleeding itself. Of those admitted to a hospital because of a GI bleed, death occurs in about 7%. Despite treatment, re-bleeding occurs in about 7–16% of those with upper GI bleeding. In those with esophageal varices, bleeding occurs in about 5–15% a year and if they have bled once, there is a higher risk of further bleeding within six weeks. Testing and treating H. pylori if found can prevent re-bleeding {{in those with}} peptic ulcers. The benefits versus risks of restarting blood thinners such as aspirin or warfarin and anti-inflammatories such as NSAIDs need to be carefully considered. If aspirin is needed for cardiovascular disease prevention, it is reasonable to restart it within seven days in combination with a PPI for those with nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} issue of Final Crisis, Lois and Perry are caught in an {{explosion}} triggered by Clayface destroying the Daily Planet and Lois is critically injured. In the third issue, it is revealed that only Clark's heat vision is keeping her heart beating. Clark is visited by a mysterious phantom who insists that he must depart Earth immediately {{if he is to}} save his wife's life. The story is continued in the 3D tie-in comic Superman Beyond, where the female Monitor Zillo Valla stops time around Lois, allowing Superman to leave her side for a while, recruiting him and several of his multiversal doppelgangers in a mission to save the entire Multiverse, promising care for Lois. After defeating the dark Monitor Mandrakk, Superman brings back a distilled drop of <b>The</b> <b>Bleed</b> and administers it to Lois through a kiss, restoring her to full health. Lois is later seen in Final Crisis #6, one of the few still free humans.|$|E
25|$|While the USAF {{found the}} B-57A lacking, the photo {{reconnaissance}} RB-57A saw some operational use. First flying in October 1953, RB-57As fully equipped the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw Air Force Base by July 1954. The aircraft were also deployed with USAF squadrons in Germany, France, and Japan. However, operational readiness was {{poor and the}} aircraft suffered from significant production delays because of engine problems. Wright had subcontracted production of J65 engines to Buick, which resulted in slow deliveries and a tendency for engine oil to enter <b>the</b> <b>bleed</b> air system, filling the cockpit with smoke. The problems were ameliorated when Wright took over engine production in 1954. RB-57As also suffered from a high accident rate caused in part by poor single-engine handling. This resulted in the entire fleet spending much of 1955 on the ground. By 1958, all RB-57A craft were replaced in active service by the Douglas RB-66B and McDonnell RF-101A. Air National Guard units extensively used the RB-57A for photographic surveys of the United States until 1971.|$|E
5000|$|The {{formation}} of a TIF is a medical emergency and requires immediate intervention. Blood volume control, management of the hemorrhage, and adequate oxygenation should be insured in these patients. In a majority of TIF cases (85%), hyperinflation of the tracheostomy cuff will control <b>the</b> <b>bleeding,</b> while <b>the</b> patient is prepared for surgery. However, if this fails the tracheostomy cuff must be removed, and the patient must be intubated from above. Next, pressure from the index finger can be applied on <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> site from within the tracheostomy to control <b>the</b> <b>bleeding.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> [...] "Utley Maneuver", which involves digital compression of the artery against the posterior wall of the manubrium of the sternum following a right infraclavicular incision, {{may be used to}} urgently control <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> When <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> is controlled <b>the</b> patient should be immediately transferred on the operating room.|$|R

500|$|Esophageal varices {{often do}} not have {{symptoms}} until they rupture. A ruptured varix is considered a medical emergency, because varices can bleed a lot.

Matt Walker played drums in the August 22 concert in Chicago because Vig had to depart for his mother's funeral. After being initially organized low-key, the tour was moved into large venues when Bleed Like Me and its lead single [...] "Why Do You Love Me" [...] became surprise hits outside the U.S. In September, the band canceled concerts planned for the following month in Europe, and released a press statement saying that the band members had overextended themselves.

50|$|The {{cause of}} <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> {{can often be}} discerned {{on the basis of}} <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> history, {{physical}} examination, and other medical tests as appropriate. The physical examination for evaluating vaginal bleeding typically includes visualization of the cervix with a speculum, a bimanual exam, and a rectovaginal exam. These are focused on finding the source of <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> and looking for any abnormalities that could cause <b>bleeding.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> abdomen is examined and palpated to ascertain if <b>the</b> <b>bleeding</b> is abdominal in origin. Typically a pregnancy test is performed as well. If bleeding was excessive or prolonged, a CBC may be useful to check for anemia. Abnormal endometrium may have to be investigated by a hysteroscopy with a biopsy or a dilation and curettage.|$|R
