5|$|After {{the story}} is printed, the {{neighborhood}} learns of Mac's past, and members of a local country–western band visit him to show <b>their</b> <b>respect.</b> Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves {{in the middle of}} the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).|$|E
5|$|Raúl Alfonsín was the {{president}} of Argentina from 1983 to 1989. He died on March 31, 2009, aged 82. He had lung cancer and died at his home; a massive candlelight vigil took place in the vicinity of it. Vice president Julio Cobos, the acting president at the time, arranged three days of national mourning and a state funeral at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Alfonsín was seen by 40,000 people and the senior politicians of the country; people from other countries also voiced <b>their</b> <b>respect</b> for him. A military escort took his coffin to the La Recoleta Cemetery, and left him at the pantheon for the veterans of the Revolution of the Park.|$|E
5|$|During Persson's time as {{chairman}} Malmö FF employed their first foreign managers and won their first national titles. In total Persson employed 15 managers, seven {{of whom were}} foreign born. Malmö FF won Allsvenskan and became Swedish champions {{for the first time}} in 1944, and by the end of the 1970s had won nine Swedish league championships. Most of the titles won during this time were under foreign managers, the most successful of whom in terms of honours was Bob Houghton, whom Persson appointed in 1974. Persson was reportedly initially hesitant to employ Houghton, who at 27 was younger than several of the club's players, but was convinced when the Englishman met them and won <b>their</b> <b>respect</b> and confidence. Houghton had never met any of the players, but had researched them thoroughly; he impressed the team by immediately recognising each of them and knowing them by first name. There was also some initial disagreement between Persson and Houghton as Persson had been used to having a final say in the team selection. Houghton wanted full purview over team selection, and Persson ultimately relented and gave it to him.|$|E

5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command <b>their</b> <b>respect,</b> but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E

This use is sometimes considered graphical, nationalistic or funny.

25|$|Wright {{spent two}} months with the battalion, having persuaded a {{commander}} {{that he could}} cope with such an assignment. The Marines of 1st Reconnaissance Battalion were initially hostile and suspicious but soon warmed to him and treated {{him as one of}} their own. He gained <b>their</b> <b>respect</b> through his refusal to quit in the face of combat. Often riding in the lead vehicle, a lightly armored Humvee, Wright was in real danger for much of the time, and at one point carried a weapon, though he did so reluctantly.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, Gary orchestrates a series of dangerous and destructive pranks throughout the school and blames them on Jimmy's lack of leadership. These events ruin Jimmy's reputation {{in the eyes of}} the cliques, and he gradually loses <b>their</b> <b>respect.</b> The final straw comes when Gary falsely informs Crabblesnitch of Jimmy's alleged crimes, triggering immediate expulsion from Bullworth.|$|E
25|$|The 50th {{anniversary of}} the Winter War started {{a new era in}} 1989. At the same year the film Talvisota (Winter War) was {{released}} which was the most expensive Finnish movie at the time. At the beginning of the 1990s the atmosphere changed. The Soviet Union collapsed and Moscow Archives opened revealing new information about the Winter War. The Finns openly showed <b>their</b> <b>respect</b> for the Finnish soldiers of three wars in 1939–1944; the situation would have been impossible in the 1970s. In the 2004 television programme Suuret suomalaiset (Great Finns) the Finns voted three World War II persons in the top four: Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim (1st), Risto Ryti (2nd), and Adolf Ehrnrooth (4th).|$|E

25|$|It {{was evident}} that the people at large, with <b>their</b> <b>respect</b> for the law and their anxiety for their own homes, were tired of the war. Only those men, such as Cromwell, who have set their hearts on {{fighting}} out the quarrel of conscience, kept steadfastly to their purpose. Cromwell himself had already decided that the King himself must be deprived of his authority, and his supporters were equally convinced. But they were relatively few. Even the Eastern Association trained bands had joined in the disaffection in Waller's army. The unfortunate general's suggestion of a professional army, with all its dangers, indicated {{the only means of}} enforcing a peace, such as Cromwell and his friends desired.|$|E
25|$|During {{the three}} major {{national}} days, Language Movement Day (21 February), Independence Day (26 March) and Victory Day (16 December), the university hosts public meetings, cultural programs and political activities. On these days, students and teachers, going barefoot, congregate around the Shaheed Minar and pay <b>their</b> <b>respect.</b> During the major Muslim religious occasions of Eid, the university is usually deserted as students go home {{to be with their}} families. Other religiously important days like Shabe-barat are observed through discussions and religious activities. The major Hindu festival celebrated in the university is Saraswati Puja—Saraswati, the goddess of knowledge, is worshiped in a central location as well as individually in many residential halls. The Bengali new year, Pohela Baisakh is also observed with much pomp.|$|E
25|$|Confucius {{believed}} that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. He {{believed that}} individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through ren, and that the most basic step to cultivating ren was devotion to one's parents and older siblings. He taught that one's individual desires {{do not need to}} be suppressed, but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via rituals and forms of propriety, through which people could demonstrate <b>their</b> <b>respect</b> for others and their responsible roles in society. He taught that a ruler's sense of virtue was his primary prerequisite for leadership. His primary goal in educating his students was to produce ethically well-cultivated men who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.|$|E
