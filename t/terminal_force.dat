40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} ventricular failure in acute myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic left atrial overloading was correlated to several simultaneous clinical and radiological signs of {{left ventricular dysfunction}} in 200 consecutive patients. Analyses were made at three time periods after infarction. Left atrial overloading, measured by P <b>terminal</b> <b>force,</b> {{was significantly associated with}} the signs of left ventricular dysfunction, though in this unselected series of infarctions the prevalence of abnormal values was not high (46 %). This finding is to be considered rather as a contributory sign than as a diagnostic one in the entire clinical picture.

40|$|Left atrial {{volume and}} {{pressure}} measurements in 23 normal subjects and 117 cardiac patients {{were compared with}} several electrocardiographic criteria for left atrial disease. Both P duration in lead II and V 1 <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> (the area inscribed by the terminal portion of the P in lead VI) showed a highly significant correlation with changes in left atrial volume but related less well to increases in left atrial pressure. Diagnostically, both criteria accurately predicted normal or increased left atrial size in two thirds of all patients. The V, <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> was more accurate in predicting left atrial pressure abnormalities in all subjects and particularly reliable in detecting increased pressure and volume in mitral stenosis. The P/PR segment ratio was less helpful in the detection of left atrial disease. Additional Indexing Words: Quantitative angiocardiography CLINICIANS HAVE long appreciated {{the usefulness of the}} electrocardiogram in detecting left atrial disease. Berliner and Master ' as well as Fraser and Turner 2 noted a high prevalence of broad or notched P waves, or both, in mitral valve disease. How-ever, a significant number of patients with left atrial disease do not show abnormal P waves in the standard limb leads. To improve the reliability of the electrocardiogram for the recognition of left atrial disease, investi-gators have proposed other criteria, most notably the P/PR segment ratio and the product of the magnitude and duration of the <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> of the P wave in lead V,. 3 4 Despite these additional criteria, doubt re-mains concerning the specificity of the elec-trocardiogram in predicting increased left atrial volume or pressure. 5,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} new {{experiments on}} compliance discrimination in which work cues were eliminated and force cues were minimized. The average JNDs for compliance ranged from 15 % to 99 % and were {{much larger than}} the average JND (8 %, see Tan, Pang & Durlach, 1992) obtained from previous compliance discrimination experiments in which both work and <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> cues, as well as compliance cues, were available to the subject. By converting results to corresponding JNDs in <b>terminal</b> <b>force,</b> we obtained a force JND of 5. 2 % ± 0. 8 %; this value was found to be consistent with force JNDs (6 - 8 %, see Pang, Tan & Durlach, 1991; Tan et al., 1992) we had obtained earlier from force discrimination experiments. We conclude from these compliance experiments and our previous experiments on force and compliance perception that manual resolution of compliance deteriorates when force and/or work cues are reduced or eliminated.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{approach}} is described for determining equilibrium states of a rigid body suspended elastically in space {{by a set}} of linear springs. This system is considered as a two-terminal generalized spring with terminal across (translational and rotational velocities, V-G, omega(G)) and terminal through (<b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> and moment, f(G), m(G)) variables. The algorithmic approach used for the solution of six nonlinear and coupled equilibrium equations consists of two major steps. The first step is to assign an initial orientation to the rigid body which is represented by the transformation (rotation) matrix T(theta,n) and reduce the problem to the solution of force equations only through a computer program. This yields the position vector xi of a preselected point G on the rigid body. Although the <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> f(G) becomes zero at this position, the calculated terminal moment m(G), in general, is not equal to zero. The second step is to try to determine the correct orientation of the rigid body based on an argument that the terminal moment should vanish. The same argument is also used for the solution of force equilibrium equations. These two steps are repeated several times until both f(G) and m(G) vanish simultaneously yielding an equilibrium state (xi,T(theta, n)). Application of the approach is illustrated through various examples. It is observed that, if there are nonstable equilibrium states of the system, then sometimes all possible physical equilibrium states may not be obtained with this approach. Publisher's Versio...|$|E

The spring constants of these fibers were measured directly using an atomic force microscope (AFM). These AFM measurements corroborate determinations based on the transverse vibrational resonance frequencies of the fibers, which is a more convenient method.

40|$|The {{validity}} of various electrocardiographic P wave measurements was tested in 48 patients by comparing them to left atrial dimensions determined by echocardiography (echo), a proved method of left atrial size estimation.

The results indicated that P widths in excess of 105 ms were present in all the patients who had left atria equal to or greater than 3 - 8 cm by echo and in 11 per cent of patients without atrial enlargement (false positives), and that when measurements were less than 105 ms left atrial enlargement was unlikely...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the ability of electro- and {{echocardiography}} to detect enlargement of the left atrium. Seventy-four patients, divided into three groups (eighteen normal, thirty-six valvular disease, twenty hypertension and/or coronary artery disease) were studied. The P wave <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> in lead V 1 (PTF-V 1) was measured from a standard 12 lead electrocardiogram, and the internal left atrial dimension (LAD) was measured from time-motion echocardiograms. Linear regression analysis showed a small but significant linear correlation between PTF-V 1 and LAD (r = 0 - 32, P less than 0 - 01). Both methods would separate patients with diseases known to cause left atrial enlargement from normals, but echocardiography showed greater "specificity" (100 % v. 94 +) and "sensitivity" (75 % v. 67 %).

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} helix with variable radius is developed to analyze geometric and mechanical properties of a migrating fiber. The factors concerned include the frequency and amplitude of fiber migration {{as well as the}} equivalent radial position and equivalent helix height of the fiber. This treatment permits the application of experimentally determined migration patterns defined by those factors. The derived properties are the curvature and torsion components of the migrating fibers, bending moments, torque, strain energy distribution, and total strain energy. The <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> and couple are calculated as functions of the length of the helix axis. A critical migration amplitude is identified where the axial component of the couple and transverse component of the force change their direction.

To this purpose, the ECGs from three populations were compared: healthy subjects, patients subject to paroxysmal AF selected for catheter ablation, under general anesthesia or not. In addition to standard temporal P-wave parameters (P-wave duration and PQ interval), an index of P-wave stability over time defined as the Euclidean distance between beat-to-beat P waves, and morphologic characteristics of biphasic P-wave, such as P-wave initial force and <b>terminal</b> <b>force,</b> were studied. Significant differences between the healthy and pathological groups were obtained for the considered parameters. Moreover, a classification {{of the two groups}} based on the joint analysis of P-wave duration and PQ interval was suggested.

Objective: This study evaluates {{the value of}} P wave indices to predict recurrences post pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in patients with paroxysmal AF.

A 12 -lead electrocardiogram {{was used to measure}} P wave duration in lead II, P wave <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> (PWTF) in lead V 1, P wave axis and dispersion. Results: During a follow-up of 9 ± 3 months, recurrences occurred in 60 (30. 3 %) patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hypertension entails atrial {{remodeling}} {{that affect}} P-wave (PW) duration on electrocardiogram (ECG). PW indices (e. g., variance, dispersion, and <b>terminal</b> <b>force)</b> {{are associated with}} a higher risk for atrial fibrillation (AF), but their calculation requires multiple measurements of PW duration, limiting their use in clinical practice. We evaluated whether PW duration in specific ECG leads may identify patients with increased susceptibility to AF in a population of hypertensive patients. METHODS: In a case-control study, AF and control subjects were matched for age, sex, and left atrial (LA) dimensions. PW duration was measured from digitally stored ECGs. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of PW duration and indices with AF. RESULTS: We enrolled 44 hypertensive AF patients (16 paroxysmal and 28 persistent) and 44 hypertensive controls. AF and control subjects were matched for sex (males, n = 27), age (67 ± 8 years), LA diameter (40 ± 5 mm), and were comparable for left ventricular mass (45 ± 11 g/m 2. 7 vs 48 ± 12 g/m 2. 7, P = 0. 19), ejection fraction (58 ± 7...|$|E

Logistic regression analysis showed that QRS score, ST depression, and QTc were independently predictive of cardiac mortality. When multivariate analysis was applied to clinical and electrocardiographic data together, however, the 12 lead electrocardiogram did not provide independent information additional to that provided by other routine clinical findings and laboratory tests such as a history of previous myocardial infarction, clinical signs of persistent heart failure, indication for digitalis or antiarrhythmic drugs at discharge, and enlarged heart on chest x ray. In conclusion, the electrocardiogram has important prognostic value; however, it is not powerful enough to further improve the risk assessment of post-infarction patient...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between mean left atrial pressure (LAm) and P-wave abnormalities in lead V 1 of standard 12 -lead electrocardiograms was evaluated in 30 patients with acute myocardial infarction. In each patient pulmonary artery diastolic pressure or pulmonary wedge pressure was measured, and these values {{were used as}} an estimate of LAm. Electrocardiograms recorded {{at the time of}} the pressure measurements were used for P-wave analysis. Patients with a history of hypertension were excluded from analysis. There was a significant correlation between the magnitude of the P <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> in lead V 1 (PTF-V 1) and the estimated LAm (r =- 0. 78, P 12 mm Hg). Thus, in 25 of the 30 patients, the PTF-V 1 correctly identi-fied whether the LAm was normal or abnormal on admission. On subsequent days, simultaneous measurements of PTF-V 1 and estimated LAm were made in 27 of the patients. Significant changes occurred in both PTF-V 1 and LAm; discordant changes were observed on only seven of 56 oc-casions.

40|$|P-wave {{assessment}} is frequently used in clinical practice to recognize atrial abnormalities. However, {{the use of}} P-wave criteria to diagnose specific atrial abnormalities such as left atrial enlargement has shown to be of limited use since these abnormalities {{can be difficult to}} distinguish using P-wave criteria to date. Hence, a mechanistic understanding how specific atrial abnormalities affect the P-wave is desirable. In this study, we investigated the effect of left atrial hypertrophy on P-wave morphology using an in silico approach. In a cohort of four realistic patient models, we homogeneously increased left atrial wall thickness in up to seven degrees of left atrial hypertrophy. Excitation conduction was simulated using a monodomain finite element approach. Then, the resulting transmembrane voltage distribution was used to calculate the corresponding extracellular potential distribution on the torso by solving the forward problem of electrocardiography. In our simulation setup, left atrial wall thickening strongly correlated with an increased absolute value of the P-wave <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> (PTF) in Wilson lead V 1 due to an increased negative amplitude while P-wave duration was unaffected. Remarkably, an increased PTF-V 1 has often been associated with left atrial enlargement which is defined as a rather increased left atrial volume than a solely thickened left atrium. Hence, the observed contribution of left atrial wall thickness changes to PTF-V 1 might explain the poor empirical correlation of left atrial enlargement with PTF-V 1...|$|E
40|$|P-wave {{characteristics}} {{in the human}} ECG are {{an important source of}} information in the diagnosis of atrial conduction pathology. However, diagnosis by visual inspection is a difficult task since the P-wave is relatively small and noise masking is often present. This paper introduces novel wavelet characteristics derived from the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) which are shown to be potentially effective discriminators in an automated diagnostic process. Characteristics of the 12 -lead ECG P-wave were derived using CWT and statistical methods. A normal control group and an abnormal (atrial conduction pathology) group were compared. The wavelet characteristics captured frequency, magnitude and variance components of the P-wave. The best individual characteristics (i. e. ones that significantly discriminated the groups) were entered into a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for four different models: two-lead ECG, three-lead ECG, a derived three-lead ECG and a factor analysis solution consisting of wavelet characteristic loadings on the factors. A comparison was also made between wavelet characteristics derived form individual P-waves verses wavelet characteristics derived from a signal-averaged P-wave for each participant. These wavelet models were also compared to standard cardiological measures of duration, <b>terminal</b> <b>force</b> and duration divided by the PR segment. Results for the individual P-wave approach generally outperformed the standard cardiological measures and the signal-averaged P-wave approach. The best wavelet model on the basis of both classification performance and simplicity was the two-lead model that uses leads II and V 1. It was concluded that the wavelet approach of automating classification is worth pursuing with larger samples to validate and extend the present study.
