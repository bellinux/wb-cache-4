50|$|CSN {{primarily}} {{operates as}} an integrated steel producer in Brazil. It produces {{a line of}} steel products, including slabs, which are semi-finished products used for processing hot-rolled, cold-rolled, or coated coils and sheet products; hot-rolled products comprising heavy-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets, and light-gauge hot-rolled coils and sheets; cold-rolled products, including cold-rolled coils and sheets; and galvanized products consisting of flat-rolled steel coated with zinc or a zinc-based alloy. The company also offers <b>tin</b> <b>mill</b> <b>products,</b> including tin plate, tin free steel, low tin coated steel, and black plate products. CSN also mines iron ore, limestone, and dolomite, and maintains strategic investments in railroads and power supply companies. The company sells its steel products to customers in Brazil and 71 other countries in North America, Europe, and Asia through its sales force and distributors.

40|$|Plant trial {{evaluations}} {{have been}} completed for two zirconium-based, non-chromium passivation systems previously identified as possible alternatives to cathodic dichromate (CDC) passivation for electrolytic tinplate (ETP). These trials were done on a commercial electrolytic tin plating line at Weirton Steel and extensive evaluations of the materials resulting from these trials {{have been completed}}. All this was accomplished as a collaborative effort under the AISI Technology Roadmap Program and was executed by seven North American <b>Tin</b> <b>Mill</b> <b>Products</b> producers [Bethlehem Steel (now acquired by International Steel Group (ISG)), Dofasco Inc., National Steel (now acquired by U. S. Steel), U. S. Steel, USS-Posco, Weirton Steel, and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel] with funding partially from the Department of Energy (DOE) and partially on an equal cost sharing basis among project participants. The initial phases of this project involved optimization of application procedures for the non-chromium systems in the laboratories at Bethlehem Steel and Betz Dearborn followed by extensive testing with various lacquer formulations and food simulants in the laboratories at Valspar and PPG. Work was also completed at Dofasco and Weirton Steel to develop methods to prevent precipitation of insoluble solids {{as a function of}} time from the zirconate system. The results of this testing indicated that sulfide staining characteristics for the non-chromium passivation systems could be minimized but not totally eliminated and neither system was found to perform quite as good, in this respect, as the standard CDC system. As for the stability of zirconate treatment, a method was developed to stabilize this system for a sufficient period of time to conduct plant trial evaluations but, working with a major supplier of zirconium orthosulfate, a method for long term stabilization is still under development...|$|E

In December 1892, the Grand Island & Wyoming Central Railroad built a line running from the town to the <b>tin</b> <b>mill</b> east of Hill City. The mine never became successful, despite shaft and drift mining down to 800 feet. On February 25, 1900, the railroad extended to Keystone, causing the town to grow again. The town included a boarding house, saloon, platform station, and commissary car for railroaders. The town declined when, in June 1917, the railroad leading into the town was removed.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the maximal amount of concentrate and forage that could be replaced with a new wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product.</b> The corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> contained 23. 1 % crude protein, 9. 9 % ruminally undegradable protein, 13. 7 % acid detergent fiber, 40. 3 % neutral detergent fiber, and 2. 6 % ether extract (% of dry matter; DM). In experiment 1, 16 Holstein cows were {{assigned to one of}} four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. The four diets contained 54. 3 % forage (alfalfa:corn silages, 1 : 1 DM basis) with the wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> replacing 0, 50, 75, or 100 % of the concentrate portion (corn and soybean meal) of the diet (DM basis). The diets containing wet corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> resulted in 7. 8 % lower DM intake, equivalent milk production (28. 5 kg/ d), and 13. 6 % greater efficiency of 4 % fat-corrected milk (FCM) production than the control diet. There was no effect of diet on ruminal pH. In experiment 2, 16 Holstein cows were assigned to one of four diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design with 28 -d periods. The 100 % concentrate replacement diet from experiment 1 was used as control diet. For the test diets, forage was replaced with 15, 30, or 45 % of the corn <b>milling</b> <b>product</b> (DM basis). Efficiency of FCM production (1. 16) was not affected by diet. Rumination time was reduced for the 30 and 45 % forage replacement diets, but ruminal pH was unaffected. In experiment 3, 30 Holstein cows were assigned at parturition to either a control diet (no corn <b>milling</b> <b>product)</b> or a diet containing 40 % corn milling feed in place of both forage and concentrate (optimal levels from experiments 1 and 2) for 9 wk. The diet containing corn milling feed resulted in 21 % greater efficiency of FCM production than the control diet. These results indicate that a new feed product based on wet corn milling ingredients has the potential to effectively replace all of the concentrate and up to 45 % of the forage in the diet for lactating dairy cows...|$|R
