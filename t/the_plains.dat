5|$|Later {{morphological}} studies came to conflicting conclusions. A 1999 {{analysis of}} cranial measurements {{found that the}} quagga was as different from <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> zebra as the latter is from the mountain zebra. A 2004 study of skins and skulls instead suggested that the quagga was not a distinct species, but a subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> zebra. In spite of these findings, many authors subsequently kept <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> zebra and the quagga as separate species.|$|E
5|$|The {{time period}} in <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> where {{thunderstorm}} areas are most prevalent ranges between May and September. Mesoscale convective systems develop {{over the region}} during this time frame, with a bulk of the activity occurring between 6 and 9 p.m. local time. Mesoscale convective systems bring 30 to 70 percent of the annual warm season rainfall to <b>the</b> <b>Plains.</b> A subset of these systems known as mesoscale convective complexes lead to up to 10% of the annual rainfall across <b>the</b> <b>Plains</b> and Midwest. Squall lines account for 30% of the large thunderstorm complexes which move through the region.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>plain</b> extends {{northwest}} {{from the}} town of Maricopa, following the San Andreas Fault. Bordering <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> to <b>the</b> northeast is the Temblor Range, {{on the other side of}} which is the California Central Valley. Bordering <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> to <b>the</b> southwest is the Caliente Range.

Soda Lake, a 3000 acre alkaline lake, is in the center of <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> with <b>the</b> popular Painted Rock containing Chumash and Yokut rock art nearby. As the central depression in an enclosed basin, Soda Lake receives all of the runoff from both sides of <b>the</b> <b>plain.</b> At 5,106 ft (1,556 m), Caliente Mountain, southwest of <b>the</b> <b>plain,</b> stands as <b>the</b> highest point in San Luis Obispo County.

5|$|Horses, {{originally}} {{acquired from}} Spanish New Mexico, spread widely via native trade networks, reaching the Shoshone of the Snake River Plain by 1700. The Nez Perce, Cayuse, and Flathead people acquired their first horses around 1730. Along with horses came {{aspects of the}} emerging plains culture, such as equestrian and horse training skills, greatly increased mobility, hunting efficiency, trade over long distances, intensified warfare, the linking of wealth and prestige to horses and war, {{and the rise of}} large and powerful tribal confederacies. The Nez Perce and Cayuse kept large herds and made annual long-distance trips to the Great Plains for bison hunting, adopted <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> culture to a significant degree, and became the main conduit through which horses and <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> culture diffused into the Columbia River region. Other peoples acquired horses and aspects of <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> culture unevenly. The Yakama, Umatilla, Palus, Spokane, and Coeur d'Alene maintained sizable herds of horses and adopted some of <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> cultural characteristics, but fishing and fish-related economies remained important. Less affected groups included the Molala, Klickitat, Wenatchi, Okanagan, and Sinkiuse-Columbia peoples, who owned small numbers of horses and adopted few plains culture features. Some groups remained essentially unaffected, such as the Sanpoil and Nespelem people, whose culture remained centered on fishing.|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the large}} {{training}} areas inaccessible to <b>the</b> public, <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> is a wildlife haven, and home to two national nature reserves, but there is concern that {{the low level of}} grazing on <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> could allow scrub to encroach on <b>the</b> grassland. <b>The</b> <b>plain</b> supports <b>the</b> largest known expanse of unimproved chalk downland in north west Europe, and represents 41% of Britain's remaining area of this wildlife habitat. <b>The</b> <b>plain</b> supports 13 species of nationally rare and scarce plants, 67 species of rare and scarce invertebrates and forms a site of international importance for birds.

5|$|The quagga was {{the first}} extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and this 1984 study {{launched}} the field of ancient DNA analysis. It confirmed that the quagga was {{more closely related to}} zebras than to horses, with the quagga and mountain zebra (Equus zebra) sharing an ancestor 3–4 million years ago. An immunological study published the following year found the quagga to be closest to <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> zebra. A 1987 study suggested that the mtDNA of the quagga diverged at a range of roughly 2% per million years, similar to other mammal species, and again confirmed the close relation to <b>the</b> <b>plains</b> zebra.|$|E
5|$|A. n. melaschistos was {{described}} by Allan Octavian Hume in 1869.

The Moulin à paroles took place without incident.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, animal {{resources}} were in {{decline in the}} area leading to increased competition among the tribes for game and for furs to sell.

50|$|<b>The</b> Erie <b>Plain</b> begins {{just east}} of Auburn, New York, where the Onondaga Escarpment meets the Portage Escarpment. The Onondaga Escarpment sharply distinguishes <b>the</b> Erie <b>Plain</b> from <b>the</b> Huron <b>Plain</b> east of Buffalo. But along the {{southern}} side of Lake Erie west of Buffalo, the Onondaga Escarpment is so slight that <b>the</b> Huron <b>Plain</b> and Erie <b>Plain</b> are essentially <b>the</b> same. At Buffalo, <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> narrows to just 2 to 3 mi wide as the Portage Escarpment moves closer to the Lake Erie shoreline, and remains 2 to 4 mi wide in Erie County, Pennsylvania. From Erie, Pennsylvania, to Cleveland, <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> broadens to about 4 to 6 mi and is starkly defined by the Portage Escarpment, which rises in three terraces. <b>The</b> <b>plain</b> remains narrow until just west of Cleveland, where the Portage Escarpment moves to the south, and the definition between <b>the</b> <b>plain</b> and escarpment becomes much less distinct. The escarpment is broken in two places by the valleys of the Great Miami and Scioto rivers. <b>The</b> <b>plain</b> expands to 4 to 5 mi between the Cuyahoga River and the Rocky River, and to 17 mi west of the Rocky River around the southwest and western sides of Lake Erie.
