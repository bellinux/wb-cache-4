40|$|AbstractIn {{magnetic}} abrasive <b>finishing,</b> <b>the</b> {{development of}} a multiple pole-tip system using a partially heat-treated magnetic tool allows <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> of multiple regions simultaneously in capillary tubes and thus improves <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> efficiency. To further reduce the processing time required, a new high-speed machine is fabricated. This paper describes {{the development of the}} high-speed multiple pole-tip finishing equipment, which is capable of rotating the spindle up to 30000 min- 1, and the effects of tube rotational speed on abrasive motion during <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> experiments. Also, <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> mechanisms of <b>the</b> high-speed machine are clarified...|$|R

The {{finishing}} position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the vertical plane of the nearer edge of <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line. Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) {{are becoming more and more}} common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a (sprint) record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).|$|E

Stage six took the race east, with the seventh ending in the Vosges Mountains. Stage eight then entered the Jura Mountains, with <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> in Porrentruy, Switzerland. A return to France saw the next stage take place between Arc-et-Senans to Besançon. The next stages, ten and eleven, went into the Alps, and stages twelve and {{thirteen}} took the Tour down to the Mediterranean coast at Cap d'Agde. Stage fourteen moved the race into the east of Pyrenees, before a transitional stage {{taking it to the}} western side of the mountains for the next two stages. Stage eighteen was held between Blagnac to Brive-la-Gaillarde in the south of the country, before a long transfer took the race back to the north-east for two further stages, with <b>the</b> <b>finish</b> on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.|$|E

40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety-five {{crossbred}} steers {{were used to}} compare lifetime implant strategies and {{study the effects of}} implanting during the suckling period on performance in <b>the</b> growing and <b>finishing</b> periods. There were no differences in growing period gains when both groups were implanted in the suckling period and the growing period. However, steers implanted in the suckling period but not implanted in the growing period had significantly lower gains than all other treatments including controls. Steers implanted only in the growing period had better feed efficiency in the growing period than both controls and steers implanted only in the suckling period. Steers reimplanted during <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period had similar finishing gains regardless of prior implant treatment, and all implanted cattle gained faster than controls in <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period. Steers not reimplanted during <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period had lower gains than those reimplanted. Implanting in <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period resulted in better feed efficiency. All implanted cattle that were reimplanted in <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period had higher lifetime gains than controls, but {{there was no difference between}} implant combinations. The only carcass characteristic changed by implanting was quality grade, which was reduced by all implant combinations with the exception of implanting only in <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period. Implanting during the suckling period did not reduce cattle performance during <b>the</b> growing and <b>finishing</b> periods when <b>the</b> steers were also implanted during these periods. This study emphasizes the importance of implanting twice in <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period to maximize finishing gain and final weight...|$|R
