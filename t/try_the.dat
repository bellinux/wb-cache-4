The courts, which adhere to civil law, lack the capacity to quickly and transparently <b>try</b> <b>the</b> cases in the judicial system, often forcing defendants to pass lengthy pretrial detentions in unsanitary and overcrowded prisons.|$|E
5|$|Because of Nintendo's solid {{infrastructure}} for the DS, Igarashi wanted to <b>try</b> <b>the</b> online components, and test for possible online game play, in future Castlevania titles. Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage to , his favorite Castlevania game. The anime style of artwork was retained from Dawn of Sorrow, which Igarashi had switched {{to in the}} previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems. Portrait of Ruins development cycle took roughly {{the same amount of}} time as Dawn of Sorrow did. Koji Igarashi stated that the schedule became tight due to Nintendo Wi-Fi difficulties, considering it was their first online enabled game.|$|E

5|$|Edward Christian, {{brother of}} Fletcher Christian, had been {{appointed}} Chief Justice of the Isle of Ely in 1800 by the Bishop of Ely. As the Chief Justice, Christian was entitled to <b>try</b> <b>the</b> rioters alone. The government, in this case via the Home Secretary, Lord Sidmouth, nevertheless appointed a Special Commission, consisting of Justice Abbott and Justice Burrough. The rioters were tried in the assizes at Ely during the week commencing June 1816. 23 men and one woman were condemned, of which five were subsequently hanged. General unrest and riots such as that at Littleport {{may have been a}} factor in the government passing the Vagrancy Act of 1824 and subsequently the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero: Aerosmiths {{gameplay}} {{is structured}} similarly to the gameplay {{of the other}} games in the series, in which players use a guitar-shaped peripheral to simulate the playing of rock music, hitting fret buttons and strumming in time to notes as they scroll on the screen. The player's performance is tracked through each song; if the player does well they are given a score and a rating of up to five stars; if the player performs poorly, the song may end prematurely and the player will need to <b>try</b> <b>the</b> song again. Each song can be played at one of four difficulties that changes the number and speed of the notes that must be played.|$|E
5|$|Henry and Becket quickly {{disagreed}} over {{a number}} of issues, including Becket's attempts to regain control of lands belonging to the archbishopric and his views on Henry's taxation policies. The main source of conflict, however, concerned the treatment of clergy who committed secular crimes: Henry argued that the legal custom in England allowed the king to enforce justice over these clerics, while Becket maintained that only church courts could <b>try</b> <b>the</b> cases. The matter came to a head in January 1164, when Henry forced through agreement to the Constitutions of Clarendon; under tremendous pressure, Becket temporarily agreed but changed his position shortly afterwards. The legal argument was complex at the time and remains contentious.|$|E

5|$|In October 1885, the Halifax Wood Fibre Company {{built the}} first {{sulphide}} pulp mill in Canada, {{which at the time}} was the Dominion of Canada, at East River, Sheet Harbour. Since the discovery of the sulphite process happened earlier in 1866, the news had traveled to William Chisholm, who was a lumber manufacturer in Halifax. He decided to <b>try</b> <b>the</b> sulphite method out for himself {{at the head of the}} East River. He had 60,000 acres (24,281 hectares, or 242km2) of woodland on the Sheet Harbour rivers. The mill closed in January 1891, due to the high costs of importing sulphide from the United States. The cookhouse which was used at the mill was bought by the residents of Watt Section and was floated down the harbour to the community.|$|E
5|$|Mystery of the Emblem began {{development}} in 1992 during {{the production of}} Fire Emblem Gaiden. The staff from previous entries, including series creator Shouzou Kaga and composer Yuka Tsujiyoko, returned to their respective roles. While originally conceived as two separate projects, the team eventually merged the proposed remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light with the original story content of Mystery of the Emblem. The gameplay, which had veered away from the first game's tactical RPG routes in Gaiden, returned to its more traditional stance. The difficulty was lowered to encourage new players to <b>try</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|E

5|$|When the Negev forces {{reached the}} coastal road, they {{realized}} {{that they could not}} continue on their vehicles, which could not travel in the sand dunes {{to the west of the}} road.

The other soldiers continued on foot into the sand dunes in an attempt to flank the Egyptian positions. On the second <b>try,</b> <b>the</b> Negev forces successfully captured several key points in the village, and destroyed a cannon. Nahum Sarig, the Negev Brigade commander, later wrote that the lack of intelligence on the enemy prevented the Israeli force from continuing its assault, while the Egyptians had time to regroup.|$|E
