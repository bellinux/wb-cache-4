5|$|The Eccles Spinning and Manufacturing Company {{came into}} being {{following}} a meeting called by the Mayor of Eccles, in which concern was expressed at the decline in local industry. Two earlier Eccles mills had been destroyed by fire, resulting in significant local unemployment. Designed by Potts, Son and Hennings of Manchester, Bolton and Oldham, it was opened in 1906. <b>The</b> <b>imposing</b> mill contained a multi-storey spinning mill, engine house and extensive weaving sheds.|$|E
5|$|The decorations were in wood, stucco and stone, {{including}} marble, with geometrical and floral {{patterns and}} arabesques with Samarran and Byzantine origins. The decorations were {{more complex than}} the earlier Islamic forms and more carefully adapted to structural constraints. <b>The</b> <b>imposing</b> architecture and decoration of Fatimid buildings such as the al-Hakim mosque provided a backdrop that supported the dual role of the Fatimid caliph as both religious and political leader.|$|E

[...] A court cannot maintain an order of contempt where <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> party does not have the ability {{to comply with the}} underlying order.

5|$|The great {{significance}} {{of religion in}} the culture of Roman Switzerland is illustrated by <b>the</b> <b>imposing</b> size and central location of the Roman temples in the cities, {{as well as by the}} great number of religious artifacts found by archaeologists. As everywhere in the Empire, the Imperial cult was practiced in Switzerland; it had a particularly prominent temple in the center of the forum of Nyon.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} lines {{under the}} original Acts were opened in stages but all were completed and open {{by the end}} of 1852 when the Stoke to Newcastle and Newcastle to Knutton sections opened. A few months after the opening of the first line, <b>the</b> <b>imposing</b> permanent station in Winton Square, Stoke was opened on 9 October 1848. Stoke station then became the headquarters of the NSR.|$|E
5|$|The {{water tower}} from 1895 was {{designed}} by Christian Hjerrild Clausen who had been inspired by Nuremberg's medieval Nassauer Haus. Standing {{at the top of}} a cliff, it commands excellent views of the city and the harbour from its platform which is open to the public. <b>The</b> <b>imposing</b> old Courthouse Building on the central square with its tall tower and stepped gables has recently been fully renovated. A bronze equestrian statue of Christian IX, the founder of Esbjerg, stands at the centre of the square.|$|E

In addition, except some minor round-off effects, <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> pressure difference has no influence on the permeabilities value, because it is cancelled out during the calculations.|$|R

Since then, he has starred in more than 40 films, {{almost all of them}} in the action genre. He portrayed He-Man in the 1987 science fantasy film Masters of the Universe and Frank Castle in the 1989 film The Punisher. In the early 1990s, he also appeared in films such as Dark Angel (1990), Universal Soldier (1992), Joshua Tree (1993), Johnny Mnemonic (1995), and Blackjack (1998). In 2004, he directed his first film, The Defender, and subsequently directed The Mechanik (2005), Missionary Man (2007), Command Performance (2009), and Icarus (2010), also starring in the latter.|$|E
5|$|The new {{station was}} {{constructed}} in an Art Deco/Streamline Moderne design by Charles Holden with L H Bucknell. Like Holden's other designs for London Underground in the 1930s, East Finchley station was inspired by European architecture (particularly Dutch) that Holden had seen on trips to the continent during that decade. The track here runs roughly north-west to south-east. <b>The</b> <b>imposing</b> station building, built on rising ground adjacent to the railway bridge over High Road (A1000), has three entrances. The two main entrances to the ticket hall are {{on the north side}} of the tracks facing High Road and the third, minor entrance, is on the south side. The entrances are linked by a passage under the tracks which provides access up to the platforms.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Small endotracheal tubes (ETTs) and {{neonatal}} ventilators can impact gas ex-change, work of breathing, and lung-mechanics measurements in infants, {{by increasing}} the expi-ratory resistance (RE) to gas flow. METHODS: We tested two each of the Babylog 8000 plus, Avea, Carestation, and Servo-i ventilators. In {{the first phase of}} the study we evaluated (1) <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> RE of an ETT and ventilator system during simulated passive breathing at various tidal volume (VT), positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and frequency settings, and (2) the intrinsic PEEP at various ventilator settings. In the second phase of this study we evaluated <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> expiratory work of breathing (WOB) of the ETT and ventilator system at various PEEP levels during simu-lated spontaneous breathing using an infant lung model. Pressure and flow were measured con-tinuously, and we calculated <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> RE of <b>the</b> ETT and each ventilator, and the intrinsic PEEP with various PEEP, VT, and frequency settings. We measured <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> expiratory WOB with several PEEP levels during a simulated spontaneous breathing pattern. RESULTS: The ventilatorâ€™s contribution to <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> RE was greater than that of the ETT with nearly all of the ventilators tested. There were significant differences in ventilator-imposed RE between the ventilator brands at various PEEP, VT, and frequency settings. The Babylog 8000 plus consistently had the lowes...|$|R

5000|$|The {{polarization}} of a dielectric material is a competition between torques due to <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> electric field, {{which tend to}} align the molecules, and collisions, which tend to destroy the alignment. The theory of rotational Brownian motion allows one to calculate the net result of these two competing effects, and to predict how the permittivity of a dielectric material depends on the strength and frequency of <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> electric field.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>imposed</b> query model {{provides}} {{a new way}} of thinking about whom the user is in information proving organizations and environments. It does this by making a distinction between questions that are self-generated (internally motivated by personal context) and those that are imposed (thought up by one person then given to someone else to resolve). While <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> query model represents familiar behaviour, it is a dimension of information seeking that has only recently been explicitly addressed and isolated for study. This article summarizes research on <b>the</b> <b>imposed</b> query in two different information providing contexts: the elementary school and the adult reference desk at the public library. Results reveal whom the imposers and agent users are in these environments and provide an assessment of how common imposed queries are in these contexts...|$|R
