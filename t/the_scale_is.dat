40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to adapt “Chemistry Perception Questionnaire (CPQ) ”, {{developed}} by Wells (2003), into Turkish and investigate validity and reliability of the Turkish version of <b>the</b> <b>scale.</b> <b>The</b> original version of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> composed of 35 items gathered under seven factors (aptitude, chemophobia, discipline, ethnicity, gender, instruction and value). First, permission from the developers of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> sought. Then, <b>the</b> items of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>were</b> translated into Turkish by researcher. The translation validity of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> examined by referring to the views of English and Turkish language experts. Once the final form of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> had <b>been</b> derived, an English language expert translated the items of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> from Turkish to English. The results obtained from this translation indicated that <b>the</b> Turkish version <b>scale</b> closely approximated to <b>the</b> original <b>scale.</b> Turkish version of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> administered to total of 435 university students from Education, Science and Engineering Faculties of Bartin, Kirikkale, Kilis 7 Aralik and Mustafa Kemal Universities.

40|$|Objective: Perceptual {{aberration}} is {{an important}} dimension of schizotypy which has been considered as a clinical determinant of psychosis proneness. The present study aimed to explore the validity and {{the reliability of the}} Turkish version of <b>the</b> Perceptual Aberration <b>Scale.</b> Methods: Internal consistency of <b>the</b> Perceptual Aberration <b>Scale</b> <b>was</b> studied in 222 university students and for test-retest reliability, <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> readministered to 105 students. Convergent validity of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> measured by <b>the</b> Magical Ideation <b>Scale</b> in 128 students. Results: The internal consistency of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> Cronbach’s alpha= 0. 90 and the test-retest reliability was r= 0. 59. The convergent validity of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>was</b> established by a significant correlation between the scores of <b>the</b> Magical Ideation <b>Scale</b> and <b>the</b> Perceptual Aberration <b>Scale.</b> Discussion: <b>The</b> Turkish version of <b>the</b> Perceptual Aberration <b>Scale</b> <b>is</b> a reliable instrument, which can be used to quantify the important dimension of schizotypy in university students. <b>The</b> <b>scale</b> should <b>be</b> validated in community-based samples and also the predictive validity of <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> should <b>be</b> investigated.
