5|$|James Villiers as MI6 Chief of Staff Bill Tanner. The role of Tanner first {{appeared}} on film in The Man with the Golden Gun, although in an un-credited capacity. Villiers presumed he would {{play the role of}} M in subsequent films and was disappointed not to be asked; the producers <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> too young for the role and wanted an actor in his 70s.|$|E
5|$|By 1889 Verdi {{had been}} an opera {{composer}} for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, Un giorno di regno, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> incapable of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed {{and said that he}} longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would give him the chance. He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E
5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> unintelligent on {{the grounds}} that he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E
6000|$|... "And Billy," [...] called Mr. Smith, {{as still}} another <b>thought</b> struck <b>him</b> (indeed, the moment Mr. Smith went into {{politics}} {{you could see}} these <b>thoughts</b> strike <b>him</b> like waves), [...] "get fifty pictures of his father, old King Albert." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the days}} that {{followed}} she <b>thought</b> of <b>him</b> as she saw him last, a minute fleck on the plain. She <b>thought</b> of <b>him</b> when the rains fell, and prayed that he might not fall ill of fever or be whelmed by a stream. He seemed so little and weak when measured against that mighty and merciless wall of snow. Then when the cold white storms came and the plain was hid in the fury of wind and sleet, she shuddered and <b>thought</b> of <b>him</b> camped beside a rock, cold and hungry. She <b>thought</b> of <b>him</b> lying with a broken leg, helpless, while his faithful beasts pawed the ground and whinnied their distress. She spoke of these things once or twice, but her father merely smiled.|$|R
60|$|De Stancy {{bowed and}} {{departed}} in a glow of triumph; satisfied, notwithstanding her frigidity, {{that he had}} compassed his immediate aim, which was that she {{might not be able}} to dismiss from her <b>thoughts</b> <b>him</b> and his persevering desire for the shadow of her face during the next four-and-twenty-hours. And his confidence was well founded: she could not.|$|R
5|$|Adams resented Hamilton's {{influence}} with Washington and considered him overambitious and scandalous {{in his private}} life; Hamilton compared Adams unfavorably with Washington and <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> too emotionally unstable to be President. Hamilton took the election as an opportunity: he urged all the northern electors to vote for Adams and Pinckney, lest Jefferson get in; but he cooperated with Edward Rutledge to have South Carolina's electors vote for Jefferson and Pinckney. If all this worked, Pinckney would have more votes than Adams, Pinckney would become President, and Adams would remain Vice President, {{but it did not}} work. The Federalists found out about it (even the French minister to the United States knew), and northern Federalists voted for Adams but not for Pinckney, in sufficient numbers that Pinckney came in third and Jefferson became Vice President. Adams resented the intrigue since he felt his service to the nation was much more extensive than Pinckney's.|$|E
5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|Finally on 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, the Entente's High Commissioner in Greece, ordered King Constantine {{to give up}} his power. On {{the threat}} of Entente forces landing in Piraeus, the king conceded and agreed to go into self-exile, though without officially abdicating his crown. The Allies, while {{determined}} to be rid of Constantine, did not wish to create a Greek republic, and sought to replace the king with another member of the royal family. Crown Prince George, who was the natural heir, was ruled out by the Allies because they <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> too pro-German, like his father. Instead, they considered installing Constantine's brother (and Alexander's uncle), Prince George, but he had tired of public life during his difficult tenure as High Commissioner of Crete between 1901 and 1905; above all, he sought to remain loyal to his brother, and categorically refused to take the throne. As a result, Constantine's second son, Prince Alexander, was chosen to become the new monarch.|$|E

5|$|It {{was at this}} battle, {{regardless}} of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban Pelopidas; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when Agesipolis the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for the next twenty years.|$|E
5|$|William Rolleston, at {{the time}} Provincial Secretary, {{proposed}} to Mary Brittan in early 1865. He was 34 {{at the time}}, and she was 19. Both Joseph and Sophia Brittan were opposed to a marriage, which is surprising, given that Rolleston was intelligent, well educated, successful, and if anything, of higher social standing. They <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> too old for their daughter, her too young to marry. Maybe Sophia Brittan {{did not want to}} lose her daughter, who was in effect running the household and entertained guests, as she was often too ill to look after these tasks herself. But Rolleston was offered and accepted the role of Under Secretary for Native Affairs, which required moving to Wellington. Hence, the wedding went ahead on 24 May 1865 at Avonside Trinity Church, before the newly-weds moved to the capital.|$|E
5|$|In May 1851 Metternich {{left for}} his Johannisberg estate, {{which he had}} last visited in 1845. That summer Metternich enjoyed the company of Prussian {{representative}} Otto von Bismarck. He also enjoyed a visit from Frederick William, though the King irritated Metternich by appearing to cultivate him as a tool against Schwarzenberg. In September Metternich returned to Vienna, entertained along the way by various German princes keen to entertain the focus of Prussian intrigue. Metternich was reinvigorated, dropped his nostalgia, and lived in the present {{for the first time}} in a decade. Franz Josef asked for his advice on numerous issues (though he was too headstrong to be much influenced by it), and both of the two emerging factions in Vienna courted Metternich; even Tsar Nicholas called on him during a state visit. Metternich was not keen on the new Foreign Minister, Karl Ferdinand von Buol but <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> sufficiently incompetent that he would be impressionable. Metternich's advice was of varying quality; nonetheless, some of it was usefully insightful, even in modern issues. Now deaf, Metternich wrote endlessly, particularly for an appreciative Franz Josef. He wanted Austrian neutrality in the Crimean War, though Buol did not. In the meantime Metternich's health was slowly failing, and he was a more peripheral figure after the death of his wife Melanie in January 1854. In a brief resurgence of energy in early 1856, he busied himself in arrangements for a marriage between his son Richard and his granddaughter Pauline (Richard's step-sister's daughter) and undertook more travel. The King of the Belgians came to visit, as did Bismarck, and on 16 August 1857 he entertained the future Edward VII of the United Kingdom. Buol, however, was growing more resentful of Metternich's advice, particularly about Italy. In April 1859 Franz Josef came to ask him about what should be done in Italy. According to Pauline, Metternich begged him not to send an ultimatum to Italy, and Franz Josef explained that such an ultimatum had already been sent.|$|E

25|$|He became {{fascinated with}} arcade {{games as a}} teenager, though his parents <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> a delinquent for this pastime. He {{particularly}} enjoyed playing Taito's Space Invaders, which drew him into other video games. His interest eventually evolved into attempting to plan his own games. He took his Famicom apart {{to see how it}} worked, and won a contest for a video game idea sponsored by Sega.|$|E
25|$|Newman, who {{was only}} a few years younger than Keats and Shelley, was born into the Romantic generation, when Englishmen still wept in moments of emotion. But he lived on into the age of the stiff upper lip, with the result that later generations, hearing of his tears on a visit to his mother's grave or at the {{funerals}} of old friends such as Henry Wilberforce, <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> not only sensitive but melancholy.|$|E

25|$|Wilson had hoped, {{as early}} as March 1905, to succeed Rawlinson as Commandant at Staff College, Camberley, when Rawlinson {{told him he had}} been offered a brigadier-general’s staff {{position}} at Aldershot Command; however the move was postponed {{until the end of the}} year. In June 1905 Wilson learned that Arnold-Forster (Secretary of State for War) <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> the man for the job, but on 12 July Lyttelton (Chief of the General Staff), who appears to have disliked Wilson, raised the job to a brigadier-general’s position, for which Wilson was not yet senior enough.|$|E
25|$|They arrive {{safely in}} England and Harry is {{reunited with his}} family, who <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> long dead in the {{violence}} of the Revolution. Several years later, Harry marries Jeanne after he passes his medical exams and joins his father's practice. Virginie marries one of Harry's brothers, Tom, and the girls and their husbands later travel back to France for a short time to stay with Marie and Victor, who, after fighting in the French army under Napoleon, purchases the chateau that once belonged to the Marquis de St. Caux.|$|E
25|$|Sim {{was among}} the top British film stars of the early- and mid-1950s, but his films of the late 1950s are {{considered}} by the critic Michael Brooke to be of lesser quality, because of poor scripts or lack of innovative direction. Sim made no films in the decade between 1961 and 1971; {{it is not clear}} whether this was, as Brooke suggests, because he found the scripts offered to him unacceptable or, as Simpson proposes, because film makers in the 1960s <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> unsuited to the kitchen sink dramas then fashionable.|$|E

25|$|After a {{classical}} education, Giovanni studied {{law at the}} University of Palermo following {{a brief period of}} study at Livorno's naval academy. Falcone and Borsellino met again at Palermo University. While Falcone drifted away from his parents' middle-class conservative Catholicism towards Communism, Borsellino was religious and conservative; in his youth he {{had been a member of}} the Fronte Universitario d'Azione Nazionale (FUAN), a right-wing university organisation affiliated with the neo-fascist Movimento Sociale Italiano. However, neither ever joined a political party, and although the ideologies of their political movements were diametrically opposed, they shared a history of opposing the Mafia. Their different political leanings did not thwart their friendship. Falcone wanted a naval career but his father <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> too independent-minded for the armed forces, and sent him to study law.|$|E
25|$|When a widow from Wigan built {{a cottage}} nearby in 1797 for {{seasonal}} lodgers, Sutton quickly {{built a new}} inn {{on the site of}} the bathing house which he called the South Port Hotel, moving to live there the following season. The locals <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> mad and referred to the building as the Duke's Folly, but Sutton arranged transport links from the canal that ran through Scarisbrick, four miles from the hotel, and trade was remarkably good. The hotel survived until 1854, when it was demolished to make way for traffic at the end of Lord Street, but its presence and the impact of its founder are marked by a plaque in the vicinity, by the name of one street at the intersection, namely Duke Street, and by a hotel on Duke Street which bears the legacy name of Dukes Folly Hotel.|$|E
25|$|Cowdrey tended towards {{caution and}} drew 15 of his 27 Tests in command, but won eight Tests, lost only four (two each to Australia and the West Indies). For {{one reason or}} another he only captained England in two full series, against South Africa in 1960 and the West Indies in 1967–68, and won both. He was a shrewd cricket captain with years of experience; Tom Graveney <b>thought</b> <b>him</b> the best captain he served under, and Graveney played under every England captain from 1951 to 1969. In the field Cowdrey {{preferred}} to set the best field for his bowlers and stick to it rather than make constant changes. His greatest asset was the care he took over his players, always thanking bowlers after they had bowled a spell and batsmen when they returned to the pavilion.|$|E
