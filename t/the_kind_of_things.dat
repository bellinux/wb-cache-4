500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—" [...] has immense energy, huge energy, {{and is the}} kind of woman who could do all <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth [...]" [...] Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. It is not like she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopper began {{painting}} {{urban and}} architectural scenes {{in a dark}} palette. Then he shifted to the lighter palette of the Impressionists {{before returning to the}} darker palette with which he was comfortable. Hopper later said, [...] "I got over that and later things done in Paris were more <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> I do now." [...] Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and café scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract cubist experiments, Hopper was attracted to realist art. Later, he admitted to no European influences other than French engraver Charles Méryon, whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though he}} was mentored by Democritus, Protagoras did not share his enthusiasm for the pursuit of mathematics. [...] "For {{perceptible}} lines are not <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> the geometer talks about, since no perceptible thing is straight or curved in that way, nor is a circle tangent to a ruler at a point, but the way Protagoras used to say in refuting the geometers" [...] (Aristotles, Metaphysics 997b34-998a4). [...] Protagoras was skeptical about the application of theoretical mathematics to the natural world; {{he did not believe}} they were really worth studying at all. [...] According to Philodemus, Protagoras said that [...] "The subject matter is unknowable and the terminology distasteful". [...] Nonetheless, mathematics was considered to be by some a very viable form of art, and Protagoras says on the arts, [...] "art (tekhnê) without practice and practice without art are nothing" [...] (Stobaeus, Selections 3.29.80).|$|E

2500|$|Specified at 5 to 50MiB/s, Nintendo {{cited the}} ROM cartridges' very fast load times in {{comparison}} to disc-based games. Few contemporary CD-ROM drives have speeds above 4×, and the competing consoles Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation have 2× drives running at about [...] with high latency. This can be observed on the loading screens that appear in many PlayStation games but are typically nonexistent in Nintendo 64 games. ROM cartridges are so much faster than contemporary CD-ROM drives that data can be streamed in real-time from cartridges {{as if they are}} additional RAM, thus maximizing the efficiency of the system's RAM. This was a common practice for developers in many games, such as Nintendo EAD's Super Mario 64 or Factor 5's Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine. Howard Lincoln said, [...] " [...] and those guys felt very strongly that it was absolutely essential to have it on a cartridge in order to do <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that we wanted to do with Super Mario." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{point it}} is my purpose to urge might perhaps be {{suggested}} thus: that Socialists and most social reformers of their color are vividly conscious of the line between <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that belong {{to the state and}} <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that belong to mere chaos or uncoercible nature; they may force children to go to school before the sun rises, but they will not try to force the sun to rise; they will not, like Canute, banish the sea, but only the sea-bathers. But inside the outline of the state their lines are confused, and entities melt into each other. They have no firm instinctive sense of one thing being in its nature private and another public, of one thing being necessarily bond and another free. That is why piece by piece, and quite silently, personal liberty is being stolen from Englishmen, as personal land has been silently stolen ever since the sixteenth century.|$|E

[...] Perhaps so; but I am not sure that the power of rubbing out is an advantage; at all events, we shall best discover what the pencil outline ought to be, by investigating the power of the black one, and <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> we can draw with it.|$|E
