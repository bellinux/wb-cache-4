50|$|The {{lessons learned}} were {{incorporated}} into the new <b>tactical</b> <b>concept</b> named neuer Schützenpanzer ("new IFV") in 1998. In 2002, the German Army (Heer) placed an order for the delivery of five pre-production vehicles and their logistics and training services {{at the end of}} 2004. On 8 November 2007, a budget of €3 billion to acquire 405 Pumas (excluding the five Pumas that had already been delivered to the German Army for trials) was agreed upon.|$|E

The ISA was given its classified budget of $7 million, a secret headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, and cover name, the <b>Tactical</b> <b>Concept</b> Activity. ISA included three main operations branches (Command, SIGINT and Operations), and an analysis branch, whose name {{changed over the years}} (i.e. Directorate of Intelligence, Directorate of Intelligence and Security). Colonel Jerry King became ISA's first commander.|$|E
50|$|Secondly, he was {{responsible}} for the <b>tactical</b> <b>concept</b> of a deep-lying centre forward. At the time, the majority of footballing sides adopted the WM formation, where the centre forward spearheaded an attack line of 3 forwards and 2 wingers. Sebes's tactic was to withdraw the centre forward back to the midfield, as well as dropping the wingers back to the midfield when necessary. This effectively created an extremely flexible 2-3-3-2 formation, allowing the team to quickly switch between attack and defense. The tactic also drew defenders out of position, as centre halves used to man-marking a centre forward would follow the deep-lying centre forward back to the midfield.|$|E

5000|$|Close {{quarters}} combat (CQC) is a <b>tactical</b> <b>concept</b> {{that involves}} physical confrontation between several combatants. It {{can take place}} between military units, police and criminals, and other similar scenarios. In warfare, it usually consists of small units or teams engaging the enemy with personal weapons at very short range, up to 100 meters, from proximity hand-to-hand combat to close-quarter target negotiation with short-range firearms. In the typical close quarters combat scenario, the attackers try a very fast, violent takeover of a vehicle or structure controlled by the defenders, who usually have {{no easy way to}} withdraw. Because enemies, hostages/civilians, and fellow operators can be closely intermingled, close quarters combat demands a rapid assault and a precise application of lethal force. The operators need great proficiency with their weapons, and the ability to make split-second decisions in order to minimize accidental casualties.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there is}} {{considerable}} overlap, close quarters combat is not synonymous with urban warfare, now sometimes known by the military acronyms MOUT (military operations in urban terrain), FIBUA (fighting in built-up areas) or OBUA (Operations in Built Up Areas) in the West. Urban warfare is a much larger field, including logistics {{and the role of}} crew-served weapons like heavy machine guns, mortars, and mounted grenade launchers, as well as artillery, armor, and air support. In close quarters combat, the emphasis is on small infantry units using light, compact weapons that one person can carry and use easily in tight spaces, such as carbines, submachine guns, shotguns, pistols, knives, and bayonets. As such, close quarters combat is a <b>tactical</b> <b>concept</b> that forms a part of the strategic concept of urban warfare, but not every instance of close quarters combat is necessarily urban warfare—for example, a jungle is potentially a stage for close quarters combat.|$|E
50|$|As {{its title}} would suggest, the Three Strategies of Huang Shigong is {{organized}} into three sections, {{which can be}} interpreted as a hierarchy of importance or as simple indicators of position in the work. The work itself states that all three types of strategy are necessary for different styles of government. Much of the work is concerned with administrative control, but some important <b>tactical</b> <b>concepts</b> are also developed. Generals are placed in a high position, and must be unquestioned once they assume command. Attacks should be swift and decisive.|$|R

30|$|Several reasons exist why {{answers to}} these {{questions}} are important. First, gamification has become a strategic imperative for leadership in numerous businesses and they seek {{answers to these}} questions. Second, businesses gain competitive advantage when adapting to customers and employees in this new digital age. Finally, profit margins may be positively affected by gamification through growth in customer loyalty, sales increases, and increased visits to web sites. Practitioners project incorporation of gamification technology {{at the highest levels of}} the enterprise. Gabe Zichermann, CEO of Gamification Co., asserted that gamification must occur at the level of strategic imperative for organizations. He believes the concept “has become a buzzword, for sure, but many enterprises have just scratched the surface of its potential. Over the next year, gamification is likely to morph from a <b>tactical</b> <b>concept</b> to a strategic imperative” (Zichermann 2013). In fact, he promotes in his new book how companies must recruit and retain talent from the ‘gamer’ generation and beyond (Zichermann and Linder 2013). Palmer (2013) adds evidence by stating “over the past year or so, gamification has become a central part of almost every enterprise business package”. Indeed, practitioners and academics alike must work together with the new ‘Digital Natives’ (original term by Marc Prensky 2001) who enter the workplace or classroom with mobile devices in hand.|$|E
50|$|The AGRA {{concept was}} {{developed}} during Exercise 'Bumper' {{held in the}} UK in 1941, organised by the commander of Home Forces, General Alan Brooke (himself a Gunner) with Lt-Gen Bernard Montgomery as chief umpire.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to identify the fi ghters’ technical and tactical activity indicators in order to determine indicator signifi cance regarding situational effi ciency and designation between winning and losing performances in a karate match. We scientifi cally observed a sample of 274 male contesters of 137 karate matches during the 2008 World Karate Championship in Tokyo. Each individual competitor was observed in maximum of three matches. The matches were recorded using a DVD camera in order to collect data for further analysis, and the sample was further described using 48 technical and tactical indicators of situational effi ciency and match outcome variables. The obtained results indicate that a karate match is composed of 91 % of non-scoring techniques and 9 % of scoring techniques in the total technique frequency. On this basis a signifi cant difference in the situational effi ciency between the match winners and the losing contesters has been discovered. Those two groups of fi ghters exhibit a statistically signifi cant difference (p< 0. 05) in 11 out of 21 observed variables of situational effi ciency in the table of derived situational indicators. A prevalence of nonscoring techniques suggests that energy demand and technical and tactical requirements of a karate match are in the largest extent defi ned by non-scoring techniques. Therefore, it would be a grave mistake to disregard non-scoring karate techniques in any future situational effi ciency studies. It has been discovered that the winners differ from the defeated contesters by a higher level of situational effi ciency in their executed techniques, which incorporate versatility, biomechanical and structural complexity, topological diversity and a specifi c <b>tactical</b> <b>concept</b> of technique use in the attack phase...|$|E
