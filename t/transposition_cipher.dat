25|$|The Greeks of Classical {{times are}} said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher</b> claimed to have been used by the Spartan military). Steganography (i.e., hiding even the {{existence}} of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair. More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink, microdots, and digital watermarks to conceal information.|$|E
25|$|Different {{physical}} {{devices and}} aids {{have been used}} to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher</b> (see image above). In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the cipher grille, which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own cipher disk, Johannes Trithemius' tabula recta scheme, and Thomas Jefferson's wheel cypher (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them rotor machines—famously including the Enigma machine used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II. The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.|$|E
50|$|Multiple anagramming is a {{technique}} used to solve some kinds of cryptograms, such as a permutation cipher, a <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher,</b> and the Jefferson disk.|$|E
50|$|Classical ciphers {{are often}} divided into <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers</b> and {{substitution}} ciphers.|$|R
25|$|Many anti-Stratfordians {{search for}} hidden {{messages}} {{in the form}} of acrostics and <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers,</b> although this approach is not so popular with Marlovians.|$|R
50|$|Gaines, in her {{standard}} work on hand ciphers {{and their}} cryptanalysis, gave a lengthy account of <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers,</b> and devoted a chapter to the turning grille.|$|R
50|$|The rail fence cipher (also {{called a}} zigzag cipher) {{is a form}} of <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher.</b> It derives its name from {{the way in which it}} is encoded.|$|E
50|$|Invented by Lieutenant Fritz Nebel (1891-1977) and {{introduced}} in March 1918, the cipher was a fractionating <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher</b> which combined a modified Polybius square {{with a single}} columnar transposition.|$|E
50|$|It is also entirely {{possible}} that the encryption system started from a fundamentally simple cipher and then augmented it by adding nulls (meaningless symbols), homophones (duplicate symbols), <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher</b> (letter rearrangement), false word breaks, and more.|$|E
50|$|After World War I, machine {{encryption}} made simple cipher devices obsolete, and grille ciphers {{fell into}} disuse except for amateur purposes. Yet, grilles provided seed ideas for <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers</b> that {{are reflected in}} modern cryptography.|$|R

40|$|<b>Transposition</b> <b>ciphers</b> are a {{class of}} {{historical}} encryption algorithms based on rearranging units of plaintext according to some fixed permutation which acts as the secret key.

50|$|The device {{made the}} {{solutions}} {{of a single}} transposition (<b>Transposition</b> <b>cipher)</b> easy. A message being study must be broken into likely columns, with these matched against each other, with the resulting bigrams (Digraphs) examined for their suitability.|$|E
50|$|Many {{transposition}} ciphers {{are similar}} to these two examples, usually involving rearranging the letters into rows or columns and then taking them in a systematic way to transpose the letters. Other examples include the Vertical Parallel and the Double <b>Transposition</b> <b>Cipher.</b>|$|E
50|$|During World War II, {{the double}} <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher</b> {{was used by}} Dutch Resistance groups, the French Maquis and the British Special Operations Executive (SOE), which {{was in charge of}} {{managing}} underground activities in Europe. It was also used by agents of the American Office of Strategic Services and as an emergency cipher for the German Army and Navy.|$|E
5000|$|VEST (Very Efficient Substitution <b>Transposition)</b> <b>ciphers</b> are {{a set of}} {{families}} of general-purpose hardware-dedicated ciphers that support single pass authenticated encryption and can operate as collision-resistant hash functions designed by Sean O'Neil, Benjamin Gittins and Howard Landman. [...] VEST cannot be implemented efficiently in software.|$|R
50|$|The {{most useful}} special device was the {{so-called}} automaton, a rapid deciphering machine developed {{for use on}} the American Diplomatic Strip Cypher Another machine developed, a type of comparator (Spezialvergleicher), to solve Japanese <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers</b> by dragging {{the end of the}} message through the cipher text.|$|R

5000|$|A single typical S-box or {{a single}} P-box alone does not have much {{cryptographic}} strength: an S-box could {{be thought of as}} a substitution cipher, while a P-box could {{be thought of as a}} <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher.</b> However, a well-designed SP network with several alternating rounds of S- and P-boxes already satisfies Shannon's confusion and diffusion properties: ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a regular}} {{columnar}} <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher,</b> any spare spaces {{are filled with}} nulls; in an irregular columnar <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher,</b> the spaces are left blank. Finally, the message is read off in columns, in the order specified by the keyword. For example, suppose we use the keyword ZEBRAS and the message WE ARE DISCOVERED. FLEE AT ONCE. In a regular columnar transposition, we write this into the grid as follows: 6 3 2 4 1 5 W E A R E D I S C O V E [...] R E D F L E [...] E A T O N C [...] E Q K J E U providing five nulls (QKJEU), these letters can be randomly selected as they just fill out the incomplete columns and {{are not part of}} the message. The ciphertext is then read off as: EVLNE ACDTK ESEAQ ROFOJ DEECU WIREE ...|$|E
50|$|Another form of <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher</b> uses grilles, or {{physical}} masks with cut-outs. This {{can produce a}} highly irregular transposition over the period specified {{by the size of}} the grille, but requires the correspondents to keep a physical key secret. Grilles were first proposed in 1550, and were still in military use for the first few months of World War One.|$|E
50|$|An {{exercise}} of the Dutch Army was covered in 1937. Very simple techniques, principally double <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers,</b> were used and these could be read without much difficulty. As a result, {{it was possible to}} establish the Order of battle of the Dutch units participating in the exercise down to the battalion level.|$|R
25|$|One of Marks's first {{challenges}} was {{to phase}} out double <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers</b> using keys based on preselected poems. These poem ciphers had the limited advantage of being easy to memorise, but significant disadvantages, including limited cryptographic security, substantial minimum message sizes (short ones were easy to crack), {{and the fact that}} the method's complexity caused encoding errors.|$|R
50|$|Other {{options include}} {{positioning}} of the significant letters next to or at certain intervals from punctuation marks or particular characters. Historically, users of concealment ciphers often used substitution and <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers</b> on the data prior to concealment. For example, Cardinal Richelieu {{is said to have}} used a grille to write secret messages, after which the blank spaces were filled out with extraneous matter to create the impression of a continuous text.|$|R
50|$|Substitution ciphers can be {{compared}} with transposition ciphers. In a <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher,</b> the units of the plaintext are rearranged in a different and usually quite complex order, but the units themselves are left unchanged. By contrast, in a substitution cipher, the units of the plaintext are retained in the same sequence in the ciphertext, but the units themselves are altered.|$|E
5000|$|In cryptography, a scytale ( [...] , rhymes {{approximately}} with Italy; also transliterated skytale, Greek σκυτάλη [...] "baton") {{is a tool}} used {{to perform}} a <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher,</b> consisting of a cylinder with a strip of parchment wound around it on which is written a message. The ancient Greeks, and the Spartans in particular, {{are said to have}} used this cipher to communicate during military campaigns.|$|E
50|$|The {{competition}} is organised into eight challenges, which are further subdivided into parts A and B. The part A challenge {{consists of a}} relatively simple cryptogram that is intended for beginning cryptographers. In later challenges the cryptograms become harder to break. In the past, part A cryptograms have been encrypted with the Caesar cipher, the Affine cipher, the Keyword cipher, the <b>Transposition</b> <b>cipher</b> and the Vigenère cipher.|$|E
50|$|The part B {{challenges}} {{are intended to}} be harder. These begin with relatively simple substitution ciphers, including the Bacon cipher and Polybius square, {{before moving on to}} <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers,</b> Playfair ciphers and polyalphabetic ciphers such as the Vigenère cipher, the Autokey cipher and the Alberti cipher. In the later stages of the competition, the ADFGVX cipher, the Solitaire cipher, the Double Playfair cipher, the Hill cipher, the Book cipher and versions of the Enigma and Fialka cipher machines have all been used. The 2009 challenge ended with a Jefferson Disk cipher, the 2012 challenge ended with the ADFGVX Cipher, the 2014 with the Playfair Cipher, and the most recent challenge ended with a sectioned Cadenus transposition.|$|R
50|$|But all is {{not lost}} if a grille copy can't be obtained. The later {{variants}} of the Cardano grille present problems which are common to all <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers.</b> Frequency analysis will show a normal distribution of letters, and will suggest the language in which the plaintext was written. The problem, easily stated though less easily accomplished, is to identify the transposition pattern and so decrypt the ciphertext. Possession of several messages written using the same grille is a considerable aid.|$|R
50|$|The puzzles {{are very}} diverse, the only common feature {{is that they}} require logical thinking. The players may face simple {{substitution}} and <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers,</b> steganography, graphic and multimedia ciphers, object with a clue hidden inside that must be destroyed, and more. As the years go and numerous experienced teams return to the game many times, the puzzles, especially those later through the game, tend to depart from the traditional schemes and feature very original principles and lines of thought, devised just for the occasion.|$|R
50|$|In cryptography, a <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher</b> is {{a method}} of {{encryption}} by which the positions held by units of plaintext (which are commonly characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a regular system, so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the plaintext. That is, {{the order of the}} units is changed (the plaintext is reordered). Mathematically a bijective function is used on the characters' positions to encrypt and an inverse function to decrypt.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} {{cryptology}} in Japan shows two things. First, {{the fact that}} substitution ciphers existed makes {{the failure of the}} Japanese to improve on the substitution cipher or to invent the <b>transposition</b> <b>cipher</b> much harder to explain. Second, the lack of a strong cryptographic tradition suggests - almost requires - a correspondingly weak cryptanalytic tradition. In fact {{there seems to be no}} cryptanalysis in Japanese history before the late 19th century.|$|E
50|$|In 1942 {{the chief}} of Abwehr, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, {{commissioned}} him to carry out security checks on their own cryptographic procedures. Menzer recognized blatant cryptographic weaknesses of the methods used, and {{in the summer of}} 1943 reworked all the manual methods used by the Abwehr. He introduced the ABC Schlüssel, Procedure 62 and Procedure 40, which were all double transposition (<b>Transposition</b> <b>cipher)</b> and substitution systems, as well as the Schlüsselrad or Cipher Wheel, a hand cranked autoclave.|$|E
5000|$|Historical pen {{and paper}} ciphers {{used in the past}} are {{sometimes}} known as classical ciphers. They include simple substitution ciphers (such as Rot 13) and <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers</b> (such as a Rail Fence Cipher). For example, [...] "GOOD DOG" [...] can be encrypted as [...] "PLLX XLP" [...] where [...] "L" [...] substitutes for [...] "O", [...] "P" [...] for [...] "G", and [...] "X" [...] for [...] "D" [...] in the message. Transposition of the letters [...] "GOOD DOG" [...] can result in [...] "DGOGDOO". These simple ciphers and examples are easy to crack, even without plaintext-ciphertext pairs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{book also}} include an {{exposition}} of encryption, including the public key RSA cipher and presciently expounds on {{the lack of}} privacy in the cashless society. Code examples are also given using the Sharp PC-320I to encode and decode the German Enigma machine. The books claims that the Enigma was kept secret for long periods because understanding it could compromise the American M-209 cipher machine, and that it was still being sold to other countries. Other encryption topics covered include Data Encryption Standard, Vernam cipher (one-time pad), pseudo random number generators, <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers,</b> and substitution ciphers ...|$|R
5000|$|Simple ciphers were {{replaced}} by polyalphabetic substitution ciphers (such as the Vigenère) which changed the substitution alphabet for every letter. For example, [...] "GOOD DOG" [...] can be encrypted as [...] "PLSX TWF" [...] where [...] "L", [...] "S", and [...] "W" [...] substitute for [...] "O". With even {{a small amount of}} known or estimated plaintext, simple polyalphabetic substitution <b>ciphers</b> and letter <b>transposition</b> <b>ciphers</b> designed for pen and paper encryption are easy to crack. It is possible to create a secure pen and paper cipher based on a one-time pad though, but the usual disadvantages of one-time pads apply.|$|R
