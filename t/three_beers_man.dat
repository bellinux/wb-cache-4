5000|$|The {{original}} gravity of a beer {{was the basis}} for determining taxation in both the UK and Ireland from 1880 until the late 20th century, and a legacy of that system remains in the largely arbitrary division of bitter into [...] "bitter", [...] "best bitter", and [...] "special bitter" [...] substyles. In continental Europe, the density of a beer in degrees Plato is sometimes used by a brewery to distinguish a particular beer produced in a line.
