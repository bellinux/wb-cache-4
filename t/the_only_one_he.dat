5|$|After high school, Southern Mississippi offered Favre a {{football}} scholarship, which was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> received. Southern Miss {{wanted him to}} play defensive back, but Favre wanted to play quarterback instead. Favre began his freshman year as the seventh-string quarterback and took over the starting position {{in the second half}} of the third game of the year against Tulane on September 19, 1987. Favre, despite suffering a hangover from the night before and vomiting during warm-ups, led the Golden Eagles to a come-from-behind victory with two touchdown passes. Favre started ten games during his freshman year and won six of them.|$|E
5|$|Asashōryū began 2004 {{with two}} {{consecutive}} perfect 15–0 tournament wins (zensho-yūshō) in January and March. Nobody had attained a zensho-yūshō since 1996; yet Asashōryū {{went on to}} add three more such titles after 2004, for a career total of five. Only Hakuhō, with twelve, Taihō, with eight, and Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi with seven, have recorded more 15–0 scores. His unbeaten run continued into the first five days of the May 2004 tournament, giving him a winning streak of 35 bouts in total, the longest run since Chiyonofuji's 53 in 1988. Although he was then upset by maegashira Hokutōriki, he gained revenge by defeating Hokutōriki in a playoff {{on the final day}} to claim the championship. On 27 November 2004, Asashōryū became the first wrestler to win five tournaments in a year since Chiyonofuji achieved the feat in 1986, and won his ninth Emperor's Cup. Asashōryū's below average 9–6 score in the Autumn basho of 2004, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> did not win, was attributed in part to the official ceremony for his marriage, which was held in August 2004 (although he had actually married in December 2002). The hectic social round that inevitably follows Japanese weddings affected his pre-tournament preparations, as it prevented him from doing any training.|$|E

50|$|Fear of the Unknown is more {{self-contained}} {{than most}} of Briley's solo albums, being <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> on which <b>he</b> played all the guitars himself, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> which <b>he</b> co-produced.|$|R
25|$|Bernhard Riemann {{made some}} famous {{contributions}} to modern analytic number theory. In a single short paper (<b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> {{published on the}} subject of number theory), he investigated the Riemann zeta function and established its importance for understanding the distribution of prime numbers. He made a series of conjectures about properties of the zeta function, one of which is the well-known Riemann hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The South African Board President's XI {{was again}} captained by Eddie Barlow. It also, {{for the very}} first time in a South African {{representative}} match, included two black players. Edward Habane played in both the first-class match (<b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> ever played) and the one-dayer. Sedick Conrad played only in the first-class match. The other players were: Darryl Bestall, Simon Bezuidenhout, Rupert Hanley, Pelham Henwood, Lee Irvine, Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards, Vintcent van der Bijl. Also Peter Swart played in the one-day match, but not the first-class match.|$|E
25|$|Francis {{returned}} to South Africa and later {{appeared in a}} single match for Eastern Province against the MCC team of 1927–28. He captained the Eastern Province team and made 11 and 14 himself in a curious match in which the MCC side was all out for 49 in its first innings, and then, set 186 to win in a low-scoring game, hit off the runs without losing a wicket. This was Francis's last first-class match and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> played in his native South Africa.|$|E

Lizzie reveals that she is visiting because she is pregnant.|$|R
25|$|In September 2001, Joe Sillett {{was hunting}} {{in his garage}} for a bat ahead of a Sunday match for his club side Brook in Surrey versus The Zombies. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> could find had {{a bad case of}} woodworm, and to repair the damage, Joe's father Bob carved out small curves towards the top of the bat, {{finishing}} it by hand and a Black and Decker power sander. In the match, using his oddly shaped bat, he scored 142 not out, and it was at that point Joe decided to found The Woodworm Cricket Company, with its now famous shaped bats.|$|E
25|$|New {{script editor}} Christopher Bidmead found himself {{faced with a}} serious problem from the outset {{of his time on}} the show. He {{ultimately}} deemed many of the stories left to him by Adams to be unusable, being too close to the humour-driven stories of the previous season. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> ended up using was The Leisure Hive, though only after heavily editing it. Bidmead asked a pair of writing friends to come up with what would be the second story of the season, Meglos, which ended up being {{regarded as one of the}} weakest shows in the series' history up to that point.|$|E
25|$|One day {{his father}} had promised {{to take him to}} a tannery the next day to see an engine that could run without a steam boiler. This tannery was located in Greenville, Ohio that {{his father had}} {{previously}} seen. When they arrived at the tannery the next morning, Lambert was disappointed to find that the building had burned to the ground the night before. He searched amongst the ashes and found the burned Otto gas engine. This was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> had ever heard of or seen. He took it apart to see how it was constructed. It was a slide valve coal gas engine.|$|E
60|$|The rough clothes {{which he}} had worn {{yesterday}} were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>he</b> had. They would, of course, serve his purpose better than his own, {{which he had}} left at Blakeney's lodgings yesterday. In half an hour he was dressed, looking a fairly good imitation of a labourer out of work.|$|R
50|$|Doubling as an {{offensive}} end, Brooker had his best statistical season in his rookie year, 1962. He caught four passes, three for touchdowns, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>he</b> would score during his career. He also made all 33 of his extra point attempts and kicked 12 of 22 field goals {{for a total}} of 87 points.|$|R
50|$|Eventually Thor {{turns up}} at the party, {{and he is not}} to be placated, nor withheld. Alternating with Loki's insults to him, he says four times that he will use his hammer to knock Loki's head off if he continues. Loki replies that for Thor alone he will leave the hall, because his threats are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>he</b> fears. He then leaves.|$|R
25|$|Forrest had 12 {{brothers}} and sisters, {{and half of}} them died of typhoid. Isaac and Bedford (twins), Fanny (Forrest's twin), Milly and Mary all died when Forrest was about 11. His father recovered but died from the effects five years later. So, he was 16, his brother John was 15, and then they {{went all the way}} down to 8 and under - Bill, Jesse, and Aaron with Jeffrey being born after. A few years later, Miriam remarried to John (sometimes James) Luxton, a marshal, and had three boys and a girl with him. At the outset of the Civil War, Forrest had a 10-year-old sister, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> had.|$|E
25|$|In Game 6, Damon {{sparked the}} Yankees with a 2-run {{single in the}} bottom of the 4th to give the Yankees a lead that they would not relinquish. Pettitte hurled 6 strong innings, {{allowing}} only one earned run. Mariano Rivera came on in the 8th for a 6 out save, but allowed an RBI single to Guerrero to make it a 3-2 Yankee lead. It was the first postseason run allowed by Rivera at home since 2000, and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> would give up in the 2009 postseason. In the bottom half, errors by Kendrick and Scott Kazmir gave the Yankees two insurance runs, and Rivera shut the door in the 9th to give the Yankees their 40th American League pennant.|$|E
25|$|Milan Bandić heavily used {{religion}} {{as an issue}} in the campaign, calculating that Josipović's agnosticism would be a turn-off for a largely Catholic country as Croatia. He constantly repeated <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> fears is God and that he was raised as a true believer and a humble Christian, also making claims that he has the support of the Catholic Church. Josipović largely ignored Bandić's attempts saying he would be the president of all Croatians no matter their religious beliefs. The incumbent president Stjepan Mesić was elected twice despite his atheism. However, the Bandić campaign used all tactics to force the issue, even distributing fliers in front of churches after the Sunday mass across the country urging believers to choose between the cross and a red star, referencing communism.|$|E

The boy behaves horribly and becomes disliked by all the gods, Þjálfi and Röskva being <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>he</b> finally learns to like. (Quark isn't based on any {{original}} Norse myths, but is an original creation of Peter Madsen.) The story continues in the next album.|$|R
25|$|Heading to meet Mendoza, the McCalls instead find Barnsby, who imprisons them. Under interrogation, William tells Barnsby that Mendoza is trading the rifles for the medallion. Barnsby orders {{his men to}} {{hang the}} McCalls. However, they escape, and follow Mendoza. Barnsby watches them leave, {{deciding}} to follow them to Mendoza, hoping to get the medallion and use the Gold to raise a new confederate army. When the McCalls catch up with Mendoza, he claims he knew nothing of Barnsby's plan. The Apaches acquire the rifles, but confront the group, as William has told Seeing Farther the rifles don't work. Running River orders them all killed, but Seeing Farther intercedes. Marisa is taken captive, with Mendoza's approval, as she was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> told the rifles were defective (unknown to Mendoza, Marisa had told Thomas, who had told William). The McCalls go to the village as Seeing Farther's guests, and he agrees to help them find the medallion. Infiltrating Navajo territory, they retrieve it, with Seeing Farther entrusting it to William and explaining how to use it.|$|E
25|$|The second work, {{targeted}} at a specialist audience, {{was not intended}} as a textbook but {{as a means to}} show Romanian grammar as it existed in reality; this was in contrast with Tiktin's 1891 teaching manual. Philippide discussed words selected from the dictionary by Alexandru Cihac, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> found respectable; and from writers, Moldavians especially: Ion Creangă foremost, but also Mihai Eminescu, Alexandru Odobescu, Costache Negruzzi, Petre Ispirescu, Costache Conachi and Vasile Alecsandri; and from the Moldavian chronicles, as well as a bit of Anton Pann. The book features many examples of the spoken language, some of them in the Moldavian subdialect. He believed the examples would help illustrate the development of the language's inflection and syntax; this methodology is unique in the annals of Romanian grammar works. Here, he introduced the (debated) notion that the Romanian literary language was not based on a particular subdialect, but resulted from each one's contributions. While the Wallachian form was previously dominant, the increasing output of Moldavian writers meant that, {{by the end of the}} 19th century, the written language had become a compromise between the two.|$|E
25|$|Inspector Davies and Poirot meet back at Fernley. The call to Dr. Sheppard {{has been}} traced. It {{was made from}} the local railway station, {{a few minutes before}} the late-night express train for Liverpool left. He has also found out that the woman in the lodge house saw Ralph Paton enter the grounds at 9.25pm. The {{fingerprints}} on the dagger are yet to be tested but Poirot has a theory that they will find only the dead man's prints on the handle. The missing letter from Mrs Ferrars is also a puzzle and Poirot summons Parker and asks him to state what is different about the study compared to when he helped break in the previous evening. Parker tells him of the differences – including the fact that the armchair was pulled out from its normal position and turned at a strange angle, something that catches Poirot's attention. Raymond is questioned about any strangers seen in the past week – <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> can recall was a young representative from a firm of Dictaphone manufacturers called Curtis and Trout – Sir Roger was considering buying one of their machines. Poirot reveals that he found a scrap of starched material in the summerhouse and theorises that it came from the dress of Bourne who is {{the only person in the}} house who has no alibi. Mr Hammond, the family solicitor, arrives and reveals that the dead man's will leaves the majority of Sir Roger's estate to Ralph – another motive for the murder. It is also revealed that cash to the sum of one hundred pounds is missing from Sir Roger's room. Ralph though remains the principle suspect and Poirot tells the assembled group that he knows they are all individually hiding something from him and that he means to find the truth.|$|E
50|$|It was in 1955 that Sterlé {{began to}} have his first {{financial}} difficulties. The launch of his two perfumes, Huit-huit and 2 Diam, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>he</b> created, were a financial disaster. He had refused, as usual, {{to take into account}} the cost of manufacture, and as a result was forced to sell the product for below the cost price. To balance the books, he was required to separate his collection of paintings, and property north of Paris.|$|R
50|$|Owing to a ban from {{international}} football after refusing to tour with the England under-23 side, Hudson didn't make his England debut until 1975, when sparkling performances earned him two call-ups by then England manager Don Revie. He {{starred in the}} team that beat 1974 FIFA World Cup champions West Germany 2-0 at Wembley, {{and then in the}} 5-0 destruction of Cyprus. However, injuries and clashes with Revie meant that those two caps were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>he</b> earned.|$|R

500|$|The Indians {{planned to}} use Tucker as their fourth outfielder for the 1949 season when he served mostly as backup to Doby. He was relegated mostly to pinch hitting duties, and {{finished}} {{the season with a}} [...]244 batting average in 20 games and under 200 at-bats. Due to his hitting struggles, Indians manager Lou Boudreau tried converting Tucker to a switch hitter to start off the 1950 season. Tucker was again set to be a backup outfielder in 1950. His performances during the year included hitting a home run, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> hit that season, in an 8–5 victory over the Brooklyn Dodgers; the teams raised $60,000 in that game to benefit sandlot teams in Cleveland. Tucker finished the season with a [...]178 batting average in 54 games, the lowest mark of his career.|$|E
500|$|It {{was from}} Minneapolis that Johnson was recruited, {{along with his}} {{defensive}} partner Taffy Abel, {{to play for the}} newly formed New York Rangers. Offered the position at the age of 28, Johnson insisted on a three-year contract as he believed it would be <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> would get. He made his NHL debut in the Rangers opening game on November 16, 1926 in a 1–0 victory over the Montreal Maroons. A rugged and physical defenceman, Johnson appeared in only 27 of the Rangers' 44 games as he suffered a broken collar bone early in the season, but still finished second on the Rangers with 66 penalties in minutes. [...] In 1927–28, his total of 146 penalty minutes led the team and was second in the NHL to Eddie Shore's 165. He added a career high 10 goals, and helped the Rangers win their first Stanley Cup. Additionally, he was voted by the fans as the most valuable player of either New York team.|$|E
500|$|In {{reviews for}} the debut album, Robert Yates of Q wrote {{that there was}} [...] "a nice self-deflating Morrissey touch to [...] ", while Jackie Hinden of Hot Press felt that [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] was [...] "like a Pretenders for the nineties". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian {{described}} the song as [...] "perversely pretty", while Leo Finlay of Music Week compared the song to Mazzy Star, and that it [...] "employs the current hip status of country music to devastating effect". Spins Eric Weissard said the song was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he</b> hated in Garbage's debut album, but reacted positively to the intro where [...] "backward guitars produce a chiming solo." [...] At the end of 1995, Melody Maker rated [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] the 49th best Song of the Year, writing up: [...] "In a year of sunny Britpop, reservoir supplies of ironic bubblegum pop-noir were dangerously low. This burst of mocking miserablism helped". The track {{has been described as}} Garbage's signature song, and in 2000 was ranked as 69th in a list of 100 Greatest Pop Songs Of All Time jointly compiled by Rolling Stone and MTV.|$|E
60|$|Brooke's face, {{as she did}} {{not fail}} to notice, {{hardened}} suddenly, and he felt an unpleasant embarrassment as he met her eyes. He had decided that he was fully warranted in taking any steps {{likely to lead to}} the recovery of the dollars he had been robbed of, but he was sensible that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>ones</b> <b>he</b> had found convenient would scarcely commend themselves to his companion. There was also no ignoring the fact that he would very much have preferred her approbation.|$|R
5000|$|Although his meddling {{with her}} {{personal}} affairs and insatiable curiosity frustrates Thirteen, House comes to respect {{her as a}} talented doctor and the two build a relationship of mutual trust and understanding of each other's personalities (and, occasionally, shared cynicism and/or sarcasm). Wilson later states that House is better with her on his team, saying [...] "He needs someone who doesn't need him. You're <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>he's</b> never really been able to suck into his crazy House vortex. Keeps him grounded, his ego in check." ...|$|R
