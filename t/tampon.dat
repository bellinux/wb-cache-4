5|$|Playtex-branded tampons were {{introduced}} in the 1960s and became the primary competition to incumbent Tampax. Playtex invented the plastic <b>tampon</b> applicator in 1973. It {{was one of the}} <b>tampon</b> manufacturers that were sued for aggressively advertising over-absorbent tampons, which led to toxic shock syndrome.|$|E
5|$|According to Energizer Holdings' 2012 annual report, Playtex Products LLC is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of household gloves, hand wipes and sunscreen, {{as well as the}} second largest producer of tampons in the US. The best-selling Playtex <b>tampon</b> is the Gentle Glide brand, which was first introduced in 1973. It also manufactures the Playtex Sport <b>tampon,</b> which targets young athletes. Both brands are sold in regular, super and super-plus absorbency. Playtex had a 29 percent share of a $550 million market for tampons in 1994 and a 30 percent share of a $780 million market by 2000.|$|E
5|$|Playtex Products {{continued}} to erode Tampax's' market share throughout the late 20th century. The two companies had divided the market almost evenly {{by the late}} 1990s. Both makers increased profits primarily by reducing the <b>tampon</b> count per box, and prepared to enter emerging markets, particularly in Asia, where many women still used homemade pads. In 1997 Procter & Gamble (P), makers of Always sanitary napkins and pantiliners, bought Tambrands for $1.25 billion, its largest acquisition up to that point, returning to the <b>tampon</b> sector almost two decades after pulling Rely from the market over Toxic Shock Syndrome concerns.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, <b>tampon</b> use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of Bejisa, Électricité de France (EDF) {{deployed}} 500personnel and 6helicopters to restore power on the island. Within three days, roughly 160,000residences were restored, considerably faster than previous restoration efforts in previous cyclones. By January9, {{all but a few}} dozen homes had power. In addition, water supply was largely restored within four days. A state of national disaster was declared for Réunion on January17, by Overseas Minister of France, Victorin Lurel. This declaration covered 16towns on the island: Les Avirons, Cilaos, L'Entre-Deux, L'Étang-Salé, Petite-Île, La Plaine-des-Palmistes, Le Port, La Possession, Saint-Joseph, Saint-Leu, Saint-Louis, Saint-Paul, Saint-Pierre, Salazie, Le <b>Tampon,</b> and Trois-Bassins. Insurance estimates indicated that €25million (US$33.8million) was needed for relief funding. Farmers were eligible for compensation under the disaster declaration; however, many voiced their skepticism following a lack of follow-through by the government to supply funds after Tropical Cyclone Dumile in January 2013. Ultimately, the affected farmers had to indicate their taxed losses by February26 to receive the assistance. By April 2014, all farmers affected by the declaration were compensated.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Philip M. Tierno Jr., Director of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology at the NYU Langone Medical Center, helped {{determine}} that <b>tampons</b> were behind toxic shock syndrome (TSS) {{cases in the}} early 1980s. Tierno blames the introduction of higher-absorbency <b>tampons</b> in 1978, {{as well as the}} relatively recent decision by manufacturers to recommend that <b>tampons</b> can be worn overnight, for increased incidences of toxic shock syndrome. However, a later meta-analysis found that the absorbency and chemical composition of <b>tampons</b> are not directly correlated to the incidence of toxic shock syndrome, whereas oxygen and carbon dioxide content is associated more strongly.|$|R

25|$|A <b>tampon</b> is {{a mass of}} {{absorbent}} material into a body cavity or wound to absorb bodily fluid. The most common type in daily use is disposable and designed to be inserted into the vagina during menstruation to absorb the flow of blood. The ancient Egyptians first invented disposable tampons made of softened papyrus around 2500 B.C. The ancient Greeks followed this with tampons made from lint wrapped around {{a small piece of}} wood. But it was not until 1929 that Earle Haas of Denver, Colorado first invented the modern <b>tampon</b> with an applicator. Dr. Haas submitted the design for patent in 1931, and in 1936, the <b>tampon</b> was first sold in the United States. He later gave his invention the brandname Tampax, which {{is still one of the}} main <b>tampon</b> brands today.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS {{cases were}} reported; 38 deaths {{resulted}} from the disease. The majority of women in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic tampons, particularly the Rely <b>tampon</b> created by Procter & Gamble. The Rely <b>tampon</b> was so super-absorbent that one by itself could, in fact, hold one woman's entire menstrual period flow. Unlike other tampons made of cotton and rayon, Rely used carboxymethylcellulose and compressed beads of polyester for absorption.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Although the {{incidence}} of reported cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) has declined in recent years, the disease continues to occur in menstruating women using the newer, less-absorbent <b>tampons</b> or barrier contraceptives. Extant <b>tampons</b> and other vaginal devices were {{tested for the ability}} to induce TSS toxin- 1 (TSST- 1) by a TSS strain of Staphylococcus aureus MN 8, a known high-toxin producer. Tested for the first time were 20 varieties of <b>tampons,</b> including 2 all-cotton brands newly introduced in the United States, a polyurethane contraceptive sponge, a latex diaphragm, and a polymer menstrual collection cup. Methods: All products were washed in sterile distilled water prior to use to reduce the effect of leachable chemicals. Duplicate experiments with unwashed products were also performed. Entire <b>tampons</b> and other test products were immersed in brain heart infusion broth plus yeast extract (BHIY) and inoculated with S. aureus MN 8, a known TSST- 1 producer. After incubation, the culture supernatants were assayed for TSST- 1 by gel immunodiffusion. Results: Except for all-cotton <b>tampons,</b> greater amounts ofTSST- 1 were detected in the supernatant fluid of washed <b>tampons</b> than detected in those which were not washed.

50|$|Following a {{controversial}} period of test marketing in Rochester and Fort Wayne, in August 1978 Procter and Gamble introduced superabsorbent Rely <b>tampons</b> to the United States market {{in response to}} women's demands for <b>tampons</b> that could absorb more menstrual flow without leaking or replacement.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Lil-lets {{launched}} a compact applicator range in direct competition {{to the market}} leader Tampax, followed in 2009 by a video advertising campaign that showed the key {{difference between the two}} brands.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1980, the Centers for Disease Control {{released}} a report explaining how these bacterial mechanisms were leading to TSS. They also stated that the Rely <b>tampon</b> was associated with TSS {{more than any other}} brand of <b>tampon.</b> In September 1980, Procter & Gamble voluntarily recalled its Rely brand of tampons from the market and agreed to provide for a program to notify consumers. Since the 1980s, reported cases of TSS have dramatically decreased.|$|E

25|$|Staphylococcal toxic shock {{syndrome}} is rare {{and the number}} of reported cases has declined significantly since the 1980s. Patrick Schlievert, who published a study on it in 2004, determined incidence at three to four out of 100,000 <b>tampon</b> users per year; the information supplied by manufacturers of sanitary products such as Tampax and Stayfree puts it at one to 17 of every 100,000 menstruating people per year.|$|E
25|$|It {{was shown}} later that higher {{absorbency}} of tampons {{was associated with}} an increased risk for TSS, regardless of the chemical composition or the brand of the <b>tampon.</b> The sole exception was Rely, for which the risk for TSS was still higher when corrected for its absorbency. The ability of carboxymethylcellulose to filter the S. aureus toxin that causes TSS may account for the increased risk associated with Rely.|$|E

25|$|The {{severity}} {{of this disease}} frequently warrants hospitalization. Admission to {{the intensive care unit}} is often necessary for supportive care (for aggressive fluid management, ventilation, renal replacement therapy and inotropic support), particularly in the case of multiple organ failure. The source of infection should be removed or drained if possible: abscesses and collections should be drained. Anyone wearing a <b>tampon</b> at the onset of symptoms should remove it immediately. Outcomes are poorer in patients who do not have the source of infection removed.|$|E
25|$|In 1890 {{antibody}} {{therapy was}} used to treat tetanus, when serum from immunized horses was injected into patients with severe tetanus {{in an attempt to}} neutralize the tetanus toxin, and prevent the dissemination of the disease. Since the 1960s, human tetanus immune globulin (TIG) has been used in the United States in unimmunized, vaccine-naive or incompletely immunized patients who have sustained wounds consistent with the development of tetanus. The administration of horse antitoxin remains the only specific pharmacologic treatment available for botulism. Antitoxin also known as heterologous hyperimmune serum is often also given prophylactically to individuals known to have ingested contaminated food. IVIG treatment was also used successfully to treat several victims of toxic shock syndrome, during the 1970s <b>tampon</b> scare.|$|E
