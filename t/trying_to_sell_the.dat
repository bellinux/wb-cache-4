The three men involved were D.C.P. Brooksbank, a salesman for a coal firm; J.W. Patterson, a sampler at the power station, and M. Ridley, a contractor. Their scheme was for Patterson to substitute samples of reasonably good coal for the samples of poor coal taken from the lorries. However they were found out only two days after starting the scheme, when a foreman at the station saw Patterson dropping a bag of cement into the sampling bin, and reported the incident. Ridley {{was found to have}} planned the fraud, and was jailed for a year, while Brooksbank was fined £150 and Patterson £75.|$|E

5|$|Rand wrote Night of January 16th in 1933. She was 28 and {{had been}} in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the Soviet Union, where her strong anti-Communist {{opinions}} had put her at risk. Rand had never written a stage play, but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille, and later in RKO Studios' wardrobe department. In September 1932, Rand sold an original screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios and quit RKO to finish her first novel, We the Living. She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while finishing her novel. By 1934 her agent was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> play and the novel, but both were repeatedly rejected. Red Pawn was shelved and Rand's contract for rewrites on it expired. Rand's husband, actor Frank O'Connor, was getting only minor roles with little pay, leaving the couple in financial difficulties. With the last of her money from Red Pawn exhausted, Rand got an offer for her new play from Al Woods, who had produced The Trial of Mary Dugan for Broadway. The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script. Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama, Rand turned Woods down.|$|E

25|$|On August 29, 1988, {{local media}} {{announced}} that Conrad Cafritz, {{heir to the}} Cafritz real estate empire, had signed an agreement that gave him control of Washington Harbour. CXS quietly began <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> property in 1987 (before the management controversay began), asking $225 million to $250 million for it. Negotiations with Cafritz began in summer 1987, {{and came to a}} quick resolution. Although no purchase price was publicly disclosed, the Washington Post reported that the sale was worth $200 million. (The city appraised the property at $116 million.) The deal was not an outright purchase. Under the terms of the agreement creating Washington Harbour Associates, CSX not only controlled the partnership but was also the sole landlord of Washington Harbour under a 198-year lease. CSX sub-leased the property to the tenants. Using a complex transaction involving a number of shell corporations, contracts Cafritz made with himself, and contracts Cafritz made personally with CSX Realty president Richard Beadles, Cafritz bought the land beneath Washington Harbour for $31 million. Cafritz obtained control (but not ownership) of the improvements to the property by purchasing CSX's interest in Washington Harbor Associates and taking over the 198-year lease. Cafritz then took further control of the property by leasing Washington Harbour to two new partnerships created by Cafritz solely for the purpose of controlling the property. Under the terms of these leases, Caftritz only took ownership of the improvements in 2182.|$|E
500|$|Biden campaigned heavily for Democrats in the 2010 midterm elections, {{maintaining}} {{an attitude of}} optimism {{in the face of}} general predictions of large-scale losses for the party. [...] Following large-scale Republican gains in the elections and the departure of White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, Biden's past relationships with Republicans in Congress became more important. [...] He led the successful administration effort to gain Senate approval for the New START treaty. [...] In December 2010, Biden's advocacy within the White House for a middle ground, followed by his direct negotiations with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in producing the administration's compromise tax package that revolved around a temporary extension of the Bush tax cuts. [...] Biden then took the lead in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> agreement to a reluctant Democratic caucus in Congress, which was passed as the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010.|$|E

500|$|The book, {{which was}} Rowling's debut novel, was written between {{approximately}} June 1990 and {{some time in}} 1995. In 1990 Jo Rowling, as she preferred to be known, wanted to move with her boyfriend to a flat in Manchester and in her words, [...] "One weekend after flat hunting, I took the train back to London on my own and the idea for Harry Potter fell into my head... A scrawny, little, black-haired, bespectacled boy {{became more and more}} of a wizard to me... I began to write Philosopher's Stone that very evening. Although, the first couple of pages look nothing like the finished product." [...] Then Rowling's mother died and, to cope with her pain, Rowling transferred her own anguish to the orphan Harry. Rowling spent six years working on Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and after it was accepted by Bloomsbury, she obtained a grant of £8,000 from the Scottish Arts Council, which enabled her to plan the sequels. She sent the book to an agent and a publisher, and then the second agent she approached spent a year <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> book to publishers, most of whom thought it was too long at about 90,000words. Barry Cunningham, who was building a portfolio of distinctive fantasies by new authors for Bloomsbury Children's Books, recommended accepting the book, and the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury's chief executive said it was [...] "so much better than anything else".|$|E

2500|$|During {{several years}} in the early 1960s, Mooney had discussions with Mitsubishi Motors {{regarding}} their MU-2. An agreement between the companies was reached in mid-1964: the MU2 would be fabricated in Japan but assembled by Mooney in the United States. The existing Kerrville facility and workforce was insufficient, so Mooney purchased [...] near the airport in San Angelo, Texas ( [...] to the northeast of Kerrville), set up an assembly line in an existing hangar, and built new support facilities. The MU2 sold slowly. This was partly because the same sales force that was selling the M20 line was also <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> much more expensive MU2. It cost about US$400,000, and marketing and selling such an airplane was different than selling a small four-seater. The company's management was also over-stretched.|$|E
2500|$|For the C6 Corvette GM {{wanted to}} focus more upon {{refining}} the C5 than trying to redesign it.(Corvette: Sports Car Superstar, Editors of Consumer Guide, 2005) However, this did not prevent GM from <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>the</b> C6 as being [...] "all new" [...] {{even though it was}} not. [...] The press immediately saw through the marketing ploy and GM's use of [...] "simply changing the part numbers" [...] to further the claim even though a large number of the parts were actually interchangeable between the C5 & C6. Car & Driver, along with Motor Trend quickly noticed the inaccuracy, noting that the C6 was more an [...] "evolution of the C5, instead of a complete redo". [...] This even lead C to term the C6 as the [...] "C5 and 11/16ths". GM did give the C6 a nice face lift; reducing the exterior body overhangs for a noticeably overall reduction in outward dimension. [...] The front headlights were also redone, deleting the traditional [...] "pop-up" [...] headlights, and thereby shedding a few more parts off of the list that could cause quality problems. [...] Beyond that, the majority of the C6 difference focused upon a concerted effort to upgrade the interior quality. Some are quick to point to a change in wheelbase between the C5 and C6, but here again it was smoke and mirrors. [...] The change was necessitated by the use of a different automatic transmission which resulted in the rear linkage points being relocated; thus presenting a [...] "longer" [...] wheelbase. [...] However, many people have studied the change and determined that it actually did nothing to alter the suspension geometry from the C5 and thus the [...] "smoke & mirrors" [...] idea that it was an [...] "all new" [...] geometry (NOTE: Interestingly, the C7 has returned to a [...] "shorter" [...] wheelbase more akin to the C5). [...] If one were to Photoshop the C5, C6, and C7's basic chassis' frame to all be one color, they would look the same. [...] So there was far more than just the front engine and rear transmission design of the C5 that was still very much present underneath the C6's skin.|$|E
