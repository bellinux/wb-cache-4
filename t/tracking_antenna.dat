50|$|The CIWS has two antennas {{that work}} {{together}} to engage targets. The first antenna, for searching, is located inside the radome on the weapon control group (top of the white-painted portion). The search subsystem provides bearing, range, velocity, heading, and altitude information of potential targets to the CIWS computer. This information is analyzed {{to determine whether the}} detected object should be engaged by the CIWS system. Once the computer identifies a valid target (see details below), the mount moves to face the target and then hands the target over to the <b>tracking</b> <b>antenna.</b> The track antenna is extremely precise, but views a much smaller area. The tracking subsystem observes the target until the computer determines that the probability of a successful hit is maximized and then, depending on the operator conditions, the system either fires automatically or recommends fire to the operator. While firing, the system tracks outgoing rounds and 'walks' them onto the target.|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 24 - 27, 1983 / Sheraton-Harbor Island Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaRecent {{events in}} the Falkland Islands, and in Israel/Lebanon, have made the {{tactical}} use of unmanned airborne vehicle systems a practical reality The control of the unmanned vehicles requires a radio uplink, a downlink for vehicle position determination, for telemetering monitored events and functions, and, in some instances, transmission of television or other information. While for some situations the ground antenna can be fixed, the majority of today’s applications require a steerable antenna. This is dictated {{by the fact that}} a high gain (and therefore, narrow beam) antenna is required for maximum range, and that for most scenarios, vehicle position must be determined. The increasing use of unmanned vehicles indicates the need for a low-cost <b>tracking</b> <b>antenna</b> system. Use of the <b>tracking</b> <b>antenna</b> in transportable and/or mobile systems calls for a lightweight system. A two-axis antenna, in addition to being heavy, is more than twice the cost of a single-axis <b>tracking</b> <b>antenna</b> system. Slant range of the vehicle is determined by the use of a ranging tone and ground range is determined by comparing altitude data telemetered back from an on-board altimeter with slant range. Complete positional data are obtained given the ground range and the bearing angle from the singleaxis <b>tracking</b> <b>antenna.</b> A microprocessor-based antenna control unit allows all systematic errors of the antenna system to be calibrated out of the angle data. A binomially fed, linearly polarized, folded pillbox horn antenna, having extremely low sidelobes, permits wide angle acquisition, and high elevation angle tracking without introducing bearing angle error. The use of graphite fiber materials for antenna and rotator construction provides savings both in cost and weight. A newly developed lightweight and low-cost single-axis <b>tracking</b> <b>antenna</b> that utilizes all these techniques is described in this paper...|$|E
