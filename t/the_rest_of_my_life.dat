In the letter, he said that he hoped to impress her with the magnitude of his action and that he would [...] "abandon the idea of getting Reagan in a second if I could only win your heart and live out <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> with you." ...|$|E
500|$|After the event, Jenner took an American flag from {{a spectator}} {{and carried it}} during the victory lap, {{starting}} a tradition that is now common among winning athletes.

500|$|Looking {{back at the}} {{creation}} of the album, guitarist Frank Iero was blasé about [...] the band received for this decidedly [...] "non-scene" [...] record. [...] "When we did Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, we didn't fit in," [...] he said. [...] "There was a little less screaming and a little more melody, but it was still us. Never was it a case of, 'Don't put that melody there because Hardcore Chuck, who took me to my first show at Fairfield American Legion Hall, {{is really going to be}} bummed at me.' I don’t give a shit: If I had to work at McDonald's for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> to play shows and ride in a shitty van on tour? I've done it. I'll do it again." ...|$|E

500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> because of James Brown." ...|$|E

He left Ryerson in 1985, {{several months before}} graduating, [...] to accept a position with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, where he spent five seasons performing. [...] "It was all I wanted, to be a classical actor for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life,</b> but during {{the last couple of}} years I was there, I started to realise that it wasn't for me. Perhaps I didn't have to give my Hamlet before I died, that the world might be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact." [...] McCormack appeared in the productions A Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry V, Murder in the Cathedral and Three Sisters. McCormack later performed with the Manitoba Theatre Centre in a production of Burn This, as well as with Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre in Biloxi Blues.|$|E

Smith told Robyn Harvey from The Sydney Morning Herald, [...] "I wanted Daphne to die.

[...] Daphne was critically injured during a car crash on the way to her father's funeral and she was left in a coma. Off-screen, representatives from the serial's production company tried to persuade Smith to sign a new contract, but she refused. Daphne briefly regained consciousness to say [...] "I love you Clarkey" [...] to Des, before becoming the first regular character to die.|$|E

500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E

After this I could do anything I want, for <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The positivity was so unbelievable". On August 31, 2004, Insane Clown Posse released their ninth studio album, Hell's Pit, the second exhibit of The Wraith, intended to warn listeners of the horrors of Hell. Bruce described the album as the darkest, most painful work he had ever done. Two versions of the album were released, each containing a different DVD.

According to her note, she immediately informed her mother, who reacted [...] "extremely negatively" [...] by claiming that it was only a phase and that God had made her a male, so she could never be a woman. She stated that this made her hate herself, and that she developed a form of depression. Her mother sent her to Christian conversion therapists, but Alcorn later related that here she only encountered [...] "more Christians" [...] telling her that she was [...] "selfish and wrong" [...] and [...] "should look to God for help."
