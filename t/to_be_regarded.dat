The correlation coefficient (R value) and its 95  % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for variables including the age and calculated VBD. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. R values from 0 <b>to</b> 0.25 <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> as indicating {{the absence of a}} correlation. Those from 0.25 <b>to</b> 0.50 <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> as indicating a poor correlation. Those from 0.50 <b>to</b> 0.75 <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> as indicating a moderate to good correlation. Finally, R values from 0.75 <b>to</b> 1.0 <b>were</b> <b>regarded</b> as indicating a very good to excellent correlation between the variables (Dawson and Trapp 2004).|$|R

5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural incompatibility of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these issues}} with {{censorship}} obscured and truncated the film {{for many years}} following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors as a highly original and accomplished work.

5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie accent very poorly, however, he won the part and it came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair did not speak for the entire period that Our Friends in the North was filming.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s Vaughan Williams came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as {{a leading}} figure in British music, {{particularly}} after the deaths of Elgar, Delius and Holst in 1934. Holst's death was a severe personal and professional blow to Vaughan Williams; the two had been each other's closest friends and musical advisers since their college days. After Holst's death Vaughan Williams was glad of the advice and support of other friends including Boult and the composer Gerald Finzi, but his relationship with Holst was irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883 Carvalho finally revived Carmen at the Opéra-Comique, with Adèle Isaac {{featuring}} in an under-rehearsed {{production that}} removed {{some of the}} controversial aspects of the original. Carvalho was roundly condemned by the critics for offering a travesty of what had come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as a masterpiece of French opera; nevertheless, this version was acclaimed by the public and played to full houses. In October Carvalho yielded to pressure and revised the production; he brought back Galli-Marié, and restored the score and libretto to their 1875 forms.|$|E

With some 5,300 men, he defeated 25,000 Russians led by General Michail Kachovski. Despite the tactical victory, Kościuszko had to retreat from Dubienka, as the Russians crossed the nearby Austrian border and began flanking his positions.|$|E

Despite releasing only three full-length studio albums in their seven-year career, Nirvana has come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> {{as one of the}} most influential and important alternative bands in history. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern rock and roll culture.|$|E

In 984, in obedience to a vision of St Andrew, he persuaded King Æthelred to appoint Ælfheah as Bishop of Winchester in succession to Æthelwold. In 986, Dunstan induced the king, by a donation of 100 pounds of silver, to stop his persecution of the See of Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Referring to {{the cases}} in which the High Court had upheld the wartime {{legislation}} allowing indefinite administrative detention, Kirby said that equivalent decisions in other countries had come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as embarrassing and incorrect, and should be likewise regarded in Australia. While conceding that the scope of the Parliament's powers with respect to defence will be greater in wartime than in peacetime, Kirby said that they could not extend so far as to displace fundamental constitutional requirements such as those in Chapter III.|$|E

5|$|The 1832 {{exhibition}} of Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm, a painting containing apparently gratuitous nude figures, met a hostile reception from critics. From then on, while Etty continued to paint nude {{figures for the}} rest of his career, he made a conscious effort to try to illustrate moral lessons with his work. This effort was not wholly successful, and he continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as a pornographer by some throughout his career.

The following paragraph is based on that description, it is not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> as a static ritual that always was observed, but as a descriptive enumeration of elements gleaned from several sources written over a period of several centuries. Mommsen, for example, notes that the monkey hardly can have been an ancient element in the execution ritual.|$|E

5|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham to a prosperous family. He was {{encouraged}} by his parents to pursue a career in music, and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. Consequently, he came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> in musical circles as an important but isolated figure. While still a student at the Royal Academy of Music Bax became fascinated with Ireland and Celtic culture, which became a strong influence on his early development. In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne. Later, he developed an affinity with Nordic culture, which for a time superseded his Celtic influences in the years after the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Rhodes, a {{sometime}} {{associate of}} McLaren {{and friend of}} the Sex Pistols, was similarly aiming to make stars of the band London SS. Early in 1976, London SS broke up before ever performing publicly, spinning off two new bands: the Damned and the Clash, which was joined by Joe Strummer, former lead singer of the 101'ers. On June 4, 1976, the Sex Pistols played Manchester's Lesser Free Trade Hall in what came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> {{as one of the}} most influential rock shows ever. Among the approximately forty audience members were the two locals who organised the gig—they had formed Buzzcocks after seeing the Sex Pistols in February. Others in the small crowd went on to form Joy Division, the Fall, and—in the 1980s—the Smiths.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} their repeated failures before Constantinople, {{and the continued}} resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began to project the fall of Constantinople to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> {{as one of the}} signs of the arrival of the end times in Islamic eschatology. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Apocalypse of Daniel, written either at about the time of the siege or a century later.|$|E
