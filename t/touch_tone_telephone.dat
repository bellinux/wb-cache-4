50|$|A {{vertical}} {{service code}} (VSC) is {{a sequence of}} digits and the signals star (*) and number sign (#) dialed on a telephone keypad or rotary dial to enable or disable certain telephony service features. Some vertical service codes require the dialing of a Telephone number after the code sequence. On a <b>touch</b> <b>tone</b> <b>telephone,</b> the codes are usually initiated with the star key, resulting in the commonly used name star codes. On rotary dial telephones the star is replaced by dialing 11.|$|E
50|$|This was a 746 type {{telephone}} {{which could}} transmit MF4 signalling, {{also known as}} DTMF <b>touch</b> <b>tones.</b> These <b>telephones</b> could only operate to exchanges that could deal with MF4 but they were used on PABX systems that used MF4 for internal calls from the 1970s. The TXE1 exchange could handle MF4 calls {{as early as the}} late 1960s. This was however a unique prototype exchange, which served customers in Leighton Buzzard: otherwise customers did not have access to MF4 capable exchanges until later models of the TXE4 system came into service in the late 1980s.|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} basic socioeconomic {{characteristics of}} new residents to North Dakota, the factors motivating their move, and their {{satisfaction with the}} North Dakota communities where they live. Data came from a 1997 {{survey of more than}} 700 new residents. New residents who responded to the survey were generally younger than the North Dakota population overall; about two-thirds were between 21 and 40 years old. The educational level of the migrants was also higher than that of the state's population overall; 47 percent of the new residents were college graduates and an additional 35 percent reported some college or post-secondary vocational/trade school attendance. About 48 percent of the new residents had previous ties to North Dakota. The new residents most often mentioned the following reasons for moving to North Dakota: looking for a safer place to live (59. 5 %), closer to relatives (50 %), quality of the natural environment (49. 5 %), lower cost of living (48 %), outdoor recreational opportunities (38 %), and quality of local grade/high schools (35 %). New job opportunities or transfers were central to many new residents' decisions to relocate. About 65 percent of the new resident households indicated that a new job or business opportunity, a transfer by a current employer, or a military transfer had been a key factor influencing their decision to move. Following their move to North Dakota, about 67 percent of respondents and 69 percent of their spouses or partners were employed full-time, while 12 percent of respondents and 11 percent of spouses were employed part-time. About 30 percent of the new residents moved to North Dakota alone, while 70 percent moved with others. About 66 percent moved with a spouse or partner and 40 percent moved with children. About 41 percent owned their current home, 45 percent rented, and 14 percent reported other housing arrangements. Household incomes covered a broad range, with about 30 percent reporting an income of $ 20, 000 or less the first year after moving while 23 percent had incomes over $ 50, 000. Most of the new residents had a number of telecommunications and computer-related capabilities available in their homes. Almost 99 percent had <b>touch</b> <b>tone</b> <b>telephones,</b> 96 percent had VCR players, 85 percent had telephone answering machines, 58 percent had personal computers, and 45 percent had computer modems. About 9 percent reported that the telephone service available to their home would limit the use of some telecommunications services or capabilities, and this percentage was more than twice as high in rural communities (15. 5 %) compared to urban centers (7 %). in-migrants, new residents, socioeconomic characteristics, North Dakota, Community/Rural/Urban Development,...|$|R

50|$|SurveyUSA is a polling {{firm in the}} United States. It conducts market {{research}} for corporations and interest groups, but {{is best known for}} conducting opinion polls for various political offices and questions. SurveyUSA conducts these opinion polls under contract by over 50 television stations (who also use the SurveyUSA {{market research}} to fine-tune their newscasts for higher ratings).The difference between SurveyUSA and other telephone polling firms is twofold. First, SurveyUSA does not use live call center employees, but an automated system. Taped questions are asked of the respondent by a professional announcer (usually a local news anchor), and the respondent is invited to press a button on their <b>touch</b> <b>tone</b> <b>telephone</b> or record a message at a prompt designating their selection. Secondly, SurveyUSA uses more concise language, especially for ballot propositions, than competitors. This can lead to diverging results, such as for California Proposition 76, where one version of the SurveyUSA question with a one sentence description, polled significantly differently compared to another version with a three sentence description (which was similar to a version of the question used by other pollsters, which used a five or six sentence question).|$|E

The 1650 and 1660 were 300 Baud, and the 1670 was 1200 baud. The 1650 could only dial Pulse. The 1660 had no sound chip of its own to generate <b>Touch</b> <b>Tones,</b> so a cable from the monitor /audio out was required {{to be connected to}} the 1660 so it could use the C64 sound chip to generate <b>Touch</b> <b>Tones.</b> The 1670 used a modified set of Hayes AT commands.|$|R
