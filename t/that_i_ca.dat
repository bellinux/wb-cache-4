Ca 2 +-mobilizing compounds activated p 38 and p 44 / 42 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Induction of apoptosis by the Ca 2 +-mobilizing compounds was suppressed by an inhibitor of p 38 MAPK but not by an inhibitor of p 44 / 42 MAPK.

When accumulation of [14 C]lactose by iodoacetate-inhibited starved cells was abolished within 1 s of commencement of transport, a phosphorylated disaccharide was identified by autoradiography.

After maximum lactose uptake (ca. 15 mM in 15 s) the cells were collected by membrane filtration and extracted with trichloroacetic acid.

Thus, it is not surprising <b>that</b> cardiac <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> is regulated by numerous pathways. This review will focus on changes in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> <b>that</b> occur during the cardiac action potential (AP), with particular attention to Ca 2 + -dependent inactivation (CDI), Ca 2 + -dependent facilitation (CDF) and how calmodulin (CaM) and Ca 2 + -CaM dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) participate in the regulation of Ca 2 + current during the cardiac AP. CDI depends on CaM pre-bound to the C-terminal of the L-type Ca 2 + channel, such that Ca 2 + influx and Ca 2 + released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum bind to that CaM and cause CDI. In cardiac myocytes CDI normally pre-dominates over voltage-dependent inactivation. The decrease in <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> via CDI provides direct negative feedback on the overall Ca 2 + influx during a single beat, when myocyte Ca 2 + loading is high. CDF builds up over several beats, depends on CaMKII-dependent Ca 2 + channel phosphorylation, and results in a staircase of increasing <b>I</b> <b>Ca</b> peak, with progressively slower inactivation.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the results of a study, carried out by recently developed amperometric bioelectrodes, on the interactions between carbonic anhydrase (CA) and the decarboxylating enzymes arginine decarboxylase (ADC), l-lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and l-ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). These are all pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzymes and catalyze the decarboxylation reaction of the respective amino acids, to give carbon dioxide and the corresponding diamine (agmatine, cadaverine, and putrescine, respectively). The rate of each decarboxylase catalyzed reaction was measured by monitoring the production of the respective diamine by a plant tissue diamino oxidase (DAO) based bioelectrode. DAO is the enzyme which catalyzes the oxidation of agmatine, cadaverine, and putrescine with the production of NH 3 and H 2 O 2. DAO-based bioelectrodes consist of an amperometric H 2 O 2 electrode, coupled to the biocatalytic membrane formed by a whole plant tissue (lentil cotyledon) containing the enzyme DAO, immobilized on a dialysis membrane by polyazetidine prepolymer (PAP). The bioelectrodes were calibrated and characterized in standard solutions of agmatine, cadaverine, and putrescine. Kinetic studies to measure decarboxylase activity were performed in the presence of different concentrations of ADC, LDC, and ODC, resulting in a lowest detection limit of 10, 25, and 10 U l− 1, respectively. The effect of bovine CA II (bCAII) was evaluated in the presence of 500 U l− 1 of each decarboxylase, showing a marked increase of the rate of the decarboxylation reaction.

Action potentials (whole cell perforated patch clamp) and <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transients (Indo- 1 fluorescence) were recorded from single isolated rabbit SAN cells, whereas intracellular cAMP content was measured in SAN cell suspensions using a cAMP assay (LANCE((R))). Our data show <b>that</b> the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient, like the hyperpolarization-activated "funny current" (I (f)) and the ACh-sensitive potassium current (I (K,ACh)), is an important determinant of ACh-mediated pacemaker slowing. When I (f) and I (K,ACh) were both inhibited, by cesium (2 mM) and tertiapin (100 nM), respectively, 1 micro M ACh was still able to reduce pacemaker frequency by 72 %. In these I (f) and I (K,ACh) -inhibited SAN cells, good correlations were found between the ACh-mediated change in interbeat interval and the ACh-mediated change in <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient decay (r (2) = 0. 98) and slow diastolic <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) rise (r (2) = 0. 73). Inhibition of the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient by ryanodine (3 microM) or BAPTA-AM (5 microM) facilitated ACh-mediated pacemaker slowing. Furthermore, ACh depressed the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient and reduced the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2 +) content, all in a concentration-dependent fashion. At 1 microM ACh, the spontaneous activity and <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient were abolished, but completely recovered when cAMP production was stimulated by forskolin (10 microM) and I (K,ACh) was inhibited by tertiapin (100 nM). Also, inhibition of the <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) transient by ryanodine (3 microM) or BAPTA-AM (25 microM) exaggerated the ACh-mediated inhibition of cAMP content, indicating <b>that</b> <b>Ca</b> (<b>i)</b> (2 +) affects cAMP production in SAN cells.

The contribution of electrical resonance to frequency selectivity was assessed from microelectrode recordings from hair cells in an excised preparation of the sacculus. Electrical resonance in the hair cell is demonstrated by damped membrane-potential oscillations in response to extrinsic current pulses applied through the recording pipette. This response is analyzed {{as that of a}} damped harmonic oscillator. Oscillation frequency rises with membrane depolarization, from 80 - 160 Hz at resting potential to asymptotic values of 200 - 250 Hz. The sharpness of electrical tuning, denoted by the electrical quality factor, Q e, is a bell-shaped function of membrane voltage, reaching a maximum value around eight at a membrane potential slightly positive to the resting potential. In whole cells, three time-variant ionic currents are activated at voltages more positive than - 60 to - 50 mV; these are identified as a voltage-dependent, non-inactivating <b>Ca</b> current (<b>I</b> <b>ca),</b> a voltage-dependent, transient K current (I a), and a Ca-dependent K current (I c). The C channel is identified in excised, inside-out membrane patches {{on the basis of its}} large conductance (130 - 200 pS), its selective permeability to Kover Na or Cl, and its activation by internal Ca ions and membrane depolarization. Analysis of open- and closed-lifetime distributions suggests that the C channel can assume at least two open and three closed kinetic states. Exposing hair cells to external solutions that inhibit the Ca or C conductances degrades the electrical resonance properties measured under current-clamp conditions, while blocking the A conductance has no significant effect, providing evidence that only the Ca and C conductances participate in the resonance mechanism. To test the sufficiency of these two conductances to account for electrical resonance, a mathematical model is developed <b>that</b> describes <b>I</b> <b>ca,</b> <b>I</b> c, and intracellular Ca concentration during voltage-clamp steps. <b>I</b> <b>ca</b> activation is approximated by a third-order Hodgkin-Huxley kinetic scheme. Ca entering the cell is assumed to be confined to a small submembrane compartment which contains an excess of Ca buffer; Ca leaves this space with first-order kinetics. The Ca- and voltage-dependent activation of C channels is described by a five-state kinetic scheme suggested by the results of single-channel observations. Parameter values in the model are adjusted to fit the waveforms of <b>I</b> <b>ca</b> and <b>I</b> c evoked by a series of voltage-clamp steps in a single cell. Having been thus constrained, the model correctly predicts the character of voltage oscillations produced by current-clamp steps, including the dependencies of oscillation frequency and Q e on membrane voltage. The model shows quantitatively how the Ca and C conductances interact, via changes in intracellular Ca concentration, to produce electrical resonance in a vertebrate hair cell. ...|$|R

40|$|Cycloheximide (actidione) has an {{immediate}} inhibitory effect on amino acid transport by nitrogen-starved or carbon-starved mycelium suspended in phosphate buffer. High concentrations of phosphate alone are slightly inhibitory; cycloheximide appears to potentiate {{the effect of}} phosphate. Ca 2 + reverses the inhibition of transport caused by phosphate plus cycloheximide. Ca 2 + did not relieve the inhibition of protein synthesis. Cycloheximide promotes a continual uptake of 45 Ca 2 + by the mycelium. The cumulative results suggest <b>that</b> (<b>i)</b> membrane-bound <b>Ca</b> 2 + is involved in amino acid transport, (ii) cycloheximide labilizes the membrane-bound Ca 2 +, and (iii) phosphate forms a complex with Ca 2 + making it unavailable for its role in transport. The effect of cycloheximide described above is observed within 1 to 2 min after addition of the antibiotic. This initial inhibition occurs more rapidly with 10 − 3 M cycloheximide than with 10 − 5 M cycloheximide. However, after a longer preincubation time, a curious inverse relationship between cycloheximide concentration and amino acid transport is observed. The mycelium incubated with 10 − 5 M cycloheximide remains strongly inhibited (unless the antibiotic is washed away). The mycelium incubated with 10 − 3 M cycloheximide recovers about 40 % of the transport activity lost during the rapid initial phase. We have no obvious explanation for the inverse effect...|$|R
