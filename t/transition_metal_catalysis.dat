40|$|The {{importance}} of C–H bond activation {{in a simple}} molecule to form a molecule with enhanced functionality can be easily understood from a study of biological processes at a molecular level where, for example, a specific enzyme selectively activates a chemically inert C–H bond and functionalises it to a useful product. This strategy is now being used for large scale industrial processes and has both social and environmental benefits. C–H bond functionalization is also of major importance in catalysis because {{of the possibility of}} constructing complex structural motifs from relatively simple precursors.

Much work has been done to better understand how to stabilize these compounds. Caulton has specifically worked on stabilizing a rhenium polyhydride.

This phototransient species, which is formed from excitation from light, is highly reactive, where the initial rhenium complex is not. If you could trap the highly reactive, short-lived state, then you can make a much more efficient catalyst.

5000|$|Trimethylenemethane is a neutral, four-carbon {{molecule}} {{composed of}} four pi bonds; thus, {{it must be}} expressed either as a non-Kekulé molecule or a zwitterion. The orbital energy levels of TMM reveal that it possesses singlet and triplet states; generally, these states exhibit different reactivity and selectivity profiles. A singlet 3+2 cycloaddition, when it is concerted, is believed to proceed under frontier orbital control. When electron-rich TMMs are involved, the A orbital serves as the HOMO (leading to fused products if the TMM is cyclic). When electron-poor (or unsubstituted) TMMs are involved, the S orbital serves as the HOMO (leading to bridged products if the TMM is cyclic). Cycloadditions involving the triplet state are stepwise, and usually result in configurational scrambling in the two-atom component.(1)The rapid closure of TMMs to methylenecyclopropenes (MCPs) is a general problem that affects the rate and yield of 3+2 cycloaddition reactions involving this class of reaction intermediates. The problem is generally less severe for five-membered, cyclic TMMs due to ring strain in the corresponding MCPs. When ring closure and TMM dimerization can be controlled, 3+2 cycloaddition affords isomeric mixtures of methylenecyclopentanes. Three classes of compounds {{have been used to}} generate synthetically useful TMM intermediates: diazenes, silyl-substituted allylic acetates and methylenecyclopropenes. <b>Transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalysis</b> can be used with the latter two classes, although polar MCPs may open under light or heat (see below).(2) ...|$|E
50|$|Alkyl sulfones may {{be reduced}} with sodium or lithium in liquid ammonia; however, the {{strongly}} basic conditions of these dissolving metal reductions represent a significant disadvantage. In alcoholic solvents, magnesium metal and a catalytic amount of mercury(II) chloride may be used. A wide variety of functional groups are unaffected by these conditions, including many that are transformed by dissolving metal reductions. Reductive desulfonylation with these reagents does not occur in reactions of β-hydroxy sulfones, due to the poor leaving group ability of the hydroxyl group.A significant issue associated with the reduction of allylic sulfones is transposition of the allylic double bond, which occurs in varying amounts during reductions by metal amalgams. and tin hydrides Palladium-catalyzed reductive desulfonylations of allylic sulfones do not have this issue, and afford allylic sulfones with high site and stereoselectivity.Aluminum amalgam (Al/Hg) {{may be used for}} the chemoselective reduction of α-sulfonylated carbonyl groups. Carboxylic acid derivatives, acetals, thioacetals, amines, alcohols, and isolated double bonds are all inert to Al/Hg. Selective desulfonylation may be carried out on β-hydroxy sulfones without reductive elimination. <b>Transition</b> <b>metal</b> <b>catalysis</b> is also useful for the stereospecific reduction of alkenyl sulfones. In the presence of an excess of a Grignard reagent, a palladium(II) or nickel(II) catalyst, and a phosphorus or nitrogen ligand, alkenyl sulfones are converted to the corresponding alkenes stereospecifically in good yield. On the other hand, dissolving metal and metal amalgam reductions are not stereoselective in general. Palladium catalysis is generally superior to nickel catalysis, giving higher yields and stereoselectivities.Alkyl and alkenyl sulfones with good leaving groups in the β position undergo elimination under reductive conditions to afford alkenes or alkynes. The Julia olefination exploits this process for the synthesis of alkenes from alkyl sulfones and carbonyl compounds. Addition of an α-sulfonyl anion to a carbonyl compound, followed by quenching with an acyl or sulfonyl chloride, leads to a β-acyloxy or -sulfonyloxy sulfone, which undergoes elimination under reductive conditions. Sodium amalgam may be used to accomplish the elimination step; however, the combination of samarium(II) iodide and HMPA is milder than strongly basic sodium amalgam and leads to higher yields in reductive elimination processes.|$|E

Using CO as a probe molecule, we observe that Au@Pd core-shell nanoparticles exhibit strong SERS activity.
