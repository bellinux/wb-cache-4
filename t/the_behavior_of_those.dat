Seeking aid from the British government (he proposed a joint expedition to conquer Jerusalem), he became unhappy with <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Britons whom he had counted on to advance his request, and he took them hostage and chained them. In 1868, as a British expeditionary force sent from India to secure {{release of the hostages}} stormed his stronghold, Tewodros committed suicide.|$|E

2500|$|Paracrine {{signaling}} {{is a form}} of cell-to-cell {{communication in}} which a cell produces a signal to induce changes in nearby cells, altering <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> cells. Signaling molecules known as paracrine factors diffuse over a relatively short distance (local action), as opposed to endocrine factors (hormones which travel considerably longer distances via the circulatory system), juxtacrine interactions, and autocrine signaling. [...] Cells that produce paracrine factors secrete them into the immediate extracellular environment. Factors then travel to nearby cells in which the gradient of factor received determines the outcome. However, the exact distance that paracrine factors can travel is not certain.|$|E

[...] The letter clarified the skeptical opinion on climate and denial: [...] "As scientific skeptics, we {{are well aware of}} political efforts to undermine climate science by those who deny reality but do not engage in scientific research or consider evidence that their deeply held opinions are wrong. The most appropriate word to describe <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> individuals is 'denial'. Not all individuals who call themselves climate change skeptics are deniers. But virtually all deniers have falsely branded themselves as skeptics. By perpetrating this misnomer, journalists have granted undeserved credibility to those who reject science and scientific inquiry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though {{evolutionary}} psychology has traditionally focused on individual-level behaviors, determined by species-typical psychological adaptations, considerable {{work has been}} done on how these adaptations shape and, ultimately govern, culture (Tooby and Cosmides, 1989). Tooby and Cosmides (1989) argued that the mind consists of many domain-specific psychological adaptations, some of which may constrain what cultural material is learned or taught. As opposed to a domain-general cultural acquisition program, where an individual passively receives culturally-transmitted material from the group, Tooby and Cosmides (1989), among others, argue that: [...] "the psyche evolved to generate adaptive rather than repetitive behavior, and hence critically analyzes <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> surrounding it in highly structured and patterned ways, {{to be used as a}} rich (but by no means the only) source of information out of which to construct a 'private culture' or individually tailored adaptive system; in consequence, this system may or may not mirror the behavior of others in any given respect."

With this mind, it only appears natural that the action of effective mentors could and would be an avenue to pass on leadership style and behaviors. This paper has drawn relatively concise parallels to the actions of both the leader and mentor...|$|R

Other ways that {{the success of}} environmental enrichment can be assessed quantitatvely by a range of behavioral and physiological indicators of animal welfare. In addition to those listed above, behavioral indicators include the occurrence of abnormal behaviours (e.g. stereotypies, cognitive bias studies, and the effects of frustration.

Teachers are regularly expected to provide curriculum and intervene regarding all forms of bullying, including cyber-bullying. Altering <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who bully is often the focus of interventions, with less attention being placed on victim impact. The purpose of this article was to provide educators with a review of evidence regarding the occurrence, impact, and interventions for victims of cyber-bullying. Evidence reveals that cyber-bullying can have emotional, social, and academic impacts but that there are very few documented, and even fewer evidence-based, programs for victims of cyber-bullying. We conclude by proposing that school-wide programs and support be developed and provided to victims...|$|R

For a look at trends predicted for advertising research in the 21st century, see Seven Trends for the Future. Dr. Robert Heath publishes the seminal and controversial monograph “The Hidden Power of Advertising” which challenged the traditional models used in advertising research and shows how most advertising is processed at an emotional level (not a rational level). His monograph leads to re-examination of in-market research approaches that compare <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who have seen advertising versus those who have not, such as the Communicus System, {{and the development of}} brand new pretesting systems such as the OTX AdCEP system.|$|R

This paper surveys the systems and their algorithms that can automatically learn <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> complex systems and diagnose the rootcauses of failures without the detailed knowledge of the system structures. We propose a unified common framework for automated fault diagnosis. Under the same framework, we present four case studies in different application domains, including program debugging, configuration troubleshooting and Internet service diagnosis, using different machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, Bayesian estimation, and treeaugmented naïve Bayesian networks. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed and compared. Finally, we provide some thoughts on the possibl...|$|R

Global environmental problems arise because the actions of some individuals or governments in one location hold serious implications for individuals and governments in other locations. There are global environmental policy problems because adversely-affected individuals (and governments) attempt to alter <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> responsible for global pollution. We develop a framework with which to analyze such global environmental problems. Our goal is to craft a resource management policy that will satisfy both those who seek a change and those who prefer the current situation. This environmental incentive policy will align {{the interests of the}} two parties. Incentive alignment is the policy problem in the global commons. That is, we must find ways to align interests through realigning incentives for individual and group behaviors. Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} sequential conflict resolution maneuvers of a continuous flow of agents through a finite control volume. Video analysis of real world traffic flows that exhibit self-organized capabilities is conducted to extract characteristics <b>of</b> <b>those</b> agents. A tool is created which stabilizes the input video and extracts motion from it using the background subtraction method. I discuss the tool in detail as I created it to be user friendly and easily modifiable for other uses. The aim of the video analysis I conduct is to determine characteristics of agents in self-organized traffic flow. Comparisons are made with agents under sequential conflict resolution schemes and those that exhibit these self-organized capabilities to determine if agents under sequential control can approach <b>the</b> <b>behaviors</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in self-organized environment. Flow geometries are studied and generalized {{with the goal of}} determining stability characteristics of arbitrary flow geometries. Stability analysis includes analytical proof of bounds on the conflict resolution maneuvers. M. S...|$|R
