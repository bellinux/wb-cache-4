40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>for</b> Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Part Three {{deals with the}} calculation of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Chapter Two focuses on legal regulation of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Chapter Two is divided in ten parts. Part One defines the beginning of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Part Two looks at the extension of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment. Part Three deals with the interruption of time [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In the Republic of Macedonia, the {{legislator}} {{has tried}} {{to solve the problem}} of late payment in commercial transactions by enacting the Financial Discipline Act. The justifications for enacting this Act were the illiquidity of the business sector and the implementation of the EU Directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions. Yet, the Act includes several differences in comparison to the regime envisaged in the Directive. The <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> governing the performance of monetary liabilities in transactions between economic operators (undertakings) are identical with those in the EU Directive; however, the Act does not regulate payment in installment and does not provide for an extension of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> unless expressly agreed. On the other hand, public authorities have a few privileges: <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> commercial transactions between public authorities and economic operators are identical with the <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> transactions between economic operators (whereas in the Directive <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> public authorities are shorter); contracts on perennial procurement are exempt from compliance with this Act; and particular categories of public authorities should comply with the general <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> commercial transactions as of 1 January 2016. Additionally, considering the prescribed misdemeanor sanctions applicable in cases where the debtor has failed to pay within the prescribed <b>time</b> <b>limits,</b> the purpose of the Financial Discipline Act remains unclear. Has it been enacted to increase or to reduce the liquidity in the national economy?...|$|R
