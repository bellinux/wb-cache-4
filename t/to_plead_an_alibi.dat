60|$|That tithes are due {{of common}} right is readily granted; {{and if this}} {{principle}} had been kept in its original straitness, it might, indeed, be supposed that <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>an</b> exemption was <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>a</b> long-continued fraud, and that no man could be deceived in such a title,--as the moment he bought land, he must know that he bought land tithed: prescription could not aid him, for prescription can only attach on a supposed bonâ fide possession. But the fact is, that the principle has been broken in upon.|$|R

A priest is to slay a sacrifice; <b>an</b> {{advocate}} is <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>a</b> cause; a priest is to offer his sacrifice, to the end that, by the merit thereof, he may appease; <b>an</b> advocate is <b>to</b> <b>plead,</b> <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> according <b>to</b> law; <b>a</b> priest is to make intercession, by virtue of his sacrifice; <b>an</b> advocate is <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> law, because amends is made.|$|R
50|$|Ethical {{definitions}} {{involve a}} wedding of descriptive and emotive meaning, and accordingly have a frequent use in redirecting and intensifying attitudes. To choose <b>a</b> definition is <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>a</b> cause, {{so long as}} the word defined is strongly emotive.|$|R

5000|$|Code {{pleading}} {{stripped out}} most of the legal fictions that had encrusted common law pleading by requiring parties <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> [...] "ultimate facts." [...] This means that <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>a</b> cause of action, the pleader has <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> each element and also allege specific facts which, if proven with evidence at trial, would constitute proof of that element. Failure to provide such detail could lead to dismissal of the case if the defendant successfully demurred to the complaint on the basis that it merely stated [...] "legal conclusions" [...] or [...] "evidentiary facts." ...|$|R

50|$|Occasionally, {{members of}} the Hmong ethnic group have engaged in bride {{kidnapping}} in the United States. In some cases, the defendant has been allowed <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>a</b> cultural defense <b>to</b> justify his abduction. This defense has sometimes been successful. In 1985, Kong Moua, a Hmong man, kidnapped and raped a woman from a Californian college. He later claimed {{that this was an}} act of zij poj niam and was allowed <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>to</b> false imprisonment only, instead of kidnapping and rape. The judge in this case considered cultural testimony as an explanation of the man's crime.|$|R

Pompey now marched against Tigranes, whose kingdom and authority were now severely weakened. Tigranes then sued for peace and met with Pompey <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>a</b> cessation of hostilities.

5000|$|Usually a demurrer attacks a {{complaint}} as missing {{one or more}} required elements of a claim. Those elements are usually attacked by showing that the plaintiff failed <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>an</b> essential element per se or facts that adequately support it (e.g., facts giving rise to an actionable duty running from the defendant to the plaintiff). Another method is to attack the entire cause of action itself as abolished or prohibited as against public policy (e.g., wrongful life is against public policy in most jurisdictions).|$|R

National and regional round procedures may vary, but in Oxford, each team will compete in between three to four preliminary rounds.

In every round, each team has 45 minutes (rebuttals inclusive) <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>a</b> case. Each team also has to prepare a set of written submissions for applicant and respondent before the oral phase of the competition begins.|$|R

40|$|Generally speaking, three burdens can {{be imposed}} upon {{a party at}} trial: the burden of pleading, the burden of {{producing}} evidence, and the burden of persuasion. Burdens of pleading specify {{the conditions under which}} factual/legal issues will be deemed to be included within a litigated case. They can be distributed any way the law maker prefers, although usually they are allocated to the party asking for a change in the status quo. There are exceptions to this general rule designed to respond to this or that policy concern, such as the requirement that criminal defendants <b>plead</b> specifically <b>an</b> <b>alibi</b> even though <b>an</b> 'alibi' is nothing but a general denial. Burdens of pleading are significant in that they create the scaffold of the trial; but they pose no interesting conceptual challenge, and thus they can be put asid...|$|R

60|$|The {{dinner was}} over; they retired to the library.

5000|$|The court noted [...] "one key {{difference}} between a rimless hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of purely vertical agreements) and a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy (i.e., a collection of vertical agreements joined by horizontal agreements)." [...] The {{key difference}} was that [...] "courts analyze vertical agreements {{under the rule of}} reason, whereas horizontal agreements are violations per se." [...] The court then commented on the plaintiffs' motives:This distinction provides strong incentives for plaintiffs <b>to</b> <b>plead</b> <b>a</b> horizontal conspiracy (either alone or as part of a rimmed hub-and-spoke conspiracy). The prospect of establishing a violation per se is much more appealing to plaintiffs than the potential difficulty and costliness of proving a § 1 claim under the rule of reason.|$|R
