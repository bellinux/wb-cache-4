5000|$|Velvet {{is a type}} of woven <b>tufted</b> <b>fabric</b> {{in which}} the cut threads are evenly distributed, with a short dense pile, giving it a {{distinctive}} feel. By extension, the word velvety means [...] "smooth like velvet." [...] Velvet can be made from either synthetic or natural fibers.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, usage for the <b>tufted</b> <b>fabric</b> became widely {{desirable}} for throws, mats, bedspreads, and carpets, {{but not as}} yet, apparel. Companies shifted handwork from the farms into factories for greater control and productivity, encouraged as they were to pursue centralized production by the wage and hour provisions of the National Recovery Administration's tufted bedspread code. With the trend towards mechanization, adapted sewing machines were used to insert raised yarn tufts.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{comparative}} advantage of Indonesian commodities in order to enter the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). This study uses the export data during the period of 2003 - 2013 among five ASEAN countries participating in the AEC, including Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. All data obtained from the UN Comtrade database following the Harmonized System (HS) at the two-digit classification level. This study applies dynamic revealed comparative advantage (DRCA) index developed by Edwards and Schoer (2001) which is the development of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index by Balassa (1965). The results show that Indonesia is ready to enter the AEC. From this research, there are several Indonesian main commodities which have comparative advantage in ASEAN, including fish, crustaceans, molluscs, aquatic invertebrates ones (HS- 03), edible fruit, nuts, peel of citrus fruit, melons (HS- 08), oil seed, oleagic fruits, grain, seed, fruit, etc, nes (HS- 12), lac, gums, resins, vegetable saps and extracts nes (HS- 13), rubber and articles thereof (HS- 40), paper & paperboard, articles of pulp, paper and board (HS- 48), special woven or <b>tufted</b> <b>fabric,</b> lace, tapestry etc (HS- 58), articles apparel, accessories, not knit or crochet (HS- 62), and vehicles other than railway, tramway (HS- 87). Those commodities are in line with Indonesian government export's strategy direction which mainly focuses on several sectors, including fishery, vegetable products, rubber, wood and wood products, textiles, and transportation. Therefore, Indonesian government should focus to improve those commodities in AEC.

50|$|The velour {{widely used}} in the {{manufacture}} of theater drapes and stage curtains is manufactured using the same weaving process as velvet: two sets of warps and wefts woven at the same time, with additional threads that will become the nap in between, then cut apart to produce the two separate <b>tufted</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Cotton velours used for this range from 16oz per linear yard to 32oz per linear yard, synthetic versions typically run 13oz to 32oz per linear yard.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the effectiveness of}} tufting in enhancing the through the thick-ness properties of non crimped fabrics. The response of tufted and untufted carbon/epoxy non crimped fabric composites produced using resin infusion is investigated in axial tension and compression and cyclic [± 45] loading. The out-of-plane response is studied in mode I and mode II delamination tests. Tufted material has significantly higher delamination resistance and lower in plane properties in tension and compression. Tufted and untufted non crimp fab-ric composites have similar response in shear {{in terms of both}} plastic strain and strength. Op-tical strain measurements allowed monitoring of the two dimensional damage field in cyclic experiments. Damage tends to be localised in untufted specimens, whereas it becomes more uniform across the width of specimens with tufts. Material models for untufted and <b>tufted</b> non-crimped <b>fabric</b> composites simulating both non-linear in-plane behaviour and delamina-tion damage were developed. Material parameters were estimated from experimental results, and both material submodels were implemented in a commercial explicit finite element code which allows the incorporation of delamination behaviour using cohesive interface elements. A comparison of experiments and finite element model results simulating coupons verified the implementation of the models...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{details the}} {{manufacturing}} {{processes involved in}} the preparation of through-the-thickness reinforced composites via the ‘dry preform–tufting–liquid resin injection’ route. Samples for mechanical testing were prepared by tufting a 5 harness satin weave carbon fabric in a 3 mm × 3 mm square pitch configuration with a commercial glass or carbon tufting thread, infusing the reinforced preforms with liquid epoxy resin and curing them under moderate pressure. The glass thread reinforcement increases the compression-after-impact strength of a 3. 3 mm thick carbon fabric laminate by 25 %. The accompanying drop- downs in static tensile modulus and strength of the same tufted laminate are below 10 %. The presence of tufts is also shown to result in {{a significant increase in the}} delamination crack growth resistance of tufted double-cantilever beam specimens and has been quantified for the case of a 6 mm thick <b>tufted</b> carbon non-crimped <b>fabric</b> (NCF) /epoxy...|$|R
