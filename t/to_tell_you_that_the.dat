500|$|That August, Brownlee {{received}} a letter from MacLean reading in part [...] "We have been instructed to commence action against you for damages for the seduction of Miss Vivian MacMillan." [...] Later that month, he took advantage of a recess in the federal Royal Commission on Banking and Currency, of which he was a member, to visit Allan MacMillan in Edson. [...] He spoke instead to Mrs. MacMillan, who initially refused to let him into the house and asked him to leave. [...] She eventually relented and let him in; he told her that pursuing the matter could ruin Vivian's future, to which she responded [...] "what about you?" [...] Concluding that the meeting was pointless, Brownlee parted by announcing [...] "I am not asking you to refrain from your action, but I want <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> allegation is not true and I will face them frankly and answer any questions ... If its money you are after, I haven't got it." ...|$|E

On the night of the attack, at 22:27, he received a text message from Lahouaiej-Bouhlel: [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pistol you brought me yesterday was very good, so bring five more from your friend's place. They're for Chokri and his friends". Molins, the French prosecutor, disclosed that Ramzi A. had a previous police record for petty crime and drugs.|$|E

"Suppose I had <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> a young man, {{carried away}} by an irresistible passion for an admirable and most virtuous young creature--whom {{everybody}} falls in love with--had consulted the dictates of reason and his heart, and had married.

I mean <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it is <b>you</b> who are {{suffering from}} the emasculating ravages of that same microbe. As for me, I am an inveterate opponent of socialism just as I am an inveterate opponent of your own mongrel democracy that is nothing else than pseudo- socialism masquerading under a garb of words that will not {{stand the test of}} the dictionary." ...|$|R
2500|$|The NOI has {{produced}} a number of videos promoting anti-American sentiments. NOI video titles include [...] "Conspiracy of the International Bankers", [...] "Conspiracy of the U.S. Government", [...] "Controversy with Jews", and [...] "Which One Will You Choose, the Flag of Islam or the Flag of America?"

2500|$|The IBM {{archives}} of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry {{about whether he}} said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as [...] "the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations". He said that [...] "IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I would like <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, {{as a result of our}} trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18." [...] Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, {{a family}} meeting took place {{to talk about}} the boy's future: None of his sisters-in-law was ready to finance his studies. As for his brothers, they {{considered}} him unsuccessful and considered to find him a job as a farmer or grocer's apprentice. Only his brother Mahmoud, who was a thirty years old single and worker at the ministry of Justice, decided to invest in his brother's education. Thanks to his support and aid, Bourguiba enrolled in Lycée Carnot of Tunis. Bourguiba stated in 1973 the reasons his brother supported him: [...] "As for [...] "si" [...] Mahmoud, I had forgotten <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> year I passed my certificat d'études primaires and lost my mother, he had just left Sadiki where he was an intern. He was in classe de seconde. I lived, myself in Tourbet El Bey. Every Friday and Sunday of every week, he came home to teach me. But he used, during his task, an unpreceeded brutality and savagery. He was in such a furry that he beat me like plaster. I was still not ten and my fear was so intense that I could not even focus or understand tasks that he asked me. Each time, panicked, the cleaning woman rushed to the window and cried for help. I was severely traumatized and I still wonder today how such a scandalous treatment has not finally overcame my intelligence and thirst for knowledge [...] He had indeed redeemed himself".|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Gareth spake very calmly, saying: [...] "Sir, {{that would}} be a pity for you to do, for I have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that,</b> whether I be a kitchen knave or no, {{nevertheless}} I have had to do with several good and worthy knights of fair repute. For I have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> one of these knights was Sir Launcelot of the Lake and that he made me knight. And I have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> another one of these was your own brother, Sir Perard, whom I overcame yesterday in battle and whom I would have slain only that this damsel besought his life at my hands. And I have <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Sir Perard is even now upon his way to the court of King Arthur, there to pay his duty to the King upon my demand upon him to that end." ...|$|R
