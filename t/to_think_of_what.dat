500|$|In {{the scene}} where the boys are talking to Chef, he leaves without {{answering}} the boys' sexual question, angrily saying, [...] "Dammit, children, why do I {{always have to be}} the one to explain all this stuff to you. Ask your parents for once!". This is in reference to Chef's tendency to give advice to the boys. While the children are trying <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is the most important thing for a man, Cartman says [...] "Ham?", to which Stan angrily replies, [...] "No, not ham, you fat fuck!". This exchange was used verbatim between the same characters in The Spirit of Christmas, the 1995 short film that was the precursor to South Park.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{elements}} of Klingon culture, {{such as the}} Emperor, and a general influence of Japanese culture with honor at the forefront, were first explored with the script for the two-part [...] "Kitumba". Writer John Meredith Lucas said that [...] "I wanted something that we {{had never seen before}} on the series, and that's a penetration deep into enemy space. I started to think of how the Klingons lived. Obviously for the Romulans we had Romans, and we've had different cultures modeled on those of ancient Earth, but I tried <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the Klingon society would be like. The Japanese came to mind, so basically that's what it was, with the Sacred Emperor, the Warlord and so on." [...] While the episode itself was later filmed for the fan production , Star Trek first visited the Klingon homeworld in The Next Generation episode [...] "", and the themes would be revisited through the series.|$|E
500|$|She {{had a small}} role in the 2005 romantic drama Shopgirl {{and played}} the {{babysitter}} of George and Kathy Lutz's children in The Amityville Horror (2005). For the latter role she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scream Scene and the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance. She later revealed that she almost did not audition for the film due to her fear of dogs. [...] " [...] Michael Bay has these gigantic [...] [...] And, when I went to audition for The Amityville Horror, I went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs were there, and I almost turned around. I was like, 'No, I'm not going to read for this film.' I actually used the dogs in my audition <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would scare me the most." [...] The Amityville Horror received generally negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success.|$|E
60|$|JOB ARTHUR. Everybody's used to your talk, Mr. Houghton, and {{for that}} reason it doesn't make much impression. What I meant to say, in plain words, was that we have <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> best for everybody, not only of ourselves.|$|R

500|$|Recurring guest actors for {{the series}} Eugene Simon, Julian Glover, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Finn Jones, and Ian Gelder, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, Pycelle, Mace Tyrell, Loras Tyrell, and Kevan Lannister, respectively, also made their final {{appearance}} in the series. Finn Jones, who was cast concurrently in the leading role for the upcoming television series Marvel's Iron Fist, spoke about his departure saying, [...] "I had been on Thrones for six years. It was yearly employment. Now I was at a crossroads and I had <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the future is. I was very blessed {{that something like this}} has come along at the right moment," [...] referring to Iron Fist. Eugene Simon also spoke about his learning of his departure, saying that the showrunners promised a [...] "huge scene" [...] for his character in the season finale, with Simon responding, [...] "for everything that you've done for the last six years, thank you. This is a wonderful way to go. I really, really appreciate it, and I look forward to doing it for you." ...|$|E
500|$|Foremost of the disorienting effects, {{to critics}} and scholars, is Whedon's use {{of sound and}} silence. While Buffy {{performs}} CPR, she cracks one of Joyce's ribs with a startling snap. After Buffy vomits on the floor, she stands in the back doorway listening to life carrying on: children playing, someone practicing a trumpet, and birds singing. Long pauses between dialogue create gaps that turn awkward as the characters try <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to say, made especially notable in a series famous for its rapid banter. The transition between the Christmas dinner scene and the living room scene is abrupt, {{and the sound of}} Buffy and Joyce shouting because they dropped a pie on the floor carries over into the silence of Joyce's lifeless face and Buffy standing alone in the living room. This effect is also used when shifting between Buffy's alternate version of her mother being [...] "good as new" [...] in the hospital and the paramedics trying to revive her. In the car on the way to Willow's dormitory, Anya is shot by a camera mounted on the front bumper, separated from the audience by the windshield. Xander, driving, faces the other way; neither of them speak and only the sound of the car can be heard. Joyce Millman at Salon.com writes of the sound issues, [...] "The effect was almost Bergmanesque in its starkness. The spooky stillness and the long, spacey pauses in conversation as characters struggled to articulate their feelings exaggerated the sense of time elongating and standing still." ...|$|E
500|$|Toriyama {{said that}} by {{the second half of}} the series, he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than drawing it, and that the battles became more intense by him simplifying the lines. He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become [...] "too square", so he intentionally made it more so. Years later he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborately, suggesting that he was not interested in the art. As the manga progressed, he struggled with the Android and Cell arc, feeling that the manga could not outdo the Freeza arc. He added time travel, but said he had a hard time with the plot, only being able <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do that week. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for it and changed his mind. Even after the Cell arc, Toriyama felt it could not end there and so continued to the Majin Boo arc. Having resolved it would be the finale, he decided to draw what he wanted and inserted comedy with Gohan's Great Saiyaman persona and the character Gotenks. However, he did not think of an ending until the final chapter. At the time, Toriyama said he gave Dragon Ball a low-key ending to make it seem as if the story might continue. But would later say he skipped 10 years ahead in the story to signal that it was truly the end. Wanting to make it clear that Goku's battles were over, and a new generation was taking over, Toriyama added a message to the ending for the kanzenban re-release of Dragon Ball which finished in 2004.|$|E

2500|$|Certain {{elements}} of Klingon culture, {{such as a}} general influence of Japanese culture with honor at the forefront, were actually first explored with the script for the planned two-part [...] "Kitumba" [...] episode for the unproduced 1978 [...] series.

2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Joshua and Caleb exhorted the Israelites not to fear {{and not to}} rebel against God. Just as the {{community}} threatened to pelt them with stones, God's Presence appeared in the Tabernacle. God complained to Moses: [...] "How long will this people spurn Me," [...] and threatened to strike them with pestilence and make of Moses a nation more numerous than they. But Moses told God <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the Egyptians would think {{when they heard the}} news, and how they would think God powerless to bring the Israelites to the Promised Land. Moses asked God to forbear, quoting God's self-description as [...] "slow to anger and abounding in kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression." [...] In response, God pardoned, but also swore that none of the men who had seen God's signs would see the Promised Land, except Caleb and Joshua.|$|E

The lyric tells how, though Dennis {{was born in the}} city and has always lived there, he has become sick of the overcrowding and pollution and is now just [...] "looking for some country life". Referring to Los Angeles, Dennis has been quoted as saying, [...] "It just makes me sick <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> happening here".|$|R
