500|$|Victor Lewis-Smith {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{thought that a}} spring onion risotto accompaniment to a pan fried seabass tasted so good {{that it would have}} been sufficient as a main course itself and was also quite pleased that crêpe suzette was served on a trolley for table side service. Claire Ogden visited the restaurant for the Metro newspaper shortly after it was first awarded a Michelin star in 2007. She thought that a John Dory main course was [...] "pristine", and overall thought that the star was well deserved. The only negative thing she had to say about the experience was a toffee foam served on top of a pear granita which she described as [...] "flimsy-flavoured". It was named the best restaurant in Britain by Les Routiers later that year. The critic from the Western Mail stated in 2008 that [...] "the menu is short and to the point, with around five choices for each course. <b>The</b> <b>wine</b> <b>list</b> is huge, an insurmountable challenge for me but another's utopia." [...] However, he remarked that the main course was [...] "genuinely brilliant food" [...] and deserving of its Michelin star.|$|E

[...] In On Her Majesty's Secret Service it is revealed that M's pay {{as head of the}} Secret Service is £6,500 a year, (£ in [...] pounds) £1,500 of which comes from retired naval pay. Although his pay is good for the 1950s and 1960s, it is never explained how M received or can afford his membership at Blades, an upscale private club for gentlemen he frequents in London to gamble and dine. Blades has a restricted membership of only 200 gentlemen and all must be able to show £100,000 (£ in [...] pounds) in cash or gilt-edged securities. Kingsley Amis noted in his study, The James Bond Dossier, that on M's salary his membership of the club would have been puzzling. As a personal favour to M, the staff at Blades keeps a supply of cheap red wine from Algeria on hand but does not include it on <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> <b>list.</b> M refers to it as [...] "Infuriator" [...] and tends only to drink it in moderate quantities unless he is in a very bad mood.|$|E

They watched the head waiter, with his little black imperial and beady eyes, a miracle of suaveness, deftness, and light-footedness, one moment bowing before a newcomer, his face wreathed with smiles, the next storming with volubility absolutely indescribable at a tardy waiter, a moment later gravely discussing <b>the</b> <b>wine</b> <b>list</b> with a bon viveur, and offering confidential and wholly disinterested advice. It was all ordinary enough perhaps, but a chapter out of real life. Their pleasure was almost the pleasure of children.|$|E
