5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized protest that took the issue of <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation</b> across the nation. The {{previous}} summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the explanation that taxing women while denying {{them the right to}} vote was a violation of America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation</b> before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the polls to demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E
5|$|Appeals to nonviolent {{resistance}} were unsuccessful. On September 11, 1791, {{a recently}} appointed tax collector named Robert Johnson was tarred and feathered by a disguised gang in Washington County. A man sent by officials to serve court warrants to Johnson's attackers was whipped, tarred, and feathered. Because {{of these and}} other violent attacks, the tax went uncollected in 1791 and early 1792. The attackers modeled their actions on the protests of the American Revolution. Supporters of the excise argued that there was a difference between <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation</b> in colonial America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.|$|E
5|$|The British Parliament's {{efforts to}} levy new taxes {{following}} the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation</b> {{was led by}} Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others. Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year. After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution. Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.|$|E

In essence, the Metropolitan Council operates in ways similar to the Minnesota Department of Transportation.|$|R
500|$|The Whiskey Rebellion (also {{known as}} the Whiskey Insurrection) was a tax protest in the United States {{beginning}} in 1791 during the presidency of George Washington. The so-called [...] "whiskey tax" [...] was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. It became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue for the war debt incurred during the Revolutionary War. [...] The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but American whiskey {{was by far the}} country's most popular distilled beverage in the 18th century, so the excise became widely known as a [...] "whiskey tax". Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or fermented grain mixtures into whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax. In these regions, whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the American Revolution, in particular against <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> local <b>representation,</b> while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers.|$|R

500|$|Anti-imperialist {{sentiment}} was on {{the rise}} among both native and Indian communities in Kenya following {{the success of the}} Irish War of Independence and the Russian October Revolution. Many indigenous Africans were deeply resentful that they had to carry the kipande identity certificate at all times, were forbidden from growing coffee, and had to pay <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> political <b>representation.</b> Various political upheavals occurred in Kikuyuland following the end of World War I, among them the campaigns of Harry Thuku and the East African Association which resulted in the government massacre of 21 native protesters in March 1922. Kenyatta had not taken part in any of these events, perhaps so as not to disrupt his lucrative employment prospects. [...] Kenyatta's interest in politics stemmed from his friendship with James Beauttah, a senior figure in the Kikuyu Central Association (KCA). Beauttah took Kenyatta to a political meeting in Pumwani, although this led to no firm involvement at the time. In either 1925 or early 1926, Beauttah moved to Uganda, although remained in contact with Kenyatta. When the KCA wrote to Beauttah and asked him to travel to London as their representative, he declined, but recommended that Kenyatta—who had a good command of the English language—go in his place. Kenyatta accepted, probably on the condition that the Association matched his pre-existing wage. He thus became the group's secretary.|$|R

25|$|Held from 16–20 June 1923, the {{congress}} was chaired by Musa Kazim. It was agreed to send another delegation to London, eschewing the more-radical policies which were advocated. A proposed campaign of non-payment of taxes, arguing no <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation,</b> was debated without a decision. Twenty-four resolutions were passed, including boycotts of Pinhas Rutenberg's Palestine Electricity Corporation and Jewish goods.

25|$|After 1765, growing {{philosophical}} and political differences strained {{the relationship between}} Great Britain and its colonies. Following the Stamp Act, Patriot protests against <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation</b> escalated into boycotts, which culminated in the Sons of Liberty destroying a shipment of tea in Boston Harbor. Britain responded by closing Boston Harbor and passing a series of punitive measures against Massachusetts colony. Massachusetts colonists responded with the Suffolk Resolves, and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a Continental Congress to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.|$|E
25|$|A colonial Assembly {{was created}} in October 1683. New York {{was the last of}} the English colonies to have an {{assembly}}. The assembly passed the Province of New York constitution on October 30, {{the first of its kind}} in the colonies. This constitution gave New Yorkers more rights than any other group of colonists including the protection from <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation.</b> On November 1, 1683, the government was reorganized, and the state was divided into twelve counties, each of which was subdivided into towns. Ten of those counties still exist (see above), but two (Cornwall and Dukes) were in territory purchased by the Duke of York from the Earl of Stirling, and are no longer within the territory of the State of New York, having been transferred by treaty to Massachusetts. While the number of counties has been increased to 62, the pattern still remains that a town in New York State is a subdivision of a county, similar to New England.|$|E

25|$|Isolated {{strands of}} liberal thought had existed in Western {{philosophy}} since the Ancient Greeks and in Eastern philosophy since the Song and Ming period. These ideas were first drawn together and systematized {{as a distinct}} ideology, by the English philosopher John Locke, generally regarded {{as the father of}} modern liberalism. The first major signs of liberal politics emerged in modern times. These ideas began to coalesce {{at the time of the}} English Civil Wars. The Levellers, a radical political movement, during the war called for freedom of religion, frequent convening of Parliament, and equality under the law. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the 17th century in England, culminating in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which enshrined parliamentary sovereignty and the right of revolution and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state. The development of liberalism continued throughout the 18th century with the burgeoning Enlightenment ideals of the era. This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several European monarchies throughout the 18th century. Political tension between England and its American colonies grew after 1765 and the Seven Years' War over the issue of <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation,</b> culminating in the Declaration of Independence of a new republic, and the resulting American Revolutionary War to defend it. After the war, the leaders debated about how to move forward. The Articles of Confederation, written in 1776, now appeared inadequate to provide security, or even a functional government. The Confederation Congress called a Constitutional Convention in 1787, which resulted in the writing of a new Constitution of the United States establishing a federal government. In the context of the times, the Constitution was a republican and liberal document. It remains the oldest liberal governing document in effect worldwide.|$|E

[...] A Colonial Assembly convened in October 1683, making New York the last colony to have an assembly. A constitution was drafted and passed on October 30, 1683, giving the colonists many rights, including the rights to no <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation.</b> However, upon learning of the constitution, James II declared it void.|$|E

500|$|The last {{of these}} pamphlets, Taxation No Tyranny (1775), was a defence of the Coercive Acts and a {{response}} to the Declaration of Rights of the First Continental Congress of America, which protested against <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation.</b> Johnson argued that in emigrating to America, colonists had [...] "voluntarily resigned the power of voting", but they still had [...] "virtual representation" [...] in Parliament. In a parody of the Declaration of Rights, Johnson suggested that the Americans had no more right to govern themselves than the Cornish people, and asked [...] "How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes?" [...] If the Americans wanted to participate in Parliament, said Johnson, they could move to England and purchase an estate. Johnson denounced English supporters of American separatists as [...] "traitors to this country", and hoped that the matter would be settled without bloodshed, but he felt confident that it would end with [...] "English superiority and American obedience". Years before, Johnson had stated that the English and the French were just [...] "two robbers" [...] who were stealing land from the natives, and that neither deserved to live there. After the signing of the 1783 Peace of Paris treaty, marking the colonists' defeat of the British, Johnson was [...] "deeply disturbed" [...] with the [...] "state of this kingdom".|$|E
500|$|Merrion did {{not want}} to pay a {{severance}} tax to both New Mexico and the tribe, and filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, along with such major companies as Atlantic Richfield (now part of BP), Getty Oil, Gulf Oil, and Phillips Petroleum (now ConocoPhillips), among others. [...] The case was not filed until 15 days before the severance tax was due. [...] In the hearing on the temporary injunction on June 17, 1977, Merrion argued that the tribe's severance tax was unconstitutional, violating both the Commerce clause and Equal protection clause, and that it was both <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation</b> and double taxation. In addition, the plaintiffs argued against the entire concept of tribal sovereignty, stating that it had been a [...] "legal fiction for decades." [...] U.S. District Judge H. Vearle Payne granted the temporary injunction and set the hearing on the permanent injunction for August 29, 1977. The oil companies showed up with approximately 40-50 attorneys, compared to 2 or 3 lawyers for the tribe. [...] Both sides made essentially the same arguments as for the temporary injunction. [...] Following the hearing, District court ruled that the tribe's tax violated the Commerce clause of the Constitution and that only state and local authorities had the ability to tax mineral rights on Indian reservations. [...] The court then issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the collection of the tax by the tribe.|$|E
500|$|When British {{authorities}} were planning {{how to deal}} with their rebellious North American colonies in late 1775 and early 1776, they decided to send a large military expedition to occupy New York City. [...] Two brothers, Admiral Lord Richard Howe and General William Howe, were given command of the naval and land aspects of the operation respectively. [...] Since they believed it might still be possible to end the dispute without further violence, the Howe brothers insisted on being granted diplomatic powers in addition to their military roles. [...] Admiral Howe had previously discussed colonial grievances informally with Benjamin Franklin in 1774 and 1775, without resolution. [...] General Howe believed that the problem of colonial taxation could be resolved while retaining the supremacy of Parliament. [...] At first King George III reluctantly agreed to grant the Howes limited powers, but Lord George Germain took a harder line, and insisted that the Howes not be given any powers that might be seen as giving in to the colonial demands for relief from <b>taxation</b> <b>without</b> <b>representation</b> or the so-called Intolerable Acts. [...] As a consequence, the Howes were only granted the ability to issue pardons and amnesties, but not to make any substantive concessions. [...] The commissioners were also mandated to seek dissolution of the Continental Congress, re-establishment of the pre-war colonial assemblies, acceptance of the terms of Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution regarding self-taxation, and to promise a further discussion of colonial grievances. [...] No concessions could be made unless hostilities were ended and colonial assemblies made specific admissions of Parliamentary supremacy.|$|E
