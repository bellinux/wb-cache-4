5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of iron ore deposits {{in the north of}} Sweden, Lappland became a frontier for industrial development, instead of an exotic wilderness of the Sami culture and midnight sun. Opportunistically, Carl Adam Victor Lundholm published his Lappland, det stora svenska framtidslandet (Lappland, the great Swedish land of the future). He engaged noted Swedish artists—such as Karl Tirén, Alfred Thörne, Per Daniel Holm and Hjalmar Lindberg—to create the illustrations. Since Bauer was an inexperienced illustrator by comparison, Lundholm tested his abilities by sending him <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>some</b> drawings of Sami people at Skansen.|$|E

Yaya Touré unleashed a 30-yard strike in the 11th minute which went only inches wide of the top corner of the goal, while Mario Balotelli had a curling shot from the corner of the penalty area in the 24th minute which was destined for the goal but for a strong, one-handed save from Sørensen.|$|E

50|$|In 2003 O'Shaughnessy {{made his}} senior {{championship}} debut in a Munster semi-final against Waterford. Both sides drew level on that occasion, however, Limerick lost the replay and continued their streak {{of bad luck}} that had lasted since 2001 when they were dumped out of the championship in the All-Ireland qualifiers. The next few years proved difficult for both O'Shaughnessy and for Limerick. In spite of coming close <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>some</b> hurling upsets, defeat seemed to be Limerick's lot.|$|R

5|$|In the quarter-final {{match against}} {{eventual}} champions France, Baggio came on {{as a substitute}} for Del Piero in the second half, and managed <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>some</b> scoring opportunities. The score remained 0–0, and the match went to extra time, although Baggio came the closest to scoring the golden goal, with a volley from a lobbed pass by Albertini, but his shot was put just wide of Fabian Barthez's far post. The match eventually went to a penalty shootout. Although Baggio converted his penalty, the shootout was won by the host nation, as Italy were eliminated on penalties in a World Cup for the third consecutive time. Italy's coach, was criticised for starting the recovering Del Piero ahead of Baggio, and for not allowing the two players to play alongside each other. Despite rumours that the substitutions had created a rivalry between the players, Baggio and Del Piero remain friends. Baggio stated in 2008 that he has great respect for Del Piero, and that there had never been disagreements between them. Del Piero in turn stated in 2011 that Baggio, along with Zinedine Zidane, was the best player with whom he had ever played.|$|E
5|$|This {{explains}} {{the most natural}} plans for both sides. White will try a minority attack on the queenside, {{in order to increase}} its space advantage and <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>some</b> weaknesses in the black pawns (e.g. an isolated pawn or a backward pawn). So White will try to use the advances b2–b4 or c4–c5 in good conditions, supported by the queen and the rooks on the c-file and the d-file. On the other hand, Black will try to keep the position closed, most importantly by keeping the c4-pawn where it is {{in order to keep the}} Bf1 at bay. This can be achieved by moves like b7–b6 and d7–d6, and sometimes the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f8–e6. The first move by Black has to be 10...d6! because otherwise White plays 11.c5! and gets a clear advantage immediately. For example 10...b6? loses a pawn to 11.Qd5 Nc6 12.Bxc7, and 10...0-0?! is bad because of 11.c5! Qxc5? 12.Rc1 Qe7 13.Rxc7 and White is winning already.|$|E

30|$|Such {{a process}} demands a {{distinct}} way of thinking: {{a high degree}} of open-mindedness, a willingness to postpone judgment {{on the nature of the}} problem, and a preparedness to experiment on the fly (Hassi and Laakso 2011). Dunne and Martin (2006) describe designers’ way of thinking as “integrative thinking,” an unwillingness to accept unpleasant tradeoffs and instead seek creative resolution of paradox. The means of creative resolution is “abduction,” reasoning from observed data <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>some</b> form of value, contrasted with “deduction,” which is concerned with deriving testable consequences from hypotheses, and “induction,” which is concerned with inference from observed phenomena (Dorst 2011).|$|R

25|$|The ambitious {{five-year plan}} for 1981–85, {{estimated}} to cost more than $18 billion, aimed at achieving a growth rate of 6.5% annually.

Other major goals were to increase production in agriculture and fisheries to make the country self-sufficient in food, and to develop energy, industry, and tourism to enable Morocco to lessen its dependence on foreign loans. The plan called for significant expansion of irrigated land, for increased public works projects such as hospitals and schools, and for economic decentralization and regional development {{through the construction of}} 25 new industrial parks outside the crowded Casablanca-Kénitra coastal area. Large industrial projects included phosphoric acid plants, sugar refineries, mines to exploit cobalt, coal, silver, lead, and copper deposits, and oil-shale development.|$|E
25|$|The four-game homestand {{concluded}} with a Sunday afternoon national TV game against arch-rivals New York Red Bulls. Despite a pre-game shower during warm-ups and with inclement weather approaching, the teams kicked off on time, but the game was stopped just shy of the 8:00 mark, because a powerful storm was about to settle over RFK. After the torrential rains eased somewhat, grounds-crew tried to {{remove some of the}} bigger puddles of water and play resumed after a delay of {{about an hour and a}} quarter. Despite epically sloppy conditions, United was able <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>some</b> excellent chances to score, but their finishing was not up to the task. NYRB punished the home team's mistakes when Bradley Wright-Phillips finished off a play that opened up when Franklin whiffed on an attempted clearance due to poor footing. The visitors extended their lead in the second half on a shot by Felipe. As the team had done 2 weeks earlier, a desperate United team was able to rally to gain a home draw. First, Marcelo Sarvas scored on a penalty kick, earned by Lloyd Sam, who was playing against his old team for the first time. The tying goal was scored on a header by Patrick Mullins after Birnbaum headed a long corner kick back into the box. With a mid-week trip to Montreal looming, United were clinging to the final post-season slot, holding a tiebreaker edge over Orlando City SC.|$|E
