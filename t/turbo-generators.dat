5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} to the ships by five electricity plants.

5|$|Electrical {{power was}} {{supplied}} by eight generators. Four were <b>turbo-generators</b> designed for naval use; these provided 1,250kilowatts each. The other four were diesel generators that supplied 850kilowatts each. Two smaller diesel generators—each provided 200kilowatts—supplied emergency power should the main system be damaged. Total electrical output was 8,400kilowatts, {{not including the}} emergency generators, at 450volts on an alternating current.|$|E
5|$|The ships had {{extensive}} electrical generator systems. Leipzig had three power plants that {{each had a}} 180kilowatt turbo-generator and a 180kW diesel generator; this gave the ship a combined output of 1,080kW at 220volts. Nürnberg had four generators which comprised two 300kW <b>turbo-generators</b> and two 350kW diesel generators, for a total output of 1,300kW, also at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|The vessels {{also carried}} the same {{electrical}} plant {{as in the}} older Roon-class ships. It consisted of four <b>turbo-generators</b> that delivered 260kilowatts at 110volts.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{monitoring}} and predicting the short circuit faults of the rotor windings of large <b>turbo-generator</b> systems. For {{the purpose of}} increasing efficiency and decreasing maintenance cost, a method that combines the HHT (Hilbert Huang Transform) with a wavelet has been studied. This method is based on analyzing a classical Albright detecting coil. Due to the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) of the HHT {{the exact location of}} a short circuit of rotor windings may be given. However, a part of the useful information is eliminated by the unreasonable decomposing scale of the wavelet. Based on the thermodynamics modeling method, this study was illustrated with a 50 MW <b>turbo-generator</b> system that is installed in Northern China. The analysis results, which have very good agreement with those of a previous study, show that the method of combining the HHT with a wavelet is an effective way to analyze and predict the short circuit faults of the rotor windings of large generators, such as supercritical <b>turbo-generator</b> systems and wind <b>turbo-generator</b> systems. This work can offer a useful reference for analyzing smart grids by improving the power quality of a distribution network that is supplied by a <b>turbo-generator</b> system...|$|R

5|$|Steam was {{provided}} by 12 Schulz-Thornycroft boilers, each of which had 2 fireboxes, {{for a total of}} 24. The machinery was divided into three engine and six boiler rooms. The wing turrets and their magazines further divided the machinery into three separated groups, thereby increasing survivability. The ships carried 2,700tons of coal, and were later modified to carry an additional 160tons of oil that was to be sprayed on the coal, to increase its burn rate. Electrical power {{was provided}} by eight <b>turbo-generators,</b> producing 1,280kW at 225V.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom <b>turbo-generators</b> rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for use when the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The RAF made {{a second}} attempt on 29 October, after {{the ship was}} moored off Håkøya Island outside Tromsø. Thirty-two Lancasters {{attacked}} the ship with Tallboys during Operation Obviate. As on Operation Paravane, No. 9 Squadron and No. 617 Squadron carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss, partially the result of bad weather over the target. The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. Tirpitzs 38cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns. Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sand bank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. Tirpitz retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared {{for her role as}} a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to only what was necessary to power the <b>turbo-generators,</b> and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to a novel hull which let her attain speed at far less power than other big liners, Normandie was filled with technical feats. She had turbo-electric transmission, with <b>turbo-generators</b> and electric propulsion motors built by Alsthom of Belfort. CGT chose turbo-electric transmission for {{the ability to use}} full power in reverse, and because, according to CGT officials, it was quieter and more easily controlled and maintained. The engine installation was heavier than conventional turbines and slightly less efficient at high speed but allowed all propellers to operate even if one engine was not running. This system also made it possible to eliminate astern turbines. An early form of radar was installed to prevent collisions.|$|E

Parsons' company in Heaton began to make <b>turbo-generators</b> for power stations and supplied power stations all over the world.

40|$|Abstract. For {{the complex}} status of fluid flow in stator radial {{ventilation}} ducts of large <b>turbo-generator,</b> the temperature distribution of stator is dramatically {{affected by the}} flow status of cooling medium in stator ventilating ducts. In this paper, a new ventilating ducts structure in stator is investigated. According to fixing a wind deflector on the stator teeth adjacent to the ventilation ducts, the fluid flow status of cooling air is changed flowing in stator ventilation ducts. For this reason, the effect of heat transfer in stator is changed. Taking an air-cooled <b>turbo-generator</b> as an example, considering the characteristics of fluid flow and heat transfer in <b>turbo-generator</b> ventilation system, the three-dimensional fluid flow and heat transfer coupling model is established. Using finite volume method, three-dimensional fluid field and temperature field control equations are coupling solved. Based on this, the velocity distribution in ventilating ducts is obtained. Besides that, the velocity distribution is studied with the cooling air flows into radial ventilation ducts at different incident angles.
