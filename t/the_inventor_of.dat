5|$|During the Suez Crisis of 1956, future Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson eased {{tensions}} {{by proposing}} {{the inception of}} the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, for which he was awarded the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize. As this was the first UN peacekeeping mission, Pearson is often credited as <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> <b>of</b> the concept. Canada has since served in over 50 peacekeeping missions, including every UN peacekeeping effort until 1989, and has since maintained forces in international missions in Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, and elsewhere; Canada has sometimes faced controversy over its involvement in foreign countries, notably in the 1993 Somalia Affair.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Auriga {{is often}} {{identified}} as the mythological Greek hero Erichthonius of Athens, the chthonic son of Hephaestus who was raised by the goddess Athena. Erichthonius was generally credited to be <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> <b>of</b> the quadriga, the four-horse chariot, which he used {{in the battle against}} the usurper Amphictyon, the event that made Erichthonius the king of Athens. His chariot was created {{in the image of the}} Sun's chariot, the reason Zeus placed him in the heavens. The Athenian hero then dedicated himself to Athena and, soon after, Zeus raised him into the night sky in honor of his ingenuity and heroic deeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of printed planar technologies greatly simplified {{the manufacture of}} many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. <b>The</b> <b>inventor</b> <b>of</b> printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951.Barrett, 1952,Niehenke et al., p.846. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's stripline soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially triplate and microstrip. The generic term stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate.|$|E

During his time on the varsity basketball team, Kansas won the national championship in 1952 and were NCAA tournament finalists in 1953.

5|$|David Hillis, one of DeLee's {{colleagues at}} the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, {{published}} a 1917 journal article about his invention of the fetoscope, {{also known as the}} head stethoscope. By 1922, DeLee published a report of a similar device. Though DeLee published his findings several years after Hillis, he claimed that he had been openly discussing his idea for the device over many years. The device became known as the DeLee-Hillis stethoscope. DeLee was also <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> <b>of</b> a catheter used to suction an infant's airway; the DeLee suction trap is still used after the delivery of a baby. He was one of the earliest physicians to advocate for the lower segment cesarean section.|$|E

5|$|In 2068, the New World Aircraft Corporation (NWAC) {{provides}} Brains, <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> <b>of</b> the Thunderbird machines of {{the humanitarian}} International Rescue organisation, {{with an open}} brief to design a revolutionary aircraft. Although Brains is ridiculed when he proposes an airship for the 21st century, NWAC accepts his blueprints and builds Skyship One, which will circumnavigate the world on its maiden flight with pre-programmed stopover destinations. Alan, Tin-Tin, Lady Penelope and Parker will represent International Rescue as special guests. Brains, meanwhile, is forced to remain on Tracy Island when Jeff decides that International Rescue requires a Thunderbird 6. Contracted to design this latest addition to the Thunderbirds fleet with no specification, Brains produces a range of concepts, {{all of which are}} rejected by Jeff.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene, Maggie spells EMCSQU with her blocks, a {{reference}} to Albert Einstein's mass-energy equivalence equation. A picture of Einstein also appears {{on the wall of}} Dr. Pryor's office. At one point Homer erroneously refers to Einstein as <b>the</b> <b>inventor</b> <b>of</b> the light bulb. Dr. Pryor compares Bart's proposed work among ordinary children to Jane Goodall's study of chimpanzees. Goodall was pleased to be mentioned in the episode, sending the program a letter, and Vitti an autographed copy of her book. The conductor of the opera the family attends is named Boris Csupowski, {{a reference to}} animator Gabor Csupo. The opera attended by the family is Carmen, by French composer Georges Bizet; the song that Bart mocks is a famous aria called the Toreador Song. Students at the gifted school have lunchboxes that feature images of the 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited and chess grandmaster Anatoly Karpov.|$|E
