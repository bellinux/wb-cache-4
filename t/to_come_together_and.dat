25|$|In {{its early}} years, {{the city was}} known as a {{deliberate}} reminder of an expression in the Qur'an, when it refers to Paradise. It took four years to build (764–768). Mansur assembled engineers, surveyors, and art constructionists from around the world <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> draw up plans for the city. Over 100,000 construction workers came to survey the plans; many were distributed salaries to start the building of the city. July was chosen as the starting time because two astrologers, Naubakht Ahvazi and Mashallah, believed that the city should be built under the sign of the lion, Leo. Leo is associated with fire and symbolises productivity, pride, and expansion.|$|E

25|$|Willow's {{earliest}} {{and most}} consistent relationships are with Buffy and Xander, {{both of whom}} she refers to as her best friends although they have their conflicts, and Giles as a father figure. Willow takes on the leadership role when Buffy is unavailable, and her growing powers sometimes make her resent being positioned as Buffy's sidekick. Some scholars see Willow as Buffy's sister-figure or the anti-Buffy, similar to Faith, another Slayer whose morals are less strict. In early seasons, Willow's unrequited crush on Xander creates some storylines involving the relationships between Xander, Cordelia, and Oz. Willow {{is part of a}} powerful quartet: she represents the spirit, Giles intelligence, Xander heart, and Buffy strength of the Scoobies. Although they often drift apart, they are forced <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> work in these roles to defeat forces they are unable to fight individually.|$|E

25|$|After {{the merger}} between Square and Enix in 2003, many rookie staff members {{had to be}} trained and there were more new {{platforms}} to develop for {{with the release of}} the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Toriyama decided to assemble and direct a team of scenario writers and joined various game projects. He later collaborated with Final Fantasy X main programmer Koji Sugimoto and supervisor Yoshinori Kitase to create a Final Fantasy VII tech demo for the PlayStation 3. Development of this took around 6 weeks. During the first year after the development start of Final Fantasy XIII in April 2004, Toriyama thought up a story premised on the Fabula Nova Crystallis mythology created by Kazushige Nojima. In March 2006, when the structural part of the narrative started <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> lead scenario writer Daisuke Watanabe joined the team, Toriyama showed him a rough outline of what he had written and asked him to flesh out the story and to correct how everything would connect.|$|E

In 2012, she attended the Audre Lorde Legacy Cultural Festival in Chicago with filmmaker Dagmar Schultz presenting the documentary [...] "Audre Lorde - The Berlin Years 1984 to 1992". Hügel-Marshall has a positive relationship with Chicago, as it was here she found her father.|$|E

He was substantially inspired by Marcus Garvey, and had anti-imperialist and pan-Africanist themes in many of his songs, such as [...] "Zimbabwe", [...] "Exodus", [...] "Survival", [...] "Blackman Redemption", and [...] "Redemption Song". [...] "Redemption Song" [...] draws influence from a speech given by Marcus Garvey in Nova Scotia, 1937. Marley held that independence of African countries from European domination was a victory for all those in the African diaspora. In the song [...] "Africa Unite", he sings of a desire for all peoples of the African diaspora <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> fight against [...] "Babylon"; similarly, in the song [...] "Zimbabwe", he marks the liberation of the whole continent of Africa, and evokes calls for unity between all Africans, {{both within and outside}} Africa.|$|E

However, Will stands Sa5m up, breaking the date for a concert with Charlotte. [...] After that, Sa5m starts ignoring Will at school; he visits her house, hoping to apologize. Her mom shows him a video of a younger Sa5m performing [...] "Everything I Own", leading Sa5m to be outraged and order Will to leave. As an apology, he makes a touching documentary short about her for his Human Studies project (with the song [...] "Young Folks" [...] included in it) and she eventually forgives him.|$|E
500|$|The Pickford {{brothers}} {{included a}} couple of easter egg references. One of them revolved around {{the name of one}} of the tavern keepers, Newton N. Ridley, which is a play off the brewery Newton and Ridley from the British soap opera Coronation Street. Another easter egg reference was made to Dragon Warrior with regards to the princesses Kuros must save during the game. Upon saving a princess, she asks Kuros to marry her, prompting a yes/no response for the player; if the player selects [...] "no", the princess responds with [...] "If you refuse, my heart will surely break!" [...] and prompts the yes/no response again - similar to the [...] "but thou must" [...] response in Dragon Warrior. In addition, as all three princesses will have committed to marrying all three forms of Kuros, the original plan for the game's ending was for the three princesses <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>together</b> <b>and</b> see their heroes whom they were going to marry, only to find out all three princesses promised to marry the same person. To rectify the situation, Pickford called for what he referred to as [...] "the ultimate cheapo cop-out", where a UFO abducts Kuros with a teleport beam, sending him into the future and setting the stage for the next sequel which would have been called Lasersword. However, this never came to be.|$|E
