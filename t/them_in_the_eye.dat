50|$|These creatures have nocturnal habits. Also, {{due to the}} {{position}} of their feet, one can never quite tell from which direction the beings are moving from by looking at their footprints.

60|$|The {{notion that}} the value of a thing bears any {{necessary}} relation to the amount of labour (average or otherwise) bestowed upon it, is a fallacy which needs no further refutation than it has already received.
