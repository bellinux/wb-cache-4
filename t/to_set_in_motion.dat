5|$|Julia's suspicions {{regarding}} Macrinus' {{involvement in}} the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of her grandson, Elagabalus, as the rightful emperor. At the time Elagabalus was the chief priest of the Phoenician god Elagabal in Emesa. The soldiers nearby frequently visited the temple where Elagabalus was chief priest, to watch him perform his rituals and ceremonies. At one of these visits, Julia Maesa took the opportunity to inform the soldiers, it is not known whether truthfully, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's son. Simultaneously, she may have seen the opportunity to use her family's wealth and prestige <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> her plot.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} text-based {{graphics}} and is open-ended with no main objectives. Before playing, the player has <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> {{a process which}} generates worlds with continents, oceans and histories documenting civilizations. The main game mode, Fortress mode, consists of selecting a suitable site from the generated-world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like goblin invasions, generating wealth {{and taking care of}} the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its individual personality, has likes or dislikes and specific trainable skills in various labors. The second main game mode, Adventure mode, is a turn-based, open-ended roguelike where the player starts off as an adventurer in the world and is free to explore, complete quests, or even visit old abandoned fortresses. The combat system is anatomically detailed with combat logs describing organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and limbs getting severed.|$|E
5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but their {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the following years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E

25|$|With some hesitance, Gherman Pântea {{endorsed}} the Republic's union with Romania, affiliating {{with the local}} Bessarabian Peasants' Party, then with Romania's National Liberals. Having parallel careers as teacher, lawyer and journalist, Pântea remained a presence in Romanian political life, as member of Parliament, negotiator of détente with the Soviet Union, and three times Mayor of Chișinău. He was however mistrusted for his defense of arrested Bolsheviks, his critique of centralized government, and his alleged corruption. During World War II, Pântea was Mayor of Odessa under a Romanian occupation. He intervened to save Jews from the 1941 Odessa massacre and the subsequent deportations to camps in Transnistria. He had a tumultuous relationship with Ion Antonescu, the Romanian dictator, and was kept in check by the occupation authority. His administration managed <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> a plan for Odessa, and helped the city overcome devastation through the adoption of free trade, but also created various controversies.|$|E

Finding Boer officialdom inadequate, he imported ministers and civil servants en masse from the Netherlands. His ascent to the presidency came shortly after the realisation that the Boer republics might stand on land of immense mineral wealth. Diamonds had been discovered in Griqua territory just north of the Orange River on {{the western edge of the}} Free State, arousing the interest of Britain and other countries; mostly British settlers, referred to by the Boers as uitlanders ("out-landers"), were flooding into the region. Britain began to pursue federation (at that time often referred to as [...] "confederation") of the Boer republics with the Cape and Natal and in 1873, over Boer objections, annexed the area surrounding the huge diamond mine at Kimberley, dubbing it Griqualand West.|$|E

The [...] "Vardarska" [...] Division, due to the fall of Skopje was forced to halt its operations in Albania. In the meantime, the Western Macedonia Army Section under General Tsolakoglou, comprising the 9th and 13th Greek Divisions, advanced in support of the Royal Yugoslav Army, capturing some 250 Italians on 8 April. The Greeks were tasked with advancing towards Durrës. On 9 April, the Zetska Division advanced towards Shkodër and the Yugoslav cavalry regiment reached the Drin River, but the Kosovska Division had to halt its advance due to the appearance of German units near Prizren. The Yugoslav-Greek offensive was supported by S.79K bombers from the 66th and 81st Bomber Groups of the VVKJ, that attacked airfields and camps around Shkodër, as well as the port of Durrës, and Italian troop concentrations and bridges on the Drin and Buene rivers and Durrës, Tirana and Zara.|$|E

This idea was worked out in more detail by Oliver Heaviside (1889), Thomson (1893), George Frederick Charles Searle (1897), Max Abraham (1902), Hendrik Lorentz (1892, 1904), and was directly applied to the electron by using the Abraham–Lorentz force.

2500|$|On 22 May, the League of Cognac {{was signed}} by Francis I (who was just {{released}} from his captivity following the Battle of Pavia), Pope Clement VII, the Republic of Venice, Florence, and the Sforza of Milan, specifically to destroy the Imperial hold over Italy. The Emperor immediately sent an ambassador to Rome, Ugo Moncada, his Viceroy of Sicily, who arrived on 17 June. His instructions were to either get the Pope to agree to an alliance with the Empire instead of the League of Cognac, or else <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> a scheme of Pompeo Colonna to reduce the Pope to obedience {{by means of a}} revolution in Rome, which would detach Siena and Florence from his control.

He had also seen the proposed Spanish articles of capitulation, which he did not deem to be damaging to Francis' position. Despite several offers which Moncada presented the Pope if he would cooperate, the Pope refused all Moncada's offers. Moncada [...] left Rome on June 26, issuing dire warnings about the consequences of the Pope's obstinacy. He went immediately to the Colonna.|$|E

2500|$|During his {{development}} of Maxwell's Theory, J. J. Thomson (1881) recognized that charged bodies are harder <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> than uncharged bodies. Electrostatic fields behave {{as if they}} add an [...] "electromagnetic mass" [...] to the mechanical mass of the bodies. I.e., according to Thomson, electromagnetic energy corresponds to a certain mass. This was interpreted as some form of self-inductance of the electromagnetic field. He also noticed that the mass of a body in motion is increased by a constant quantity. Thomson's work was continued and perfected by FitzGerald, Heaviside (1888), and George Frederick Charles Searle (1896, 1897). For the electromagnetic mass they gave— in modern notation— the formula , where [...] is the electromagnetic mass and [...] is the electromagnetic energy. Heaviside and Searle also recognized that the increase {{of the mass of}} a body is not constant and varies with its velocity. Consequently, Searle noted the impossibility of superluminal velocities, because infinite energy would be needed to exceed the speed of light. Also for Lorentz (1899), the integration of the speed-dependence of masses recognized by Thomson was especially important. He noticed that the mass not only varied due to speed, but is also dependent on the direction, and he introduced what Abraham later called [...] "longitudinal" [...] and [...] "transverse" [...] mass. (The transverse mass corresponds to what later was called relativistic mass.) ...|$|E

6000|$|There {{are various}} {{complications}} which blur {{the sharpness of}} this distinction in practice. To begin with, many instincts mature gradually, and while they are immature an animal may act in a fumbling manner which {{is very difficult to}} distinguish from learning. James ("Psychology," [...] ii, 407) maintains that children walk by instinct, and that the awkwardness of their first attempts is only {{due to the fact that}} the instinct has not yet ripened. He hopes that [...] "some scientific widower, left alone with his offspring at the critical moment, may ere long test this suggestion on the living subject." [...] However this may be, he quotes evidence to show that [...] "birds do not LEARN to fly," [...] but fly by instinct when they reach the appropriate age (ib., p. 406). In the second place, instinct often gives only a rough outline of the sort of thing to do, in which case learning is necessary in order to acquire certainty and precision in action. In the third place, even in the clearest cases of acquired habit, such as speaking, some instinct is required <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>in</b> <b>motion</b> the process of learning.
