O'Keefe 306 U.S. 466 (1939), state sales taxes in Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 (1941), and use taxes in Curry v. United States, 314 U.S. 14 (1941). Both cases also [...] used the [...] "legal incidence test." [...] The Supreme Court also later expanded the rationale for upholding state taxes on companies {{doing business with the}} federal government in two cases. [...] In United States v. Detroit, 355 U.S. 473 (1958), the Court held that private, for-profit companies should not gain tax-exempt status merely because <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>business</b> with the federal government. And in United States v. New Mexico, 455 U.S. 720 (1982), the Court enunciated a general policy of upholding taxes against private parties doing business with the federal government absent a specific constitutional or legislative mandate.|$|E

Out there the people we skin are trying to skin us, even the farmers and the remittance men that the magazines send out to write up Goldfields. But there's little sport in New York city for rod, reel or gun. They hunt here with either one of two things--a slungshot or a letter of introduction.
