5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} based on {{independent}} chemical analyses, on-site analyses and field sampling. It includes seven selected wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> at mountain lodges. At each plant the author conducted three sets of winter analyses and two sets of summer analyses. The research includes 200 hours of field work in the mountains. Before conducting the analyses {{it was necessary to}} catalogue all wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> at Slovenian Alpine Association's mountain lodges and on this basis choose a representative sample of wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> for further research. The thesis interfer widely with Slovenian environment with exact, analytical review of Slovenian legislation about small wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants.</b> The results are generally applicable to all small wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> while mountain-related are stressed separately. The thesis monitored 20 parameters at inflow and outflow of wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> all around Slovenia. Propositional improvements for concrete plants are made on this data. The great amount of data acquired in the research is of great help for further scientific research. The thesis also includes proposals and questions for improvement of Slovenian legislation, proposals for wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> producers as well as proposals to improve and to make on-site samplings and measures uniform.

40|$|We {{wanted to}} present the usage of {{membrane}} bioreactors for municipal wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants.</b> In industries such systems are widely spread contributing to improve wastewater treatment. With increasing standards on discharges from wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> began usage of membrane bioreactors at municipal <b>treatment</b> <b>plants.</b> The aim of the thesis was to describe the process of wastewater treatment with membrane bioreactors and to present {{advantages and disadvantages of}} these systems. Companies that produce membrane bioreactors have different ways of approaching to development. So there has been the emergence of several types of membrane systems, materials and procedures in the proper functioning of membrane bioreactors. We have presented the most commonly used systems, which are already well proven for usage for municipal wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> since they have been in operation for several years. By studying the literature it showed that the usage of membrane bioreactors for municipal wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> still has some drawbacks. Particularly the operating costs are higher than by conventional biological wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plants,</b> which is result of membrane exchange. Since the membrane bioreactors are not commonly used at this type of <b>treatment</b> <b>plants</b> the costs of installing the system are therefore also higher. Some of setbacks of membrane bioreactors can be found in intense maintance and cleaning of the membranes...|$|R

5|$|Wilsonville also {{provides}} its own {{water supply and}} wastewater treatment. The wastewater system was built in 1972, while the water system was upgraded with a new <b>treatment</b> <b>plant</b> in 2002. Water is drawn from the Willamette River from the Wilsonville Water <b>Treatment</b> <b>Plant</b> built {{at a cost of}} $46 million in conjunction with the Tualatin Valley Water District. The city used to use wells to provide drinking water, but those began to run dry in the late 1990s. The plant’s initial capacity was 15 million gallons per day, but can be expanded to 120 million gallons per day. Neighboring Sherwood will begin receiving water from the plant in 2012.|$|E

5|$|A 1991 {{agreement}} between the City of Portland and the State of Oregon to dramatically reduce combined sewer overflows (CSOs) led to Portland's Big Pipe Project. The project, part of a related series of Portland CSO projects completed in late 2011 {{at a cost of}} $1.44billion, separates the city's sanitary sewer lines from storm-water inputs that sometimes overwhelmed the combined system during heavy rains. When that occurred, some of the raw sewage in the system flowed into the river instead of into the city's wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>plant.</b> The Big Pipe project and related work reduces CSO volume on the lower river by about 94percent.|$|E
