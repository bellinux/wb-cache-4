5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} systems (EGS) actively inject {{water into}} wells <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> and pumped back out. The water is injected under high pressure to expand existing rock fissures {{to enable the}} water to freely flow in and out. The technique was adapted from oil and gas extraction techniques. However, the geologic formations are deeper and no toxic chemicals are used, reducing the possibility of environmental damage. Drillers can employ directional drilling to expand {{the size of the}} reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated.</b> In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water vapour. During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water vapour is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
5|$|The European Winter of 1941-1942 was {{the coldest}} {{of the twentieth}} century. On 30 November, von Bock {{reported}} to Berlin that the temperature was –45 °C (–49 °F). General Erhard Raus, commander of the 6th Panzer Division, kept track of the daily mean temperature in his war diary. It shows a suddenly much colder period during 4–7 December: from –36 to –38 °C (–37 to –38 °F). Other temperature reports varied widely. Zhukov said that November's freezing weather stayed around –7 to –10°C (+19 to +14°F) Official Soviet Meteorological Service records show the lowest December temperature reached –28.8°C (–20°F). These numbers indicated severely cold conditions, and German troops were freezing with no winter clothing, using equipment that was not designed for such low temperatures. More than 130,000 cases of frostbite were reported among German soldiers. Frozen grease {{had to be removed}} from every loaded shell and vehicles had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> for hours before use. The same cold weather, typical for the season, hit the Soviet troops, but they were better prepared.|$|E

5|$|When {{an object}} is in {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium, a global layer of liquid covering its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in hydrostatic equilibrium is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E
25|$|By definition, all heat {{sources for}} a heat pump must be colder in {{temperature}} than the space <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated.</b> Most commonly, heat pumps draw {{heat from the}} air (outside or inside air) or from the ground (groundwater or soil).|$|E
25|$|Other heat {{sources for}} heat pumps include water; nearby streams {{and other natural}} water bodies have been used, and {{sometimes}} domestic waste water (via drain water heat recovery) which is often warmer than cold winter ambient temperatures (though still of lower temperature than the space <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated).</b>|$|E

25|$|The coolant {{is pumped}} around the primary circuit by {{powerful}} pumps. After picking up heat as it passes through the reactor core, the primary coolant transfers heat in a steam generator to water in a lower pressure secondary circuit, evaporating the secondary coolant to saturated steam — in most designs 6.2MPa (60atm, 900psia), 275°C (530°F) — {{for use in the}} steam turbine.

25|$|Brandy is {{traditionally}} served {{at room temperature}} (neat) from a snifter, a wine glass or a tulip glass. When drunk at room temperature, it is often slightly warmed by holding the glass cupped in the palm or by gentle heating.

Brandy drinkers who like their brandy warmed may ask for the glass <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> before the brandy is poured.|$|E
25|$|The use of two lasers to {{heat the}} sample reduces the axial {{temperature}} gradient, this which allows for thicker samples <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> more evenly. In order for a double-sided heating system to be successful {{it is essential that}} the two lasers are aligned so that they are both focused on the sample position.

25|$|The {{very first}} modern {{aquarium}} {{made of glass}} {{was developed in the}} 19th century by Robert Warrington. During the Victorian age, glass aquariums commonly had slate or steel bottoms, which allowed them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> underneath by an open-flame heat source. These aquariums had the glass panels attached with metal frames and sealed with putty. Metal-framed aquariums were still available until the mid-1960s, when the modern, silicone-sealed style replaced them. Acrylic aquariums first became available to the public in the 1970s. Laminated glass is sometimes used, which combines the advantages of both glass and acrylic.|$|E
25|$|In active {{volcanic}} zones such as Yellowstone National Park, {{water may}} be heated by coming {{into contact with}} magma (molten rock). The high temperature gradient near magma may cause water <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> enough that it boils or becomes superheated. If the water becomes so hot that it builds steam pressure and erupts in a jet above {{the surface of the}} Earth, it is called a geyser. If the water only reaches the surface in the form of steam, it is called a fumarole. If the water is mixed with mud and clay, it is called a mud pot.|$|E

25|$|As the {{solution}} to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the fractionating column. As it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the packing material. Here, the condensate continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, {{the composition of the}} fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a theoretical plate) will yield a purer solution of the more volatile component. In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur at exactly the same position in the fractionating column; theoretical plate is thus a concept rather than an accurate description.|$|E
25|$|Knifeline attack (KLA) {{is another}} kind of {{corrosion}} affecting welds, impacting steels stabilized by niobium. Niobium and niobium carbide dissolves in steel at very high temperatures. At some cooling regimes, niobium carbide does not precipitate, and the steel then behaves like unstabilized steel, forming chromium carbide instead. This affects only a thin zone several millimeters wide in the very vicinity of the weld, {{making it difficult to}} spot and increasing the corrosion speed. Structures made of such steels have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> in a whole to about , when the chromium carbide dissolves and niobium carbide forms. The cooling rate after this treatment is not important.|$|E
25|$|Roman hypocaust {{heating systems}} made {{extensive}} use of fired clay elements: The space beneath {{the floor of a}} room <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>heated</b> was supported on robust pillars (pilae), usually made of small, square bricks mortared together, so that the heat from the adjacent furnace could circulate freely. In public and private bath-houses (essential to the Roman way of life), heat was also carried up through the walls in flues made of interlocking box-tiles. Though these were covered up by wall facings both inside and out, they were sometimes manufactured with quite elaborate geometric and even figural decoration. Pipes for water and drainage were also often made of fired clay.|$|E
