5|$|Daily {{routine of}} life in the {{trenches}} began with the morning 'stand-to'. An hour before dawn everyone was roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by the Germans. With stand-to over, {{it was time for the}} men to have breakfast and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed the men who were off-duty would find a place to sleep. Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of trying to stay alive, sleep deprivation was common. Soldiers also had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.|$|E
5|$|From there, the Arabs turned west towards Nicaea, {{the chief}} city of Bithynia and {{capital of the}} {{powerful}} Opsician Theme. The Arabs arrived before the city in late July, with al-Battal's vanguard preceding the main army. The Byzantines, probably {{under the command of}} the Count of the Opsicians, Artabasdos, did not meet them in the field, but instead retreated behind the city's walls. The Arabs assaulted the city for forty days, employing siege engines which destroyed a part of the walls, but eventually failed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> late August, they raised the siege and departed, taking along many captives and much booty. The 12th-century chronicle of Michael the Syrian claims that the city's inhabitants abandoned it and fled by ship through Lake Ascania, whereupon the Arabs destroyed Nicaea, but this is clearly an error.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese would {{subsequently}} {{attempt to}} occupy the city, but never managed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> his journal of an expedition to the region in 1497-1499, the explorer João de Sá, who accompanied Vasco da Gama on the voyage, wrote that Magadoxo (Mogadishu) was controlled by Moors. A big town surrounded by four towers, it had houses several storeys high and large palaces in its center. De Sá and his men bombarded the city before continuing southwards along the seaboard. The Hawiye Somali, however, were later successful in defeating the Ajuran State and bringing {{about the end of}} Muzaffar rule.|$|E

25|$|Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army's advance toward Lwów was halted, {{first at}} the battle of Brody (29 July – 2 August), and then on 17 August at the Battle of Zadwórze, where a small Polish force sacrificed itself to prevent Soviet cavalry from seizing Lwów and {{stopping}} vital Polish reinforcements from moving toward Warsaw. Moving through weakly defended areas, Budyonny's cavalry reached the city of Zamość on 29 August and attempted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Battle of Zamość; however, he soon faced an increasing number of Polish units diverted from the successful Warsaw counteroffensive. On 31 August, Budyonny's cavalry finally broke off its siege of Lwów and attempted to {{come to the aid of}} Soviet forces retreating from Warsaw. The Soviet forces were intercepted and defeated by Polish cavalry at the Battle of Komarów near Zamość, one of the largest cavalry battles since 1813 (Brandy Station in 1863, during the American Civil War, was larger) and one of the last cavalry battles in history. Although Budyonny's army managed to avoid encirclement, it suffered heavy losses and its morale plummeted. The remains of Budyonny's 1st Cavalry Army retreated towards Volodymyr-Volynskyi on 6 September and were defeated shortly thereafter at the Battle of Hrubieszów.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Eurogamer, Chahi emphasised that the developers tried initially to avoid including overt religious elements in the game. Tribal worship, totems, and animal-shaped monuments are examples of the quasi-religious characters of From Dust. Chahi explained that, during one mission, the player would physically divide an ocean in order to assist their tribe in crossing it and so forth. He indicated that Ubisoft Montpellier were reluctant: [...] "we didn't want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> this direction", but the [...] "game kept pushing us back to it". When asked {{the meaning of the}} game's title, Bunier remarked that [...] "it's just another universe, another place, something people create from dust". Separately, Chahi commented that the game centered on the fragility of life and brevity of humankind.|$|E

Angeldust released its debut album Musical Conjurings From the World of Illusion in 1998. He later released the albums System 1, System 2, and System 3. In 2003, he released the album Supernatural. His musical style {{continues to be}} in the heavy metal style, though when describing his musical style he has said, [...] "There are elements where it's more electronic, and there are orchestrated sections. I decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> different places because I'm inspired by emotion and by giving people a connection, a sense of a feeling — whether it's excitement or crying or being happy."

500|$|The American {{mathematician}} George Birkhoff's 1933 Aesthetic Measure {{proposes a}} quantitative metric {{of the aesthetic}} quality of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but {{is limited to the}} [...] "elements of order" [...] of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, O, takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, C, counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as O/C. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in.</b> Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.|$|E
500|$|During a February 2010 {{television}} interview, Sestak {{said that}} in July 2009 he was offered a job in President Obama's administration if {{he dropped out of}} the race. During a February 18 taping of Larry Kane: Voice of Reason, a Philadelphia-area local news show, host Larry Kane asked Sestak whether such an offer had been made, to which Sestak responded, [...] "Yes", without elaborating beyond that it was a high-ranking assignment and that he did not plan <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> subsequent press inquiries, Sestak repeatedly stood by his original statement. When asked about the matter by The Washington Post, he said, [...] "There has been some indirect means in which they were trying to offer things if I got out." [...] Likewise, during an appearance on the Fox News Channel, he said, [...] "I was asked a direct question yesterday and I answered it honestly. There's nothing more to go into. I'm in this race now." [...] Over the next month, White House officials did not answer multiple press inquiries about whether Sestak's claims were true. On March 16, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said he had reviewed the matter and found conversations that had been held with Sestak were [...] "not problematic." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{developing}} Advent Children, Nomura {{stated that}} because of the comparisons between Barret's original design and Mr. T, they decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a different direction for the film, implementing co-director Takeshi Nozue's suggestion to give him cornrows for his hair, while Nomura designed his face. Artist Yusuke Naora influenced the design as well, developing his attire, which originally consisted of white overalls, before instead having him wear him a down vest. Barret's arm tattoo was changed as well, although it retained the [...] "skull and fire" [...] motif of the original. Other aspects of his design included the loss of the metal bands around his body, a white sleeve extending from the middle of his right forearm to his elbow fastened by straps, a black band on his left forearm surrounded by a pink string and bow, and a fishnet shirt that ends in torn fibers below his waist. The dog tags were altered to a bullet and medallion supported by a chain around his neck, and three rings covered his left hand. His Gimmick Arm was modified into a robotic prosthetic hand, developed by Nomura, with the only guideline being [...] "a huge, over-the-top gun that transforms in a huge, over-the-top way." [...] Nozue stated that these specifics made it difficult to work with, and decided to conceal the hand's transformation sequence into the gun as much as possible. His Advent Children design was also planned to be used for the Final Fantasy VII remake. However, the staff later decided to give every character in the party a new look.|$|E
2500|$|Pippi {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "the strongest girl in the world", but no explanation is given for her strength. Pippi's strength amazes and confounds people, including the children, though they eventually begin <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> stride. Pippi herself makes no mention of her extraordinary strength, though she is obviously aware of it. She is not at all violent, and when circumstances require her to protect herself or others, she usually takes great care not to hurt anyone. This is seen in the first book, when she neutralizes five large bullies singlehandedly, and also when she engages two policemen, who were determined to take her to an orphanage against her will, in a game of tag.|$|E

To prevent this, the Earl {{attempted to}} donate {{the house to the}} National Trust, however the Trust declined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> the end, Lady Mabel Fitzwilliam, sister of the 7th Earl and a local alderman, brokered a deal whereby the West Riding County Council leased most of the house for an educational establishment, leaving forty rooms as a family apartment. Thus, from 1949 to 1979, the house was home to the Lady Mabel College of Physical Education, which trained female physical education teachers. The college later merged with Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University), which eventually gave up the lease in 1988 due to high maintenance costs.|$|E

He described the situation as [...] "one of those too-many-cooks-in-the-kitchen kind of things". Although DeWyze felt that he and RCA were not thinking the same thing regarding his musical style, he still had high hopes about recording a second album with them and trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a different direction, but in September 2011, he was dismissed by the label.

He described {{his plans to}} land troops beyond {{the range of the}} fort guns to exploit the Galle fort’s inherent weakness, “... there is a highland like the promontory, so that one can easily fire with guns from there at the city and the principal fort, and, {{as far as we can}} gather, can throw (grenades) with mortars, and we shall obliged <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> this manner.” Van Diemen, writing back on 11 August 1638, ordered that Galle was a priority target and to capture it before Colombo. He further added “... it [...] offers an excellent harbor for vessels which can anchor there at any time of the year”, which better suited their future plans.|$|E

[...] He was then listed as the Starting Defensive Tackle in week 10 after the Falcons cut veteran Grady Jackson. During training camp, his number was listed as #67, because in college, he was #76, but that number was already taken. Then his number was changed to #97 before the season began because an older falcons player had the same number as him. He finished the 2007 NFL season with 23 tackles and one interception. Because of his size, Lewis played both Defensive Tackle and Nose Tackle during the season. According To Lewis, the most hard adjustment from NCAA Division II to the NFL was working on his Technique. Around this time, Lewis lost 20pounds and slimmed down to 294pounds.|$|E

2500|$|With Australia needing 377 runs {{to avoid}} an innings defeat Denness could afford to set an {{aggressive}} field, {{but to no avail}} as Redpath and McCosker made 32/0 when bad light stopped play. Peter Lever had caught a fever on the rest day and retired after three overs, to be replaced by Old and Greig. Though much of the pitch was flat the area around the damp patch of the first day was pock-marked and made the odd ball fly up and hit the hands of the batsmen, who were surrounded by slips, gullies and short-legs. McCosker took to hooking the ball over their heads and outscored Redpath so that when he edged Arnold (3/83) to Cowdrey for his 120th and last Test catch he mad made 76 of their 111 in 108 minutes. Redpath (83) added another century stand with Ian Chappell (50) until the captain glanced another catch to Knott off Grieg (4/88), but was unsatisfied with the decision and stayed to argue with the bowler and losing his temper in the process before leaving at 215/2. Greig caught Redpath at close short-leg, but the England appeals were turned down and in his next over the South African saw 12 runs scored while Greg Chappell gave three half-chances. After 335 minutes Redpath was out for 83, hitting the ball to Amiss at short-leg, who took a 'golden catch'. Soon after Ross Edwards appeared to be lbw, but much to the surprise of the commentary box was given not out, having caught a tiny edge as he moved across the ball. Denness delayed the taking of the new ball as he hoped to use it in the morning when Lever was better, but was forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the evening to no avail as Australia reach 273/3 with the local press proclaimed [...] "WE SAVED IT". Lever was back on the field, but it was Arnold who made the breakthrough, feeding Edwards his favourite leg-glance until he edged it behind his to Knott. The Surrey bowler then made the ball cut from leg to hit Walter's off stump. When Denness caught Marsh off a Lever out-swinger Australia were 306/6 and struggling, but Chappell made his seventh half-century of the series and with Walker took Australia to 360/6 by lunch. After the break the tail collapsed, Walker got above himself and drove the ball {{into the hands of the}} bowler Greig, Lever moved the ball back nine inches to bowl Chappell (102) just after he reach his second century of the series and Mallett, Dymock and the injured Lillee failed to make any runs and Australia were suddenly out for 373 with three hours to spare.|$|E
