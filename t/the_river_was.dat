5|$|At {{the time}} of European {{settlement}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> a summertime chain of waterholes bounded by large gum trees. Flowing through {{the area where the}} city of Adelaide is sited <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> sometimes invisible beneath its gravel stream bed. It frequently flooded in winter and did not reach the sea, instead ending at coastal dunes where its waters created a vast but shallow freshwater wetlands. These wetlands, known as The Reedbeds after the dominant vegetation, occupied a large area of the western Adelaide Plains and were also fed by other waterways. The river only flowed to the sea through the Port River, Barker Inlet, and Patawalonga River following heavy rain.Try: http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/Caring_for_Water_Seas/Creeks_Rivers/River_Torrens.aspx Retrieved on 9 September 2009.|$|E
5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in road making and construction of buildings. As the natural environment was removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> {{noted for}} Atlantic Salmon fishing. Many {{of the upper}} and middle {{stretches}} of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>are</b> whitewater, and dangerous for canoeing; {{the lower part of}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> much more commonly canoed.|$|R

5|$|From the colonizers' perspective, Carabane's {{position}} {{at the mouth of}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> an undeniable asset. In the 20th and 21stcenturies, in terms of trade and tourism issues, this location is more of a disadvantage because it effectively separates the island {{from the rest of the}} country.|$|E
5|$|Matamoros, Tamaulipas, on the {{southern}} bank of the Rio Grande, experienced the hurricane for several days beginning on October2. Along the coast, several ships were wrecked. The Mexican custom house, situated {{at the mouth of}} <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> <b>was</b> destroyed. It was later rebuilt at a more sheltered location farther inland.|$|E
5|$|The River Don Navigation was {{the result}} of early efforts to make the River Don in South Yorkshire, England, navigable between Fishlake and Sheffield. The Dutch {{engineer}} Cornelius Vermuyden had re-routed the mouth of the river in 1626, to improve drainage, and the new works included provision for navigation, but the scheme did not solve the problem of flooding, and the Dutch River was cut in 1635 to link the new channel to Goole. The first Act of Parliament to improve navigation on <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> obtained in 1726, by a group of Cutlers based in Sheffield; the Corporation of Doncaster obtained an Act in the following year for improvements to the lower river. Locks and lock cuts were built, and, by 1751, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> navigable to Tinsley.|$|E

5|$|The canal had a lock at Thorne {{and another}} where it joined the River Trent at Keadby. This lock had {{four sets of}} gates, {{so that it could}} be used whether the level of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> higher or lower than that of the canal.

5|$|The southern-half of {{the area}} then {{underwent}} significant development, as the retaining wall along <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> repaired and an at-grade rail crossing was installed at the park's western boundary. Construction then began in 1998 and concluded in fall 1999 at a total cost of $5million. The park was officially opened on October 2, 1999.|$|E
5|$|When {{construction}} began, the River Moselle, running {{parallel to}} Lordship Lane {{a short distance}} south of it, formed the de facto northern boundary of the area. During {{the development of the}} area in the 1880s <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> culverted and the land between the river and Lordship Lane built on.|$|E

5|$|According to the Domesday Survey of 1086, Tameside {{was divided}} into four manors, those of Tintwistle, Hollingworth, Werneth, and Mottram. The land east of the River Tame was in the Hundred of Hamestan in Cheshire and held by the Earl of Chester while {{to the west of}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> in the Hundred of Salford under Roger de Poitevin. These manors were divided to create further manors, so that by the 13th century most of them were owned by local {{families}} and remained {{in the hands of the}} same families until the 16th century. Manorialism continued as the main for of administration and governance until the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|Cowan and Hook {{suggest that}} Lucullus would have {{deployed}} the Romans in a simplex acies, {{that is to}} say a single line, so making the frontage of the army as wide as possible as a counter to the cavalry. He took several of his troops downriver, where <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> the easiest to ford, and at one moment, Tigranes believed that this move meant Lucullus was withdrawing from the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{served as}} the book review editor of The Miami Herald from 1942 to 1949, and as editor for the University of Miami Press from 1960 to 1963. She {{released}} her first novel, entitled Road to the Sun, in 1952. She wrote four novels, and several non-fiction books on regional topics including Florida birdwatching and David Fairchild, the entomologist turned biologist who imagined a botanical park in Miami. Her autobiography entitled Marjory Stoneman Douglas: Voice of <b>the</b> <b>River</b> <b>was</b> written with John Rothchild in 1987. She {{had been working on}} a book about W. H. Hudson for years, traveling to Argentina and England several times. It was incomplete when she died in 1998.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> {{occasionally}} {{used for}} recreational purposes, such as kayaking. This is usually limited to periods after heavy rainfall when <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> in spate, because {{in times of}} normal flows <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> too shallow to use. When <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> in spate it becomes very technical, with many weirs and holes. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> quite narrow and relatively shallow, making the rocky bed hazardous for kayakers who capsize. By far the most challenging part is in the higher-volume upper section of <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> where a small tributary of the Ashop flows swiftly through a steep tunnel under <b>the</b> road. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> has many obstacles such as fallen trees, and fences which lie across the channel and must be negotiated. This makes it dangerous at times of high water if <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> flowing rapidly.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Lewis <b>River</b> <b>is</b> an 18.1 mi {{tributary}} of <b>the</b> Snake <b>River.</b> <b>The</b> entire course of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> located within <b>the</b> boundaries of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> named for Meriwether Lewis, {{commander of the}} Lewis and Clark Expedition.|$|R
50|$|The major tributaries of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Malleco and <b>the</b> Laja. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> Chile's second-longest <b>river</b> (<b>the</b> longest being Loa River) and Biobío basin is Chile's {{third largest}} watershed, after Loa and Baker basins. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> also <b>the</b> widest <b>river</b> in Chile, {{with an average}} width of 1 km. In the Metropolitan area of Concepción, <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> crossed by four bridges: Biobío Railroad Bridge (1889), Biobío Bridge (1942), Juan Pablo II Bridge (1973) and Llacolén Bridge (2000).|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{the main}} port on <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> at Bridgwater, where a span crossed {{the river from}} 1200 AD onwards. Quays were built at Bridgwater in 1424, with another quay, the Langport slip, being built in 1488 {{upstream}} of the Town Bridge. A custom house was sited at Bridgwater, on West Quay, and a dry dock, launching slips and a boat yard on East Quay. Bridgwater built some 167 ships, the last one being the Irene launched in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Iden Lock {{connected}} the Royal Military Canal to the river. The last commercial barge to pass from the Rother through Iden lock onto the canal was the Vulture, carrying 27 tons of shingle on 15 December 1909. After that, the lock {{was replaced by}} a sluice, severing the navigable connection. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> used by pleasure craft in Edwardian times, when regular boat trips from Scots Float Sluice, then called Star Lock, to Bodiam Castle were offered. The lower river is currently used for moorings, and the Bodiam Ferry Company operate a trip boat from Newenden Bridge to Bodiam Castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, a {{group was}} created whose {{objective}} was to channel the Senne into subterranean tunnels for nearly its entire course through the Brussels metropolitan area. This was done in order to expand the benefits that the covering achieved in the old city. In the centre, the course of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> to be changed from the central boulevards to the peripheral boulevards of the small ring. The project, delayed by war and the work being done on the North–South connection, was only finished in 1955.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> mainly dry during dry {{seasons as}} <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> named after {{along with many}} other streams on the island.|$|R
50|$|The town lies on <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Lliedi, {{although}} much of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> not visible, especially in the town centre, where <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>is</b> underneath <b>the</b> town.|$|R

5|$|In 1961, the Dammasch State Hospital mental {{hospital}} {{opened on the}} west side of the community. Gordon House, the only house in Oregon to be designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright, was built in 1963 near what became Charbonneau and moved to the Oregon Garden in 2001. Wilsonville was flooded in 1964 and the first fire station was built in 1966. Wilsonville was incorporated as a city in 1969 with a population of about 1,000. In 1971, the planned community of Charbonneau on the south side of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> annexed into the city the year after development began.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{as part of}} the {{construction}} of what is now the Northern line, the CCE was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it was connected to the City & South London Railway. The loop tunnel under <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line platform {{is the only one of}} the four deep level platforms that is not connected to any of the others by deep level walkways. The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.|$|E
5|$|In the 7th Army sector, about 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began {{crossing}} the Drava, but {{construction of a}} bridge near Maribor was suspended because <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>was</b> in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative crossing point, and established a bridgehead. This crossing point was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment Ormozki, the far left formation of the 4th Army. This crossing, combined with {{the withdrawal of the}} 38th Infantry Division Dravska from the line from Slovenska Bistrica to Ptuj, exposed the left flank of Detachment Ormozki. The Detachment attempted to withdraw south, but began to disintegrate during the night of 10/11 April.|$|E
