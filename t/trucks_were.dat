5|$|On May 21, 1952, {{large numbers}} of <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> spotted by Jersey City police {{entering}} {{the city on the}} skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in Newark for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. Hudson County police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the opening}} of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US1-9 and Route 25 were moved to the new bridge. After <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> banned from the Pulaski Skyway in 1934, the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was {{designated}} as Route 25T. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, US1-9 Truck was designated to replace all of Route 25T as well as the portion of Route 1 between Route 25T and the Tonnele Circle.|$|E
5|$|Local {{television}} stations ran all-night {{coverage of the}} deluge from June 8 through the next day, including KHOU-TV 11, which was forced to transmit its broadcast to a satellite truck when floodwaters entered its production studio on the Allen Parkway near Studemont/Montrose, near downtown {{along the banks of}} Buffalo Bayou. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to abandon their vehicles for higher ground. Eighteen-wheeled <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> filmed floating down major freeways and highways, swept along by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} March 31, 1986 and concluded on June 20, 1986, {{on a budget}} of $18 million. Filming began in Eldridge Street, Manhattan, New York City, which acted as Harry Angel's neighbourhood. Production designer Brian Morris and the set decorating team spent two months designing the set prior to filming, hoping to recreate 1950s New York. Because of the warm weather conditions, ice <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> used to create fake snow. Filming then moved to Alphabet City in Manhattan, where several bar scenes and Angel's intimate bedroom scene with Connie (Whitcraft) were filmed.|$|E

The launch tubes have an elevation range of 0° to 60° and azimuth range of -30° to +30°. The <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> equipped with four hydraulically operated stabilisers which are lowered in preparation for the rocket launch.|$|R
5|$|The Air Force {{estimated}} {{that during the}} year there were 3,375 trucks working the trail system in southern Laos, yet it claimed that 12,368 enemy <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> destroyed during the year. During the same time frame, the CIA {{estimated that}} only 6,000 trucks existed in the entire North Vietnamese inventory. The buildup of PAVN anti-aircraft defenses continued to increase. During Commando Hunt III the Seventh and Thirteenth Air Force estimated that 700 23-mm and 37mm weapons, most of them radar-guided, were defending the trail system in southern Laos.|$|E
5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator who always rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of I-287's New Jersey portion in 1993, more out-of-state tractor trailer drivers began to use the alignment of Route31 as a toll-free alternative to the New Jersey Turnpike. On July 16, 1999, oversize <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> banned from using Route31 {{as part of a}} larger statewide ban imposed on New Jersey roads not a part of the National Highway System by then-governor Christine Todd Whitman. The legislation had a significant effect on trucks that followed Route31 as it forced them to use I-287 and the New Jersey Turnpike instead. In themid-2000s, the portion of Route31 was widened during extensive construction between Flemington and Clinton that widened the road to four lanes.|$|E
50|$|Downhill longboarders usually use Reverse Kingpin Trucks (RKP), whereas skateboarders use Traditional Kingpin Trucks. RKP trucks tend to hold {{traction}} {{better and}} {{are easier to}} handle at speed, whereas TKP <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> more suited for tricks, bowl skating and usually sport a lower ride height. Other forms of <b>trucks</b> have <b>been</b> seen in downhill but remain on the sidelines. These would include torsion trucks (seismic) and CAM trucks (Other Planet). Downhill <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> separated into two further categories: Cast and Precision. Cast <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> the economical choice {{as well as the}} most common, although Precision <b>Trucks</b> <b>are</b> becoming more common. Cast <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> usually a gravity cast aluminum with a solid steel axle that is non-removable. Due to the casting process cast trucks have 'slop' which is caused by small gaps in between parts. This causes small shifts and movements at speed and results in slightly diminished control. Cast <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> also prone to warping slightly, causing uneven contact pressure on the wheels. Precision trucks can counter these limitations at a much higher price tag, although not all brands achieve this equally. Precision <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> milled out of Aluminum billet and usually house two separate axles.|$|R
50|$|Several {{types of}} non {{centralized}} sanitation systems {{are served by}} vacuum <b>trucks.</b> They <b>are</b> used to empty septage from cesspits, septic tanks, pit latrines and communal latrines, for street cleanup, for sewer clean out, and for individual septic systems. The <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used in the cleaning of sanitary sewer pumping stations. Vacuum <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used to empty portable toilets. In commercial aviation, vacuum <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used to collect waste from airplane toilets.|$|R

5|$|Seven {{thousand}} carvers {{and three}} thousand volunteers {{were put to}} work for the construction Akshardham. With over 6,000 tons of pink sandstone coming from Rajasthan, workshop sites were set up around places within the state. Amongst the carvers were local farmers and fifteen hundred tribal women who had suffered from a drought and received economic gain due to this work. The initial stone cutting was done by machine, while the detailed carvings were done by hand. Every night, over one hundred <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> sent to Akshardham, where four thousand workers and volunteers operated on the construction site.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} regrouped at Pyongtaek itself, {{mostly a}} mass of disorganized soldiers without leadership. Engineers with the battalion demolished a bridge north of the town before moving south. The remains of A Company then headed for Cheonan, regrouping there {{with the rest of}} the 1st and 3rd Battalions which had also withdrawn. Though a few jeeps and <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> found and commandeered, most of the retreat was carried out on foot. A few scattered artillery shells landed around the retreating force, but North Korean soldiers did not aggressively pursue them. By noon the disorganized remains of the 34th Infantry had outrun all enemy fire and were out of immediate danger.|$|E
5|$|The {{real problem}} for U.S. {{planners}} {{was a lack of}} sufficient intelligence on the numbers of infiltrators, the amount of supplies being transported, the number of trucks operating, the specific locations of targets in a rapidly changing environment, and the infrastructure of the system. This lack of real intelligence forced the Air Force to basically take its best guess as to PAVN numbers, intentions, and limitations. For instance, Air Force intelligence claimed that 9,012 enemy <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> destroyed during 1969. Yet, an even lesser estimate of trucks destroyed by the Defense Intelligence Agency only resulted in their computer model reaching zero (where the enemy was supposed to be out of trucks) no fewer that 14 times during the same time period.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. More {{and more}} {{high-level}} order-picking <b>trucks</b> <b>are</b> used {{to pick and}} transport goods in warehouses. The dynamic stability of the truck has great effect on operation efficiency, quality and safety. It is instructive and meaningful for the optimization of structure and control strategy to analyze the dynamic stability of the truck. Firstly, the dynamic model of the order-picking <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> established using Alembert principle, and then the dynamic stability of the <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> analyzed. Secondly, the virtual prototype model of the <b>truck</b> <b>is</b> established and traveling process is simulated. The simulation further verifies the dynamic stability of the truck...|$|R

5|$|While on {{the move}} the lead {{vehicles}} of the patrol commanders and sergeants flew a small flag. Because the LRP was organised on divisional cavalry lines the leaders carried green flags for 'A' (HQ) Troop, black for 'B' Troop, yellow for 'C' Troop and red for 'D'. When the LRDG was organised into 11 vehicle patrols this was simplified to a green flag displaying the patrol letter in white; the later half-patrols used a plain green flag on occasion. When it became necessary to change course from an intended route, or {{in the event of}} enemy action, patrol movements were controlled by a simple semaphore flag system using blue and white signal flags, or hand signals, depending on how widely dispersed the <b>trucks</b> <b>were.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{members of}} Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni {{provided}} $2,500 {{to the town}} of Iwakuni toward cleanup and disaster relief. Soldiers also helped nearby residents and farmers to complete the rice harvest, after floods from the typhoon damaged harvesting machines. The local government of Iwakunda distributed disinfectant chemicals to flooded houses. Closed markets and decreased supplies caused the price of beef to reach record levels in the country. Following the storm, the General Insurance Association of Japan reported that insurance claims from the typhoon totaled ¥58.8billion (US$53million), the tenth-highest for any natural disaster in the country. Miyazaki Prefecture reported the highest claims with ¥12.6billion (US$11.4million). The total was split between ¥49billion (US$44million) in housing claims and ¥7.9billion (US$71million) in car claims. The Japanese government provided food, water, and rescue workers to the affected areas {{in the days after the}} storm, along with Japan Post, the local post system; <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> mobilized to affected towns, accompanied by a mobile bank and insurance agent.|$|E
5|$|Air Force {{planners}} {{believed that}} Operation Commando Hunt VII (1 November 1971 to 29 March 1972) {{would be the}} most fruitful of the entire campaign. During this dry season phase, the U.S. averaged 182 attack fighters, 13 fixed-wing gunships, and 21 B-52 sorties per day. As a result of this all-out effort, U.S. intelligence analysts claimed 10,689 North Vietnamese <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> destroyed and credited AC-130E Spectres alone with 7,335 of these kills. During the campaign, however, ominous signs appeared in the mountains of Laos. On 10 January 1972, a U.S. 0–1 observation aircraft, flying near the Mu Gia Pass, dodged the first surface-to-air missile(SAM) launched from Laotian soil. This event, and others like it, were compounded by the crossing into Laotian airspace of North Vietnamese MiG fighters. Both of these threats tended to force off B-52 and tactical air strikes. During the campaign, ten American aircraft were lost to SAMs (mostly SA-2 Guideline)s and another thirteen were lost to more conventional weapons.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, the Golden Age of Trucking Museum was a {{non-profit}} organization dedicated to trucking. The Guerreras owned and operated R.J. Guerrera, a liquid transportation trucking company. Originally, a collection of <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> restored and stored in barns and garages throughout Connecticut. The Golden Age of Trucking Museum was opened to bring the collection under a single roof. After the property for the museum was purchased in July 1998, Richard Guerrera was diagnosed with cancer. In June 1999, he was transported to the site for an unofficial groundbreaking event. Richard Guerrera died a month later and the facility was completed in 2002. The museum was designed by Francis Guerrera's son-in-law, a general contractor. On September 23, 2002, the museum was formally opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony in the complete 32,000 square foot building.|$|E
5|$|On December1, 2008, {{the bridge}} {{carrying}} NY270 over Tonawanda Creek (also the Erie Canal) {{was closed to}} traffic to allow construction to begin on a replacement bridge over the creek. The existing bridge was built in 1941 and considered to be structurally deficient. During construction, commuter traffic was detoured onto Tonawanda Creek and Bear Ridge Roads while <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> instructed to follow NY263, NY78, and NY93 around the closed bridge. The new bridge was opened to traffic in July 2009. NY270's intersections with Tonawanda Creek Road (Erie CR2) and Tonawanda Creek Road North (Niagara CR60) on {{the north and south}} approaches to the bridge were reconstructed as part of the $10.9 million project. The new bridge is similar to the former, two-lane structure; however, unlike the old one, it has wide shoulders for bicyclists and includes new sidewalks for pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Super Typhoon Bess was {{responsible}} for ¥591.6billion (US$2.32billion) in damage and 95fatalities. According to police reports, 26people were initially missing. A total of 119were hurt. Four {{people were killed in}} Osaka due to landslides, while two people were buried alive in Yokohama via mudslides. At the foot of Mt. Fuji, a series of mudslides buried 36vehicles, killed one person and injured five policemen. The landslides stranded approximately 2,000persons, including 1,500primary school children on a camping trip. In Mie, Bess was considered the worst storm to affect the city in 23years, where 17fatalities occurred and seven were initially listed missing. Elsewhere, in Nara, a couple was killed and a boy was hurt. Throughout western Japan, five people were rendered missing in heavy rains that caused at least five landslides and damaged 15automobiles. Along Tokyo Bay, high waves from Typhoon Bess left windows 11stories high coated with salt. Although Tokyo was on {{the eastern edge of the}} storm, large trees were uprooted nevertheless due to high winds. Five people were wounded in the city. Many cars and <b>trucks</b> <b>were</b> stranded due to mudslides; air traffic was also paralyzed.|$|E
