50|$|Many large {{transport}} aircraft {{use a different}} fuel gauge design principle. An aircraft may use a number (around 30 on an A320) of low voltage <b>tubular</b> <b>capacitor</b> probes where the fuel becomes the dielectric. At different fuel levels, different values of capacitance are measured and therefore the level of fuel can be determined. In early designs, the profiles and values of individual probes were chosen to compensate for fuel tank shape and aircraft pitch and roll attitudes. In more modern aircraft, the probes tend to be linear (capacitance proportional to fuel height) and the fuel computer works out how much fuel there is (slightly different on different manufacturers). This has the advantage that a faulty probe may be identified and eliminated from the fuel calculations. In total this system can be more than 99% accurate. Since most commercial aircraft only take on board fuel necessary for the intended flight (with appropriate safety margins), the system allows the fuel load to be preselected, causing the fuel delivery to be shut off when the intended load has been taken on board.|$|E
50|$|Extra bands on ceramic {{capacitors}} {{identify the}} voltage rating class and temperature coefficient characteristics. A broad black band {{was applied to}} some <b>tubular</b> paper <b>capacitors</b> to indicate the end that had the outer electrode; this allowed this end {{to be connected to}} chassis ground to provide some shielding against hum and noise pickup.|$|R
40|$|This barchelor {{thesis is}} about Desig an {{automated}} workplace forchargeable and high-impedant measurements. This automated workplace is realized by <b>tubular</b> aspiration <b>capacitor,</b> which is connected via differential converter U/I to data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A. The data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A is also connected by serial line RS- 232 to Computer (PC), {{on which the}} directed program Agilent VEE Pro 7. 0 is installed. To the right connection data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A and PC is necessary to set the same parameters on data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A, such in I/O config and also in Instrument manager too. In Instrument manager is requisite to set Plug und Play driver for data acquisition switch unit HP 34970 A. The programing in Agilent VEE Pro 7. 0 is based on object oriented programming. To start the program press the button “START“ and automatic measuring of concentration air ionts, will start the process (the trend is marked to the graph). The program is indicated if the ventilator blows an air in the aspiration capacitor and draws the trend of voltage on this ventilator to the graph. To stop the program press the buton “STOP“. Measured data are exported to program Excel. For the export Excel has to be running before the process. The function is verifing by measuring of background negativ a positiv ionts, by influence of position the source of ionts behind the aspiration capacitor and by influence of materials (metal plate, paper carton, wood, conductive paint) to the concentration of negativ ionts...|$|R
