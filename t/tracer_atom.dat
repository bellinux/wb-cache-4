The structure has four inequivalent Al-sites 111 and two inequivalent R-sites. In/Cd <b>tracer</b> <b>atoms</b> were observed to occupy several sites via the nuclear quadrupole interaction using perturbed angular correlation of gamma rays (PAC). Timedomain PAC spectra became damped {{as the temperature}} increased, which is attributed to nuclear relaxation caused by diffusional jumps of Cd <b>tracer</b> <b>atoms</b> leading to changes in orientations and/or magnitudes of electric field gradients (EFG’s). Maximum relaxations were observed near 770 K. A method is proposed for estimating the mean jump frequency at that temperature, giving a mean jump frequency w averaged over all sites of about 100 MHz. At still higher temperatures, damping decreased due to motional averaging, and the quadrupole perturbations evolved into unique signals having lower frequencies and corresponding in each phase to the averages of EFG tensors of all sites visited by the Cd <b>tracer</b> <b>atoms.</b> For Al 11 La 3, the jump frequency at 1073 K {{was estimated to be}} 1. 9 GHz.

40|$|Metabolic flux {{analysis}} (MFA) {{deals with}} the experimental determination of steady-state fluxes in metabolic networks. An important feature of the 13 C MFA method is its capability to generate information on both directions of bidirectional reaction steps given by exchange fluxes. The biological interpretation of these exchange fluxes and their relation to thermodynamic properties of the respective reaction steps has never been systematically investigated. As a central result, it is shown here that for a general class of enzyme reaction mechanisms the quotients of net and exchange fluxes measured by 13 C MFA are coupled to Gibbs energies of the reaction steps. To establish this relation the concept of apparent flux ratios of enzymatic isotope-labeling networks is introduced and some computing rules for these flux ratios are given. Application of these rules reveals a conceptional pitfall of 13 C MFA, which is the inherent dependency of measured exchange fluxes on the chosen <b>tracer</b> <b>atom.</b> However, it is shown that this effect can be neglected for typical biochemical reaction steps under physiological conditions. In this situation, the central result can be formulated as a two-sided inequality relating fluxes, pool sizes, and standard Gibbs energies.

However, depending on the diffusion time and grain size a given <b>tracer</b> <b>atom</b> can be expected to cross a number of grain boundaries in its diffusion time. This has recently been taken into account in square and cubic grain models for determining the limit of the Harrison Type-A regime.

The applicability of different solutions for the grain boundary diffusion analysis is numerically investigated for the 3 D model.

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of jump {{frequencies}} of 111 In/Cd <b>tracer</b> <b>atoms</b> on the Sn-sublattice in rare-earth tri-stannides having the L 12 crystal structure via perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy (PAC). Phases studied were Sn 3 R (R= La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Gd). Earlier measurements on isostructural rare-earth tri-indides showed that the dominant diffusion mechanism changed along that series. The dominant mechanism was determined by comparing jump frequencies measured at opposing phase boundary compositions (that is, more In-rich and more In-poor). Jump frequencies were observed to be greater at the In-rich boundary composition in light lanthanide indides and greater at the In-poor boundary composition in heavy-lanthanide indides. These observations were attributed to predominance of diffusion via rare-earth vacancies in the former case and indium vacancies in the latter. Contrary to results for the indides, jump frequencies found in the present work are greater for the Sn-poor boundary compositions of the stannides, signaling that diffusive jumps are controlled by Sn-vacancies. Possible origins of these differences in diffusion mechanisms are discussed. Comment: 8 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R

Measurements at elevated temperatures exhibited nuclear relaxation (damping) of quadrupolar perturbation functions attributed to diffusional jumps of the probes among orientationally inequivalent Ga-sites.

The frequencies were determined by analysis of nuclear quadrupole relaxation produced by fluctuating electric field gradients. Samples were synthesized having nominal values n= 1, 2, 3, 5 and ∞, with n=∞ corresponding to the L 12 phase LaIn 3. The phases form heuristically from LaIn 3 by replacing every (n+ 1) th (100) mixed plane of La and In atoms with a plane of Co-atoms. For the n= 1 phase, LaCoIn 5, jump frequencies were too small to detect. Two signals were observed, one for indium atoms next to the Co-planes and the other for more distant indium atoms. No relaxation was observed for atoms next to the Co-planes, indicating that there is no diffusion across the Co-planes. With increasing n, jump rates for the other In-atoms increased toward values observed for LaIn 3. Jump frequency activation enthalpies for n= 3 and 5 were observed to be the same as for n=∞, suggesting the same diffusion mechanism. However, the jump-frequency prefactors were found to be smaller for small n, which is attributed to reductions in the connectivity of the diffusion sublattice. We conclude that diffusion in the layered phases is remarkably similar to diffusion in LaIn 3 once the reduced connectivity is taken into account.

40|$|The long lived {{naturally}} occurring radon progeny {{species in the}} atmosphere, namely (210) pb, Bi- 210 and Po- 210, {{have been used as}} important tracers for understanding the atmospheric mixing processes and estimating aerosol residence times. Several observations in the past have shown that the activity size distribution of these species peaks at larger particle sizes as compared to the short lived radon progeny species an effect that has been attributed to the process of coagulation of the background aerosols to which they are attached. To address this issue, a mathematical equation is derived for the activity-size distribution of tracer species by formulating a generalized distribution function for the number of <b>tracer</b> <b>atoms</b> present in coagulating background particles in the presence of radioactive decay and removal. A set of these equations is numerically solved for the progeny chain using Fuchs coagulation kernel combined with a realistic steady-state aerosol size spectrum that includes nucleation, accumulation and coarse mode components. The important findings are: (i) larger shifts in the modal sizes of Pb- 210 and Po- 210 at higher aerosol concentrations such as that found in certain Asian urban regions (ii) enrichment of tracer specific activity on particles as compared to that predicted by pure attachment laws (iii) sharp decline of daughter-to-parent activity ratios for decreasing particle sizes. The implication of the results to size-fractionated residence time estimation techniques is highlighted. A coagulation corrected graphical approach is presented for estimating the residence times from the size-segregated activity ratios of Bi- 210 and Po- 210 with respect to Pb- 210. The discrepancy between the residence times predicted by conventional formula and the coagulation corrected approach for specified activity ratios increases at higher atmospheric aerosol number concentrations (> 1010 #/m(3)) for smaller sizes (< 1 pm).

40|$|Surface {{diffusion}} coefficient Ds(T) measured for the canonical metallic glass, Pd 40 Cu 30 Ni 10 P 20, by {{the method of}} surface-grating decay {{was found to be}} more than eight orders of magnitude larger than the bulk {{diffusion coefficient}}. So far no theory has attempted to account quantitatively for this spectacular enhancement of diffusion at the surface. The objective of the research reported in this paper is the application of the Coupling Model (CM) to predict the size of the surface diffusion found in Pd 40 Cu 30 Ni 10 P 20. The prediction compares well with the size of the enhancement obtained by experiment. There is yet another prediction of the CM, which is Ds(T) having the same Arrhenius activation energy as the bulk diffusion coefficient DvCo of the <b>tracer</b> 57 Co <b>atoms</b> in the same metallic glass. This prediction is also verified by the experimental data, and it provides additional support of the theoretical explanation of the enhancement of diffusion at the surface. A successful application of the CM to account for the decoupling of diffusion coefficient of P from that of Pd in the bulk of a similar metallic glass, Pd 43 Cu 27 Ni 10 P 20, is recalled because the physics involved therein is similar to the present problem...|$|R
