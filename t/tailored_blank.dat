40|$|Tailored blanks are {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} automotive industry. A <b>tailored</b> <b>blank</b> consists of different metal parts, which are joined by a welding process. These metal parts usually have different material properties. Hence, the main advantage of using a <b>tailored</b> <b>blank</b> is to provide the right material properties at specific parts of the blank. The movement of the weld during forming is extremely important. Unwanted weld displacement can cause damage to both the product and the tool.

40|$|Incremental equal channel angular {{pressing}} (I-ECAP) is {{a process}} used for production of continuous ultrafine grained bars, plates and sheets.

However, if a final product requires being thinner and therefore longer, the bottom position of the punch can be lowered before the last pass. Going further, the bottom position of the punch can be changed during the process, which opens up a possibility to vary billet thickness along its length.

These aspects has to be considered for the tool and process design especially for forming operations. On the other hand, new innovative technologies (e. g. press hardening, hydroforming, temperature-supported forming processes, high-speed forming processes) lead to additional demands to guarantee high-quality parts. The determination of relevant material parameters which describe accurately the forming behavior represents the precondition for the extension of the application of these new materials and these innovative forming processes. In this context, the consideration of the following features is of crucial importance: - forming temperature - forming speed - high forming levels Another demand is the use of the FE simulation as an effective tool for process design.
