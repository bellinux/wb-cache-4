2500|$|Bored {{with the}} sketch format {{and with a}} yearning to {{recapture}} previous success as a playwright, Wood came up with six individual sitcoms as a compromise. She admitted to finding the writing difficult. Though Wood was written as the central character, other lead parts were written with specific actresses in mind, like Julie Walters and Una Stubbs. [...] "I want people <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> {{and the people who}} play my friends, and not everybody else" [...] she said. Screenonline says of the shows [...] "Modest in ambition and scale but rich in wit and acuity, the six playlets showcase Wood's eye for human foibles and her distinctively eccentric characters.".|$|E

[...] "To test God would be to never train, never practice, and then to walk across the Grand Canyon; or to jump off a building, or throw myself {{in front of a}} truck," [...] he says. [...] Wallenda says he tries to live [...] "an upright life" [...] and be a good example. Despite his success, Wallenda wants people to think of him as just a regular guy. [...] "I want people <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> just for who I am," [...] he says. [...] "What you get is a regular person. I want people to relate to me." [...] Friends {{described}} him as a lighthearted guy who is always cracking jokes.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{a damned}} silly thing to say. Everyone doesn't want <b>to</b> act <b>like</b> <b>me.</b> The great {{majority}} are perfectly content {{to do the}} ordinary thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everybody does," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl coolly. [...] "I'm glad {{you like the}} way I talk. But I want you <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>ME,</b> too--AS WELL as you like Felicity and Cecily. Not BETTER. I wanted that once but I've got over it. I found out in Sunday School, the day the {{minister}} taught our class, that it was selfish. But I want you <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> AS WELL." ...|$|E
60|$|Cecily. How {{nice of you}} <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> so {{much after}} we {{have known each other}} such a {{comparatively}} short time. Pray sit down.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Don't mention it,' {{said the}} young man. 'I enjoy arbitrating in these little disputes. Dogs seem <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> and trust my judgement. I {{consider}} {{myself as a}} sort of honorary dog.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{to marry}} me," [...] {{explained}} Ann. [...] "But I {{told him he}} must be an unnatural little beast not to try <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>me</b> when he knew how you loved me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes! Don't think me presuming; {{only think}} me vain. I can't {{hear you say}} too often that you have learned <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>me.</b> Is it really a {{pleasure}} to you to have me in the house? Have I always behaved well since I have been with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! He!' {{returned}} the Manager. 'He {{has never had}} occasion to acquire such little arts. <b>To</b> men <b>like</b> <b>me,</b> they are sometimes useful. As at present, Major Bagstock, when they enable {{me to take a}} hand with you.' ...|$|R
