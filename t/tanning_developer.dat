50|$|Handschiegl {{described}} the invention thus: A separate, black-and-white print for each color {{to be applied}} was made. Using an opaque paint, portions of the image where color was to be applied were blocked out. A duplicate negative was made from the painted print and developed in a <b>tanning</b> <b>developer,</b> which hardened the gelatin layer {{where it had been}} exposed and developed. Those areas corresponding to the blocked out areas on the print remained relatively soft and capable of taking up dye. This dyed matrix film was brought into contact, in accurate register, with a positive print, to which the dye transferred in the appropriate areas. The print made several passes through the dye transfer machines, in contact with a separate matrix for each color. Usually, three colors were applied at the most.|$|E
5000|$|As a chemist, he has {{designed}} products for Photographers' Formulary, Inc., including TF-4, the first alkaline fixer for {{black and white}} film and papers to be sold, and TD-3, a film developer which was reported to provide superior speed and dynamic range and lower grain {{in the category of}} low contrast film developers designed for high contrast films such as Kodak Technical Pan and similar. TF-4's use as a helpful adjunct to <b>tanning</b> <b>developers</b> was discussed in detail by Gordon Hutchings in [...] "The Book of Pyro" [...] Alkaline fixing for black and white silver halide films and printing papers was considered revolutionary when Troop introduced it. Though still controversial, it has since become a recognized technique in photographic processing as it offers reduced washing times, increased archival stability, and reduced environmental impact. Troop published the first formulas for alkaline fixers, and several manufacturers now produce them.|$|R
