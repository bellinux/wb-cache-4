25|$|After {{suffering}} a ten-year {{downturn in the}} 1990s, the Lego Group went forward {{with the idea of}} storytelling, believing a theme with a storyline behind it would appeal to their audience. Their first attempt was the Star Wars line based on the film series of the same name. Despite becoming an instant success upon its 1999 release, the royalty payments to the franchise owners Lucasfilm limited Lego's profit, prompting the latter to decide that an original story would be more advantageous to them. Their first attempts were the Slizer/Throwbots and RoboRiders themes released in 1999 and 2000, respectively, under the Lego Group's already-established <b>Technic</b> construction series. <b>Technic</b> construction elements, such as the then-innovative 'ball-and-socket' system used to create free joint movement, were heavily incorporated into the sets and would go on to be used and greatly expanded upon in Bionicle.|$|E

500|$|Pet Shop (set number 10218), {{released}} in May 2011, is the sixth {{set in the}} Modular Buildings series. [...] The set contains 2032 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. It is the first set in the series that is actually made out of 2 buildings that separate using the same <b>Technic</b> pins that link the rest of the modulars together. They can be reversed or separated and wrapped around another building. The brown building is a town house and the sand blue building is the Pet Shop. The brown building is the only building, with the exception of Market Street, that has a basement. There is a special feature on the Pet Shop on the ground floor, where the staircase can be folded away for more access room for playing (this was an issue with Market Street). There are 4 minifigures, 2 parrots and a fish tank with goldfish. The set also includes 3 dog bones, a ball, a frog toy, a birdhouse, a bucket and a brush. This is also the smallest set by height and stands at just over 25cm. The next tallest modular is Market Street at 33cm. The set includes a full interior including a toilet, bed, kitchen and fireplace.|$|E
