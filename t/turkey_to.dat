5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the FPÖ {{became more}} eurosceptic, which was {{reflected}} by its change from pan-Germanism to Austrian patriotism.

Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs–with the likely option being the F-35B. The Spanish government, in May 2014 however, announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft's service life to beyond 2025 {{due to a lack of}} funds for a replacement aircraft.|$|E

Demands by the UK Treasury to cut the defence budget led to Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailing plans on 21July2004 to withdraw the Jaguar by 2007. An expected date of October 2007 for the out of service date was brought forward at just five days notice to 30 April 2007. On 20December2007, a Jaguar operated by Qinetiq undertook the last ever British military Jaguar flight.|$|E

5|$|After {{some time}} off to recover in Zwittau, Schindler was {{promoted}} to second in command of his Abwehr unit and relocated with his wife to Ostrava, on the Czech-Polish border, in January 1939. He was involved in espionage {{in the months leading}} up to Hitler's seizure of the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March. Emilie helped him with paperwork, processing and hiding secret documents in their apartment for the Abwehr office. As he frequently travelled to Poland on business, he and his 25 agents were in a position to collect information about Polish military activities and railways for the planned invasion of Poland. One assignment called for his unit to monitor and provide information about the railway line and tunnel in the Jablunkov Pass, deemed critical for the movement of German troops. Schindler continued to work for Abwehr until as late as fall 1940, when he was sent to <b>Turkey</b> <b>to</b> investigate corruption among the Abwehr officers assigned to the German embassy there.|$|E
