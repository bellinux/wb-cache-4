5|$|William Warburton's {{treatise}} The Divine Legation of Moses, published from 1738 to 1741, {{included an}} analysis of ancient mystery rites that drew upon Sethos for much of its evidence. Assuming that all mystery rites derived from Egypt, Warburton argued that {{the public face of}} Egyptian religion was polytheistic, but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal a deeper, monotheistic truth to elite initiates. One of them, Moses, learned <b>this</b> <b>truth</b> during his Egyptian upbringing and developed Judaism to reveal it to the entire Israelite nation.|$|E
5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging <b>this</b> <b>truth,</b> Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} {{of truth in}} an interpretation that uses a variable assignment function cannot work with empty domains, {{because there are no}} variable assignment functions whose range is empty. (Similarly, one cannot assign interpretations to constant symbols.) <b>This</b> <b>truth</b> definition requires that one must select a variable assignment function (μ above) before truth values for even atomic formulas can be defined. Then the truth value of a sentence is defined to be its truth value under any variable assignment, and it is proved that <b>this</b> <b>truth</b> value does not depend on which assignment is chosen. This technique does not work if there are no assignment functions at all; it must be changed to accommodate empty domains.|$|E

25|$|Interpretation of {{the atomic}} {{formulas}} of L is more complicated.

Similarly, for each n-ary relation symbol R of L and each n-tuple <a0,...,an-1> of elements of M, the model must assign an element of B to be the truth value ||R(a0,...,an-1)||.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek {{philosophers}} took {{such questions}} very seriously. Indeed, {{many of their}} general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. Plato (424/423BC 348/347BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic Ideas (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, {{in a world of}} mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the truths about these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is discovered by humans. In the Meno Plato's teacher Socrates asserts {{that it is possible to}} come to know <b>this</b> <b>truth</b> by a process akin to memory retrieval.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of sciences (especially natural philosophy) {{that took place}} in Western Europe during the Middle Ages, often has its foundation in the works of the Arabs who translated works from Greek and Latin. The works of Aristotle {{played a major role in}} the subsequent institutionalization, systematization, and expansion of reason. Christianity accepted reason within the ambit of faith. In Christendom, reason was considered subordinate to revelation, which contained the ultimate truth and <b>this</b> <b>truth</b> could not be challenged. Even though they had the urge to use their reason, they had little on which to exercise it. In medieval universities, the faculty for natural philosophy and theology were separate, and discussions pertaining to theological issues were often not allowed to be undertaken by the faculty of philosophy.|$|E

25|$|She later met a {{representative}} from a public relations company who agreed to help Artemis with her public likeability. What Artemis {{was not aware of}} was that the company, {{with the help of the}} White Magician, had set up several battles for her with superhuman men. However, she ultimately helped downtrodden groups such as immigrant workers and abused women. Once she uncovered <b>this</b> <b>truth</b> she set about to prove herself by single-handedly taking down Boston's biggest mob boss: Julianna Sazia. Unable to capture Julianna, Artemis destroyed her army of robots and Sazia's booby-trapped mansion. Later, Artemis' arrogance gained the better of her, and she died in a battle with the White Magician who gained extreme power while accidentally being transported to hell. Thus, Queen Hippolyta's vision of Wonder Woman dying came true (Although, ironically, Diana still died for a time shortly after Artemis's death; Hippolyta had used a spell to slightly weaken Diana during the contest and her weakened strength resulted in her losing a crucial fight).|$|E

25|$|Twilight {{is about}} a 17-year-old girl named Bella Swan, who moves from her mother's home in Phoenix, Arizona, {{to live with her}} father in her birthtown of Forks, Washington. There, she becomes {{intrigued}} by a student, Edward Cullen. When Edward saves her life, he exhibits super-human qualities. Bella learns from her family friend Jacob Black that Quileute legends say the Cullen family are vampires. Edward eventually admits to <b>this</b> <b>truth,</b> though his family hunts only animals, not humans, through moral choice. Edward constantly warns Bella against being with him, perceiving her life to be at constant risk if she continues to associate with him because the scent of her blood is more powerful to him than that of any other human he has ever encountered. Bella's love and confidence in Edward's restraint is such that his warnings go unheeded, and on an outing with the Cullens she becomes the target of a sadistic vampire, James. With his family's help, Edward is able to save Bella from James' predations, but Edward is still unwilling to change Bella into a vampire himself.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say <b>this</b> <b>truth.</b> I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

50|$|According to Soares de Azevedo, the Perennialist {{philosophy}} {{states that}} the universal truth is the same {{within each of the}} world's orthodox religious traditions, and is the foundation of their religious knowledge and doctrine.

Thereby he declared {{an end to the}} Historikerstreit ('historians' dispute') that had sharply divided German scholars and journalists for two years, stating [...] "Auschwitz remains unique.

500|$|Sam Jones III plays Pete Ross, {{another of}} Clark's best friends. He hates the Luthors {{for what he}} sees as their thievery of his family's creamed corn business, and is the first person Clark voluntarily informs of his secret. It is {{established}} in season three's [...] "Truth", that Pete is in love with Chloe. He kept <b>this</b> <b>truth</b> to himself because of the Clark–Lana–Chloe love triangle already taking place. In season three's [...] "Velocity", Pete, feeling alienated by Clark, begins hanging around a group of street racers. When Pete refuses to throw a race, his life is put in jeopardy, and he forces Clark to abuse his powers in order to help Pete win a race. This leads to a falling out between the two friends. The character was written out of the series at the end of season three, citing the trouble keeping Clark's secret was causing him. Pete returns to Smallville in season seven's [...] "Hero", after gaining superhuman abilities from kryptonite-enhanced chewing gum, which allow him to stretch his body to extreme lengths. Lex learns the truth and blackmails Pete into abusing his powers for Lex's personal gain. Clark steps in and saves Pete, and the pair mend their relationship before Pete leaves Smallville again.|$|E
500|$|Newton, using old {{technology}} from Walter and Bell's research, {{is able to}} pull an entire building from the parallel universe to the prime, and the team races against time to prevent harm when, due {{to the laws of}} mass conservation, a building from the prime is pulled to the parallel one. This event forces Walter to try to coax Olivia to recall her Cortexiphan abilities as to identify things affected by the parallel universe. Initially unable to do so, her fear of failure enables her ability, allowing them to save the people within the target building, but also revealing to her that Peter is from the parallel universe. Walter explains to Olivia that in 1985, he and Bell had devised a way to observe the parallel universe, where he found his doppelgänger, [...] "Walternate", was also close to losing his son. Though Walter's Peter had died, Walternate continued to search for a cure, but missed the telltale sign when the Observer September arrived at his lab. Walter resynthesized the cure and aimed to cross over using untested equipment at Reiden Lake, though stalled by Nina and his lab assistant Clara. Nina tackled him on his way over, losing her arm in the process, while Walter, on the other side, found the cure vial broken. Intent on curing the alternate Peter, he posed as his father and crossed back with Peter, intending to administer the cure at the lab and then return Peter. However, on the return, the ice on Reiden Lake broke, threatening to drown both, but they were saved by September, who cautioned Walter [...] "the boy must live". While Walter successfully administered the cure, his wife Elizabeth saw Peter, and Walter realized he could never return Peter to the parallel universe. After Walter reveals <b>this</b> <b>truth,</b> he considers letting Peter know but struggles with how to do so, hoping to seek repentance from God for his actions.|$|E
