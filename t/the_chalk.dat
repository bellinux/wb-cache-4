5|$|The South Downs {{dominate}} Eastbourne and the Eastbourne Downland Estate can be {{seen from}} most of the town. These were originally chalk deposits laid down under the sea during the Late Cretaceous, and were later lifted by the same tectonic plate movements that formed the European Alps, during the middle Tertiary period. <b>The</b> <b>chalk</b> can be clearly seen along the eroded coastline {{to the west of the}} town, in the area known as Beachy Head and the Seven Sisters, where continuous erosion keeps the cliff edge vertical and white. <b>The</b> <b>chalk</b> contains many fossils such as ammonites and nautilus. The town area is built on geologically recent alluvial drift, the result of the silting up of a bay. This changes to Weald clay around the Langney estate.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of soil in the Languedoc varies from <b>the</b> <b>chalk,</b> limestone and gravel based soils inland to more alluvial soils near the coast. Some of the more highly rated vineyards are laid on top of ancient riverbed stones {{similar to those of}} Châteauneuf-du-Pape.|$|E

5|$|At Lulworth Cove, {{the waves}} have cut {{their way through}} the {{resistant}} Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature of this part of the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch.

5|$|Part of <b>the</b> <b>chalk</b> cliff {{near the}} lower {{terminus}} collapsed in 1957, forcing the railway's closure while a strengthening concrete wall was built. The new wall reduced the lower terminus {{to a single}} length of track. The second track at Hereson Road was closed at the same time, and removed to build a short siding {{near the bottom of}} the tunnel for stabling the trains. The wooden station platforms were replaced by modern concrete structures.|$|E
5|$|The land {{immediately}} {{south and}} west of the town {{is part of the}} Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is traversed by the South Dorset Ridgeway, part of the South West Coast Path. There are over five hundred ancient monuments along <b>the</b> <b>chalk</b> hills that form the ridgeway, including barrows, stone circles and hillforts; many archaeological finds from the area are on view at the Dorset County Museum in Dorchester.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was {{estimated}} to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding {{the cost of the}} heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like phosphorus-32, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>Chalk</b> River Laboratories passed to the Atomic Energy Control Board.|$|E
5|$|Ditton is {{situated}} between the Lower Weald and <b>the</b> <b>Chalk</b> (North) Downs. The parish encompasses the Lower Greensand strata, where a formation of hard sandy limestone {{known as the}} Hythe Beds is abundant. From this formation ragstone is obtained. Kentish ragstone was a historically important building material in south east England. The Romans used ragstone {{in the construction of}} London and villas in the south-east. Medieval builders used ragstone to build churches, civic buildings, houses and bridges over local rivers. The predominance of ragstone beds in the locality gave Ditton a legacy of quarrying which continues today.|$|E
5|$|In 1880 the Burne-Joneses bought Prospect House in Rottingdean, near Brighton in Sussex, {{as their}} holiday home, {{and soon after}} the next door Aubrey Cottage to create North End House, {{reflecting}} {{the fact that their}} Fulham home was in North End Road. (Years later, in 1923, Sir Roderick Jones, head of Reuters, and his wife, playwright and novelist Enid Bagnold, were to add the adjacent Gothic House to the property, which became the inspiration and setting for her play <b>The</b> <b>Chalk</b> Garden).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Austin <b>Chalk</b> {{consists}} of recrystalized, fossiliferous, interbedded chalks and marls. Exposures of Austin Chalk are mainly seen in quarries, roadcuts, and stream beds {{where the water}} eroded the soil. <b>The</b> Austin <b>Chalk</b> outcrops and can be seen throughout Dallas, and extends south underneath I-35 down into Austin and San Antonio. Volcanic ash layers are present in <b>the</b> Austin <b>chalk,</b> and were deposited by wind from distant erupting volcanoes around 86 mya. These eruptions occurred along a 250-mile long by 50 mile wide belt of submarine volcanoes, which are located in present-day south-central Texas. This belt of volcanoes coincides with the trend of the Balcones Fault zone and {{is known as the}} Balcones volcanic province. Evidence of these ancient volcanoes is only visible in a few places since most were buried by the Austin and Taylor Group, and now are in the subsurface. The presence of this volcanism during deposition of <b>the</b> Austin <b>Chalk</b> is correlated with the Laramide orogeny. Sea level rose for conditions to be right for the deposition of <b>the</b> Austin <b>Chalk,</b> which also coincides with the maximum extent of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. The depths of the deposition of <b>the</b> Austin <b>Chalk</b> occurred in ~250 m or 820 ft of water. <b>The</b> Austin <b>Chalk</b> is filled with micro-organism fossils known as coccoliths.|$|R

5|$|McBride {{made his}} major league debut for the Cardinals in 1973, but he {{retained}} his rookie status after only appearing in 40 games that year. He became {{known for a}} distinctive appearance, as he wore {{one of the largest}} Afro hairstyles in the major leagues. When he stepped to home plate to bat, McBride made a ritual of wiping away <b>the</b> <b>chalk</b> lines that made up the batter's box. He used an unconventional batting stance, placing his weight on his front foot rather than on his back foot.|$|E
5|$|Operations {{along the}} Vimy Ridge were {{accompanied}} by extensive underground excavations. The Arras–Vimy sector was conducive to tunnelling owing to the soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of <b>the</b> <b>chalk</b> underground. Underground warfare had been conducted on the Vimy sector since 1915. Bavarian engineers had blown twenty mines in the sector by March 1915. By early 1916, German miners had gained an advantage over their French counterparts. British tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers took over progressively from the French between February and May 1916.|$|E
5|$|Snowdon Hill Quarry is a 0.6 hectare (1.3 acre) {{geological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest on {{the western}} outskirts. The site shows rock exposures through the Upper Greensand and Chalk, containing fossil crustaceans which are both unique and exceptionally well-preserved making it a key locality {{for the study of}} palaeontology in Britain. The unit has been dated to the subdivision of <b>the</b> <b>Chalk</b> known as the Turrilites acutus Zone, named after one of the characteristic fossils, which was laid down in the Middle Cenomanian era between 99.6 ± 0.9 MA and 93.5 ± 0.8 MA (million years ago).|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing was pioneered in Texas’ Austin <b>Chalk</b> play in <b>the</b> 1980s. Stephen Holdich, {{head of the}} Department of Petroleum Engineering at Texas A&M University, commented: “In fact, <b>the</b> Austin <b>Chalk</b> is <b>the</b> model for modern shale development methods.” <b>The</b> Austin <b>Chalk</b> play started in 1981 with vertical wells, but died with {{the decline in the}} oil price in 1982. In 1983, Maurer Engineering designed the equipment to drill the first medium-range horizontal well in <b>the</b> Austin <b>Chalk.</b> Horizontal drilling revived the play by increasing production, and lengths of the horizontal parts of the wellbores grew with greater experience and improvements in drilling technology. Union Pacific Resources, since absorbed by Anadarko Petroleum, entered <b>the</b> Austin <b>Chalk</b> play in a major way in 1987, and drilled more than a thousand horizontal wells in <b>the</b> Austin <b>Chalk,</b> with multistage massive slickwater hydraulic fracture treatments, making major improvements in drilling and fracturing techniques.|$|R

30|$|<b>Chalking,</b> <b>the</b> {{final stage}} of {{photocatalytic}} binder degradation, can present itself in different ways. In some cases, e.g. for well-dispersed paints, chalking starts evenly, but the layer of loose pigment on the surface remains very thin. In other cases, <b>the</b> <b>chalking</b> starts in ‘patches’ on the surface. This can be in one or multiple spots, before reaching an even chalking stage. Assessment of <b>the</b> state of <b>chalking</b> {{was carried out by}} swiping a black cotton swab (brand: Malian) across the paint surface. The contrast between the white pigment and the black cotton swab enhances chalk visibility.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chalk</b> River reactor {{was shut}} down for {{maintenance}} in August 2009, and reopened in August 2010. The Petten reactor had a 6-month scheduled maintenance shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply has left a gap, leaving some practitioners to revert to techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium.|$|E
5|$|The P-9 Project was the codename given during World War II to the Manhattan Project's {{heavy water}} {{production}} program. The Cominco plant at Trail, British Columbia, was upgraded to produce heavy water. DuPont built three {{plants in the}} United States: at the Morgantown Ordnance Works, near Morgantown, West Virginia; at the Wabash River Ordnance Works, near Dana and Newport, Indiana; and at the Alabama Ordnance Works, near Childersburg and Sylacauga, Alabama. The American plants operated from 1943 until 1945. The Canadian plant at Trail continued in operation until 1956. Three nuclear reactors were built using the heavy water produced by the P-9 Project: Chicago Pile 3 at Argonne, and ZEEP and NRX at <b>the</b> <b>Chalk</b> River Laboratories in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. <b>The</b> <b>chalk</b> formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds rise up to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.|$|E

25|$|Russell also {{published}} additional information and speculation on mosasaur biostratigraphy. He reported {{the presence of}} mosasaur vertebrae up to 90 million years old among the Turonian fossils curated by the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History. Another of this work's significant contributions to mosasaur biostratigraphy concerned the mosasaurs of <b>the</b> Smoky Hill <b>Chalk.</b> Russell devised two biostratigraphic zones based on <b>the</b> <b>Chalk's</b> mosasaur fossils. <b>The</b> lower zone was characterized by Clidastes liodontus, Platecarpus coryphaeus, and Tylosaurus nepaeolicus. The upper was home to Clidastes, Platecarpus ictericus, and Tylosaurus proriger. He regarded Platecarpus and Tylosaurus as deep water animals but concluded that the biostratigraphic evidence from the Smoky Hill mosasaurs suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Chalk's</b> depositional environment was becoming shallower and nearer to the ancient coastline over time. Russell also argued {{that by the end}} of the Late Cretaceous, mosasaurs were converging on the body plan that characterized the first ichthyosaurs during the Triassic period and gradually replacing these older marine reptiles.|$|R
