This timeline includes information that was not operationally released, meaning that data from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as the subtropical phase of Omeka, is included.

5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. These problems are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve these problems in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal <b>Time</b> (<b>UTC)</b> rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, the {{hurricane}} began to rapidly deepen over warm {{waters of the}} Caribbean Sea; by 1800 Coordinated Universal <b>Time</b> (<b>UTC),</b> it had strengthened to Category 4 intensity. Continuing westward, the storm passed north of Swan Island later that day. Early on September 2, a double eyewall appeared on satellite imagery. Carmen's forward movement gradually slowed as the storm took a west by north direction, and it reached its initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h), accompanied by a central barometric pressure of 928 mbar (hPa; 27.4 inHg). Atmospheric steering currents became increasingly weaker, and Carmen slowed to a drift. Later on September 2, {{the hurricane}} made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula; its northern jog spared Belize City from a direct hit. The storm's center passed {{a few miles north}} of Chetumal, Quintana Roo.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} May 2010, a {{surge in}} the monsoon {{produced}} widespread convection, or thunderstorms, off the southwest coast of India in the southeastern Arabian Sea.

The low moved northwestward within an area of warm water temperatures of , moderate wind shear, and an upper-level environment conducive for tropical cyclogenesis, The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) first noted the system on May30 as an area of potential development. The circulation became more defined within the building convection, which was amplified by outflow from an anticyclone over the northern Arabian Sea. At 03:00Coordinated Universal <b>Time</b> (<b>UTC)</b> on May31, the IMD designated the system as a depression about 1,000km (620mi) west-southwest of Mumbai, India, or about 1,260km (785mi) southeast of Muscat, Oman. At 18:00UTC, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the storm, designating it as Tropical Cyclone 03A.|$|E

25|$|A leap {{second is}} a one-second {{adjustment}} that is occasionally applied to Coordinated Universal <b>Time</b> (<b>UTC)</b> {{in order to}} keep its time of day close to the mean solar time, or UT1. Without such a correction, time reckoned by Earth's rotation drifts away from atomic time because of irregularities in the Earth's rate of rotation.

500|$|Some models do {{not produce}} output quickly enough {{to be used for}} the {{forecast}} cycle immediately after the model starts running (including HWRF, GFDL, and FSSE). Most of the above track models (except CLIPER) require data from global weather models, such as the GFS, which produce output about four hours after the synoptic times of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Universal Coordinated <b>Time</b> (<b>UTC).</b> [...] For half of their forecasts, the NHC issues forecasts only three hours after that time, so some [...] "early" [...] models — NHC90, BAM, and LBAR — are run using a 12-hour-old forecast for the current time. [...] "Late" [...] models, such as the GFS and GFDL, finish after the advisory has already been issued. These models are interpolated to the current storm position for use in the following forecast cycle — for example, GFDI, the interpolated version of the GFDL model.|$|E
500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of an ocean weather vessel was to take surface and upper air weather measurements, and report them via radio at the {{synoptic}} hours of 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 Universal Coordinated <b>Time</b> (<b>UTC).</b> Weather ships also reported observations from merchant vessels, which were reported by radio back to {{their country of origin}} using a code based on the [...] square in the ocean within which the ship was located. The vessels were involved in search and rescue operations involving aircraft and other ships. The vessels themselves had search radar and could activate a homing beacon to guide lost aircraft towards the ships' known locations. Each ship's homing beacon used a distinctly different frequency. [...] In addition, the ships provided a platform where scientific and oceanographic research could be conducted. The role of aircraft support gradually changed after 1975, as jet aircraft began using polar routes. [...] By 1982, the ocean weather vessel role had changed too, and the ships were used to support short range weather forecasting, in numerical weather prediction computer programs which forecast weather conditions several days ahead, for climatological studies, marine forecasting, and oceanography, as well as monitoring pollution out at sea. At the same time, the transmission of the weather data using Morse code was replaced by a system using telex-over-radio.|$|E
