5000|$|The game ends either when {{a player}} reaches <b>ten</b> or <b>more</b> points while holding {{at least a}} one-point {{advantage}} over all the other competitors or when a player or players reach <b>ten</b> or <b>more</b> points. Should multiple players reach <b>ten</b> or <b>more</b> points, the winner is the player with the lowest score {{at the start of}} the hand, and if a single winner can not be selected, the game is a [...] "draw" [...] among those with <b>ten</b> or <b>more</b> points. Only players who have taken tricks during the relevant hand are eligible to receive points. This implies that players may not receive points despite being on the successful team, which can cause competition within and between teams. The number of points awarded for sweeps, euchres, and lone hands is the same as Euchre.|$|R

In the 1690s, five missions were established: San Rafael de Velasco (1696), San José de Chiquitos (1698), Concepción (1699) and San Juan Bautista (1699).

5|$|The Mediterranean U-boat Campaign lasted {{approximately}} from 21 September 1941 to May 1944. The Kriegsmarine {{tried to}} isolate Gibraltar, Malta, and Suez and disrupt Britain's trade routes. More than sixty U-boats {{were sent to}} interdict Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea. Many of these U-boats were themselves attacked negotiating the Strait of Gibraltar controlled by Britain. Nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> were damaged.|$|E

5|$|The first {{complete}} specimen {{was announced}} in 1861, and <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> Archaeopteryx fossils have been found since then. Most of the eleven known fossils include impressions of feathers—among the oldest direct evidence of such structures. Moreover, because these feathers take the advanced form of flight feathers, Archaeopteryx fossils are evidence that feathers began to evolve before the Late Jurassic.|$|E
5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for third stage separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the third stage was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the third stage separated, and following <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> seconds of coasting, it ignited. The third stage was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E

5|$|Bedřich Smetana {{was born}} as Friedrich Smetana on 2March 1824, in Litomyšl, east of Prague near the {{traditional}} border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He {{was the third}} child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of the correct literary Czech until much later in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Bus chassis {{production}} {{began in}} 1950. VAT {{made the first}} prototypes of rear-engined buses in 1956. The company made two prototype chassis, which were designated model VAT-4800; the superstructures were made by coach builders Ajokki Oy and Nummela Oy. The solution caused several technical problems, including proper cooling and transfer of heating to {{the front end of}} the body. The cooling problem was finally solved by a large air scoop located at the back of the roof; this was not regarded as an aesthetically pleasing arrangement. As the solution was found, VAT produced <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> rear-engined chassis called type VAT-5200.|$|E

He won four badges for each of the next two years, and had earned almost all the badges available at the time. After becoming an Eagle Scout, he managed to earn another ten merit badges, for which he was awarded the bronze and gold palms.|$|E

5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Naomi was a {{short-lived}} Category 1 hurricane that made landfall in Mexico's Pacific coast during the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. After rapidly intensifying before its landfall in Sinaloa, Naomi caused rainfall throughout northern Mexico and the U.S. state of Texas {{in association with}} a frontal system, with the highest measurement occurring in Corpus Christi. Four people perished in Mexico due to Naomi's effects with <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> missing, all in Sinaloa. The only reported injury in Texas due to the remnants was a factory worker who was injured when {{the roof of the}} plant they were working in collapsed due to rainfall.|$|E

During the next ten months, Siboney made <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> round trips between the United States and France, returning over 3,000troops per trip when fully loaded. On one such return trip in August 1919, Siboney carried Admiral Henry T. Mayo and Congressman Thomas S. Butler home from France.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made to extend the trams with another center section, adding another axle and articulation, but these plans have been {{rejected}} by the company. Such a center section would be low-floor and give much easier access for strollers and wheelchairs, and allow the whole tram network to have step-free access. As of 2008, it was estimated that the SL79-series has about <b>ten</b> <b>more</b> years of service before it needs to be replaced. No plans {{have been made}} for new trams to be ordered.|$|E
