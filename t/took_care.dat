Later in July 1944, Schaub was present during the military briefing during which a bomb exploded, killing four people and injuring others; Hitler escaped with minor injuries.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} reviewed {{such areas}} as property, succession, maintenance, pensions, social welfare and tax and recommended {{some changes in the}} law to provide rights for qualifying cohabitees. These rights would be applied by the court on application as distinct from the 'automatic' rights of legal marriage.

5|$|Agoncillo and {{her daughters}} stayed in Hong Kong from 1895 to 1906. She <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of their house, which became an asylum. Their funds had run out because of the heavy {{expenses}} incurred by Don Felipe for his diplomatic activities in France and in the United States. She once had to sell the children's pinafores and their jewels to support her family and {{to pay for their}} voyage back to Manila. The other money was also used to help boost the revolutionary funds. Their support for the revolution made them an impoverished family; however, they gained it back when Don Felipe returned to his profession.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders <b>took</b> <b>care</b> to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of unripe figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage may {{extend beyond}} an {{aircraft}}'s airframe. High-flying aircraft {{can sometimes be}} detected by their vapor contrails. Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced {{with the use of}} chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots <b>took</b> <b>care</b> to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if the plane was creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E

2500|$|Further, {{this too}} should be said. Anyone who asserts that god exists either says that god <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> {{of the things}} in the cosmos or that he does not, and, if he does <b>take</b> <b>care,</b> that it is either of all things or of some. Now if he <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> of everything, there would be no {{particular}} evil thing and no evil in general in the but the Dogmatists say that everything is full of evil; therefore god shall not be said to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of everything. On the other hand, if he <b>takes</b> <b>care</b> of only some things, why does he <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of these and not of those? For either he wishes but is not able, or he is able but does not wish, or he neither wishes nor is able. If he both wished and was able, he would have <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> of everything; but, for the reasons stated above, he does not <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of everything; therefore, it is not the case that he both wishes and is able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of everything. But if he wishes and is not able, he is weaker than the cause on account of which he is not able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of the things of which he does not take care; but it is contrary to the concept of god that he should be weaker than anything. Again, if he is able to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> of everything but does not wish to do so, he will be considered malevolent, and if he neither wishes nor is able, he is both malevolent and weak; but to say that about god is impious. Therefore, god does not <b>take</b> <b>care</b> {{of the things in}} the cosmos.|$|R

5|$|Eleanor and her {{daughter}} Anna became estranged after she took over some of her mother's social duties at the White House. The relationship was further strained because Eleanor desperately wanted {{to go with her}} husband to Yalta in February 1945 (two months before FDR's death), but he took Anna instead. A few years later, the two were able to reconcile and cooperate on numerous projects. Anna <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of her mother when she was terminally ill in 1962.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} edition, {{published}} in 1539, Calvin dropped this format {{in favour of}} systematically presenting the main doctrines from the Bible. In the process, the book was enlarged from six chapters to seventeen. He concurrently worked on another book, the Commentary on Romans, {{which was published in}} March 1540. The book was a model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin Vulgate, an exegesis, and an exposition. In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work of his predecessors Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also <b>took</b> <b>care</b> to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|From 1940 to 1943, Nosaka's {{presence}} in China was kept a secret. Under a Chinese name, Lin Zhe, he directed {{the work of}} the Research Office of the Japanese Problem. His work with the Research Office in Yan'an brought Yan'an's intelligence information about Japan up to date. Nosaka collected newspapers and other publications from Japan. To research the enemy, Nosaka and his crew <b>took</b> <b>care</b> to analyze current events in Japan and China, which they did by stocking Japanese newspapers, magazines, journals, and diaries that were purchased or seized on the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{conversion}} in 1625 onwards, Baltimore <b>took</b> <b>care</b> to cater for the religious needs of his colonists, both Catholic and Protestant. He had asked Simon Stock to provide priests for the 1625 expedition, but Stock's recruits arrived in England after Aston had sailed. Stock's own ambitions for the colony appear to have exceeded Baltimore's: in letters to De Propaganda Fide in Rome, Stock claimed the Newfoundland settlement could act as a springboard for the conversion of natives not only in the New World but also in China, the latter via a passage he believed existed from the east coast to the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Ramakrishna {{developed}} throat cancer, and {{was transferred}} to Calcutta and (later) to a garden house in Cossipore. Narendra and Ramakrishna's other disciples <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of him during his last days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced Nirvikalpa samadhi. Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order. He was taught that service to men was the most effective worship of God. Ramakrishna asked him {{to care for the}} other monastic disciples, and in turn asked them to see Narendra as their leader. Ramakrishna died in the early-morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.|$|E

5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing {{that in the}} early 16th century one of the houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E
5|$|Since Ramanujan's {{father was}} at work most of the day, his mother <b>took</b> <b>care</b> of the boy as a child. He had a close {{relationship}} with her. From her, he learned about tradition and puranas. He learned to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits – all of which are part of Brahmin culture. At the Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{during the}} 20th or 21st Dynasty Amenhotep's {{original}} tomb was either robbed or deemed insecure and emptied {{and his body}} was moved for safety, probably more than once.

His mummy had apparently not been looted by the 21st dynasty, and the priests who moved the mummy <b>took</b> <b>care</b> to keep the Cartonnage intact. Because of that exquisite face mask, Amenhotep's is the only royal mummy which has not been unwrapped and examined by modern Egyptologists.|$|E
