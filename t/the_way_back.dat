5|$|Both Murphy and Universal gave serious {{considerations}} to {{a follow-up}} {{version of his}} post-war life. Murphy rejected the Richard J. Collins script <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Back</b> which created the fictional scenario that filming To Hell and Back had been so therapeutic for Murphy that it cured him of his combat fatigue. Spec McClure scripted a second unused version of <b>The</b> <b>Way</b> <b>Back</b> that incorporated Murphy's real-life friends into the storyline and ended with the star living happily ever after with Pamela and their two sons. A third version by an unknown writer focused on the Murphy-McClure friendship and {{was rejected by the}} threat of a lawsuit from McClure. Desi Arnaz offered to bankroll a 1965 project titled Helmets in the Dust. At Murphy's request McClure wrote a film treatment, but the project never came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|By {{morning of}} January 3, Washington had reached Princeton. After a brief battle, the British there were decisively {{defeated}} and {{a substantial number}} of the garrison under command of Mawhood was captured. With their third defeat in ten days, Cornwallis' superior, General William Howe, ordered the army to withdraw from southern New Jersey and most of <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to New York. This they did, leaving forward positions at New Brunswick. Washington moved his army to Morristown for winter quarters.|$|E
5|$|Grissom may not ask {{to take on}} {{the role}} of mentor, but it seems to happen naturally, going all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Sara Sidle when they first met in San Francisco, then Nick Stokes and Greg Sanders in Vegas. Although he can be annoyed with his protégés at times, he is visibly proud when they succeed, as Greg did by passing his field test and {{becoming}} a CSI. He is also protective of his staff and defends them as much as he can, as seen in episode 521 ("Rashomama") for example.|$|E

Finding her everyday routine dull and boring, she decides to join the Springfield police force, despite Homer's concerns.|$|E

5|$|Raynald made a plundering raid in {{the valley}} of the river Euphrates at Marash to seize cattle, horses and camels from the local peasants in November 1160 or 1161.

5|$|The disorganized {{nature of}} the British retreat {{demonstrated}} a loss of effective command. An experienced commander could easily have encamped at the Lake George landing, taken stock of the situation, and begun siege operations against the French. Abercrombie, {{to the surprise of}} some in his army, ordered a retreat all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the south end of Lake George. Nester, unable to find other rational reasons for this, claims that the general must have panicked.|$|E
5|$|After this battle, the Rhodian admirals {{decided to}} leave Chios and sail back home. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Rhodes, the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus died of the wounds he {{received}} at Chios, but before he died he appointed Cleonaeus as his successor. As the Rhodian fleet was sailing in the strait between Lade and Miletus {{on the shore of}} Asia Minor, Philip's fleet attacked them. Philip defeated the Rhodian fleet in the Battle of Lade and forced it to retreat back to Rhodes. The Milesians were impressed by the victory and sent Philip and Heracleides garlands of victory when they entered Milesian territory as did the city of Hiera Cone.|$|E
5|$|At the 2013 inquest {{into the}} roof {{collapse}} (see Government reaction below), testimony {{has revealed that}} many unpublicized structural problems at the mall dated all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to its initial construction in the late 1970s. In particular, the expansion joint above the escalators, the failure of which appears to have caused the roof deck collapse, was already not properly binding to the concrete, in turn allowing water to seep into the building's seams, as early as 1981 — barely {{a year after the}} mall's original opening. The expansion joint was fixed many times, and fully replaced twice, during the building's lifetime, yet always began tearing away from the concrete again shortly after the repairs were complete.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, The Greencards {{relocated}} from Austin to Nashville, to {{be closer}} to their production company and its staff. Coinciding with their move to Nashville and work on their second album Weather and Water, the changes in location and sound were observed by critics to be a deliberate move from the jam-style of their debut album Movin' On to instead concentrate on Americana-focused music. By 2006, The Greencards had an annual slot at Merlefest, held yearly in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The band was nominated in the Americana Music Association Awards for 2006 in the category of New/Emerging Artist of the Year, winning the award. In December 2006, their tour van rolled over on a patch of ice after leaving a performance in Bryan, Texas on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Austin, but with no serious injuries.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the month}} the 2/6th had reached Nassau Bay where it secured landing beaches for an amphibious landing by US troops from the 162nd Regimental Combat Team. Once established, the 2/6th then led <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> west towards Bitoi Ridge, ranging ahead of the Americans as the Allies began to {{encircle}} Mubo. In early July, the 2/7th attacked Observation Hill and as the Japanese began to withdraw from Mubo, the 2/5th was sent north to act in support of the newly arrived Militia 15th Brigade, which was moving on Bobdubi Ridge. In mid-July, amidst heavy close-quarters fighting, the 2/5th Infantry Battalion captured the southern parts of Mount Tambu.|$|E
5|$|Conquering {{the peoples}} of the Alps in 16BC was another {{important}} victory for Rome, since it provided a large territorial buffer between the Roman citizens of Italy and Rome's enemies in Germania to the north. Horace dedicated an ode to the victory, while the monument Trophy of Augustus near Monaco was built to honor the occasion. The capture of the Alpine region also served the next offensive in 12BC, when Tiberius began the offensive against the Pannonian tribes of Illyricum, and his brother Nero Claudius Drusus moved against the Germanic tribes of the eastern Rhineland. Both campaigns were successful, as Drusus' forces reached the Elbe River by 9BC—though he died shortly after by falling off his horse. It was recorded that the pious Tiberius walked in front of his brother's body all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to Rome.|$|E

5|$|During the happenings of the episode, a man playing Santa at a Christmas-themed ranch {{is shown}} videotaping the {{children}} at his ranch. Billie later tells Mulder that she saw a vision of her daughter in her room and that she said the number 74. Mulder decides he cannot finish the case and wants {{to take time off}} because he's too close to make any sound judgment. On their way to the airport, Scully comes across the Santa park (situated off of California State Route 74) and decides to stop because of the reference to Santa Claus in the notes.

5|$|During {{the late}} summer of 1855, Gray made his third trip to Europe. This was an {{emergency}} trip to bring home his ill brother-in-law from Paris. Gray spent only three weeks in London and Paris, and on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> he read the newly published Géographie botanique raisonnée by Alphonse deCandolle. This was a ground-breaking book {{that for the first}} time brought together the large mass of data being collected by the expeditions of the time. The natural sciences had become highly specialized, yet this book synthesized them to explain living organisms within their environment and why plants were distributed the way they were, all upon a geologic scale. Gray instantly saw that this brought taxonomic botany into focus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; {{possession}} of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei {{is said to have}} dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend {{to be the result of}} Benkei's kicking the bell all <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> to the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as a gift from the dragon deity Ryūjin, after saving the god from a giant centipede.|$|E
