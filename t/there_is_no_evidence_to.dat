5|$|Archaeologists have {{attempted}} to test the suicide theory, particularly by {{the examination of the}} remains of skulls, but have been unable to reach a conclusion.

5|$|Bellinger is {{the only}} Ireland King of Arms known to have made any grants of arms. However two of his four known grants were annulled and or regranted, because their {{recipients}} were within the heraldic jurisdiction of other kings of arms. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest that any Ireland Kings of Arms ever attempted to exercise control over the heraldic practice of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Cadbury Camp is an Iron Age hill fort in Somerset, England, {{near the}} village of Tickenham. It is a {{scheduled}} monument. Although primarily known as a fort during the Iron Age it is likely, from artefacts, including a bronze spear or axe head, discovered at the site, that it was first used in the Bronze Age and still occupied through the Roman era into the Anglo-Saxon period. It has been associated with Arthurian England and Camelot; however <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support this.|$|E
5|$|Historical data {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse {{due to lack}} of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, though <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> prove the theory. It is considered unlikely {{due to lack of}} damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E

5|$|Improvement of {{neurological}} function usually occurs {{for two or}} {{more years}} after the trauma. For many years {{it was believed that}} recovery was fastest during the first six months, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support this. It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|King Henry's Mound, a Neolithic burial barrow, is {{the highest}} point within the park and is located within the public gardens of Pembroke Lodge. At various times the mound's name has been {{connected}} with Henry VIII or with his father Henry VII. But <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support the legend that Henry VIII stood on the mound to watch for a sign from St Paul's that Anne Boleyn had been executed at the Tower {{and that he was}} then free to marry Jane Seymour.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} pyjama shark as Near Threatened, citing its small {{distribution}} {{and a recent}} increase in fishing pressure on small sharks in the region. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest that its population has declined. There are no specific conservation measures in place for this species, though its range encompasses two marine reserves. The South African Sea Fisheries Research Institute is considering legally decommercializing the pyjama shark, which would limit {{the degree to which}} it can be targeted by commercial fisheries.|$|E

5|$|Between 24 April and 1 May, the IX Army {{fought a}} desperate action {{to break out}} of the pocket in an attempt to link up with the XII Army. Hitler assumed that after a {{successful}} breakout from the pocket, the IX Army could combine forces with the XII Army and would be able to relieve Berlin. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest that Generals Heinrici, Busse, or Wenck thought that this was even remotely strategically feasible, but Hitler's agreement to allow the IX Army to break through Soviet lines allowed many German soldiers to escape to the west and surrender to the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|Castleshaw Roman fort was a castellum in the Roman {{province}} of Britannia. Although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> substantiate the claim, {{it has been}} suggested that Castleshaw Roman fort is the site of Rigodunum, a Brigantian settlement. The remains of the fort are located on Castle Hill on the eastern side of Castleshaw Valley at the foot of Standedge but overlooking the valley. The hill is on the edge of Castleshaw in Greater Manchester. The fort was constructed in c.AD79, but fell out of use at some time during the 90s. It was replaced by a smaller fortlet, built in c.105, around which a civilian settlement grew. It may have served as a logistical and administrative centre, although it was abandoned in the 120s.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, Anthony Camp {{challenges}} {{the belief that}} Sophia had a child and provides a detailed summary of the available evidence. In his book Royal Babylon: the Alarming History of European Royalty, author Karl Shaw writes {{of the possibility that}} the Duke raped his sister, citing evidence from Charles Greville's diaries, as well as other factors. Historian Gillian Gill believes that Sophia secretly gave birth to the child and that this is the reason Sophia never married. Alison Weir and others, however, write of a possible marriage between Sophia and Garth the same year as the child's birth, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> back this assertion other than the presence of a wedding ring in a portrait of an aged Sophia.|$|E

5|$|It {{is clear}} that Othelake was no longer enjoying the office by 1420. By this time, John Kitley had been {{appointed}} to the post, though the exact date of his appointment is unknown. He was appointed by King Henry V of England on the insistence of the Earl of Ormonde. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest that Kitley had any connection to Ireland, or even that he visited it, but his connection to Earl of Ormonde is interesting. Kitley was succeeded by Thomas Collyer, who had previously served as Clarenceux King of Arms and Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary. Nothing is known of his career as Ireland, and he was succeeded by Thomas Ashwell.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its {{usefulness in}} PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Panthers is uncertain. One {{of the most widely}} known {{theories}} is that the club were named for a squadron of Canadian airmen based near Nottingham during World War II. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> suggest that such a squadron existed and records indicate that the name was coined before these events could have taken place. A souvenir brochure produced to mark of the opening of the Ice Stadium in April 1939 stated that the venue's new team would be known as the Nottingham Panthers. It does not, however, explain the rationale behind the name. Three games were played by teams using the name Nottingham Panthers during the winter of 1939–40 before the name was revived in 1946.|$|E

5|$|The present-day Mikea are not {{a remnant}} of an ancient Malagasy {{hunter-gatherer}} society, but are instead descendants of individuals who took refuge in the forest beginning in the 1800s to escape military conflict, heavy taxation and other oppressive factors. Their {{way of life is}} perceived by villagers and city dwellers alike as ancestral, contributing to a mystique about them that has inspired various myths and legends. They are commonly believed to be the mythical Vazimba, the original inhabitants of the island, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support this view. While some 1,500 individuals are known to identify as Mikea, many Malagasy disbelieve that the community continues to exist in the present day.|$|E
5|$|The {{three species}} of vampire bats are all endemic to Latin America, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> {{suggest that they}} had any Old World {{relatives}} within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the Oxford English Dictionary records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat {{has been known to}} actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.|$|E
5|$|Garrow had an {{irregular}} relationship with Sarah Dore, {{who had previously}} borne a son, William Arthur Dore Hill, by Arthur Hill, Viscount Fairford in 1778. Thomas Hague has suggested that Dore was an Irish noblewoman Garrow had seduced, but the only intent of his writings was to disparage Garrow, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support his claim. Their first child, David William Garrow, was born on 15 April 1781, and their second, Eliza Sophia Garrow, was born on 18 June 1784. Garrow and Dore finally married on 17 March 1793. Dore was noted as particularly elegant, and was actively involved in local matters in Ramsgate, where the family lived. Dore died on 30 June 1808 after a long illness, and was buried at the Church of St Margaret, Darenth. David William Garrow was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, earning the degree of Doctor of Divinity, and served {{as one of the}} Chaplains to the Prince of Wales. Eliza Sophia Garrow married Samuel Fothergill Lettsom; one of her children, also named William Garrow, served as the Consul-General of Uruguay.|$|E
