5000|$|Records {{of most of}} {{the first}} anniversary show are not found; only three of the matches are documented. On the undercard Raul Romero {{defeated}} Gorila Pogi. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> event featured two non-Mexican competitors, which was not unusual at the time since EMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth primarily used non-Mexicans in <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Events</b> <b>early</b> in EMLL's history. In the semi-main event Ray Ryan, nicknamed El Tigre ("The Tiger"), from the United States of America was disqualified for excessive violence against his opponent, French-Canadian Stephan Berne. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> event of <b>the</b> show featured a wrestler that would influence Lucha Libre forever as the masked La Maravilla Enmascarada (Spanish for [...] "The Masked Marvel") made his in-ring debut. La Maravilla Enmascarada was the first ever masked wrestler in Mexico, starting a tradition of a majority of Mexican wrestlers wearing masks. Maravilla was actually Ciclon Mackey, an American wrestler that had worked for EMLL since its debut but was being presented as a new wrestler as part of the fictional storylines, or Kayfabe, that professional wrestling employs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAminaphtone, a drug {{used in the}} {{treatment}} of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), showed a remarkable role in the modulation of several vasoactive factors, like endothelin- 1 and adhesion molecules. We analysed in vitro the effects of Aminaphtone on whole-genome gene expression and production of different inflammatory proteins. ECV- 304 endothelial cells were stimulated with IL- 1 β 100 U/ml in {{the presence or absence of}} Aminaphtone 6 μg/ml. Gene expression profiles were compared at 1, 3, and 6 h after stimulation by microarray. Supernatants of ECV- 304 cultures were analysed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h by multiplex ELISA for production of several cytokine and chemokines. Microarrays showed a significant down-regulation at all times of a wide range of inflammatory genes. Aminaphtone appeared also able to modulate the regulation of immune response process (down-regulating cytokine biosynthesis, transcripts involved in lymphocyte differentiation and cell proliferation, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction) and to regulate genes engaged in homeostasis, secretion, body fluid levels, response to hypoxia, cell division, and cell-to-cell communication and signalling. Results were confirmed and extended analysing the secretome, which showed significant reduction of the release of 14 cytokines and chemokines. These effects are predicted to be mediated by interaction with different transcription factors. Aminaphtone was able to modulate the expression of inflammatory molecules relevant to the pathogenesis of several conditions in which the endothelial dysfunction is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> player and <b>early</b> <b>event,</b> like scleroderma, lung fibrosis, or atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|In the Lower Palaeozoic {{rocks of}} the Brabant Massif (Belgium), a {{recently}} discovered polysulphide mineralisation {{is related to}} a low-angle reverse shear zone. This shear zone {{has been attributed to}} <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>early</b> Devonian deformation <b>event.</b> Data from boreholes and outcrops allow a detailed investigation of the alteration pattern and palaeofluid flow along this shear zone. Macroscopic observations of the mineralogy and quantitative changes in the phyllosilicate mineralogy indicate that this shear zone is characterised by an envelope of intense sericitisation and silicification. In addition, chloritisation is associated with this alteration. The alteration zone may reach a thickness of 250 m. Ore mineralisation occurred synkinematically and is spatially related to the shear zone, The mineralisation consists of pyrite, marcasite, arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, stibnite and smaller amounts of tetrahedrite and other sulphosalts, It is concentrated in quartz-sulphide veins or occurs diffusely in the host rock. The mineralising fluids have a low-salinity H 2 O- CO 2 -CH 4 -NaCl-(KCl) composition and a minimum temperature of 250 - 320 degreesC. The delta(18) O values of quartz vary between + 12. 3 parts per thousand and + 14. 5 parts per thousand SMOW, and deltaD compositions of the fluid inclusions in the quartz crystals range from - 65 parts per thousand to - 35 parts per thousand V-SMOW. The deltaD and the calculated 6180 values of the mineralising fluids fall in the range typical for metamorphic fluids and partly overlap with that for primary magmatic fluids, The delta(34) S values, between + 4. 7 parts per thousand and + 10. 6 parts per thousand CDT, fall outside the interval typical for I-type magmas. Important migration of likely metamorphic, fluids, causing a widespread alteration and a polysulphide mineralisation along a low-angle shear zone, has, thus, been identified {{for the first time in}} the Caledonian Anglo-Brabant fold belt...|$|R
40|$|The geodynamic {{evolution}} of the early Paleozoic ultrahigh-pressure metamorphic belt in North Qaidam, western China, is controversial due to ambiguous interpretations concerning the nature and ages of the eclogitic protoliths. Within this framework, we present new LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages from eclogites and their country rock gneisses from the Xitieshan terrane, located in {{the central part of}} the North Qaidam UHP metamorphic belt. Xitieshan terrane contains clearly different protolith characteristics of eclogites and as such provides a natural laboratory to investigate the geodynamic {{evolution of}} the North Qaidam UHP metamorphic terrane. LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon dating of three phengite-bearing eclogites and two country rock gneiss samples from the Xitieshan terrane yielded 424 - 427. Ma and 917 - 920. Ma ages, respectively. The age of 424 - 427. Ma from eclogite probably reflects continental lithosphere subduction post-dating oceanic lithosphere subduction at ~. 440 - 460. Ma. The 0. 91 - 0. 92. Ga metamorphic ages from gneiss and associated metamorphic mineral assemblages are interpreted as evidence for the occurrence of a Grenville-age orogeny in the North Qaidam UHPM belt. Using internal microstructure, geochemistry and U-Pb ages of zircon in this study, combined with the petrological and geochemical investigations on the eclogites of previous literature's data, three types of eclogitic protoliths are identified in the Xitieshan terrane i. e. 1) Subducted early Paleozoic oceanic crust (440 - 460. Ma), 2) Neoproterozoic oceanic crust material emplaced onto micro-continental fragments ahead of <b>the</b> <b>main,</b> <b>early</b> Paleozoic, collision <b>event</b> (440 - 420. Ma) and 3) Neoproterozoic mafic dikes intruded in continental fragments (rifted away from the former supercontinent Rodinia). These results demonstrate that the basement rocks of the North Qaidam terrane formed part of the former supercontinent Rodinia, attached to the Yangtze Craton and/or the Qinling microcontinent, and recorded a complex tectono-metamorphic evolution that involved Neoproterozoic and Early Paleozoic orogenies...|$|R
