5|$|The {{official}} chess {{rules do}} not include a procedure for determining who plays White. Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, {{in the case of}} non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of random choice is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is revealed.|$|E
5|$|When a pawn {{advances}} to the eighth rank, {{as a part}} of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. Usually, the pawn is chosen to be promoted to a queen, but in some cases another piece is chosen; this is called underpromotion. In the animated diagram, the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted to an allowed piece. There is no restriction placed on <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is chosen on promotion, so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game (for example, two queens).|$|E
25|$|At d1, i1, d8, and i8 stands <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> {{gave the}} game its name: the Currier (courier) or Läufer, the runner. It moves {{the same as}} the modern chess bishop, any number of steps diagonally.|$|E

25|$|Courtneidge {{was educated}} in England and, for two teenage years, in Switzerland. On {{returning}} from the latter, aged 15, she embarked on an acting career, with the approval and encouragement of her parents. Robert Courtneidge cast her in small ingénue roles in his productions. Her London West End debut was at the Apollo Theatre in the comic opera Tom Jones (1907), which had a libretto co-written by her father. Her first starring role was Eileen Cavanagh in the long-running Edwardian musical comedy The Arcadians, which she took over from Phyllis Dare in 1910. In <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> followed, The Mousmé (1911), which also featured a book co-written by her father, she was cast {{in one of the}} two leading female roles alongside Florence Smithson.|$|E
25|$|On {{graduating from}} the Academy of Music in Kraków in 1958, Penderecki took up a {{teaching}} post at the Academy. His early works show the influence of Anton Webern and Pierre Boulez (Penderecki has also been influenced by Igor Stravinsky). Penderecki's international recognition began in 1959 at the Warsaw Autumn with the premieres of the works Strophen, Psalms of David, and Emanations, but <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> truly brought him to international attention was Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (see threnody and atomic bombing of Hiroshima), written in 1960 for 52 string instruments. In it, he makes use of extended instrumental techniques (for example, playing behind the bridge, bowing on the tailpiece). There are many novel textures in the work, which makes great use of tone clusters. He originally titled the work 8' 37", but decided to dedicate it {{to the victims of}} Hiroshima.|$|E
500|$|Dissatisfied {{with his}} first {{large-scale}} orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as [...] "an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the [...] "triumphal" [...] tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony.|$|E

500|$|The first {{recording}} of L'incoronazione, with Walter Goehr conducting the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich {{in a live}} stage performance, was issued in 1954. This LP version, which won a Grand Prix du Disque in 1954, is the only {{recording of}} the opera that predates the revival of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> began with the 1962 Glyndebourne Festival production. In 1963 Herbert von Karajan and the Vienna Staatsoper issued a version described by Gramophone as [...] "far from authentic", while the following year John Pritchard and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra recorded an abridged version using Leppard's Glyndebourne orchestration. Leppard conducted a Sadler's Wells production, which was broadcast by the BBC and recorded on 27 November 1971. This is the only recording of the opera in English.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} {{portion of the}} segment, Oliver urges viewers to refer to Donald Trump by the Trump family's ancestral name of [...] "Drumpf". Oliver pointed out earlier in <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> Trump had {{repeatedly}} mocked Jewish-American comedian Jon Stewart by referring to him as [...] "Jonathan Leibowitz", the comedian's birth name. Oliver, an alumnus of Stewart's Daily Show, justified the [...] "Drumpf" [...] epithet by insisting that [...] " [...] {{should be proud of}} his heritage!", parodying Trump's mockery of Stewart in a May 2013 Twitter post that Trump later denied having written. Oliver opines that this name is much more reflective of Trump's true nature, and says that if viewers wanted to vote for [...] "the charismatic guy promising to make America great again", they should [...] "stop and take a moment to imagine how [...] would feel if [...] just met a guy named Donald Drumpf".|$|E
500|$|Nintendo Power {{called the}} music in The Demon Slayer {{surprisingly}} good. Cleveland also liked it, and said that it always fits in with all the situations it is played in. Kalata and Snelgrove called it catchy. Don at Square Enix Music Online said that The Demon Slayer has a solid soundtrack for a Game Boy role-playing game, and specifically highlighted [...] "Opening" [...] as a well-composed piece, with its [...] "exotic and mysterious" [...] atmosphere. Patrick Gann at RPGFan said that The Demon Slayer has fantastic and under-appreciated music, but that the soundtrack is short. Don found the soundtrack of Last Bible II {{to be better than}} the first game's, and said that several pieces, including [...] "Temple", [...] "Field", [...] "Boss Battle", and [...] "Dungeon", were better than their counterparts in the first game. He said that [...] "Gaia", <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> is played during the final boss battle, probably was the best of all pieces in the first two games. Gann did also find Last Bible IIs music to be better than the first game's. He liked that the soundtrack was longer than the first game's, and how he could not find any melodies that had been [...] "borrowed" [...] from The Demon Slayers soundtrack. Gann found Last Bible IIIs sound font to be weak, but liked several of the compositions. Both Don and Gann thought that Another Bibles music was worse than {{the music in}} previous games in the series. Don did however appreciate several pieces, including [...] "Beginning Moment", which he thought was catchy and had a fantastic melody, and [...] "Hiding All Feeling Inside", which he found to be the most successful piece in the game's soundtrack.|$|E

2500|$|When {{commissioned}} for a project, Barda {{asks what}} music will be played, {{since it is}} his understanding of <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> will enable him to anticipate the decisive split second at which a good picture might be taken. As he explained: [...] "Music is constantly punctuated. [...] There are narrative passages, there are peaks and troughs. The pictures occur at the peaks, the climaxes. Even if you don't know the musicthough it helps if you doyou develop a sixth sense for these highs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taking {{the guitar}} as his {{instrumental}} model, and drawing his inspiration {{largely from the}} peculiar traits of Andalusian folk musicbut without using actual folk themesAlbéniz achieves a stylization of Spanish traditional idioms that while thoroughly artistic, gives a captivating impression of spontaneous improvisation... Córdoba is <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> best represents the style of Albéniz in this period, with its hauntingly beautiful melody, set against the acrid dissonances of the plucked accompaniment imitating the notes of the Moorish guslas. Here is the heady scent of jasmines amid the swaying palm trees, the dream fantasy of an Andalusian [...] "Arabian Nights" [...] in which Albéniz loved to let his imagination dwell.|$|E

2500|$|It was doubtless this {{invitation}} to [...] "independent inquiry", {{as well as}} Gautier's dithyrambic praise of Legrand's performance in <b>the</b> <b>piece,</b> <b>that</b> drew so many artists and writers into collaborative creation with the mime. [...] Among the contributors of pantomimes to Legrand's repertoire later at the Folies-Nouvelles were the poet Fernand Desnoyers, the composer Charles Plantade, the painter Hippolyte Ballue, and several well-known disciples of the new realism, especially in its satirical and caricatural forms—the Comte de Noé, the caricaturist known as Cham; Jean-Pierre Dantan, the sculptor of caricatural statuettes; Gaspard-Félix Tournachon, the photographer and cartoonist known as Nadar; and of course Champfleury himself. [...] Even Gustave Flaubert wrote a pantomime for Legrand, though it was rejected by Huart and Altaroche (apparently {{on the grounds that}} it was insufficiently realistic).|$|E
2500|$|By contrast, György Ligeti {{published}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the first chapter of this last piece in 1958, concluding that its [...] "ascetic attitude [...] akin to compulsion neurosis", and that Boulez [...] "had to break away from it... and so he created the sensual, feline world of the Marteau." [...] Speaking of Structures, Book I in 2011 Boulez described it as a piece in which [...] "the responsibility of the composer is practically absent. Had computers existed at that time I would have put the data through them and made <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> way. But I did it by hand ... It was a demonstration through the absurd." [...] Asked whether it should still be listened to as music, Boulez replied: [...] "I am not terribly eager to listen to it. But for me it was an experiment that was absolutely necessary." ...|$|E
2500|$|The anti-Zionist {{response}} to this is that Nachmanides' words [...] "we are commanded with the conquest {{of the land in}} every generation" [...] mean every generation until the era of exile. One of the established rules for counting the 613 commandments in the Torah is that we do not count one-time-only commandments, such as God's command to count the Jews in Numbers 1:2. Nachmanides' intent here is to prove that conquering the land was not a one-time-only commandment that applied to Joshua's battles; rather it applied to King David and, by extension, in every generation. This justifies counting it among the 613, even if it does not apply during exile, just as numerous commandments associated with the Temple are counted {{despite the fact that they}} cannot be kept during exile. Nachmanides does say explicitly later in <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>that</b> the commandment to live in the Land applies even during exile, but this means strictly living there as an individual - not conquering, since that would conflict with the Three Oaths.|$|E
