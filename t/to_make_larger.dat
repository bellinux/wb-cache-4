25|$|The budget {{proposed}} requiring {{state workers}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>larger</b> contributions toward {{the cost of}} the health insurance they received as an employee benefit. An attempt to persuade the legislature to relax state rules to allow for the outsourcing of state services to private contractors was rebuffed. However, Romney was more successful with efforts to reorganize and consolidate some of the agencies of the state executive branch (such as Health & Human Services), trimming the ranks of state government workers by 2,000 to 3,000 workers with the 2004 budget. Another example of his government restructuring efforts was his plan to reduce state expenditures on legal proceedings by revamping the court system, cutting the numbers of state-employed attorneys, and refusing to increase state payments to attorneys who accepted cases of defendants too poor to afford private attorneys (Massachusetts' court-appointed attorneys were being paid some of the lowest hourly rates in the nation). Romney vetoed a funding bill for payment of attorneys representing the poor, declaring that it was more important for the state to balance its books than to pay attorneys, and that the attorneys should provide the services pro bono. The cuts in payments for representation of the indigent provoked outraged attorneys to strike. The plan to remake the court system was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|The opera was {{the first}} by Gluck showing signs of his {{ambition}} to reform opera seria. Self-contained arias and choruses make way for shorter pieces strung together <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>larger</b> structural units. Da capo arias are notable by their absence; Gluck instead uses strophic form, notably in act one's [...] "Chiamo il mio ben così", where each verse is interposed with dramatic recitative, – that is, stromentato, where the voice is accompanied by part {{or all of the}} orchestra – and rondo form, such as in act three's famous [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?". Also absent is traditional secco recitative, where the voice is accompanied only by the basso continuo. On the whole, old Italian operatic conventions are disregarded in favour of giving the action dramatic impetus. The complexity of the storyline is greatly reduced by eliminating subplots. Gluck was influenced by the example of French tragédies en musique, particularly those of Rameau. Like them, the opera contains a large number of expressive dances, extensive use of the chorus and accompanied recitative. The coup de théâtre of opening the drama with a chorus mourning one of the main characters is very similar to that used in Rameau's Castor et Pollux (1737). Other elements do not follow Gluck's subsequent reforms; for instance, the brisk, cheerful overture does not reflect the action to come. The role of Orfeo calls for an especially gifted actor, so that the strophic [...] "Chiamo il mio ben così" [...] does not become dull, and so that tragic import can be given both to this aria and to [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?", both of which are based on harmonies that are not obviously mournful in nature. The first Orfeo, Gaetano Guadagni, was reputedly a fine actor who had certainly taken lessons while in London from the renowned Shakespearian actor David Garrick. Guadagni was apparently also able to project a moving and emotive tone without raising his voice. Indeed, Gluck faced criticism of [...] "Che farò senza Euridice?" [...] {{on the grounds that it}} was emotionally uninvolved; he responded by pointing out the absolute necessity of fine execution of the aria: [...] "make the slightest change, either in the movement or in the turn of expression, and it will become a saltarello for marionettes".|$|E
