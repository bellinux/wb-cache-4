More recent methods also quantify {{the strength of}} convergence.

2500|$|Another piece <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> {{the effects}} of rater {{motivation}} on judgmental evaluations. [...] It {{is not uncommon for}} rating inflation to occur due to rater motivation (i.e. [...] "organizationally induced pressures that compel raters to evaluate ratees positively"). [...] Typically, raters are motivated to give higher ratings {{because of the lack of}} organizational sanction concerning accurate/inaccurate appraisals, the rater's desire to guarantee promotions, salary increases, etc., the rater's inclination to avoid negative reactions from subordinates, and the observation that higher ratings of the ratees reflect favorably upon the rater.|$|E

5000|$|One thing <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> {{that when}} {{executing}} an operation, {{the operation is}} applied to the first operand by the second operand.
