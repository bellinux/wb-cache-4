In 2000, the European Commission published an [...] "interpretative communication on concessions under Community law", and in 2004 it published a [...] "Green Paper on public-private partnerships and Community law on public contracts and concessions", which takes stock of existing practices from the perspective of European law and is intended to launch a debate on whether a specific legal framework should be drawn up at the European level.The competitive dialogue was created with the aim of making the award of public-private partnerships easier, since before its creation, a Contracting Authority faced the choice of <b>the</b> <b>restricted</b> <b>procedure,</b> which is often too inflexible for such contracts, or the negotiated procedure, which is intended to be an exceptional procedure with specific legal justifications. Its use so far in the EU, has, however, been uneven. Up to June 2009, more than 80% of the award procedures using competitive dialogue have been launched in two EU Member States i.e. France and the United Kingdom.|$|E

We study a {{restriction}} of the classification procedure for EL ++ where the inference rule for complex role inclusion axioms (RIAs) is applied in a “left-linear ” way in analogy with the well-known procedure for computing the transitive closure of a binary relation.

40|$|The {{competitive}} dialogue procedure {{is a new}} public procurement award procedure first introduced by the Directive 2004118 for the tender of particularly complex contracts, when contracting authorities consider {{that the use of}} <b>the</b> open or <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures</b> do not allow for the contract to be tendered. It is not intended to be adopted freely as <b>the</b> open or <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures,</b> but contracting authorities may use it only when the need arises and specific grounds for its use are fulfilled. The procedure was introduced with the stated objective of increasing the flexibility of procurement, which had been already identified as a shortcoming of previous existing EU procurement framework. This thesis studies how the {{competitive dialogue}} has been implemented in Portugal and Spain. It covers both the legal transposition and aspects of its practice in these countries., through the use of empirical research methods. Through his research, the author has found that the procedure was implemented very differently in Portugal and Spain with consequences on its use. This study has tried to highlight similarities and differences in the transposition, illustrate how the competitive dialogue is being used in Spain and explain why it is being used only sparingly in Portugal.

30|$|A {{different}} {{solution that}} {{should also be}} mentioned is the BoundHole algorithm [20]. As local minima occur at the boundaries of holes, i.e. the regions in the network where greedy routing can fail, BoundHole finds these boundaries in advance, and then routes a data packet along a boundary. BoundHole requires nodes to gather information about their 1 -hop neighbourhood enabling them to identify stuck nodes as a previous step to detect a hole boundary. However, routing along the boundary can fail if the destination is inside the hole. In that case, a <b>restricted</b> flooding <b>procedure</b> is initiated by the boundary nodes until a path is found [20]. In either case, the mechanism to be implemented introduces a considerable overhead. Our approach is similar to BoundHole, as we also use the least angle distance to select the next forwarder. However, unlike BoundHole, ARROW does not require to implement <b>the</b> <b>restricted</b> flooding <b>procedure,</b> even if the destination is inside the hole.|$|R

He preached the Watch Tower millennial message, attracting huge crowds, mainly of his own Tonga people, and offered baptism and entrance to the church, bypassing <b>the</b> <b>restricted</b> entry <b>procedures</b> imposed by European missionaries that required basic literacy and a two-year preparation before baptism and threats of exclusion for disciplinary breaches.. Approximately 10,000 people were baptised under his direction: he may have succeeded because his teaching addressed his audiences' concerns about witchcraft, concerns that European missionaries did not recognise. At first, the colonial authorities considered this as a purely church issue, until the missionaries represented to the governor that Kamwana’s millennial doctrine that all government but Christ’s would cease was seditious, and he was arrested after six months of preaching in April 1909.|$|R

This pronounced anisotropy, however, cannot be characterized by classical isotropic or kinematic hardening due to the constant shape of yield surfaces during plastic deformation.

40|$|We propose an {{averaging}} {{method for}} segments of electrophysiological data (Event-Related Potentials, ERPs) {{that has been}} designed to compensate for processing speed variability across trials in psycho-physical experiments. The algorithm is based on the estimation of single-trial ERPs by wavelet-denoising combined with a parameterized dynamic time-warping algorithm to guide selective averaging. The averaging scheme is hierarchical based on dendrograms generated by agglomerative cluster-analysis. A cross-validation approach is taken in order to estimate optimal parameter settings for <b>the</b> <b>restricted</b> time-warping <b>procedure.</b> As <b>the</b> main parameter goes to zero, our method converges against the method in [1] or a pointwise average, depending on the choice of external time-markers. This allows for a direct comparison of the methods in terms of the estimated prediction error. We define the average temporal distortion as the measure obtained by averaging warping functions computed on all pairs of trials independently. We find that electrodes are well divisible into distinct clusters of physically neighbouring electrodes that correspond to brain regions (frontal, occipital; lateralization) by applying cluster analysis with this measure (see Figure). This indicates that the process of activating neural assemblies and pathways might be well captured in the timing information thus obtained. We apply our methods to artificial data and data obtained in a psychophysical experiment. We contrast th...|$|R
40|$|The European public {{procurement}} regulation {{has been described}} as a restrictive force on PPP projects, especially in countries which employ a strict interpretation of the directives. One major limitation brought forward has been the restrictions on negotiations during the procurement procedure. In the literature it has been suggested that the negotiation would improve PPP performance because it allows for a clarification of the contract and enables alignment of the parties’ goals. Two propositions are used to examine if the regulations are a hindrance to PPP performance by comparing the current doctrine and European case law on {{public procurement}} to those two propositions. The perspectives are the regulation of the different procedures available in the directives: competitive dialogue, the negotiated procedure, and <b>the</b> open and <b>restricted</b> <b>procedures</b> and <b>the</b> possibility of early involvement before the formal procedure has begun. The conclusion is that, while the directives limit the procuring authorities’ abilities to exchange information and negotiate provisions, the information which need to be transferred, and negotiations which needs to be conducted, can in most cases be carried out within the current procurement framework. Thus, the public procurement legislation does not present any substantial limitations on PPP performance...|$|R

The estimation is performed on-line. The endoscopic images are used as the only feedback, and no additional sensors are placed on the instrument, which is beneficial for application in clinical practice.

40|$|Data {{collected}} from 690 purebred Duroc pigs from 2009 to 2012 {{were used to}} estimate the heritability, and genetic and phenotypic correlations between production and meat quality traits. Variance components were obtained through <b>the</b> <b>restricted</b> maximum likelihood <b>procedure</b> using Wombat and SAS version 9. 0. Animals were raised under the same management in five different breeding farms. The average daily gain, loin muscle area (LMA), backfat thickness (BF), and lean percent (LP) were measured as production traits. Meat quality traits included pH, cooking loss, lightness (L*), redness (a*), yellowness (b*), marbling score (MS), moisture content (MC), water holding capacity (WHC), and shear force. The {{results showed that the}} heritability estimates for meat quality traits varied largely from 0. 19 to 0. 79. Production traits were moderate to highly heritable from 0. 41 to 0. 73. Genotypically, the BF was positively correlated (p< 0. 05) with MC (0. 786), WHC (0. 904), and pH (0. 328) but negatively correlated with shear force (− 0. 533). The results of genetic correlations indicated that selection for less BF could decrease pH, moisture content, and WHC and increase the shear force of meat. Additionally, a significant positive correlation was recorded between average daily gain and WHC, which indicates pork from faster-growing animals has higher WHC. Furthermore, selection for larger LMA and LP could increase MS and lightness color of meat. The meat quality and production traits could be improved simultaneously if desired. Hence, to avoid further deterioration of pork characteristics, appropriate selection of traits should be considered...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: MRCP is {{the method}} of choice in {{diagnosing}} pathologies of the biliary system. One of them is bile fistulae. They are uncommon but tend to cause many diagnostic problems. The possible way to improve MRCP is using it with intravenous injection of hepatobiliary-specific contrast agents. As it is eliminated via the hepatobiliary system, it can be visualized in the bile ducts and may help to reveal disorders undetected by a standard MRCP. CASE REPORT: We report {{a case of a}} 36 -year-old woman with leakage in the biliary system which led to creation of a subcutaneous bile reservoir. By means of a regular MRCP protocol it was impossible to reveal any disorders of the biliary system and thus a decision to inject Gd-EOB-DTPA was taken. As a result, a fistula with its opening in the fundus of the gall bladder was revealed. Patient was qualified for treatment with somatostatin analogues in order to stop bile secretion. CONCLUSIONS: The Gd-EOB-DTPA in combination with regular T 2 -weighted MRCP may be helpful in detecting anomalies of the biliary system. Although a high price of <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> <b>restricts</b> its accessibility, such advantages as lower risk of complications, lower costs of hospitalization, and less traumatic nature make it a technique that may take precedence over ERCP in ambiguous cases...|$|R
