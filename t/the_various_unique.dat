40|$|A new {{and very}} fast low-sidelobe pattern {{synthesis}} method for planar array antennas with periodic element spacing is described. The basic {{idea of the}} method is that since the array factor {{is related to the}} element excitations through an inverse Fourier transform, the element excitations can be derived from the array factor through a direct Fourier transform. Starting with an initial set of suitable element excitations the array factor is calculated. After matching the array factor to the prescribed pattern, an updated set of excitations is obtained through a direct Fourier transform performed on the matched array factor. From this updated set, only the samples associated with the aperture are retained, where after a new array factor is calculated. The whole process is repeated until the updated array factor does not violate any longer the pattern requirements. The proposed synthesis method provides significant improvements in terms of performance, computational speed, flexibility, and ease of implementation in software to the methods described in reviewed literature. A number of representative examples are presented to demonstrate <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>unique</b> capabilities of the method.

The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the experiences of eight teachers and their rural secondary students in courses that are delivered synchronously by videoconference. The study specifically examined teacher presence across a screen, the navigation of challenges and affordances of the medium, and the unique teaching skills and roles required. This collective case study research used a mixed methods approach to follow these three lines of inquiry in order to provide a comprehensive picture of the experience of teaching by videoconference in rural Alberta. The following key findings were reported: there are obstacles to developing presence implicit in the context such as insufficient time, isolation, scheduling and logistics, unreliable technology, and limited personal connection. Teachers’ confidence and experience, the use of immediacy behaviours, and understanding student learning presence can mitigate some of those obstacles. Furthermore, by leveraging supporting communication tools, intentionally building presence and prioritizing the programming within the district the affordances of the context were maximized. Teachers who felt unprepared and untrained for <b>the</b> <b>various</b> <b>unique</b> skills required to teach successfully by videoconference suggested that the development of standards, professional collaboration, and action research would better support their roles.

Schistosoma mansoni infection induces dramatic fluctuations in Th 1 or Th 2 cytokine responses systemically; Th 1 reactions are provoked in the early phase, whilst Th 2 responses become dominant after oviposition begins. In <b>the</b> liver, <b>various</b> <b>unique</b> immune cells distinct from those of conventional immune competent organs or tissues exist, resulting in a unique immunological environment.

They produce both IFN-γ and IL- 4 or both IFN-γ and IL- 13 simultaneously. Moreover, T cells secreting triple cytokines IFN-γ, IL- 13 and IL- 4 were also induced. We term these cells Multiple Cytokine Producing Hepatic T cells (MCPHT cells). During the transition phase, when MCPHT cells increase, IL- 18 secretion was up-regulated in the liver and sera.
