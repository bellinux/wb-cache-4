5|$|Buildings in Chamba were {{traditionally}} constructed using local materials. Buildings {{were made}} out of dry stone masonry, with the walls and floors of the older houses plastered with a concoction of clay and cow-dung. Thick wooden beams were used to support the walls, paying attention to durability and to withstand earthquakes, and wooden cantilever construction was often used to support the verandas. The staircases and doors were made from wood, with the doors often decorated in religious reliefs and flanked by <b>two</b> <b>lamps</b> to light it at night. Before {{the arrival of the}} British, who introduced slate roofs to Chamba, roofs were covered with planks, coated in clay. Few of these houses remain today, although a number still have wood-clay roofs in villages in the suburbs.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{destruction}} of the <b>Two</b> <b>Lamps</b> and the kingdom of Almaren, the Valar abandoned Middle-earth and moved to the continent of Aman. There they built their Second Kingdom, Valinor. Yavanna made the Two Trees, named Telperion (the silver tree) and Laurelin (the golden tree) in the land of Aman. The Trees illuminated Aman, leaving Middle-earth in darkness.|$|E
25|$|Arda {{was again}} darkened, and the lamps' fall spoiled the perfect {{symmetry}} of Arda's surface. New continents were created: Aman in the West, Middle-earth in the middle, the uninhabited lands (later called the Land of the Sun) in the East. At {{the site of}} the northern lamp was later the inland Sea of Helcar, of which Cuiviénen was a bay. At {{the site of the}} southern lamp was later the Sea of Ringil. After the destruction of the <b>Two</b> <b>Lamps</b> the Years of the Lamps ended and the Years of the Trees began.|$|E

25|$|Proponents of twin rear {{fog lamps}} say <b>two</b> <b>lamps</b> provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available from a single lamp. Proponents of the single rear fog lamp say dual {{rear fog lamps}} closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear fog lamp.|$|E
25|$|When the Valar entered Arda, it {{was still}} lifeless and had no {{distinct}} geographical features. The initial shape of Arda, chosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by the <b>Two</b> <b>Lamps,</b> Illuin and Ormal, made out of the misty light that veiled the barren ground. The Valar concentrated this light in two large lamps, Illuin and Ormal. The Vala Aulë forged two great pillar-like mountains, Helcar {{in the north and}} Ringil in the south. Illuin was set upon Helcar and Ormal upon Ringil. In the middle, where the light of the lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt at the island of Almaren upon the Great Lake.|$|E
25|$|Driven out by Tulkas, Melkor brooded in the {{darkness}} at the outer reaches of Arda until an opportune moment arrived when Tulkas was distracted. Melkor re-entered Arda and attacked and destroyed the <b>Two</b> <b>Lamps,</b> {{which at the time}} were the only sources of light, along with the Valarian land of Almaren which was wiped from existence. Arda was plunged into darkness and fire, and Melkor withdrew to his newly established dominion in Middle-earth. In the latter versions, Melkor also dispersed agents throughout Arda, digging deep into the earth and constructing great pits and fortresses as Arda was marred by darkness and rivers of fire.|$|E

40|$|The {{disinfection}} {{characteristics of}} an open channel ultra-violet (UV) wastewater disinfection reactor are investigated using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The model {{is based on the}} volume of fluid method to capture the water-air interface, the Lagrangian particle tracking method to determine the microbial particle trajectory and the discrete ordinate model to calculate the UV intensity field. The numerical predictions are compared with the available experimental data to validate the CFD model. A parametric study is performed to understand the effects of different parameters on the disinfection performance of the reactor. The hydraulic behaviour and the additive nature of disinfection for an open channel reactor with <b>two</b> <b>lamp</b> banks placed in series using different geometric configurations between the <b>two</b> <b>lamp</b> banks are also investigated. A scaling down methodology for the open channel reactor is developed and implemented in the CFD model to understand its applicability...|$|R
25|$|Other notable {{features}} of the building include stained glass windows dedicated to those fallen in war and to the Otago Mounted Rifles. For many years, the church housed a 1908 Norman & Baird organ, though this was replaced in 1983 by a digital organ by Allen. A full set of eight change-ringing bells, cast by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, was installed in 1975 and are rung {{by members of the}} Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers. At that time the only such set in a Presbyterian church outside the United Kingdom and claimed to be the southernmost ring of bells in the world. A large bell on a pedestal stands outside the church, sent from Scotland in 1851. Also located in the grounds in front of the church is a memorial plaque to Dr. Burns. The entrance gates to the church feature <b>two</b> <b>lamps</b> which started life as Edinburgh street lamps, another connection to the homeland of many of the city's first settlers.|$|E
25|$|The Valar had {{attempted}} to fashion the world for Elves and Men, but Melkor continually destroyed their handiwork. After he destroyed the <b>two</b> <b>lamps</b> that illuminated the world, the Valar moved to Aman, a continent {{to the west of}} Middle-earth, where they established their home called Valinor. Yavanna created Two Trees that illuminated Valinor and left Middle-earth to darkness and Melkor. Soon after, stars created by Varda began to shine and the Elves awoke. The elves originally formed three groups: the Vanyar, the Noldor, and the Teleri, though some elves were captured and enslaved by Melkor, eventually to be bred into orcs. Knowing the danger the Elves were in, the Valar decided to fight Melkor to keep the Elves safe. After defeating and capturing Melkor, they invited the Elves to live in Aman. Many Elves travelled to Aman, while others refused and still others stopped along the way, including the Elves who later became the Sindar, ruled by the Elf King Thingol and Melian, a Maia. Of the three tribes that set out, all of the Vanyar and Noldor, and many of the Teleri reached Aman.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers had {{no access}} to a studio, so {{shooting}} took place in rooms at their homes, with the walls painted black {{for use as a}} background. Herman G. Weinberg, a writer for Movie Makers, and Jack Spears of Films in Review, said it was filmed mostly at Florey's residence, while film historian David E. James claimed it was filmed in Vorkapić's kitchen. In an interview, Florey claimed the filming took place both in his kitchen and in Vorkapić's living room. Some scenes were also filmed in Toland's garage. The film is shot in three basic types of compositions: miniature sets, close-ups of live actors, and newsreel-like scenes of Hollywood and film studios. The film's visual motif includes abrupt cuts, rapid camera movement, extensive superimposition, dim lighting, and shapes and forms in twisted and disoriented angles. In this way, it shares some similarities with German Expressionism, particularly the film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). The opening credits, in particular, are angular and expressionistic. A single 400-watt lamp was used as lighting in the film; they originally planned to use <b>two</b> <b>lamps,</b> but one of them burned out before filming began. During close-up shots, the actors would hold the light bulb in their hands so their faces would be lit. When an actor changed position, he or she would switch the bulb from one hand to another. As a result, the faces of the actors are often kept in partial shadow, keeping their features obscured. Toland also used small reflectors that he borrowed from film studios, which included a light bulb hung inside a mirror shaped like a cone. The film's acting is heavily abstract and stylized, with the actors mouthing gibberish instead of speaking actual words. A record of Rhapsody in Blue was played constantly during filming, so that the actors would, in Florey's words, become [...] "saturated" [...] with the rhythm of the [...] "blues". This was a source of aggravation for Florey's neighbors and landlord.|$|E

50|$|By {{connecting}} the <b>two</b> <b>lamp</b> groups to a neutral, intermediate in potential {{between the two}} live legs, any imbalance of the load will be supplied by a current in the neutral, giving substantially constant voltage across both groups. The total current carried in all three wires (including the neutral) will always be twice the supply current of the most heavily loaded half.|$|R
50|$|If a main signal doesn't protect any {{switches}} or {{the speed}} restriction on a diverging route {{is the same}} as straight route, the signal doesn't need to show the Proceed 35 aspect and therefore the yellow bottom light may be absent.
