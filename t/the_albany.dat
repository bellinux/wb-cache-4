5|$|In 1754, {{representatives of}} seven British North American colonies {{met in the}} Stadt Huys, Albany's city hall, for <b>the</b> <b>Albany</b> Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} <b>the</b> <b>Albany</b> Plan of Union there, {{which was the first}} formal proposal to unite the colonies.
