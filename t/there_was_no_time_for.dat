5|$|That night, Castelli and Saavedra {{informed}} Cisneros {{of their}} resignation from {{the newly formed}} Junta. They explained that the population {{was on the verge}} of violent revolution and would remove Cisneros by force if he did not resign as well. They warned that they did not have the power to stop that: neither Castelli to stop his friends, nor Saavedra to prevent the Regiment of Patricians from mutiny. Cisneros wanted to wait for the following day, but they said that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> further delays, so he finally agreed to resign. He sent a resignation letter to the Cabildo for consideration on the following day. Chiclana felt encouraged when Saavedra resigned, and started to request signatures for a manifesto about the will of the people. Moreno refused any further involvement, but Castelli and Peña trusted that he would eventually join them if events unfolded as they expected.|$|E
5|$|When the Corregidor {{entered the}} minefield, {{there was a}} large {{explosion}} on the starboard side of the vessel. The overcrowded ship quickly began to sink, with many people trapped below-deck. Survivors stated that the ship sank so quickly that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> large-scale panic to set in. Searchlights from Corregidor Island illuminated the scene which aided the rescue effort. Sailors of MTB Squadron 3 posted at Sisiman Cove heard the explosion and left on three PT boats (PT-32, PT-34 and PT-35) to investigate. When the boats arrived they found survivors in the water and were able to retrieve 282 survivors. Seven of the rescued passengers later died from their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} {{artillery}} would not break the Polish, General von Toll devised {{a new plan}} of attack. He decided to disregard Paskevich's order not to assault Warsaw. Although dusk was nearing, von Toll ordered an all-out assault on both the western and southern fronts. As <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> proper artillery preparation, von Toll wanted to overwhelm the defenders by sheer numerical superiority, {{even if it meant}} increased casualties from Polish artillery. To distract the Polish artillery at Czyste and prevent it from firing at the Russian columns attacking Forts 21 and 22, Muraviev's forces were to lead the attack directly towards the Jerozolimskie Gate. Before 15:00, von Toll dispatched General Neidhardt to Paskevich to receive his blessing for the new plan, but Paskevich categorically refused, and ordered his subordinate to continue shelling the Polish forts with artillery at least until 16:00. As the Russian commander-in-chief was away, von Toll decided to act despite Paskevich's orders.|$|E

5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> any training or exercises. There were also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill sat in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assisted the pilot. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. 1st Parachute Battalion took off {{on the morning of}} 16 November, and enjoyed excellent weather that allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's secondincommand, Major Alastair Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment that collected the airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.|$|E

Despite the battalion's parachutes only arriving at 16:30 on 14 November, and were packed twelve to a container which meant they had to be removed and individually repacked, the battalion was prepared by 15 November and took off at 07:30. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border, they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. At the same time, 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR successfully conducted a drop at Tebessa, capturing its objectives and securing the area; it then passed from the control of 1st Parachute Brigade and remained in the area for some time. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and encountered excellent weather which allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba.

25|$|Skarbek helped organise {{a system}} of Polish {{couriers}} who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish anti-tank rifle, model 35, with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealed it in her Budapest apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the Allies, as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> reverse engineering. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.|$|E
25|$|The German {{invasion}} of France, with subsidiary attacks on Belgium and the Netherlands, {{consisted of two}} phases, Operation Yellow (Fall Gelb) and Operation Red (Fall Rot). Yellow opened with a feint conducted against the Netherlands and Belgium by two armoured corps and paratroopers. Most of the German armoured forces were placed in Panzer Group von Kleist, which attacked through the Ardennes, a lightly defended sector that the French planned to reinforce if need be, before the Germans could bring up heavy and siege artillery. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> such a reinforcement to be sent, for the Germans did not wait for siege artillery but reached the Meuse and achieved a breakthrough at the Battle of Sedan in three days.|$|E
25|$|In the end, {{the inquiry}} had a larger {{focus on the}} crews of the San Juan and S.C.T. Dodd. After {{interviewing}} survivors, it became disputed whether the crew acted appropriately towards the disaster or not. Turner claimed that either way, nothing {{could have been done}} to help passengers survive the sinking as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> action. First Officer Charles Tulee of the San Juan reported a similar statement to the inquiry. The inquiry claimed the San Juan had veered off course. Third Officer Robert Papenfuss of the San Juan, despite having claimed the S.C.T. Dodd had been the ship which veered off course, was found guilty of negligence, leading to his license being revoked. Evidence surfaced after the inquiry's conclusion, proving that the S.C.T. Dodd had veered off course rather than San Juan, proving Papenfuss' innocence.|$|E

25|$|Two weeks later, Guth heard colleagues {{discussing}} {{something called}} the horizon problem. The microwave background radiation discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson appeared extremely uniform, with almost no variance. This seemed very paradoxical because, when the radiation was released about 300,000 years after the Big Bang, the observable universe had a diameter of 90 million light-years. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> {{one end of the}} cosmos to communicate with the other end, because energy can not move faster than the speed of light. The paradox was resolved, as Guth soon realized, by the inflation theory. Since inflation started with a far smaller amount of matter than the Big Bang had presupposed, an amount so small that all parts would have been in touch with each other. The universe then inflated at billion times the speed of light so the homogeneity remained unbroken. The universe after inflation would have been very uniform even though the parts were not still in touch with each other.|$|E
25|$|Derbyshire pacer Ian Hunter {{continued}} on his good form {{from the last}} Championship match, where he took five for 63 against Durham, as he removed Leicestershire opener John Maunders for 0 in the second over of the match at Grace Road. That {{was as good as}} it got for Hunter and Durham, though, as Darren Robinson and Tom New accumulated 217 for the second wicket in four and a half hours, as Leicestershire went from 4 for 1 to 221 for 2. Nevertheless, one and a half days of lost play prevented them from forcing a victory. HD Ackerman, Dinesh Mongia and Paul Nixon also passed fifty in the first innings, as Leicestershire declared having made 552 for 6. Derbyshire then were 62 for 3 at the close of play on day two, but were saved by rain, as the third day's play was cancelled. In 50 overs on day four, Charl Willoughby and Stuart Broad took two wickets each as Derbyshire were all out for 190, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> another innings and the match was declared a draw.|$|E

25|$|While Sampo had {{not been}} damaged in the war, she was docked at the Hietalahti {{shipyard}} for extensive maintenance and repairs — when she left to the port of Hanko in mid-February 1919, 69 bottom plates had been replaced. In December 1922 Sampo struck a rock in the port of Loviisa and her bow propeller shaft was damaged, but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> repairs {{and for the rest}} of the season she had to assist ships to the port of Helsinki without her bow propeller. Another incident occurred on 24 March 1926 when the bow propeller of Sampo hit a stone bank in the port of Helsinki, came loose and dropped to the bottom. It was found after searching for a couple of days and winched on board. On 30 March, while Sampo was assisting a Finnish steamship Albert Kasimir, the stern propeller shaft snapped when the engine was reversed and the propeller dropped to the bottom. While the icebreaker still had its bow propeller, it was of no use as it was waiting for installation on the foredeck. Murtaja towed the immobilized icebreaker to Hanko on the following day and to Helsinki for repairs on 20 April.|$|E
25|$|Against such methods the NVA/VC uses {{a variety}} of approaches. If the {{objective}} was to cause attrition, NVA regulars would sometimes fight directly with their opponents using conventional tactics, particularly on the DMZ against the US Marines, and in remote border areas near Laos and Cambodia. Such attrition objectives were sometimes part of the North's overall strategy of drawing the Americans into remote areas, and away from key population clusters dominated or contested by the Viet Cong. Some American postwar memoirs comment favorably on the bravery and tactical discipline of the NVA in these encounters. To stem an advance from airmobile enemies NVA troops sometimes held their ground in prepared fortifications, buying time for their comrades to maneuver elsewhere. PAVN forces also attempted with limited success to attack the quickly constructed firebases from which the lethal firepower issued. Gaps between maneuvering US units were infiltrated and attacks mounted. Ambushes were also executed. Another tactic was fighting close to US units, so close that deadly American artillery and air strikes were discouraged for fear of hitting their own troops. If things were going badly, PAVN forces withdrew to cross-border sanctuaries, where American ground forces were forbidden to follow. The fast-moving US operations, where <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the usual months of communist initiative and rehearsed preparations, could catch PAVN off-guard, and casualties against US forces could be heavy. In Operation Dewey Canyon for example, US after-action reports claim some 1,617 NVA killed, for a loss of 121 marines killed, and the capture of hundreds of tons of munitions, equipment and supplies.|$|E
500|$|At 02:28 on 7 October, {{while about}} [...] south of Halifax, West Gates {{steering}} gear engine jammed, sending the ship veering sharply to the port.

500|$|In 1860, Williams became acting {{lieutenant}} governor and helped pass the Reorganization Act of 1861. This gave the college a four-year curriculum {{and the power}} to grant master's degrees.

The Court of Enquiry into the sinking ascribed the final magazine explosion to a fire in the 4-inch magazines outboard of the main 15-inch magazines, which would have then spread to and detonated the contents of the main magazines. Due to the speed at which she sank, 862 officers and ratings were killed, including two who died of their wounds after being rescued. The destroyer [...] rescued some 337 survivors, including Vice-Admiral Henry Pridham-Wippell and the pair who later died of their wounds, while the Australian destroyer [...] reportedly rescued some 150 men.
