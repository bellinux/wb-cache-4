This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> value, and another <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> children.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} secure his power, Díaz engaged in various forms of {{co-optation}} and coercion. He played his people like a board game – catering to the private desires of different interest groups and playing off one interest against another. In order to satisfy any competing forces, such as the Mestizos and wealthier indigenous people, he gave them political positions of power {{that they could not}} refuse. He did the same <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> elite Creole society by not interfering with their wealth and haciendas. Covering both pro and anti-clerical elements, Díaz was both the head of the Freemasons in Mexico and an important advisor to the Catholic bishops. Díaz proved to be a different kind of liberal than those of the past. He neither assaulted the Church (like most liberals) nor protected the Church. As for the Native American population, who were historically repressed, they were almost completely depoliticized; neither put on a pedestal as the core of Mexican society nor suppressed, and were largely left to advance by their own means. In giving different groups with potential power a taste of what they wanted, Díaz created the illusion of democracy and quelled almost all competing forces.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Kath {{joined a}} cover band called the Missing Links, taking Parazaider and Seraphine with him, and started playing clubs and ballrooms in Chicago {{on a regular}} basis. Parazaider's friend at De Paul University, trumpeter Lee Loughnane, also sat in with the band from time to time. Kath's compatriot, James William Guercio (who later became Chicago's producer) was lead guitarist {{in one of two}} road bands {{performing}} on The Dick Clark Show with the Missing Links. Kath received an offer from Guercio to play bass for the Illinois Speed Press and move to Los Angeles, but declined as he considered the guitar his main instrument and wanted to sing lead. He stayed with Parazaider, Seraphine, and Loughnane instead, who quickly recruited trombonist James Pankow from De Paul and vocalist/keyboardist Robert Lamm. Kath sang the lower range of lead vocals in the group in a style reminiscent of Ray Charles. The group practiced at Parazaider's parents' basement and changed its name to The Big <b>Thing.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> addition of singer and bassist Peter Cetera of The Exceptions, they moved to Los Angeles and signed with Columbia Records, renaming the band Chicago Transit Authority. In mid-1969, the name was shortened to Chicago.|$|E

500|$|The {{documentary}} crew put wireless microphones {{on several}} of the actors and crew and followed them through the conception, pre-production, filming, editing, screening and reception of [...] "Subway". Many people involved with the show found the process extremely disruptive. In particular, Fleder said that he hates to be photographed and found the camera crew distracting and stressful. Fleder, who agreed to interviews for the documentary but refused to wear a microphone on the set, said of the crew, [...] "To pull off a show like this, a seven-day shoot with this much dialogue and this many shots per day, {{you have to be}} really, really focused, and for me the <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> documentary crew kept pulling away from the focus." ...|$|E
500|$|The single [...] "The Wire" [...] was {{released}} on July 29 and the album followed on September 30. The album reached {{number one in the}} UK and has since sold 200,000 copies there. To promote the album, the group performed [...] "The Wire" [...] on the BBC's The Andrew Marr Show, with Este dedicating the song to the British Prime Minister David Cameron, also a guest on the show. The move was criticised as being ill-judged by Johnny Marr, who stated that “It’s really simple: they made themselves look like idiots. It’s ridiculous. No-one put a gun to their head. The Conservatives tried to do the same <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Smiths, to re-appropriate us in a false way, to be cool by association.” Haim did not respond.|$|E

500|$|Radical {{rebuilding}} schemes {{poured in}} for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish [...] "to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong" [...] to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, {{as well as by}} those who had left the capital; for one <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans.|$|E
500|$|Erotica {{remains the}} most rampantly {{misrepresented}} Madonna album with the biggest backlash of her career. Taraborrelli commented that {{it is unfortunate that}} Erotica has to be historically linked to other less memorable ventures in Madonna's career at this time. However, he quipped that the album should be considered on its own merits, not only as one linked to the other two adult-oriented projects, because it has true value. When asked to name her biggest professional disappointment, Madonna answered, [...] "The fact that my Erotica album was overlooked because of the whole <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Sex book. It just got lost in all that. I think there's some brilliant songs on it and people didn't give it a chance." [...] Brian McNair observed that Madonna took a financial risk with the album and it was not until Ray of Light (1998) that her record sales recovered to pre-Erotica levels. He further asserted that [...] "what she lost in royalty payments, however, Madonna more than made up for in iconic status and cultural influence." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} considered aborting {{the series}} {{if the next}} episode, [...] "Bart the Genius", turned out as this episode, but fortunately {{it turned out to}} suffer only a few, easily fixable problems. Afterwards, the producers entreated Fox to postpone the series premiere for several months. The premiere then switched to [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire", which had to be aired in December, being a Christmas special. This ensured that more time could be spent fixing the animation problems and rewriting much of this episode. Directorial retakes were handled by David Silverman, who already had considerable experience directing the shorts. Silverman estimates that about 70% of everything had to be redone. Most of these retakes consisted of changing the backgrounds. The result is an episode where the animation is uneven, because it shifts between the early animation and the retakes. It is still possible to see the doors slam like they were made of rubber. The Fox censors wanted to replace the sentence [...] "the blue <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> things", which they believed to be too sexual. Due to the fledgling position of the Fox network, Brooks had obtained an unusual contractual provision that ensured the network could not interfere with the creative process by providing show notes, so the producers simply ignored the censors.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on October 17, 1984 by Jive Records. The group had a developed a large following in Britain and Europe prior {{to the release of}} Escape, although success in the United States had initially been limited. [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] and [...] "Freaks Come Out at Night" [...] became their first legitimate hits in their home country. According to the New York Times, these could be [...] "heard almost constantly in New York dance clubs, as well as on local urban-contemporary radio stations." [...] Ecstasy said that audiences were finally ready for hip-hop music, and Whodini were [...] "just beginning to break through on radio. Rather than listening to Stevie Wonder or someone do an inferior version of rap, people want to hear the real <b>thing,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> original complexity to it. This is the most complex, interesting stuff going on in black music today, and the radio's just beginning to discover that the public eats it up." [...] By December 1984, the 7- and 12-inch singles [...] "Friends" [...] and [...] "Five Minutes of Funk" [...] were approaching sales of 350,000, and received more airplay than the [...] "Magic's Wand" [...] and [...] "Haunted House of Rock" [...] from Whodini's first album. Billboard reported the airplay, noting that despite the increased play, the songs were unreported and often played during the night. The month before Escape release, Whodini appeared at the 1984 Swatch Watch New York City Fresh Fest as part of the first national tour featuring hip-hop groups. The 27-date tour featured Run–D.M.C., Kurtis Blow, The Fat Boys and Newcleus, and grossed $3.5 million.|$|E
500|$|The Sex {{book had}} {{a range of}} influences—from punk rock to earlier fashion iconoclasts like Guy Bourdin and his surrealism, and Helmut Newton, in its stylized, sado-masochistic look. The book was also {{influenced}} by Robert Mapplethorpe's infamous three-part XYZ portfolio, particularly the X portfolio, with Madonna even having considered the latter as a title during the formative stages of Sex. Photographs from Brassaï's 1933 book Paris de nuit (Paris by Night) also inspired several of the book's series of images. Madonna changed her mind about the title being X, when Spike Lee's film Malcolm X began to be promoted (the film was released {{three weeks after the}} book). She would go on to tell Vogue magazine: [...] "We were gonna call it X [...] but then the whole <b>thing</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Malcolm X movie started. At first I thought, 'Fuck it, it's a really good symbol and I thought of it first'. But I realized it might be confusing or look like I was copying Spike [...] Besides, Sex is almost as powerful: it's universal, it doesn't need translation - and it's only two letters more than X." [...] Warner Bros. commented that Sex was very difficult to produce, requiring contributions from many different printing and publishing companies. They also stated that in order to generate any profit, the book would have to sell at least 350,000 copies. Madonna hired top-notch talent {{for the development of the}} book; she counted on the help of friends from the music, film and fashion industry. The singer hired Fabien Baron as the art director, fashion photographer Steven Meisel, editor Glenn O'Brien, make-up artist Francois Nars and hairstylist Paul Cavaco. Madonna originally wanted the book to be of an oval shape in order to simulate a condom but the printing and manufacturing of such a book would have been too expensive. Meisel would later comment: [...] "Madonna and I can keep up with each other" [...] and that [...] "I'm doing things to make people think too. It's not really to antagonize or to push people's buttons. It's really to present another way of seeing things." ...|$|E
