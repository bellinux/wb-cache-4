It {{has been used}} as a flame retardant for a variety of materials, including electronic equipment, PVC, hydraulic fluids, glues, in nail polishes, and casting resins. Its mechanism of action as a flame retardant is as follows: first, during thermal decomposition, phosphoric acid is formed. This reacts to form pyrophosphoric acid, which, when in its condensed phase, acts to block heat transfer. One of the most effective flame retardants for certain polymers, TPhP is only active as an additive flame retardant in its gas phase. Phase out of PBDEs may have increased the use of TPhP in recent years.|$|E
5000|$|Limited {{information}} is available indicating significant toxicological effects of TPhP. Although it was initially expected to have an overall low impact, {{a growing body of}} evidence suggests that the effects may not be so harmless. <b>Triphenyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> exhibits low acute toxicity by dermal or oral contact. However, an increasing number of studies have linked exposure to TPhP with reproductive and developmental toxicity, neurotoxicity, metabolic disruption, endocrine effects, and genotoxicity. TPhP has also been found to induce significant estrogenic activity. One study found that concentrations above the lowest observable effect level have been observed in a variety of other studies in coral grouper, yellow striped goat fish, and freshwater perch. This indicates that TPhP may be present in the environment at high enough concentrations to have harmful ecological effects. The European Chemicals agency considers TPhP to be [...] "very toxic" [...] to aquatic life, with potentially long-lasting effects.|$|E

A key peak shift of 726 cm⁻¹ to 718 cm⁻¹ in the Raman spectrum of <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (726 cm- 1 uncompounded) when compounded in cellulose acetate (718 cm⁻¹) was tied to the action of C-O bonds in <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphate.</b> The molecular bonds responsible for the 726 cm⁻¹ peak were identified by collecting and examining spectra of chemicals with functional groups similar to <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphate.</b> Initially {{it was hypothesized that}} <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> acts as nucleophilic catalyst of deacetylation.

The results indicate that fungi preferentially oxidize BPDP at the alkyl side chain and at the aromatic rings to form hydroxylated derivatives.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of ChemistryKenneth KlabundeRemediation of {{the indoor}} {{environment}} {{led to the}} development of novel catalysts which can absorb light in the visible range. These catalysts were prepared using the wet chemistry method known as sol-gel chemistry because preparation via sol-gel provides a homogeneous gel formation, which can be treated via supercritical drying to produce an aerogel. These aerogels have been found to have high surface areas when a combination of titania/silica is used. The increase in surface area has been shown to enhance the activity of the catalysts. Mixed metal oxide systems were prepared using titanium isopropoxide and tetraethyl orthosilicate to yield a 1 : 1 system of titania/silica (TiO 2 /SiO 2). These systems were doped during the initial synthesis with transition metals (Mn or Co) to create mixed metal oxide systems which absorb light in the visible light range. These materials were assessed for potential as heterogeneous catalysts via gas-solid phase reactions with acetaldehyde. Degradation of acetaldehyde as well as the formation of CO 2 was monitored via gas chromatography-mass spectrometery. To increase the activity, visible light was introduced to the system. Experiments have shown that a 10 mol % manganese doped titania/silica system, in the presence of light, can degrade acetaldehyde. The cobalt doped counterpart showed dark activity in the presence of acetaldehyde resulting in the formation of CO 2 without the addition of visible light. In the hope of increasing surface area a mixed solvent (toluene/methanol) synthesis procedure was applied to the manganese doped catalyst. The resulting materials were of a low surface area but showed a significant increase in degradation of acetaldehyde. Examination of the interactions between mixed metal oxide systems and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) was studied. The pollutant, <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphate,</b> was dissolved in n-pentane and exposed to 10 mg of a given catalyst. These reactions were monitored using UVVis.

Various iron(III) diketonates were used to catalyse the conversion. Mechanistic studies showed the reaction to proceed via the formation of phosphorus triiodide (PI₃), then diphenyl phosphoroiodidate (O=PI(OPh) ₂) before the final formation of <b>triphenyl</b> <b>phosphate</b> (O=P(OPh) ₃). The nucleophilic substitution of O=PI(OPh) ₂ with phenol to form O=P(OPh) ₃ was found to be the rate determining step.

Triphenyl phosphite was synthesized in selectivities of up to 60 %. The mechanism of these transformations was also elucidated. Independent syntheses of the intermediate in the reaction mechanism, O=P(OPh) ₂I and its hydrolysis products diphenyl phosphate (O=P(OPh) ₂OH) and tetraphenyl pyrophosphate ((O) P(OPh) ₂-O-P(O) (OPh) ₂) were developed from PI₃.

OPFRs have been widely detected in adults and {{have been linked to}} reproductive and endocrine changes in adult males. Carcinogenicity and damage to, immunological, neurologic and developmental systems have been observed in human cell lines. Young children are especially vulnerable to OPFR exposure, but little is known about exposure levels or exposure risk factors in this population. We examined parent-reported demographic and dietary survey data in relation to OPFR urinary metabolite concentrations in 15 - to 18 -month old toddlers (n= 41) to. OPFR metabolites were detected in 100 % subjects. The metabolite of TPP, diphenyl phosphate (DPP) was detected most commonly (100 %), with TDCPP metabolite, bis(1, 3 -dichloro- 2 -propyl) phosphate (BDCPP), detected in 85 - 95 % of samples and ITP metabolite, monoisopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate (ip-DPP), detected in 81 % of samples (n= 21). Toddlers of mothers earning <$ 10, 000 annually had average DPP concentrations 70 % higher (p=. 05) than toddlers of mothers earning <$ 10, 000 /year. While no dietary factors were significantly associated with OPFR metabolite concentrations, results suggested meat and fish consumption may be associated with higher DPP and BDCPP levels, while increased dairy and fresh food consumption may be associated with lower DPP, BDCPP, and ip-DPP levels.
