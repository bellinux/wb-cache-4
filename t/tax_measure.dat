25|$|With the {{entrance}} of the United States into World War I, revenue needs were greatly increased. Both parties worked together to produce a tax bill. Included in the War Revenue Act of October 3, 1917, was a tax of “5 cents upon each telegraph, telephone, or radio, dispatch, message, or conversation, which originates within the United States, and for the transmission of which a charge of 15 cents or more is imposed.” Work on the Revenue Act of 1918 had nearly been completed when the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. Although World War I had ended, Congress recognized budget expenditures could be expected to decline in the long term but that reductions in expenditures would not occur in the short term. Pay for U.S. military forces could be expected to continue for some time and there was a need to provide capital for reconstruction to U.S. allies in Europe. Thus, this <b>tax</b> <b>measure</b> was redrafted. The redrafted Act not only continued the telephone excise tax but also did so at increased rates that were graduated for the first time. While this Act {{is referred to as the}} Revenue Act of 1918, it was not passed until early in 1919. The tax continued until it was repealed in 1924.|$|E

2500|$|Some local {{government}} tax proposals may be relatively modest in amount, but when added to other taxes currently paid {{would result in}} a cumulative tax burden that may be unacceptably high.
