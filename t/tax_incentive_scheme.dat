40|$|Background: The paper {{examines}} the regional {{effects of a}} general innovation policy, i. e. a policy tool that does not target specific industries or subnational regions. General policy tools {{are an important part}} of the portfolio of innovation policy measures. However, there is a question over whether general tools are equally relevant for all types of firms, irrespective of their size, sector and location. Findings: The economic geography and innovation study literature, as well as the EU’s Smart Specialization approach, are based on the view that innovation policy tools must be adapted to specific regional conditions. General policy tools are insufficient unless they are adapted to individual regions.

40|$|While in 1996, 12 OECD {{countries}} offered R&D tax incentives, in 2008 {{this number}} increased to 21. Most countries have opted for level-based instead of incremental R&D tax incentives. This paper takes a {{critical look at}} how the effectiveness of R&D tax incentives has been assessed in recent evaluations. Whether based on structural models estimating a price elasticity of R&D or on treatment evaluation methods, most studies estimate the cost effectiveness ratio or additionality. If the cost effectiveness ratio is greater than 1, or firms to more R&D than before, the policy is considered to be effective. A more proper net welfare evaluation of this policy should also include administration, compliance and transfer costs, the marginal burden of taxation, as well R&D externalities and the indirect effects on innovation and productivity. The net welfare gain is shown to be sensitive to a certain number of parameters that are not always estimated with great precision. In particular, the transfer cost or deadweight loss associated with level-based tax incentives is shown to depend {{on the size of the}} firm, or more precisely its ex-ante R&D level. We report on the success of a past policy changes in the Netherlands and simulate the effect of various parameter changes in the existing Dutch R&D <b>tax</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme.</b> We show that introducing marginal changes in the schemes’s parameters has little impact of increased R&D spending.

40|$|The {{private sector}} in {{developing}} countries {{plays a key role}} in job-creation and is central to economic development and poverty alleviation. Governments around the world use various policies and regulations targeting firms in an attempt to foster growth. This dissertation focuses on the interplay between government policies, firm behavior, and labor markets in India. In Chapter 1, I study the impact of a location-based <b>tax</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> in India. Location-based policies that target particular geographic regions are widely used by governments, but there have been few rigorous evaluations of their causal impacts especially in the context of developing countries. Using aggregated and firm-level panel data, I find large increases in employment, total output, fixed capital, and the number of firms as a result of the program. These increases are due to both the growth of existing firms as well as the entry of new firms. There is supporting evidence that the new firms entering the treated regions are larger and more productive. I find no evidence for relocation of firms or spillovers in industrial activity between treatment and control areas. Finally, using data from household surveys, I show that wages of workers rise but find no changes in housing rents or migration across the treated and control regions. My results therefore suggest that the policy increased welfare, and I also conclude that the policy was cost-effective. This provides support for place-based policies to correct for regional economic disparities, especially in settings with low labor mobility. In the next chapter, I focus on the effects of a place-based policy on informal firms. The informal sector in India is a major component of economic activity covering more than 80 % of the workforce. More often than not, the informal sector is beyond the ambit of tax authorities, hurting public finances in India. In Chapter 2, I study the impact of the federally financed location-based <b>tax</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> (studied in Chapter 1) on informal firms in India. Using a difference-in-differences approach with bordering districts, neighboring states, and major states as control groups, I find no evidence for increases in employment, total output, gross value added, and registration status for informal firms on average. However, separating informal firms into those that do not hire regular workers (Own Account Manufacturing Enterprises) and those that hire workers (Non-directory manufacturing enterprises/Directory Manufacturing Enterprises) reveals heterogeneous effects. I find that the policy change led to a higher likelihood of registration by NDME/DMEs but no effect on OAMEs. The policy change did not impact the size of these different kinds of firms. This chapter provides suggestive evidence that tax-exemption schemes can be a useful policy tool to incentivize informal firms to register. In Chapter 3, I revisit the contentious labor laws in India and their effects on hiring decisions of firms faced with demand shocks. Labor regulations in India differ by states and apply differently across types of laborers. The most restrictive laws make it harder to fire permanent workers for firms. However, these laws do not apply to workers hired through contractors (contract workers). Using firm-level data from India, I find that compared to firms in flexible labor regulations, those in more restrictive labor regimes hire more contract workers as a response to transitory local demand shocks. I find no differential response in hiring of permanent workers by firms faced with these shocks. This suggests that firms circumvent labor laws by hiring workers indirectly through contractors in the face of economic fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. M.) -Unversity of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2010. The {{promotion}} of science & {{technology and the}} creation of an enabling environment for countries innovation systems has been a growing worldwide trend in developed countries, with 21 out of 30 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) currently utilising some form of tax incentive program aimed at encouraging investment in research and development (R&D) by private industry. 1 Encouraging R&D and associated innovation is generally seen as an effective tool in advancing science and technology, which in turn leads to the creation of new products and services, an increase in international competitiveness of local business, direct foreign investment and social spin-offs in the form of increased employment and economic growth? R&D is, however, expensive and involves high levels of technical risk, with the costs and risk involved often outweighing the potential profit. Consequently, many businesses choose not to perform R&D, which has resulted in governments of most developed countries having implemented various incentives to encourage private business to undertake R&D. These incentives can take the form of either direct incentives (grants, soft loans, subsidies etc) or indirect incentives (such as tax incentives). Tax incentives effectively subsidise the costs of R&D, making it a more attractive and profitable alternative for business. Developed countries, including: the United States of America (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, China, Canada and Australia have all adopted a combination of both direct and indirect incentives, with various tax incentive measures receiving much attention in the last 2 decades. In South Africa the legislation providing for R&D tax incentives has been substantially amended in recent years through a number of Taxation Amendment Acts,] culminating in the enactment of s lID of the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962 (the Act).

40|$|The {{first chapter}} investigates {{life-cycle}} saving behavior {{with a focus}} on the elderly, who are frequently found to continue saving after retirement. We test the reliability of this evidence, as it is in many cases based on repeated cross-sectional data, where we cannot directly control the stability of the sample. In fact, differential mortality or differential sampling success may lead to biased age trajectories in savings and wealth. Exploiting a characteristic of the German pension system, we find evidence for differential mortality with respect to permanent income in the German Income and Expenditure Survey (EVS) – thereby confirming previous studies. Correcting the age-trajectories of savings and wealth for the resulting sample bias, we do not find evidence supporting the hypothesis that the German savings puzzle may be a statistical artifact resulting from the use of a synthetic panel. The second chapter analyses historical trends in household portfolio choice and investigates the importance of age-, cohort- and time-effects. We show based on a range of cohort-analyses, that all three effects matter in the context of household portfolios. In the following, we focus on the age-pattern of the different portfolio components and find them in line with what we would expect given the savings motives which we would attribute to the respective assets. Apart from the empirical results, we highlight methodological issues around the estimation of life-cycle profiles. The plain assumption that there is a common life-cycle pattern may be false. Cohorts must be expected to differ in preferences, expectations, and initial endowments. Further, the institutional environment may change. Each of these factors may change the shape of the life-cycle profile across cohorts. Hence, the assumption of an unchanged age-profile may lead to biased results. We thus recommend the use of plain cohort-analyses which also convey substantially more information about the changing nature of life-cycle profiles. In chapter three, we examine in detail the determinants of the demand for life-insurance products. Their capacity to satisfy a wide range of saving motives should provide important insights beyond the demand for life insurance itself. Cross-sectional and time variation in the tax treatment towards life-insurance allows a dedicated focus on the importance of tax-effects. The tax exemption for interest earned in a long-run life-insurance contract turns out a distinct investment motive. The possibility to deduct contributions from taxable income, however, turns out ineffective. Further, we find overall supportive evidence for the old-age saving motive. The wish to provide for ones dependents is associated with higher investments in products with a term-life component. Our results imply that the cutbacks in the public pension system and the recent reform of the <b>tax</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>scheme</b> should promote annuity insurance products at the disadvantage of whole life insurance products. The fourth chapter is dedicated to the analysis of inequality in a life-cycle context. Over the last 25 years, Germany has experienced little growth in income and consumption inequality, whereas wealth inequality has grown significantly. Decomposing these trends we illustrate the influence of the German Reunification and the trend towards smaller households. Next, we look at the evolution of in inequality over age and find ambiguous results for income and wealth and a clear upward trend in consumption inequality over age. Finally, we further investigate the drivers behind wealth inequality. Active savings contribute the lion’s share of wealth growth in Germany. Passive savings, by contrast, have mostly caused wealth reductions. The reasons are the conservative asset allocation of financial wealth, as well as the poor performance of real estate wealth. The predominance of active savings for wealth growth implies a strong interdependence between the distributions of wealth and income in Germany. The concluding chapter documents all imputation and harmonization work which was involved in the preparation of the EVS data. We make two important conceptual contributions: First, we suggest an improved imputation approach for the EVS wealth data which ensures a better preservation of the variation within the imputed variables and the interdependencies between variables. Second, we assess the possible influence of structural changes to the EVS sample on life-cycle analyses, specifically the switch from an annual to a quarterly household diary and the changing sampling threshold with respect to income...|$|E
