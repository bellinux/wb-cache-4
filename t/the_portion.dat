5|$|At {{the end of}} 1926, the American Association of State Highway Officials {{formally}} {{established the}} U.S. Highway System {{and many of the}} New England inter-state routes were redesignated as U.S. Routes. <b>The</b> <b>portion</b> of New England Route 14 from Barre to Burlington was assigned to U.S. Route 2, while <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> in New Hampshire was assigned to U.S. Route 4. This shortened Route 14 in the south to US 4/US 5 in White River Junction, and in the north to US 2 in the city of Barre. In 1935, <b>the</b> <b>portion</b> of US 2 between Montpelier and St. Johnsbury was relocated to a more northerly alignment using a section of then Vermont Route 18.

40|$|The prostatic and epididymal {{portions}} of rabbit vas deferens were {{different in the}} reactivity to electrical field stimulation (EFS), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and noradrenaline (NA).
