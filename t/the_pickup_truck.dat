500|$|On August 23, 2008, a California Highway Patrol ("CHP") {{dispatcher}} in Humboldt County, California {{received a}} 911 call from an anonymous caller. According to the dispatcher, the caller reported a silver Ford F150 pickup with {{the license plate}} number [...] "8D94925" [...] ran them off the highway. The caller stated that the truck was last seen heading southbound on California State Route 1. CHP dispatchers relayed the report to officers in the geographic area, and the vehicle was soon spotted traveling southbound at mile marker 66 near Fort Bragg, California. Officers pulled over the vehicle and discovered that Lorenzo Prado Navarette and Jose Prado Navarette were the only occupants. After {{standing next to the}} cab of <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>truck,</b> the officers noticed [...] "a very distinct smell of marijuana coming from the vehicle". Officers then searched the vehicle and found four large bags containing [...] of marijuana, an unopened box of oven bags, clippers, and fertilizer in the bed of the truck.|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas held that the 911 call contained sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the traffic stop. Although he acknowledged that this was a [...] "close case", Justice Thomas concluded that indicia of the 911 caller's reliability were stronger than those in Florida v. J.L., where the Court held a [...] "bare-bones" [...] tip was unreliable. Justice Thomas began his opinion by emphasizing that the Supreme Court had [...] "firmly rejected the argument that reasonable cause for an investigative stop can only be based on the officer’s personal observation, rather than on information supplied by another person.” By identifying the make, model, and license plate number of <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>truck,</b> Justice Thomas argued that [...] "the caller necessarily claimed eyewitness knowledge of the alleged dangerous driving," [...] and that basis of knowledge supported the tip's reliability. Furthermore, Justice Thomas concluded that [...] " [...] driver’s claim that another vehicle ran her off the road, however, necessarily implies that the informant knows the other car was driven dangerously." [...] Justice Thomas also noted that the calls made through the 911 emergency system are particularly reliable, because calls are recorded and individuals may face prosecution for making false reports.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} {{motorized}} vehicle driven in modern ranch work is <b>the</b> <b>pickup</b> <b>truck.</b> Sturdy and roomy, {{with a high}} ground clearance, and often four-wheel drive capability, it has an open box, called a [...] "bed," [...] and can haul supplies from town or over rough trails on the ranch. It is used to pull stock trailers transporting cattle and livestock from one area to another and to market. With a horse trailer attached, it carries horses to distant areas where they may be needed. Motorcycles are sometimes used instead of horses for some tasks, but the most common smaller vehicle is the four-wheeler. It will carry a single cowboy quickly around the ranch for small chores. In areas with heavy snowfall, snowmobiles are also common. However, in spite of modern mechanization, there remain jobs, particularly those involving working cattle in rough terrain or in close quarters that are best performed by cowboys on horseback.|$|E
