50|$|The {{geologic}} {{evolution of}} the Mindanao Pacific Cordillera was largely controlled by convergent and transcurrent tectonics intermittently active during Upper Cretaceous to Pleistocene times.

Those scientists who doubt that plate tectonics operated in the Archean argue that the felsic protocontinents formed at hotspots rather than subduction zones.

50|$|During {{the late}} Permian ~250 mya the Afro-Arabian plate started opening up.

This rift system would cause a contractional <b>tectonic</b> <b>process</b> to occur in which the Arabian Plate was pushed in a north-easterly direction towards the Eurasian plate. The divergence in the East African Rift would eventually cause the closure of the Tethys Ocean as the Arabian Plate made its first inception of collision with Eurasia between 25-23 million years ago, and complete closure around 10 mya and creation of the Mardin High.|$|E

50|$|Mount Greylock and the {{neighboring}} Taconic Mountains are comprised predominately of Ordovician phyllite, a metamorphic rock, overlain on younger layers of metamorphized sedimentary rock, especially marble. Mount Greylock {{is the product}} of thrust faulting, a <b>tectonic</b> <b>process</b> by which older rock is thrust up and above younger rock during periods of intense mountain building. The younger, underlying marble bedrock layers have been quarried in the lower foothills of the mountain in nearby Adams and North Adams, Massachusetts. During the Pleistocene, 18,000 years ago, Mount Greylock and the surrounding region were covered by the Laurentide ice sheet up to 1 km in thickness. Glaciation rounded and wore down the mountain, carving out U-shaped valleys and leaving glacial erratics such as the Balanced Rock in Laneborough {{on the west side of}} Greylock. The Hopper, a cirque, also located on the west side of Greylock, is the southernmost such glacial feature in New England.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} low-Ca amphibolites are {{described}} {{for the first}} time in the Ordenes Complex (Galicia, NW Spain). The first type exhibits an initial mineral assemblage containing sillimanite, staurolite and anthophyllite, which are found as microinclusions in cordierite crystals. This association indicates medium pressure and temperatures above 600 ºC, and is replaced in the matrix by a medium to low-pressure assemblage of anthophyllite, cordierite and garnet. The second type is represented by lowpressure amphibolitic gneisses formed mainly of cummingtonite, cordierite, andalusite and garnet. The first type of amphibolite would appear to give rise to the second type as a result of metamorphic evolution to lower pressures. A fragment of the decompressive P-T path was obtained by a detailed study of the mineral assemblage succession and the textural relationships of these rocks. The P-T path begins with an almost isothermal decompression from ca. 6 - 7 kbar and 650 ºC. This kind of P-T path (isothermal) is usually interpreted, according to thermal models, as originating during exhumation favoured by some <b>tectonic</b> <b>process.</b> Hence, the exhumation of the uppermost unit of the Ordenes Complex, in which the anthophyllite-cummingtonite rocks are located, appears to have been facilitated by some kind of extensional <b>tectonic</b> <b>process...</b>|$|E

40|$|The recent {{revolution}} {{in the analysis of}} physical experiments of <b>tectonic</b> <b>processes</b> has provided new quantitative tools to analyze their outcomes. Physical experiments using scaled analog models are unique in providing information on complex three-dimensional deformation where processes can be directly observed. These observations critically complement insights gained from field and analytical/numerical investigations. Recent innovations in rheologic testing, digital image processing, and data collection are revolutionizing how we use experiments to provide insight into crustal deformation. At the same time, we are seeing the benefits of physical experiments in classroom teaching by engaging students in hypothesis testing and hands-on laboratory experience. Strengthening of the community of physical experimentalists and instructors using analog materials to simulate <b>tectonic</b> <b>processes</b> will enhance our understanding of these processes, lend more power both to interpretations of field observations and to validation of numerical models, and deepen student understanding of tectonic mechanisms. A step toward a stronger community has been made with a recent workshop on physical modeling of <b>tectonic</b> <b>processes,</b> and this report is one outcome of that workshop...|$|R
