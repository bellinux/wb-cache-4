25|$|As {{suggested}} by the etymology of the word, {{one of the earliest}} reasons for interest in geometry was surveying, and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally. The fundamental <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, and both of these quantities can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains such as Gunter's chain, and angles using graduated circles and, later, the theodolite.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of range is further confounded by how the total realized range size is measured. There are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurements</b> commonly in use, {{the extent of}} occurrence (EOO) and the area of occupancy (AOO) (see also the Scaling pattern of occupancy). The EOO can best {{be thought of as}} the minimum convex polygon encompassing all known normal occurrences of a particular species, and is the measure of range most commonly found in field guides. The AOO is the subset of the EOO where the species actually occurs. In essence, the AOO acknowledges that there are holes in the distribution of a species within its EOO, and attempts to correct for these vacancies. A common way to describe the AOO of a species is to divide the study region into a matrix of cells and record if the species is present in or absent from each cell. For example, in describing O–A relationships for common British birds, Quinn et al. found that the occupancy at the finest resolution (10 x 10km squares) best explained abundance patterns. In a similar manner, Zuckerberg et al. used Breeding Bird Atlas data measured on cells 5×5km to describe breeding bird occupancy in New York State.|$|E
