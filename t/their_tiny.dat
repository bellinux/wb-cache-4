5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given <b>their</b> <b>tiny</b> wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E
25|$|About 80% of {{the species}} are terrestrial, and most inhabit {{waterlogged}} or wet soils, where <b>their</b> <b>tiny</b> bladders can be permanently exposed to water in the substrate. Frequently they will be found in marshy areas where the water table {{is very close to}} the surface. Most of the terrestrial species are tropical, although they occur worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Preservation is {{a problem}} for fairyflies (and other small chalcid wasps). <b>Their</b> <b>tiny</b> sizes require special methods. Specimens have to be dried, if {{collected}} wet, e.g. if ethyl alcohol is used as the killing agent. Drying can make specimens extremely brittle, so additional care should also be taken not to disintegrate them. Mounting specimens (preferably in permanent slides) is also time-consuming and requires a fair amount of practice. They are gummed or glued onto cards, as they can not be mounted on pins like larger insects.|$|E

25|$|Due to <b>their</b> <b>tiny</b> shell sizes, Zospeum {{species are}} {{extremely}} slow-moving snails. In a week's time, they may only move a few millimeters or centimeters while grazing, usually in small circles around a given point. Because of their proximity to {{bodies of water}} and their preference for habitats with a mud substrate, Weigand and colleagues (2013) have proposed that the primary mode of dispersal of Zospeum species may be passive, either by being carried along in running water or through the activities of larger animals like cave bats or crickets.|$|E
25|$|Before neutrinos {{were found}} to oscillate, they were {{generally}} assumed to be massless, propagating {{at the speed of}} light. According to the theory of special relativity, the question of neutrino velocity is closely related to their mass: if neutrinos are massless, they must travel at the speed of light; however, if they have mass, they cannot reach the speed of light. Due to <b>their</b> <b>tiny</b> mass, the predicted speed is extremely close to the speed of light in all experiments, and current detectors are not sensitive to the expected difference.|$|E
25|$|While Locke {{had always}} wanted to be a writer, it was in the 1950s that she began to take it seriously.

In 1954 she self-published a book of her poetry, The Time of the Child: A Sequence of Poems.

25|$|During {{his studies}} on the Galápagos Islands, Charles Darwin {{observed}} 13 species of finches that are closely related and differ most markedly {{in the shape of}} their beaks. The beak of each species is suited to the food available in its particular environment, suggesting that beak shapes evolved by natural selection. Large beaks were found on the islands where the primary source of food for the finches are nuts and therefore the large beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for opening the nuts and staying well nourished. Slender beaks were found on the finches which found insects to be the best source of food on the island they inhabited; their slender beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for pulling out the insects from <b>their</b> <b>tiny</b> hiding places. The finch is also found on the mainland and it is thought that they migrated to the islands and began adapting to their environment through natural selection.|$|E
25|$|In July 1924 when Arthur Dove and Helen Torr sailed into Huntington Harbor aboard their 42-foot yawl, Mona, {{they could}} not have {{anticipated}} the extent to which Long Island’s North Shore would inspire some of their greatest paintings. They lived in Halesite until the Great Depression when both Dove and Torr moved back to the Dove's estate located in Geneva. Longing to be back on Long Island, in 1938 they moved back into their first home, a former post office and general store on Center Shore Road in Centerport, New York. They purchased the house for $980.00. <b>Their</b> <b>tiny,</b> one-room cottage stood {{on the edge of the}} Titus Mill Pond. Almost immediately, Dove was found to have pneumonia; he eventually suffered from a heart attack and was diagnosed with a debilitating kidney disorder. In terrible health for the remainder of his days, he lived quietly, finally about to devote himself entirely to painting, and focusing on the inspiration of his surroundings and his home. Some of the most powerful paintings of his career, including Indian Summer, were painted in Centerport. Torr remained in the house on the millpond but never painted again. After her death in 1967, works by Torr and Dove were hung together in The Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1979.|$|E
