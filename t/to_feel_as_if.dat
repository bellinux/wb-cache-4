5|$|Filming was set {{to begin}} in October 2003, but it was pushed back. Principal {{photography}} for Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events began on November 10, 2003, using the sound stages and backlot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood. Director Brad Silberling avoided using too many digital or chroma key effects because he wanted the younger actors <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were working in a realistic environment. Olaf's mansion occupied two sound stages, while the graveyard and {{the ruins of the}} Baudelaire mansion were constructed on the Paramount back lot. After 21 weeks of shooting at Paramount, production then moved to Downey Studios, a former NASA facility in Downey, California, for eight more weeks. Downey housed the circular railroad crossing set complete with forced perspective scenery, as well as a newly constructed water tank complete with over one million gallons of water. The water tank was instrumental in filming scenes set at Briny Beach, Lake Lachrymose, Damocles Dock and Curdled Cave. Filming for A Series of Unfortunate Events ended on May 29, 2004.|$|E

It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they {{are sitting in the}} cab of their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.|$|E
500|$|To {{make the}} project ready for theaters, Lasseter {{would need to}} add 12 minutes or so of {{material}} and strengthen what was already there. The extra material would be a challenge, since {{it could not be}} mere padding—it would have <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had always been there, an organic part of the film. With the scheduled delivery date less than a year away, Lasseter called Stanton, Docter, Joe Ranft, and some Disney story people to his house for a weekend. [...] There, he hosted what he called a [...] "story summit", a crash exercise that would yield a finished story in just two days.|$|E

500|$|Tim Burton avoided using {{too many}} digital effects {{because he wanted}} the younger actors <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they were working in a {{realistic}} environment. As a result, forced perspective techniques, oversized props and scale models were used to avoid computer-generated imagery (CGI). Deep Roy was cast to play the Oompa-Loompas based on his previous collaborations with Burton on Planet of the Apes and Big Fish. The actor was able to play various Oompa-Loompas using split screen photography, digital and front projection effects. [...] "Tim {{told me that the}} Oompa-Loompas were strictly programmed, like robots— all they do is work, work, work," [...] Roy commented. [...] "So {{when it comes time to}} dance, they're like a regiment; they do the same steps." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment" [...] {{was written}} by {{freelance}} writer Steve Pepoon and directed by Rich Moore. It was originally going to be named [...] "Homer vs. the 8th Commandment", but the writers decided to include Lisa in the title because they wanted the cast <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> all their characters were equally represented on the show. The episode {{is based on the}} Eighth Commandment ("thou shall not steal"), {{which is one of the}} Ten Commandments. The Simpsons writer Al Jean said that [...] "whenever people come up to me and say that The Simpsons is just sort of this outrageous show that has no moral center, I always point them to this , where Homer gets an illegal cable hook-up (which many people have done in real life) and suffers enormous consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|Sony {{requested}} that MediEvil should support the PlayStation analogue controller, which Sorrell {{described as a}} [...] "particularly fortuitous event" [...] as it allowed them to capture much more fluidity and intuitiveness within the game. New concepts such as camera and character control presented many drawbacks and required the team to try {{out a number of}} approaches before settling on solutions that seemed to work. The team finally settled on the concept that MediEvil would support both analogue and digital camera-related controls for balance reasons. Sorrell stated that a spline camera view was the first attempt, but he disliked it {{due to the lack of}} freedom for the player <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he was exploring. It was then changed to a free-form camera view, which [...] "just worked". There were also many levels and ideas from the original concept that the team were forced to remove due to time or budget constraints. There was intended to be a platform-oriented section of the game where the player would control the worm that lived in Daniel's skull. Concept art and a separate level was created for this section, but it never materialised into the game.|$|E

500|$|When Willow and Tara {{first met}} in the fourth season, the writers did not intend the {{relationship}} to be romantic but the actors had such chemistry that, two episodes later, Whedon and the writing team took Alyson Hannigan and Amber Benson aside to inform them where it would go. For {{the rest of the}} season, the sexual relationship between Willow and Tara was represented metaphorically by witchcraft, and none of the WB executives realized it. In the end, Whedon praised the way the WB handled the display of affection in [...] "The Body", saying [...] "They raised an eyebrow, but they've been great. I give the WB props {{when it came to the}} [...] kiss. What I want to show is real affection, and 'The Body' turned out to be the perfect place to put it in. To the network's credit, they not only aired it, but they did not advertise it. I thought that was pretty classy." [...] Stephen Tropiano in Prime Time Closet: A History of Gays and Lesbians on TV writes that this approach was [...] "truly groundbreaking"; no long speech, no huge discovery: [...] "Like Willow, we're made <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> her love for Tara is the most natural thing in the world". Tropiano calls it [...] "A simple kiss. A quiet, simple moment. Two lovers kissing. Just like lovers do." ...|$|E
500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. I believe I got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E
500|$|Further reviews {{tended to}} be negative. IGN's Travis Fickett rated the episode 6.0/10, {{explaining}} [...] "It's starting <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Walter's loony logic is starting to influence the actual writing of Fringe." [...] Fickett criticized Walter's science and [...] "silly ranting", Olivia's stepfather storyline, and believed certain lines of dialogue to be [...] "dangerously close to self-parody." [...] Sarah Stegall from SFScope was skeptical of the episode's science, and explained [...] "I really don't want any more of this. I'm tired of this formulaic series. I'm tired of Anna Torv's earnest, sad expressions—can we get this woman to laugh once or twice? Joshua Jackson and Kirk Acevedo are good supports and foils for Olivia, but there's no there there {{when it comes to}} Agent Dunham." [...] Patrick Kevin Day from the Los Angeles Times liked the opening sequence, but was distracted from fully enjoying the episode because he thought the science was [...] "wonky." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray graded the episode with a B, explaining he liked Chris Eigeman's presence and the efforts at further developing the characters, but questioned the Pattern storyline, despite admitting that he does not require rational scientific explanations in science fiction. Tim Grierson of New York Magazine disliked the focus on Olivia, calling it [...] "a long hour of television." [...] Referring to Olivia's [...] "feminist" [...] speech to Broyles, Grierson continued, [...] "It's sort of cute how Fringe occasionally pretends that it's more than just a freak show. But if they're going to focus on a character, it should be Walter — though we shudder to think how his flatulence will factor into the plot." ...|$|E

2500|$|The loss of {{a sibling}} can be a devastating life event. Despite this, sibling grief is often the most disenfranchised or {{overlooked}} of the four main forms of grief, {{especially with regard to}} adult siblings. Grieving siblings are {{often referred to as the}} 'forgotten mourners' who are made <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> their grief is not as severe as their parents grief (N.a., 2015). However, the sibling relationship tends to be the longest significant relationship of the lifespan and siblings who have been part of each other's lives since birth, such as twins, help form and sustain each other's identities; with the death of one sibling comes the loss of that part of the survivor's identity because “your identity is based on having them there.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Day the Earth Stood Still {{was well}} {{received}} by critics and {{is widely regarded}} as one of the best films of 1951. Variety praised the film's documentary style and wrote that [...] "the yarn is told interestingly enough and imbued with sufficient science-fiction lures and suspense so that only seldom does its moralistic wordiness get in the way ... Cast, although secondary to the story, works well." [...] Harrison's Reports wrote: [...] "Very good! It is by far the best of the science-fiction pictures yet produced. It holds one's interest undiminished from start to finish and, although the theme is admittedly fantastic, one is made <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he is seeing a real-life occurrence because of the expert handling of the subject matter and the extremely fine special effects work." [...] The Los Angeles Times praised the film's seriousness, though it also found [...] "certain subversive elements". Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote a dismissive review, however, calling the film [...] "tepid entertainment" [...] and describing Gort as [...] "oddly unmenacing." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{subsequent}} licensing {{deal with}} Warner Bros. Entertainment brought the studio {{the rights to}} develop games based on Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead and Bill Willingham's Fables comics. The first endeavor completed was the 2012 The Walking Dead video game, which had the same episodic nature as the studio's earlier games but was built more on developing characters and story over traditional puzzle elements. The game required the player to make significant game-changing decisions including the death of non-playable characters, sometimes {{with only a few}} seconds to deliberate which option to select through quick time events. Choices made would create determinants that would carry through the remaining episodes and into subsequent seasons, allowing players to come <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the story they are presented was more personal due to the choices they made. The game was praised critically for its emotional story and use of the adventure genre, as well as designed its release around a timed episodic schedule. The Walking Dead was considered very successful, and one of the biggest surprises for the video game industry in 2012, and a [...] "refresh" [...] of the adventure game genre; Ron Gilbert noted that The Walking Deads approach to appear to the mass market can make adventure games as relevant as other genres to larger publishers. Following The Walking Dead, Telltale secures further deals to produce additional seasons of The Walking Dead, and seasons based on the A Song of Ice and Fire/Game of Thrones book series, and the Borderlands and Minecraft video games, among other deals. Telltale's episodic and deterministic narrative model has also been used by other developers, including Life Is Strange and Dreamfall Chapters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent to}} which Austen's novels are {{realistic}} is vigorously debated by scholars. The lack of physical description in her novels lends them an air of unreality. In Austen novels, as Page notes, there is a [...] "conspicuous absence of words referring to physical perception, the world of shape and colour and sensuous response". Yet, Austen carefully researched the background of her novels, using almanacs and read books to accurately describe the chronology and geography of her fictional worlds. Alastair Duckworth argues that she displays [...] "a concern that the novelist should describe things that are really there, that imagination {{should be limited to}} an existing order." [...] Austen's prose also repeatedly contains [...] "a relatively small number of frequently-used words, mainly epithets and abstract nouns indicating personal qualities—qualities, that is, of character and temperament rather than outward appearance". This allows readers <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they know the characters [...] "intimately as a mind". Many scholars view this connection between the reader and character as a mark of realism. For example, Janet Todd writes that [...] "Austen creates an illusion of realism in her texts, partly through readerly identification with the characters and partly through rounded characters, who have a history and a memory." [...] However, there is little agreement regarding the depth of Austen's characters. Butler has argued that Austen is not primarily a realist writer because she is not interested in portraying the psychology of her heroines. Seeing Austen as a polemicist against sensibility, Butler argues that she avoided [...] "the sensuous, the irrational, [...] the involuntary types of mental experience because, although she cannot deny their existence, she disapproves of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. I thought I should have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were dying on the cross.|$|E
