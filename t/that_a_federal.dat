5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, and limiting the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E

25|$|However, {{political}} {{discussion of}} the possibility of using a constitutional amendment to restrict marriage rights was not unheard of in the 1990s. In January 1996, for example, the House Judiciary Committee for the state of Hawaii voted 12-1 in favor of passing bill HB 117, which was aimed at amending the constitution of Hawaii to define marriage as involving one man and one woman. In 1998, the first anti-same-sex marriage amendment was added to the constitution of a U.S. state, though it was not until 2002 <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> marriage amendment was first introduced in the U.S. Congress.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> law prohibiting {{tuition fees}} was unconstitutional, {{on the grounds}} that {{education}} is the sole responsibility of the states. Following this ruling, seven federal states introduced tuition fees of €500 per semester in 2006 and 2007. Due to massive student protests and a citizens' initiative which collected 70,000 signatures against tuition fees, the government of Hesse was the first to reverse course before the state election in 2008; other state governments soon followed. Several parties which spoke out for tuition fees lost state elections. Bavaria in 2013 and Lower Saxony in 2014 were the last states to abolish tuition fees.|$|E

25|$|On December 22, 2006, the LA Times {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> {{grand jury}} had subpoenaed Weldon's congressional records {{prior to the}} November elections. Because a member must notify House leadership promptly if they receive subpoenas while the House is in session to be entered into the Congressional Record, Weldon may have violated House rules depending on when he received the subpoenas. On July 17, 2007, The Washington Post reported that, as of Spring 2007, federal investigators were continuing to examine Weldon's official actions taken {{on behalf of his}} daughter's lobbying clients. The same article noted that Weldon had spent at least $30,000 in legal fees and related investigatory expenses {{as a result of the}} probe.|$|E
25|$|When Catt again became {{president}} in 1915, the NAWSA adopted her plan to centralize {{the organization and}} work toward the suffrage amendment as its primary goal. This was done despite opposition from southern members who believed <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> amendment would erode states' rights. With its large membership and {{the increasing number of}} women voters in states where suffrage had already been achieved, the NAWSA began to operate more as a political pressure group than an educational group. It won additional sympathy for the suffrage cause by actively cooperating with the war effort during World War I. On February 14, 1920, several months prior to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment, the NAWSA transformed itself into the League of Women Voters, which is still active.|$|E
25|$|But, {{in several}} cases, the Court did find {{original}} habeas jurisdiction {{and reached the}} merits. In Ex parte Karstendick (1876), the Court held <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> court had no statutory authority to sentence a defendant to hard labor at a state prison outside of its territorial jurisdiction. In Ex parte Jackson (1877), the Court considered several constitutional issues, including the Postal Power, {{the application of the}} First Amendment to mail-order gambling, and the application of the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement to the mail. In Ex parte Lothrop (1886), the Court found that the Arizona territorial courts were properly constituted. In In re Sawyer (1888), the Court granted the writ to state judges imprisoned by a federal judge for violating an injunction.|$|E

25|$|Hood {{departed}} from Gadsden on October 22, {{en route to}} Guntersville, Alabama, where he planned to cross the Tennessee River. Learning that that crossing place was strongly guarded, and concerned that Federal gunboats could destroy any pontoon bridge he might deploy, he impulsively changed his destination to Decatur, 40 miles west. When Hood arrived at Decatur on October 26, he found <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>Federal</b> infantry force of 35,000 men was defending an entrenched line that included two forts and 1,600 yards of rifle pits. Two Federal wooden gunboats patrolled the river. On October 28, Confederate skirmishers advanced through a dense fog to a ravine within 800 yards of the main fortifications. Around noon, a small Federal detachment drove the sharpshooters and skirmishers out of the ravine, capturing 125 men. Hood, concluding {{that he could not}} afford the casualties that would ensue from a full-scale assault, withdrew his army. He decided once again to move to the west, to attempt another crossing near Tuscumbia, Alabama, where Muscle Shoals would prevent interference by Federal gunboats.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, XM Satellite Radio was sued by the RIAA over XM's new {{portable}} devices the Inno and Helix. The RIAA claims these devices are {{equivalent to a}} downloading service, whereas XM contends the devices are protected under the 1992 Audio Home Recording Act. In July, XM requested <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> judge dismiss the case. It {{should be noted that}} XM's subscribers can save only songs they hear on the radio and cannot request a specific song to be downloaded or program their radios to record specific artists. XM's {{portable devices}} allow the consumer to record a portion of their broadcast much like a VCR, DVR, or cassette player would allow. The content a subscriber records is available only while the subscriber still has an active account with XM Satellite Radio. Once the account is terminated, the recorded content will become inaccessible. Also, If a subscriber fails to listen to a total of 8 hours of programming a month, the recorded content will not be accessible. Recorded content can be accessed only on the portable device; it cannot be transferred to a home computer or separate digital music player.|$|E
