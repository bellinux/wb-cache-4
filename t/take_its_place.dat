5|$|During an {{excursion}} into Przemysl Land in the 48th {{year of his}} reign, Władysław cought a cold {{from which}} {{he was unable to}} recover. He finally died in Grodek in 1434, leaving Poland to his elder son, Władysław III, and Lithuania to his younger, Casimir, both still minors at the time. The Lithuanian inheritance, however, could not be taken for granted. Władysław's death ended the personal union between the two realms, and it was not clear what would <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 1943, {{strike and}} bomber {{production}} {{was to be}} scaled down, and fighter and bomber destroyer production given priority. On 3 August 1943, Milch contradicted this and declared that this increase in fighter production would not affect production of the Ju 87, Ju 188, Ju 288 and Ju 290. This was an important consideration as the life expectancy of a Ju 87 had been reduced (since 1941) from 9.5 months to 5.5 months to just 100 operational flying hours. On 26 October, General der Schlachtflieger Ernst Kupfer reported the Ju 87 could no longer survive in operations and that the Focke-Wulf Fw 190F should <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place.</b> Milch finally agreed and ordered the minimal continuance of Ju 87 D-3 and D-5 production for a smooth transition period.|$|E

5|$|Ratchet and Clank fly to Quartu {{in order}} to find out about the Blarg's next move. Immediately after realizing that Drek intends to destroy Veldin with a planet-destroying weapon called the Deplanetizer and allow his already-completed planet to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place</b> of orbit, Ratchet swears to kill Drek for his mercilessness. The Blarg and Drek are pursued to Veldin by a vengeful Ratchet, and soon a vicious battle ensues. Halfway through the fight, Drek reveals that he intends to repeat the whole process over-and-over again until he becomes the richest person in the galaxy. Ratchet {{launches}} Drek to his new planet, which is destroyed when Ratchet fires the Deplanetizer at it, killing Drek. Chunks of the planet begin to hit Veldin causing the duo to nearly fall to their death. Clank takes damage and Ratchet seems to leave the scene. A distraught Clank then prepares to leave Veldin however Ratchet returns to take Clank home and repair him.|$|E
5|$|The Danish {{physicist}} Niels Bohr was {{the first}} to seriously consider the possibility of an element with atomic number as high as 118, noting in 1922 that such an element would <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place</b> in the periodic table below radon as the seventh noble gas. Following this, Aristid von Grosse wrote an article in 1965 predicting the likely properties of element 118. These were remarkably early predictions, given that it was not yet known how to produce elements artificially in 1922, and that the existence of the island of stability had not yet been theorized in 1965. It was 80 years from Bohr's prediction before oganesson was successfully synthesised, although its chemical properties have not been investigated to determine if it behaves as the heavier congener of radon.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{competed in}} all three sports in 2006. In bobsleigh, Australia competed in the two-man and two-woman events, and was the highest-placed country to miss {{qualifications}} for an Olympic berth in the four-man event at the 2006 Challenge Cup. The Australian Olympic Committee unsuccessfully tried to have the Brazilian bobsleigh team thrown out due {{to the use of}} drugs by Armando dos Santos, so that Australia would <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place.</b> Hannah Campbell-Pegg came 23rd in luge, and Michelle Steele, a beach flag sprinter chosen from a systematic program to identify a potential skeleton medal-winner from female non-winter athletes, came 13th due to inexperience with the intimidating and technical track. Shaun Boyle represented Australia in the men's skeleton and placed 22nd. In 2010, Australia were represented in every bobsled event, but all finished last, failed to finish due to crashes or had to withdraw due to injuries sustained in earlier races. Australia's sole luger and two male skeleton racers came in the bottom 20%, while Emma Lincoln-Smith and Melissa Hoar came 10th and 12th respectively. Until 2010, Australia had placed in {{the bottom half of the}} field in every sliding event it has entered, and came last in the luge in 1994. Lincoln-Smith's effort in the skeleton in 2010 changed this record.|$|E

5|$|The {{city was}} a home port for cruise ships from Carnival Cruise Lines. The first cruise ship {{to call the}} port home was the Holiday, which left the city in November 2009 so that a larger and newer ship could <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place.</b> The Carnival Fantasy {{operated}} from Mobile from then on until the Carnival Elation arrived in May 2010. In early 2011, Carnival announced that despite fully booked cruises, the company would cease operations from Mobile in October 2011. This cessation of cruise service left the city with an annual debt service of around two million dollars related to the terminal. In September 2015, Carnival announced that the Carnival Fantasy was relocating from Miami, Florida to Mobile, Alabama after a five-year absence and would offer four and five night cruises to Mexico that started in November 2016 through November 2017. The four night cruises will visit Cozumel, Mexico while the five night cruises will additionally visit Costa Maya or Progreso. Her first departure from Mobile left on November 9, 2016 on a five night cruise to Cozumel and Progreso. Currently, she is scheduled to sail thru April 2018.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} morning the Australians remained in position, and at daybreak they {{found more than}} 150 North Korean dead within the 3 RAR defensive position. Coad subsequently brought the Middlesex forward to secure his northern flank, while 3 RAR moved forward to the Talchon River, taking up positions in the hills overlooking Chongju by 11:00. During the advance the Australians had clashed {{with a number of}} North Korean stragglers, killing 12 and capturing 10 in skirmishes. It became clear that organised resistance had ceased however, with the successful Australian assault and the subsequent defence of its objectives the day before breaking the North Koreans locally. In the north the Middlesex pushed forward to the riverbank, while in the afternoon the Argylls forded the river with two platoons of Shermans. Meanwhile, aerial reconnaissance reported the presence of North Korean tanks to the west of Chongju. Regardless, that afternoon the Argylls encountered no further opposition as they entered and cleared the ruined and burning town, securing it by 17:00. The brigade then moved into divisional reserve for the US 24th Infantry Division, with Church ordering the US 21st Infantry Regiment to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place</b> in the lead in order to give the British and Australian infantry a much needed respite. The tanks and infantry of the US 21st Infantry Regiment subsequently moved through the brigade.|$|E

However, {{in the case of}} a particularly deadly or damaging storm, that storm's name is retired, and a replacement starting with the same letter is selected to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place.</b> The decision whether to remove a name is made yearly at an annual session of the Hurricane Committee.|$|E
25|$|After {{entering}} the host cell, the viral genome is replicated {{in the rough}} endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and in the so-called vesicle packets. At first, an immature form of the virus particle is produced inside the ER, whose M-protein is not yet cleaved to its mature form and is therefore denoted as prM (precursor M) and forms a complex with protein E. The immature particles are processed in the Golgi apparatus by the host protein furin, which cleaves prM to M. This releases E from the complex which can now <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place</b> in the mature, infectious virion.|$|E

25|$|Saadia's Arabic {{translation}} of the Torah is of importance {{for the history of}} civilization; itself a product of the Arabization of a large portion of Judaism, it served for centuries as a potent factor in the impregnation of the Jewish spirit with Arabic culture, so that, in this respect, it may <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place</b> beside the Greek Bible-{{translation of}} antiquity and the German {{translation of the}} Pentateuch by Moses Mendelssohn.

25|$|In a {{convection}} heater, {{the heating}} element heats {{the air in}} contact with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, allowing more cool air to flow in to <b>take</b> <b>its</b> <b>place.</b> This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|E
