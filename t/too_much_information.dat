Unsophisticated users may lack knowledge and technology {{to be able to}} analyze such complicated financial statements and reports. Therefore, a competitive advantage is created for the sophisticated users while unsophisticated users are left with an “information overload”. Two-tiered reporting can be damaging to unsophisticated users specifically in situations where important information is being eliminated or when <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> is being extracted.|$|E
25|$|Any chord can be denoted using staff notation, showing {{not only}} its {{harmonic}} characteristics {{but also its}} exact voicing. However, this notation, frequently used in classical music, may provide <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>information,</b> making improvisation difficult. In fact, although voicings can and do {{have a significant effect}} on the subjective musical qualities of a composition, generally these interpretations retain the central characteristics of the chord. This provides an opportunity for improvisation within a defined structure and is important to improvised music such as jazz. Other problems are that voicings for one instrument are not necessarily physically playable on another (for example, the thirteenth chord, played on piano with up to seven notes, is usually played on guitar as a 4- or 5-note voicing that is impossible to play on piano with one hand).|$|E

25|$|The Stackelberg and Cournot {{models are}} similar because in both {{competition}} is on quantity. However, as seen, {{the first move}} gives the leader in Stackelberg a crucial advantage. There is also the important assumption of perfect information in the Stackelberg game: the follower must observe the quantity chosen by the leader, otherwise the game reduces to Cournot. With imperfect information, the threats described above can be credible. If the follower cannot observe the leader's move, {{it is no longer}} irrational for the follower to choose, say, a Cournot level of quantity (in fact, that is the equilibrium action). However, it must be that there is imperfect information and the follower is unable to observe the leader's move because it is irrational for the follower not to observe if it can once the leader has moved. If it can observe, it will so that it can make the optimal decision. Any threat by the follower claiming that it will not observe even if it can is as uncredible as those above. This is an example of <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> hurting a player. In Cournot competition, it is the simultaneity of the game (the imperfection of knowledge) that results in neither player (ceteris paribus) being at a disadvantage.|$|E

Kondracki chose to bluntly portray the inhumane treatment of the young women, which she described as accurate representations of what happened. This included a graphic scene, in which Raya is raped with a lead pipe after her escape and recapture.

25|$|Privacy {{concerns}} with social networking services {{have been raised}} growing concerns among users {{on the dangers of}} giving out <b>too</b> <b>much</b> personal <b>information</b> and the threat of sexual predators. Users of these services also {{need to be aware of}} data theft or viruses. However, large services, such as Myspace and Netlog, often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incidents. In addition, there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> personal <b>information</b> in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies, allowing a profile to be produced on an individual's behavior on which decisions, detrimental to an individual, may be taken. Furthermore, there is an issue over the control of data and information that was altered or removed by the user may in fact be retained and passed to third parties. This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site Quechup harvested e-mail addresses from users' e-mail accounts for use in a spamming operation.|$|R

However, The Hollywood Reporter said of the performance that, [...] "In an age of <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>information,</b> one of the most refreshing things about Gaga is her mystery.

500|$|Also {{writing in}} The Atlantic, {{a year after}} Carr, the {{futurist}} Jamais Cascio argued that human cognition has always evolved to meet environmental challenges, and that those posed by the internet are no different. He described the 'skimming' referred to by Carr {{as a form of}} attention deficit caused by the immaturity of filter algorithms: [...] "The trouble isn’t that we have <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>information</b> at our fingertips, but that our tools for managing it are still in their infancy... many of the technologies that Carr worries about were developed precisely to help us get some control over a flood of data and ideas. Google isn’t the problem; it’s the beginning of a solution." [...] Cascio and Carr's articles have been discussed together in several places. Pew Research used them to form a tension-pair question survey that was distributed to noted academics. Most responded in detail; concurring with the proposition [...] "Carr was wrong: Google does not make us stupid". In The Googlisation of Everything, Vaidhyanathan tended to side with Carr. However, he thought both arguments relied too much on determinism: Carr in thinking that an over-reliance on internet tools will inevitably cause the brain to atrophy, and Cascio in thinking that getting smarter is the necessary outcome of the evolutionary pressures he describes. In From Gutenberg to Zuckerberg Naughton noted that, while many agreed Carr had hit on an important subject, his conclusions were not widely supported.|$|E

They were beaten by ECW on Sci Fi (with 1.4), Ghost Hunters International (with 1.6) and the season three premiere of Eureka (which earned the highest rating of 2.1). The episode was also received generally positive. Tory Ireland Mell of IGN praised the episode for its reasonably short teaser, thinking the shorter it is, the better the episode, {{as well as its}} gripping storyline and the introduction of the alien race, particularly the fact that very little is known about them, stating it was [...] "a perfect tease by the writers." [...] The episode was rated 9.1 out of 10 overall. Marx Pyle of the SyFy Portal (which was since renamed Airlock Alpha) compared the episode as Atlantis' version of [...] episode [...] "Q Who?" [...] in respect to the introduction of a new [...] "big bad" [...] for the future. It was praised for being a [...] "fun filler" [...] episode, and Pyle enjoyed the scene where the two Sheppards converse, and the space battle, believing only Battlestar Galactica could beat them.
