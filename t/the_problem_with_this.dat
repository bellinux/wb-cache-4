The next and final exit will be a half cloverleaf interchange with VA 7, {{but it is not}} final {{that it will be a}} half cloverleaf because of Valley Mill Road (State Route 659). <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> is that the intersection with Valley Mill Road is where the southbound exit for Route 37 is to come into Route 7.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making it difficult for the minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} first converts the AC mains to a DC bus {{by means of a}} bridge rectifier or a similar circuit. The output voltage is then derived from this DC bus. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> is that the rectifier is a non-linear device, so the input current is highly non-linear. That means that the input current has energy at harmonics of the frequency of the voltage.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> kind of {{argument}} is just that, {{in defining the}} meaning {{of what is happening}} in society, {{it is very difficult to}} provide definite scientific proof that this meaning is the objective truth. It remains an interpretation, which may make sense of things at a certain level, without providing the whole truth. Engels's comment illustrates that the concept of character masks is not infrequently used in a polemical way to describe a false or inauthentic representation.|$|E

25|$|The {{smallest}} modification to the Standard Model, {{which only}} has left-handed neutrinos, {{is to allow}} these left-handed neutrinos to have Majorana masses. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> is that the neutrino masses are surprisingly smaller {{than the rest of}} the known particles (at least 500,000 times smaller than the mass of an electron), which, while it does not invalidate the theory, is widely regarded as unsatisfactory as this construction offers no insight into the origin of the neutrino mass scale.|$|E

It was also used in the only experiment ever reported to produce krypton tetrafluoride, although the identification of krypton tetrafluoride was later shown to be mistaken. The electrical discharge method involves having 1:1 to 2:1 mixtures of F2 to Kr at a pressure of 40 to 60 torr and then arcing large amounts of energy between it. Rates of almost 0.25g/h can be achieved. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> method {{is that it is}} unreliable with respect to yield.|$|E

25|$|For Marx and Engels, then, {{the ruling}} classes control the {{subordinate}} classes through {{domination of the}} ideas available in the culture.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{approach}} was producing enough {{energy in the}} resonators. As the electron passed the opening in the resonator they deposited some of their energy as radio waves, but only a small amount. To generate useful amounts of radio energy, the electrons either had to pass the resonators multiple times to deposit more energy in total, or huge electron currents had to be used. Single-chamber klystrons, like those being used at the time, had to go the latter route, and were difficult to make in a form with useful output given a reasonable input power.|$|E
25|$|Repetition {{involves}} expressing dissent about a topic/issue repeatedly {{at different}} points in time. This strategy is often used when an employee feels nothing is being done to correct the original articulated problem/issue and feel that the issue warrants being repeated. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> strategy is that repetition in a short period can be seen as destructive. Especially if the abbreviated time frame does not allow the supervisor enough time to respond. However, if repetition is used over an extended time period it may be considered active–constructive since it may serve as a reminder to the supervisor.|$|E

25|$|When the United States won its {{independence}} from Great Britain in 1783, one of its major concerns was having a European power on its western boundary, {{and the need for}} unrestricted access to the Mississippi River. As American settlers pushed west, they found that the Appalachian Mountains provided a barrier to shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship produce was to use a flatboat to float it down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to the port of New Orleans, from whence goods could be put on ocean-going vessels. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> route was that the Spanish owned both sides of the Mississippi below Natchez.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} romanization {{standards}} for writing Urdu with the Latin alphabet, {{though they are}} not very popular because most fall short of representing the Urdu language properly. Instead of standard romanization schemes, people on Internet, mobile phones and media often use a non-standard form of romanization which tries to mimic English orthography. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> kind of romanization {{is that it can}} only be read by native speakers, and even for them with great difficulty. Among standardized romanization schemes, the most accurate is ALA-LC romanization, which is also supported by National Language Authority. Other romanization schemes are often rejected because either they are unable to represent sounds in Urdu properly, or they often do not take regard of Urdu orthography, and favor pronunciation over orthography.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{sequence}} is in beat two: the grounded hind and foreleg are not diagonal pairs, but {{are on the}} same side of the horse (in this case, the outside). This means that the horse is balancing on only one side of its body, which is very difficult for the horse, making it hard to keep the animal balanced, rhythmical, and keeping impulsion. A horse that is cross-firing cannot perform to the best of its ability, and can even be dangerous (such as an unbalanced, cross-firing horse who must jump a huge, solid cross-country obstacle). Additionally, it makes for a very uncomfortable, awkward ride, producing a rolling movement often described as riding an eggbeater, which makes it difficult for the rider to perform to the best of his or her abilities.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the {{apparent}} incompatibility between moral responsibility and determinism, {{it is necessary to}} understand moral responsibility in terms of the function it plays within moral systems, which is highly similar to the role played by laws within judicial systems. By showing that a conception of moral responsibility based upon desert is metaphysically untenable, a function-based conception will be showed to be much more likely. Furthermore, by considering why the desert-based conception has proven so resilient, insight into the moral responsibility/determinism debate may be possible.

25|$|Another {{issue as}} regards mutual wills is the {{question}} of revocability. In Re Hobley Charles Aldous QC held that there could be either unilateral or mutual revocation provided it occurred during the lifetime of both testators. However, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> approach is that unilateral revocation is against the general principle of contract. Several explanations for this could be proffered. Firstly, there could be an implicit term that the agreement is revocable. Secondly, it could be conceptually viewed that the agreement takes on the revocable nature of the will to which it relates. Thirdly, as the doctrine is based on detrimental reliance, the agreement only concretized on the death of the other party. Fourthly, one could apply the unconscionability rationale that unjust enrichment could only be complete when one party takes a benefit under the will of the other party.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{version of}} the story is that the 18-pounders were on the lower deck, so it would take a very lucky drop to reach them from high above. Captain Pearson speculated that either a grenade had been thrown {{through a hole in the}} hull, from Bonhomme Richard’s gun deck, or that the charge had been ignited by accident. Whatever the cause, the effect was devastating. As the ignited charge blew up, it {{scattered}} burning gunpowder, setting off other charges nearby, and ultimately the chain reaction covered the entire rear half of Serapis’ lower gun-deck, killing or severely burning many of the gunnery crewmen, forcing some to leap into the sea to extinguish their burning clothes, and putting five guns out of action. In the confusion, some of the crew clambering back on board after jumping into the sea were nearly mistaken for American boarders.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> {{approach}} {{was that it}} was very difficult to focus the electron guns on the ridges without the signal bleeding over to the ridges on either side. This problem was compounded by the changing angle between the gun and the ridges as the signal progressed down the screen. Similar designs were attempted by a number of researchers, the best known being the Geer tube that used pyramid-shaped patterns with three guns arranged around the back. None of these systems could ever be made to work reliably, with focussing and alignment being continual problems. There is no documentary evidence that a successful version of the three-gun Telechrome tube was ever built, although images of Baird holding a prototype are widely duplicated. The prototype that usually appears is the two-gun tube. The two-gun tube actually had three necks. For this reason, people often mistake this tube for a three-gun prototype. In fact, the third neck is the original neck from the Hewittic envelope. This third neck holds not a gun, but instead, supports for the two-sided target. Burns published a typical photo of the two-gun, three-neck tube.|$|E
