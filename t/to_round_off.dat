Pat McKillop scored the first goal to put Zimbabwe ahead before Pat Davies, Linda Watson and Chase each added one more <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>off</b> a 4–0 victory. On 27 July, Zimbabwe and Czechoslovakia drew 2–2; McKillop and Chase scored. The next day, the Zimbabweans beat the Soviets 2–0, McKillop scoring both goals.

5|$|Barcelona begin {{start off}} {{the season with}} the {{traditional}} curtain raiser, the Supercopa de España, against Sevilla, losing the first leg 3–1 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. In the return leg at the Camp Nou, however, the team would win 4–0, thus claiming the Supercopa 5–3 on aggregate. In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona would endure a slow start to the campaign, despite a victory over Racing de Santander (3–0) on {{the opening day of}} the season; they would go on to be defeated 2–0 at the Camp Nou by newly promoted minnows Hércules. Nevertheless, Barça would recover and go on to magnificent 5–0 win over Real Madrid at home. In the Champions League semi-finals against Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, Lionel Messi scored two goals to ensure a 0–2 win for Barcelona, with the second leg at home ending in a 1–1 draw, sending Barça through to the Final to take on Manchester United. In the Copa del Rey Final at the Mestalla Stadium against Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo would convert a header on the 100th minute to win the Copa for Madrid, 1–0. Barça, however, would end up beating Manchester United 3–1 with goals from Pedro, Messi and David Villa to win them the Champions League for the fourth time in club history. Barcelona would also claim La Liga with 96 points to Real Madrid's 92 {{for the third time in}} a row <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>off</b> a very successful season.|$|E

25|$|As a cricketer {{he was a}} {{right-handed}} opening batsman and got {{few opportunities}} to represent Victoria {{because they had a}} prolific pair in Bill Woodfull and Bill Ponsford. In the four first-class matches that he was picked in, two of them in the Sheffield Shield, it was as a middle order batsman. He made the most of his chance in a match against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1926/27 when he scored 220 of Victoria's 552 first innings runs.

25|$|Born on 18 September 1892, Newstead Colliery, Nottinghamshire, Staples first {{played for}} Nottinghamshire in 1920. Though he {{accomplished}} {{a few good}} performances such as 6 for 81 against the great Surrey batting side at The Oval, it was though he had little sting, and although he obtained a permanent place in 1921 and took 76 wickets, there was still little to suggest a significant career. Although in 1922, Staples bowled very well at times (notably four quick wickets <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>off</b> a brilliant win over Yorkshire) and made 85 not out in a last wicket stand of 140 with Richmond, he did not establish {{a reputation as a}} major force in the game until 1923, when his bowling gave Yorkshire its only defeat in the Championship and he took almost 100 wickets.

Wright then took two wickets to set Essex back to 22 for 2, but Alastair Cook then followed his 117 not out against Worcestershire in the County Championship earlier on in the week. His 110-ball 94 – a career best List A score, improving his previous best by 32 runs – {{was part of a}} 168-run stand with Grant Flower, which took Essex to the brink, with 190 for 3.

25|$|Leicestershire {{prevailed in}} a match at Old Trafford where 726 runs were scored in four {{completed}} innings and Leicestershire's young bowler Stuart Broad and captain HD Ackerman starred. Leicestershire chose to bat {{after winning the}} toss, and were taken apart by Glen Chapple and Murali Kartik, who shared nine wickets, while the highest partnership for Leicestershire was worth 53. The lack of veteran bowler Dominic Cork {{did not seem to}} bother Lancashire unduly, as Chapple got five wickets for 22 runs and Kartik four for 43. Only Jon Maunders and HD Ackerman passed 20 for the visitors, and they were all out for 165. Lancashire accumulated runs slowly, and their score was 61 for 2 at the close of play on the first day. With Mal Loye out with an injury, Lancashire posted 191, Maunders taking four for 28 and Stuart Broad three for 57 to limit Lancashire's lead to 26 runs. An opening partnership of 63 saw Leicestershire take the lead, but spinners Murali Kartik and Andrew Symonds took two wickets each, while the three seamers Chapple, Sajid Mahmood and Anderson took one each <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>off</b> the day.

5000|$|Historically, {{the first}} {{parameter}} for {{the determination of}} fracture toughness in the elasto-plastic region was the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) or [...] "opening {{at the apex of}} the crack" [...] indicated.

He noted that, before the fracture happened, the walls of the crack were leaving and that the crack tip, after fracture, ranged from acute <b>to</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> due <b>to</b> plastic deformation. In addition, the rounding of the crack tip was more pronounced in steels with superior toughness.|$|R

At the same time it was suggested by a number of arguments accompanied by detailed numerical simulations that this singularity is <b>rounded</b> <b>off</b> by the rare region fluctuations of random potential, and that tuning the disorder past its critical value is not a genuine phase transition but rather a crossover.

500|$|In 1932 the {{conductor}} Sir Thomas Beecham had founded the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), which, with {{the backing of}} rich supporters, he ran until 1940, when finances dried up in wartime. Beecham left to conduct in Australia and then the US; the orchestra continued without him after reorganising itself as a self-governing body. On Beecham's return to England in September 1944 the LPO welcomed him back, and in October they gave a concert together that drew superlatives from the critics. Over the next months Beecham and the orchestra gave further concerts with considerable success, but the LPO players, now their own employers, declined to give him the unfettered control he had exercised in the 1930s. If he were to become chief conductor again it would be as a paid employee of the orchestra. Beecham responded, [...] "I emphatically refuse to be wagged by any orchestra ...

[...] In 1945 he conducted the first concert of Walter Legge's new Philharmonia Orchestra, but was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO.

500|$|Michael Westmore was {{responsible}} for taking Probert's designs for the Ferengi and creating the make-up for the actors to meet that design. In Probert's original concept, the Ferengi had ears which were pointed like a bat. There were concerns from the producers that these would appear simply to be larger versions of the already known Vulcan ears, and so Westmore was told <b>to</b> <b>round</b> <b>off</b> the ears {{when it came to}} producing the make-up. Other elements which were changed at the make-up stage included modifications to the nose to increase the volume of wrinkles and dropping the idea of an extended chin as Westmore thought it would save time in applying the make-up. A set of false upper teeth were also created, which were added to a single head piece and a nose piece which comprised the prosthetics for the Ferengi. Westmore was not pleased when a shot of an actor in costume was leaked without the teeth, he said [...] "I was annoyed about that photo because the make-up was incomplete. After all the work that went into it, we would have wanted our design in proper form. The photo was like a pirated version of our make-up, because none of us would ever approved it under those circumstances." [...] Michael Okuda designed a rank designation tattoo which Westmore applied to the right part of each Ferengi forehead. The symbol means [...] "Dog eat dog" [...] and was painted green as that is the colour of American dollar bills.
