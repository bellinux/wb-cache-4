5|$|Christianity is {{the largest}} {{religion}} within Birmingham, with 46.1% of residents identifying as Christians in the 2011 Census. The city's religious profile is highly diverse, however: outside London, Birmingham has the United Kingdom's largest Muslim, Sikh and Buddhist communities; its second largest Hindu community; and its seventh largest Jewish community. Between the 2001 and 2011 censuses, <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> Christians in Birmingham decreased from 59.1% to 46.1%, while <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> Muslims increased from 14.3% to 21.8% and <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> people with no religious affiliation increased from 12.4% to 19.3%. All other religions remained proportionately similar.|$|E
5|$|Quantification of <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> barbarian-born {{troops in}} the 4th-century army is highly speculative. Elton has {{undertaken}} the most {{detailed analysis of the}} meagre evidence. According to this analysis, {{about a quarter of the}} sample of army officers was barbarian-born in the period 350–400. Analysis by decade shows that this proportion did not increase over the period, or indeed in the early 5th century. The latter trend implies that <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> barbarians in the lower ranks was not much greater, otherwise <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> barbarian officers would have increased over time to reflect that.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{expansion}} {{in the number of}} positions available to women and other changes which aim to encourage increased female recruitment and retention, the growth in <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> female permanent defence personnel has been slow. In the 1989–1990 financial year women made up 11.4% of the ADF personnel. In the 2008–2009 financial year women occupied 13.5% of ADF positions. During the same period <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> civilian positions filled by women in the Australian Defence Organisation increased from 30.8% to 42.8%. As of 30 June 2016, women made up 15.5% of the ADF's permanent force and 16.6% of reservists. <b>The</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> women in the permanent force differs by service: 12.1% of members of the Army are female, compared to 19.1% of the RAN and 19.2% for the RAAF. In 2015 the ADF adopted targets to increase <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> service personnel who are female by 2023: by this time it is planned that women will make up 25% of the RAN, 15% of the Army and 25% of the RAAF.|$|E

40|$|Summary: Stem density, basal area, {{vegetation}} cover and vegetation surface area were compared as measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> plant species present in North Okarito Forest, South Westland, {{for use in}} determining bird preferences for plant species. In general, stem density estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> canopy species were about 10 times lower than basal area estimates. The converse was true for estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> sub-canopy and understorey species. <b>The</b> <b>proportions</b> estimated from {{vegetation cover}} and vegetation surface area were similar for most species, and were intermediate between <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> estimated from stem density and basal area. However, in the upper forest tiers, vegetation cover gave lower estimates for <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> canopy species and higher estimates for <b>the</b> <b>proportions</b> <b>of</b> sub-canopy species than given by vegetation surface area. These differences affect calculation of bird preferences for plant species. We recommend vegetation surface area {{as a measure of}} the proportional availability of plant species to birds because it is appropriate to most birds in New Zealand forests, is likely to be more accurate than visual estimates of vegetation cover, and can be measured on the same plots separately for trunks, branches, foliage, and fruit...|$|R

5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, Bratislava remained a multi-ethnic city, but with a different demographic trend. Due to Slovakization, <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> Slovaks and Czechs increased in the city, while <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> Germans and Hungarians fell. In 1938, 59% of population were Slovaks or Czechs, while Germans represented 22% and Hungarians 13% of the city's population. The creation of the first Slovak Republic in 1939 brought other changes, most notably the expulsion of many Czechs and the deportation or flight of the Jews during the Holocaust. In 1945, most of the Germans were evacuated. After the restoration of Czechoslovakia, the Beneš decrees (partly revoked in 1948) collectively punished ethnic German and Hungarian minorities by expropriation and deportation to Germany, Austria, and Hungary for their alleged collaborationism with Nazi Germany and Hungary against Czechoslovakia.|$|E

Early harvest could therefore be recommended for best control measures in storage facilities.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> bal maidens in the {{workforce}} fell steadily, the mining boom {{of the first half}} of the 19thcentury took the total number to between 4,000 and 14,400 by the 1840s. The 1841 Census (the first full census of England) shows 3,250 women working in the mines, but the mine returns of the same year show over 5,000 women in the tin, lead and copper mines of Cornwall and West Devon. Increased mechanisation of the ore dressing process and public concerns over subjecting women and children to the harsh working conditions of the mines meant that <b>the</b> <b>proportion</b> <b>of</b> bal maidens in {{the workforce}} continued to fall, and it is generally accepted that by 1850 between 15 and 20% of mine workers were female. By the 1861 census, coinciding with the peak of the Cornish mining industry, a minimum of 6,000 women were working in mining in Cornwall, at least 2,500 of whom worked within a five-mile radius of Camborne. Although employed primarily in copper and tin mines, bal maidens also worked in lead, zinc, manganese, iron, antimony, wolfram, and uranium mines, and in slate and china clay quarries.|$|E
