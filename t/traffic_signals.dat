40|$|Adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control, which adjusts <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> timing {{according}} to real-time traffic, {{has been shown}} to be an effective method to reduce traffic congestion. Available works on adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control make responsive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control decisions based on human-crafted features (e. g. vehicle queue length). However, human-crafted features are abstractions of raw traffic data (e. g., position and speed of vehicles), which ignore some useful traffic information and lead to suboptimal <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controls. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that automatically extracts all useful features (machine-crafted features) from raw real-time traffic data and learns the optimal policy for adaptive <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control. To improve algorithm stability, we adopt experience replay and target network mechanisms. Simulation results show that our algorithm reduces vehicle delay by up to 47 % and 86 % when compared to another two popular <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control algorithms, longest queue first algorithm and fixed time control algorithm, respectively.

5|$|The city {{expanded}} police protection, even temporarily having volunteer {{police officers}} to assist the three paid officers. Fire protection was expanded in 1882, with the city's first 13 paid firefighters. Former mayor Henry Vollmer accomplished several public works achievements, including large street paving and new sub-divisions being plotted. A large city budget surplus brought {{the creation of the}} Davenport City Hall. After 1900, each mayor brought new agendas for city improvement. Waldo Becker encouraged new railroads for the city. He also promised a more business-like government, in terms of financial responsibility and to depoliticize the police department. In the mid-1920s the city established the first zoning ordinances, electrical <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> and street lighting. The city also expanded with the incorporation of the city of Rockingham and the establishment of the Davenport Municipal Airport.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Emerald Drive interchange was scheduled for the year 1971.

Another contract for the portion from Grossmont Summit near Chase Avenue to Ballantyne Avenue was awarded for $2.7 million in November.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Transport for London {{suggested}} that pedestrianisation {{may not be}} a suitable long-term measure due to Crossrail reducing the demand for bus services along Oxford Street, and proposed to ban all traffic except buses and cycles during peak shopping times. Optimisation of existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> along the street, including Pedestrian Countdown signals, have also been proposed. Transport for London is concerned that in the long term traffic problems may affect trade on Oxford Street, which is now competing with shopping centres such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre. In 2015, while campaigning for election as London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan favoured the full pedestrianisation of Oxford Street, which was supported by other parties. After winning the election, he pledged the street would be completely pedestrianised by 2020, including a ban on buses and taxis.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> {{control is}} an {{integral}} part of the urban traffic control system, and providing effective real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control for a large complex traffic network is an extremely challenging distributed control problem. This paper adopts the multiagent system approach to develop distributed unsupervised <b>traffic</b> responsive <b>signal</b> control models, where each agent in the system is a local <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controller for one intersection in the traffic network. The first multiagent system is developed using hybrid computational intelligent techniques. Each agent employs a multistage online learning process to update and adapt its knowledge base and decision-making mechanism. The second multiagent system is developed by integrating the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation theorem in fuzzy neural networks (NN). The problem of real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control is especially challenging if the agents are used for an infinite horizon problem, where online learning has to take place continuously once the agent-based <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controllers are implemented into the traffic network. A comprehensive simulation model of a section of the Central Business District of Singapore has been developed using PARAMICS microscopic simulation program. Simulation results show that the hybrid multiagent system provides significant improvement in traffic conditions when evaluated against an existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control algorithm as well as the SPSA-NN-based multiagent system as the complexity of the simulation scenario increases. Using the hybrid NN-based multiagent system, the mean delay of each vehicle was reduced by 78 % and the mean stoppage time, by 85 % compared to the existing <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control algorithm. The promising results demonstrate the efficacy of the hybrid NN-based multiagent system in solving large-scale <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> control problems in a distributed manner.

5|$|Sensors {{activate}} audible sirens near each {{entrance of}} the tunnel if a vehicle above the posted height attempts to enter the tunnel. <b>Traffic</b> <b>signals</b> at that entrance will turn red, stopping all traffic. The entrance will remain closed until the vehicle {{is removed from the}} freeway, sometimes causing severe delays for all traffic. CDOT noted that prior to the retrofit, about 20,000 vehicles per year tripped the alarm. The trucking industry argued that many of these trucks were under the height requirement but tripped the alarm due to their air suspensions (which can be lowered during their journey through the tunnel) or due to snow and ice atop the trailer. During this time, the trucking industry estimated the number of alarms would drop by as much as 80% if the clearance could be raised even a few inches. Another feature of the retrofit monitors truck weightâ€”a safe speed for each truck on the 7% grades and curves just outside the tunnel is calculated and displayed for each driver.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{proposals}} to reduce congestion on Oxford Street. Horse-drawn vehicles were banned in 1931, and <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> were installed in the same year. To alleviate congestion and help traffic flow of buses, most of Oxford Street is designated a bus lane during peak daytime hours, when private vehicles are banned. It is only open to buses, taxis and two-wheeled vehicles between 7:00am and 7:00pm on all days except Sundays. The ban was introduced experimentally in June 1972. It was considered a success, with an estimated increase of Â£250,000 in retail sales. In 2009, a new diagonal crossing opened at Oxford Circus, allowing pedestrians to cross from one corner of Oxford Street to the opposite corner without having to cross the road twice or use the pedestrian underpass. This doubles the pedestrian capacity at the junction.|$|E

It immediately crosses I-81 at exit 310, a diamond interchange with two <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> on SR 37, and then becomes a freeway, soon junctioning US 11 (Valley Pike) with a partial cloverleaf. The next interchange is a diamond at Cedar Creek Grade (SR 622), and SR 37 reaches its approximate midpoint at US 50 (Northwestern Pike), another diamond. A trumpet interchange completed in 2001 connects to the Winchester Medical Center, and the final diamond is with US 522 (Frederick Pike) at the northwestern corner. SR 37 ends at a partial Y interchange with US 11 (Martinsburg Pike), at which SR 37 traffic can only access US 11 north and only traffic from US 11 south can access SR 37, although a northbound exit to Cives Lane was added in about 2000 to allow SR 37 traffic to access US 11 south. About 1/2 mile (1km) of US 11 is a divided highway, connecting SR 37 with I-81 at exit 317.|$|E

5|$|The mall {{also added}} new burdens to city services, with {{building}} inspectors {{having to work}} overtime to inspect each store area as it was completed. While mall security was issued citation books so they could issue parking tickets directly, the city police still had to work double shifts to cover the traffic during the mall's opening weekend. Overall, the mall increased traffic on the Earl Rudder Freeway, and city traffic engineers noted it would cause more traffic backup. <b>Traffic</b> <b>signals</b> {{were added to the}} mall's main entrance, while long-term plans were made to both expand the freeway and add additional interchanges along Harvey. Traffic studies were implemented to study the traffic after the mall's opening to developed additional plans to mitigate issues. There were concerns that the mall would be the final blow to the downtown area of neighboring city Bryan, Texas, which was already suffering reduced business after the opening of smaller Manor East Mall and the Townshire shopping center, both within Bryan. Bryan city officials noted an immediate decrease in revenue due to Sears moving from Bryan to College Station, taking $50â€“100,000 of sales taxes with it. However, as a whole the city was hopeful that the mall would have benefits to the city in the form of increased city growth as a whole. The city planners felt it would only be a passing fad for local rural and lower-income families, who would still return to downtown Bryan due to its proximity.|$|E
