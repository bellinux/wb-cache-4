The total force would number about 5,300. The 9th Division {{would be limited to}} taking 15 days' supplies. One of the lessons of <b>the</b> <b>Lae</b> <b>operation</b> was <b>the</b> need for a naval beach party to take soundings, mark the beaches and channels, and handle communications between ship and shore. US Navy doctrine held that these should be composed of personnel drawn from the attack transports, but none were involved in <b>the</b> <b>Lae</b> or Finschhafen <b>operations.</b> For Finschhafen, an eight-man Royal Australian Navy (RAN) Beach Party was organised under Lieutenant Commander J. M. Band.|$|R
25|$|Following the {{fighting}} around Roosevelt Ridge, the Allied advance on Salamaua continued. Mount Tambu was secured on 18 August, and {{operations in the}} area continued through the final week of August. The capture of Roosevelt Ridge enabled Allied artillery observers to control fires more effectively around Salamaua and {{in the days following}} they began shelling Tambu Bay heavily, while patrols were pushed forward of the ridge with a view to eventually clearing the Japanese from the Scout Ridge junction and pushing north of Roosevelt Ridge. Around the same time, the Allies launched a seaborne landing near Lae and an airborne landing at Nadzab as part of an <b>operation</b> to secure <b>Lae,</b> which Allied planners considered more important than Salamaua itself. Pressure had been maintained on Salamaua in an effort to try to draw reinforcements away from Lae; however, as <b>the</b> <b>Lae</b> <b>operation</b> developed, <b>the</b> Japanese moved about 5,000 to 6,000 troops away from Salamaua by sea, abandoning the badly bomb damaged town.|$|R

25|$|Operations in {{the area}} {{continued}} {{for the rest of}} August and into September as the Japanese fought to hold the Allied advance on their final defensive line in front of Salamaua. Nevertheless, the Francisco River was crossed in late August, and the main Japanese position around Charlie Hill was taken {{in the first week of}} September. The Allies also launched a seaborne landing near Lae and an airborne landing at Nadzab as part of an <b>operation</b> to secure <b>Lae,</b> which Allied planners considered more important than Salamaua. Pressure had been maintained on Salamaua in an effort to draw reinforcements away from <b>Lae</b> but as <b>the</b> <b>Lae</b> <b>operation</b> developed, <b>the</b> Japanese moved about 5,000 to 6,000 troops away from Salamaua by sea, abandoning the badly bomb damaged town. In early September, Major General Edward Milford's 5th Division headquarters took over from the 3rd Division and the Australians launched the final effort to secure Salamaua. Bad weather hampered their efforts but the airfield and vicinity were eventually secured on 11 September by Australian forces from the 15th and 29th Brigades, after a brief engagement with the Japanese rearguard. Australian losses in the campaign were 343 men killed and 1,083 wounded, and 8,100 Japanese casualties, 2,722 being killed.|$|R
25|$|Carson {{was head}} {{of a group of}} investors who {{purchased}} and operated two television stations. The first was KVVU-TV in Henderson, Nevada, an independent station serving Las Vegas, acquired by the Carson group in 1979. Shortly after buying the station, KVVU was rumored to be acquiring an NBC affiliation as then long-time affiliate KORK-TV {{was in the process of}} being replaced by KVBC (and now KSNV), but it never happened. Carson's second station, independent KNAT-TV in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was purchased in 1982. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>Las</b> Vegas <b>operation,</b> KNAT faced stiffer competition for top-quality, syndicated programming. Carson sold both of his stations between 1985 and 1986 with KVVU-TV (FOX 5) going to the James Meredith Corporation and KNAT being sold to Trinity Broadcasting Network.|$|R

50|$|The Mark IV {{monorail}} was {{a design}} model of straddle-type monorail trains. The design {{was developed by}} legendary Disney Imagineer Bob Gurr. Ten trains were built by Martin Marietta in 1969 {{at the cost of}} about $7 million USD each and they were used on the Walt Disney World Monorail System between 1971 and 1989 before they were replaced by the Mark VI monorail, although a few lasted until 1991. Sometime between 1991 and 1994 Monorail Coral and Lime (which had been introduced new in 1984) were sold for $3.5 million each, refurbished, and used to begin <b>the</b> <b>Las</b> Vegas Monorail <b>operations.</b> In 2004 Lime and Coral (now the MGM and Bally) were replaced by fully automated Bombardier MVI 4-car trains.|$|R

Instead, his CIA backers {{supplied}} him with a guerrilla regiment imported from Military Region 3 to the south. Landed on 28 February 1971, Groupement Mobile 31 (GM 31) was tasked with sweeping north from Skyline Ridge overlooking Long Tieng. They swept north toward the refugee center at Sam Thong. However, the operation's start was delayed by insubordination among the troops. Desertions began from Bataillon Guerrier 318 (BG 318) and Bataillon Guerrier 308 (BG 308) on 6 March. BG 318 refused its duties for two days until they were paid their overdue salaries. BG 308 retreated to Long Tieng with a bill of complaints. They were appeased by relief of their commanding officer and the elevation of his deputy. Only after those matters were settled did the guerrillas resume operations.|$|R
