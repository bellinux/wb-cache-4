25|$|The {{particular}} synthetic CDO {{that the}} SEC's 2010 fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1. Unlike {{many of the}} Abacus securities, 2007-AC1 did not have Goldman Sachs as a short seller, in fact, Goldman Sachs lost money on the deal. That position {{was taken by the}} customer (John Paulson) who hired Goldman to issue the security (according to the SEC's complaint). Paulson and his employees selected 90 BBB-rated mortgage bonds that they believed were most likely to lose value and so <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> to buy insurance for. Paulson and the manager of the CDO, ACA Management, worked on the portfolio of 90 bonds to be insured (ACA allegedly unaware of Paulson's short position), coming to an agreement in late February 2007. Paulson paid Goldman approximately US$15 million for its work in the deal. Paulson ultimately made a US$1 billion profit from the short investments, the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers. These were primarily IKB Deutsche Industriebank (US$150 million loss), and the investors and insurers of another US$900 million—ACA Financial Guaranty Corp, ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|Maus {{was born}} and raised in Austin, Minnesota. As a teenager, he listened mainly to Nirvana and Syd Barrett. In 1998, he began his {{undergraduate}} in music composition at the California Institute of the Arts, by which time he had formed an appreciation for experimental music, such as the work of Michael Pisaro, as well as Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music. When he befriended and began to work alongside classmate Ariel Pink (Ariel Rosenberg), he took a greater interest in pop music. The first time he heard Rosenberg play was at a concert put up by students from the visual arts department. He recalls thinking: [...] "You know, Okay, maybe I’m not going to do experimental music anymore, because I was ... doing all of these performances like [...] Feldman and [...] Cage. ... I left that aside and took up pop as <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>bet,</b> largely because of my encounter there with Ariel, and the early work he was doing." [...] After they became roommates, he recorded the material from his first album using a cassette multi-track recorder and an early 1990s synthesizer soundbank. He later completed his degree in experimental music composition in 2003.|$|E

He too was critical of the length, but called the game [...] "a traditional action game with a terrific gameplay system that encourages you to battle it out like there's no tomorrow." [...] GameSpy's Benjamin Turner scored it 3.5 out of 5. He was critical of the FMV footage, and concluded [...] "The Two Towers isn't the best action game you'll ever play, {{but it is the}} best action game based on The Lord of the Rings.

He had mixed feelings about the integration of film footage; [...] "the quality of these recreated scenes isn't always as good as it could be, thanks to some less than cutting edge rendering. That said, it's still a nice way of introducing a new scene." [...] His biggest criticism was that the game was too short, although he praised the [...] "DVD extras" [...] being linked to level progression.

60|$|The Child cried inconsolably, {{and grew}} hollow-eyed, knock-kneed, spindling, and corykilverty {{in many other}} respects. The Millionaire smiled and tapped his coffers confidently. The pick of {{the output of the}} French and German toymakers was rushed by special {{delivery}} to the mansion; but Rachel refused to be comforted. She was weeping for her rag child, and was for a high protective tariff against all foreign foolishness. Then doctors with the finest bedside manners and stop-watches were called in. One by one they chattered futilely about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites until their stop-watches showed that Bill Rendered was under the wire for show or place. Then, as men, they advised that the rag-doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning parent. The Child sniffed at therapeutics, chewed a thumb, and wailed for her Betsy. And all this time cablegrams were coming from Santa Claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us to show a true Christian spirit and let up on the pool-rooms and tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a welcome. Everywhere the spirit of Christmas was diffusing itself. The banks were refusing loans, the pawn-brokers had doubled their gang of helpers, people bumped your shins on the streets with red sleds, Thomas and Jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you waited on one foot, holly-wreaths of hospitality were hung in windows of the stores, they who had 'em were getting their furs. You hardly knew which was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>bet</b> in balls--three, high, moth, or snow. It was no time at which to lose the rag-doll or your heart.|$|E

You couldn't git by them. But when the boss is home there's a difference. Only, of course, him an' Chess keep their eyes peeled.

If you had luck you might pull thet stunt without throwin' a gun. But I reckon the best figgerin' would include dodgin' some lead an' leavin' at least Bland or Alloway dead behind you. I'm figgerin', of course, thet when they come home an' find out you're visitin' Kate frequent they'll jest naturally look fer results. Chess don't like you, fer no reason except you're swift on the draw--mebbe swifter 'n him. Thet's the hell of this gun-play business. No one can ever tell who's the swifter of two gunmen till they meet. Thet fact holds a fascination mebbe you'll learn some day. Bland would treat you civil onless there was reason not to, an' then I don't believe he'd invite himself to a meetin' with you. He'd set Chess or Rugg to put you out of the way.

Intravaginal electrical simulation increases urinary continence and improves SUI symptoms; percutaneous electrical simulation also improve SUI symptoms and likely improves QOL measures (SOR: a, systematic review). Magnetic simulation doesn't increase continence, has mixed effects on SUI symptoms, and produces no clinically meaningful improvement in QOL (SOR: B, heterogeneous RCTs with conflicting results).

40|$|The {{experience}} from five national environmental agreement schemes, all about energy efficiency in manufacturing industries, {{is discussed in}} relation to the potential for similar action at the European Community level. Agreements at the Community level could have significant advantages. But success at the national level depends on parameters that would be difficult to reproduce or substitute at the Community level, e. g. extensive administrative capacity, substantial political threats, large economic benefits, and/or the capacity to grant tax relief. To overcome such problems, and gain some of the advantages of Community action, one option would be to focus Community action on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>bets,</b> namely a few energy-intensive industries with good capacity for collective action. Another option would be the combination of Community action with national action. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This article will show that this really is not the case.
