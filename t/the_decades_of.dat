5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> {{political}} disappointments, the February Revolution {{offered the}} Finnish Social Democrats momentum for power; {{they held the}} absolute majority in the Parliament. The conservatives were alarmed by the continuous increase of the socialists' might since 1899, with the climax in 1917 without the offsetting control of Russian administration; the Social Democrats had to be halted before {{they were able to}} markedly alter the power structure.|$|E
5|$|Another treaty dealing {{the matters}} of the {{northern}} borders was the Treaty of Novgorod signed with Norway in 1326, which ended <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> the Norwegian-Novgorodian border skirmishes in Finnmark. Per the terms of this treaty, Norway relinquished all claims to the Kola Peninsula. However, the treaty {{did not address the}} situation with the Sami people paying tribute to both Norway and Novgorod, and the practice continued until 1602. While the 1326 treaty did not define the border in detail, it confirmed the 1323 border demarcation, which remained more or less unchanged for the next six hundred years, until 1920.|$|E

5|$|Fauré's major sets of piano {{works are}} {{thirteen}} nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed across <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> his career, and display {{the change in}} his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, {{by way of a}} turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, Thème et variations in C major, and Huit pièces brèves. For piano duet, Fauré composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil André Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{radioactive}} contamination from Rocky Flats came from three sources: a catastrophic fire in 1957, leaking barrels in an outdoor storage area in 1964-1968, and another less severe fire in 1969.

5|$|Persistent {{rumors of}} her {{possible}} escape circulated after her death, {{fueled by the}} fact that the location of her burial was unknown during <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> Communist rule. The mass grave near Yekaterinburg which held the remains of the Tsar, his wife, and three of their daughters was revealed in 1991, and the bodies of Alexei Nikolaevich and the remaining daughter—either Anastasia or her older sister Maria—were discovered in 2007. Her possible survival has been conclusively disproved. Forensic analysis and DNA testing confirmed that the remains are those of the imperial family, showing that all four grand duchesses were killed in 1918.|$|E

5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} empire into four regions, each {{ruled by a}} {{separate}} emperor, the Tetrarchy. Confident that he fixed the disorders that were plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire. During <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of Julian, who attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official religion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|I. C. Filitti {{was not in}} {{a celebratory}} mood as the National Liberals publicized their August 1916 Treaty, when Romania became part of the Entente. His diaries record not only his general frustration, but also his belief that <b>the</b> <b>decades</b> <b>of</b> PNL rule had left the {{military}} ill-prepared, and claims about generalized embezzlement within the Army. He was soon after drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, as officer of the Second Field Army, and stationed in Bucharest. When the German-led counteroffensive forced the army on the retreat, resulting in the Central Powers' occupation of southern Romania, Filitti took his most controversial decision. In circumstances that are largely unknown, he opted to stay behind in occupied territory, and greeted the enemy. According to Boia, Filitti received two contradictory orders: one to follow the Imperial Russian Army as liaison officer, the other to stay behind in Bucharest; he conveniently opted to follow the latter.|$|E
