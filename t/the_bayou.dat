5|$|Chance leads Natasha to {{his uncle}} Douvee's (Wilford Brimley) house deep in <b>the</b> <b>bayou,</b> and enlists his help in {{defeating}} the men.

5|$|In {{response}} to Andrew Jackson's plea for volunteers {{to fight the}} British in the War of 1812, James and Rezin enlisted in the Louisiana militia in late 1814. The Bowie brothers arrived in New Orleans too late {{to participate in the}} fighting. After mustering out of the militia, Bowie settled in Rapides Parish, where he supported himself by sawing planks and lumber and floating them down <b>the</b> <b>bayou</b> for sale. In June 1819, he joined the Long Expedition, an effort to liberate Texas from Spanish rule. The group encountered little resistance and, after capturing Nacogdoches, declared Texas an independent republic. The extent of Bowie's participation is unclear, but he returned to Louisiana before the invasion was repelled by Spanish troops.|$|E

5|$|The marsh {{rice rat}} {{is the primary}} host of <b>the</b> <b>Bayou</b> virus (BAYV), the second-most common agent of {{hantavirus}} infections in the United States. About 16% of animals are infected and the virus is most prevalent in old, heavy males. The virus may be transmitted among rice rats through bites inflicted during fights. It is also present in rice rat saliva and urine, and human infections may occur because of contact with these excreta. Two related hantaviruses, Catacama virus and Playa de Oro virus, are known from Oryzomys couesi in Honduras and western Mexico, respectively. An arenavirus normally associated with woodrats (Neotoma) has also been found in Florida marsh rice rats. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease in the United States, {{have been found in}} marsh rice rats in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Another pathogenic bacterium, Bartonella, is known from Georgia marsh rice rats.|$|E
5|$|When Allison {{first made}} landfall, heavy {{rainfall}} flooded numerous houses and businesses. Minor wind gusts caused minor roof damage to 10houses in Cameron Parish, while its storm surge flooded portions of Louisiana Highway 82. When the system returned, more rainfall occurred, flooding over 1,000houses in St. Tammany Parish, 80 houses in Saint Bernard Parish, {{and hundreds of}} houses elsewhere in the state. The flooding also forced 1,800residents from their homes in East Baton Rouge Parish. The deluge left numerous roads impassable, while runoff resulted in severe river flooding. The Bogue Falaya River in Covington crested past its peak twice to near-record levels. The Amite and Comite Rivers reached their highest levels since 1983. In addition, the levee along <b>the</b> <b>Bayou</b> Manchac broke, flooding roadways and more houses. Damage in Louisiana totaled to $65million (2001USD, $84million 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2001, advocates began {{lobbying}} for a Grammy category specifically for cajun and zydeco music.

Awards {{were presented to}} the engineers, mixers, and/or producers {{in addition to the}} performing artists. The group Pine Leaf Boys holds the record for the most nominations, with four. Though nominated each year the honor was presented, the group failed to receive an award. Doucet and Cedric Watson each received three nominations. 2009 marked the only year in which a musician received more than one nomination as well as the only time two artists were nominated for works appearing on the same album—Doucet was nominated as a member of BeauSoleil for Live at the 2008 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival as well as for his solo album From Now On, and Steve Riley and the Mamou Playboys were also nominated for their contribution to the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival compilation album.

5|$|The {{introduced}} snake Boa constrictor preys on O.couesi on Cozumel. Parasites {{recorded on}} O.couesi in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. The flea Polygenis odiosus {{was found on}} an Oryzomys couesi from Cozumel. Out of ten O.couesi in San Luis Potosí, five each were infected by the nematode worms Hassalstrongylus musculi and H.bocqueti, with about 25 worms per rat, and two were infected by one or two cestodes of the genus Raillietina. The mites Eubrachylaelaps circularis and Gigantolaelaps boneti have been found on Oryzomys couesi in Oaxaca, the sucking louse Hoplopleura oryzomydis in Nicaragua, the mites Laelaps oryzomydis, Echinonyssus microchelae, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Prolistrophorus frontalis, and Prolistrophorus bakeri in Colima, and the apicomplexan Eimeria couesii in Mexico. The species is infected by two hantaviruses—Catacamas virus in Honduras and Playa de Oro virus in western Mexico—which are related to <b>the</b> <b>Bayou</b> virus infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of hantavirus infections in the United States. No hantavirus infections in humans {{have been linked to}} O.couesi hantaviruses, however. Chiapas O.couesi easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses, including the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, suggesting that the species may serve as a reservoir for that virus.|$|E
5|$|Upon making {{landfall}} on Louisiana, Hurricane Florence produced {{higher than}} normal tides, including a peak observation of 7.5feet (2.3m) {{above mean sea level}} on <b>the</b> <b>Bayou</b> Benvenue to the east of New Orleans. Rainfall was relatively light, ranging from about 1inch (25mm) to a maximum of 4.05inches (103mm) at Watson. Winds of tropical storm force occurred across southeastern Louisiana, with wind gusts peaking at 64mph (103km/h) at an automatic Coast Guard Station on the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River Delta. An unofficial tornado was reported in Tangipahoa Parish. Minor storm surge flooding occurred outside of the levee system of southern Louisiana in Plaquemines, Saint Bernard, and Saint Tammany Parishes. On Grand Isle, strong wave action resulted in significant beach erosion, with most areas on the island losing about 40feet (12.2m) of beach. The storm surge also flooded a portion of Louisiana Highway 300 near Delacroix. The passage of the hurricane broke a levee in Delacroix; it was quickly repaired with flooding from the levee being pumped to the gulf. Light to moderate damage was reported across the southeastern portion of the state, primarily from falling trees. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving about 150,000people without power for some period of time during the storm. The power outages were short-lived, with about 6,900left without power by the day after the hurricane. Damage in the state was fairly minor, totaling about $2.5million (1988USD, $4.4million 2007USD).|$|E
