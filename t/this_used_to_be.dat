5|$|At {{midnight on}} 20 July 1947, the Dutch {{launched}} a major military offensive called Operatie Product, {{with the intent}} of conquering the Republic. Claiming violations of the Linggajati Agreement, the Dutch described the campaign as politionele acties ("police actions") to restore law and order. <b>This</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the task of the KNIL. However, at the time the majority of the Dutch troops in Indonesia belonged to the Royal Netherlands Army. Soon after the end of World War II, 25,000 volunteers (among them 5,000 marines) had been sent overseas. They were later followed by larger numbers of conscripts from the Netherlands. In the offensive, Dutch forces drove Republican troops out of parts of Sumatra, and East and West Java. The Republicans were confined to the Yogyakarta region of Java. To maintain their force in Java, now numbering 100,000 troops, the Dutch gained control of lucrative Sumatran plantations, and oil and coal installations, and in Java, control of all deep water ports.|$|E

25|$|The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) is an {{overnight}} loan facility {{that will provide}} funding to primary dealers {{in exchange for a}} specified range of eligible collateral and is intended to foster the functioning of financial markets more generally.

25|$|Another {{business}} model {{is to give}} away the software in order to sell hardware. <b>This</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as CP/M, Apple DOS and versions of Mac OS prior to 7.6 freely copyable (but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same architecture.|$|E
25|$|There {{are over}} 200 primary schools in Amsterdam. Some of these primary schools base their teachings on {{particular}} pedagogic theories like the various Montessori schools. The biggest Montessori {{high school in}} Amsterdam is the Montessori Lyceum Amsterdam. Many schools, however, are based on religion. <b>This</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> primarily Roman Catholicism and various Protestant denominations, but with the influx of Muslim immigrants {{there has been a}} {{rise in the number of}} Islamic schools.

25|$|Here, CR33 intersects {{and joins}} US 202 {{for a third}} of a mile before turning north. It crosses CR 94 in {{downtown}} Garnerville. In fact, <b>this</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the former eastern terminus of CR94, until it was extended beyond US 9W/US 202 in West Haverstraw. CR33 then proceeds into the town of Stony Point for the final mile and a half of its run. It intersects CR 98 and CR 100 before coming to an end at CR 106. It really would be impossible to extend CR33 further north as Bear Mountain State Park lies close to its northern terminus.|$|E

25|$|Managers – Many {{nurses who}} have worked in {{clinical}} settings {{for a long time}} choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS and independent care sector management. <b>This</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seen as a natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions; however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option. Nonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organisations and independent healthcare organisations, some even as board members or directors. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming regional managers, service managers, clinical nurse managers or Modern Matrons.|$|E
25|$|Cricket {{is played}} {{here in the}} winter months, and rugby and {{football}} in the monsoon months. <b>This</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> major centre for the erstwhile Bombay Pentangular cricket matches. The ground had the distinction of hosting India's first Test cricket match on 15 December 1933, captained by CK Nayudu. Temporary stands were put up at the ground to accommodate a record crowd of 50,000 people, with tickets selling at five times their usual price. The match is remembered for Lala Amarnaths century, noted {{to be one of}} the best innings played in Indian cricket. It hasn't hosted any senior matches since the Brabourne Stadium took its place in 1937, replacing the ground as the venue for the Bombay Pentangular as well as international matches.|$|E
25|$|The {{other side}} of the Grosvenor Bridge is the Roodee, Chester's race course and the oldest course in the country. <b>This</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the site of Chester's Roman harbour until, aided by the {{building}} of the weir, the River Dee silted up to become the size it is today. The only curiously remaining reminder of this site's maritime past is a stone cross which {{stands in the middle of}} the Roodee which exhibits the marks of water ripples. To the end of the Roodee the river is crossed by Chester's fourth bridge which carries the North Wales Coast railway line, before leaving Chester. This was the scene of one of the first serious railway accidents in the country, the Dee bridge disaster.|$|E

25|$|Chinanteca huipils are {{elaborate}} {{with the entire}} garment covered in woven and embroidered geometric designs in various colors, with the edges further decorated with ribbons. In Ojitlán, Oaxaca, Chinanteca women wear special huipils for their wedding, divided into three classes. The first is called “gala” or “red” {{which used to be}} the traditional wedding dress. However, because of its cost, few families can afford it. The second type is called “pavo” which is used for special occasions. It is similar to the first but with a less intense red and with smaller designs. The third type, called “pájaros y palomas” (birds and doves) is the most economical of the three and can be found fairly easily in markets. It is white with figures of birds and other animals in vivid and contrasting colors. <b>This</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reserved for women of middle age or older but it has since been adopted by many.|$|E

500|$|... "This Used to Be My Playground" [...] {{features}} a keyboard introduction, {{followed by the}} strings and the song starts. Musically, the song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time with a slow tempo of 77 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G minor with Madonna vocals ranging from the chords of G3 to B4. The song follows a basic sequence of Gm–F/G–Emaj7–Dm7–Gsus–G as its chord progression. The chords have an unexpected flow in terms of the beginning and the ending, moving from E down to Gm and momentarily to F major, then going back to the previous sequence again. The song has a lush, romantic quality, with the melody going through different ranges and peaks, and the verse and the chorus flow into each other, making it sound seamless. Madonna sings in subdued but expressive vocals, aided by the strings and background singers during the third verse. Towards the end the singer's voice is double tracked and produces little amount of roughness. Lyrically the song talks about Madonna revisiting the places from her childhood ("This used to be my playground / <b>This</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> my childhood dream"), and evokes the songwriting on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer (1989). The singer is in a dilemma between choosing the past and letting go, concluding that the latter is difficult ("Say goodbye to yesterday (the dream) / Those are words I'll never say (I'll never say))". The track has a sudden ending with the orchestra and the backing vocal uttering [...] "Wishing you were here with me", the line addressed to Madonna's mother.|$|E
