I asked him what made such a {{difference}} between him and all the other pups--they were pups, if you like. He told me it was very simple: they had only one father apiece; and he had three.|$|E

Rob Harvilla of The Village Voice stated that [...] "Russian Roulette"s composition, makes the song unpleasant for listening. Chris Richards of The Washington Post wrote that the song has [...] "plodding beat" [...] and [...] "forgettable hook" [...] and additionally criticized {{the ending of the}} song with a sound of gunshot; according to him <b>thats</b> <b>an</b> attempt to [...] "salvage its wasted potential".|$|E

Of course, theyre not able to have the full experience, and theyre kind of trying to force themselves to be able to play, but theyre making the effort. So I thought that if you turn off the monitor, both of you are just hearing the game. So after you finish the game, you can have an equal conversation about it with a blind person. <b>Thats</b> <b>an</b> inspiration behind this game as well.|$|E

Why are veterans at VA hospitals paying less for prescription drugs than people who are under Medicare Part D? <b>Thats</b> <b>an</b> area we should go after. Medicare fraud is getting out of control....I think we should have Medicare cover home health care. Look at the savings wed have if we covered home health care and tele-health services. Instead, people in rural areas have to go hospitals at the dead of the night. If we look at this holistically, we can cut the underlying costs.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Writing in UK daily {{newspaper}} The Guardian in November 2014, Gould said, [...] "My own career {{is a fairly}} equal division between solo work and orchestral leading (with Aurora and Britten Sinfonia), with as much jazz and chamber music as time allows. I love the balance. I get to play pretty much the entire repertoire for the instrument, from Beethoven trios to Mahler symphonies to recording with Radiohead. I’m constantly playing new repertoire and working with new colleagues. <b>Thats</b> <b>an</b> enormous privilege. It might mean feeling stressed at times for having multiple projects on the go simultaneously, but it means you never get that stagnant feeling of giving the umpteenth performance of the same concerto in a season. It makes {{it much easier to}} play in a way thats fresh, spontaneous and alive. If, as a performer, you enjoy what you are doing, then your audience will too." ...|$|E

5000|$|The stadium design {{received}} a mixed {{response from the}} media, with reviews ranging from [...] "magnificent" [...] to a [...] "bowl of blancmange". The design was promoted as example of [...] "sustainable development", but some architecture critics have questioned both its aesthetic value and suitability as a national icon - especially when compared to Beijing National Stadium. For example, Ellis Woodman, Building Designs architecture critic, said of the design: [...] "The principle of it being dismountable is most welcome... it demonstrates an obvious interest in establishing an economy of means and as such {{is the antithesis of}} the 2008 Olympic stadium in Beijing. But while <b>thats</b> <b>an</b> achievement, its not an architectural achievement. In design terms what were looking at is pretty underwhelming." [...] He went on to criticise the procurement and design processes - stating of the latter that it should have been subject to an architectural competition. This view was echoed by Tom Dyckhoff, The Timess architecture critic, who described the design as [...] "tragically underwhelming" [...] and commented that the [...] "architecture of the 2008 and 2012 Olympics will, in years to come, be seen by historians as a [...] "cunning indicator of the decline of the West {{and the rise of the}} East".Despite the criticism the Olympic Stadium was nominated for the 2012 Stirling Prize in architecture losing out to the Sainsbury Laboratory at the University of Cambridge.|$|E

[...] That paper, which follows, gives reasons from within our common recovery experience why I believe we in SA should not endorse or validate, even indirectly, same-sex or [...] "committed relationship" [...] sexualizing in SA."In the section titled [...] "The Great Same-Sex Controversy" [...] Roy goes on to explain how society was divided on the [...] "nature vs. nurture" [...] argument about homosexuality, [...] "Intense controversies rage about this issue in every area of modern life in highly polarized and publicized passion. It {{is one of the most}} explosive political issues of the day. Congress is divided. Religions and churches are divided. The Twelve Step program is divided. The same-sex culture itself is divided. The [...] "experts" [...] are divided. The point here is this: For SA to validate same-sex sexualizing in SA, even indirectly, would have us endorsing a highly controversial biological theory and political movement against our Tenth Tradition. If we validate same-sex sexualizing as normative for the sexaholic in recovery, and it turns out not to be normative, SA will have been promoting an untruth and doing a devilish disservice, supporting the problem instead of recovery. <b>Thats</b> <b>an</b> awesome responsibility were dealing with here—human lives!" ...|$|E
