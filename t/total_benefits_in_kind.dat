Providing <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> potentially distorts decisions and leads to a deadweight loss if recipients value the benefits less than a cost-equivalent cash transfer.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the distribution of}} the "social wage" <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> from welfare services, including the National Health Service, state education, social housing, and personal social services. The current Government has put a strong emphasis on improving public services and has begun to translate this into higher spending. Although most measures of poverty ignore the social wage, its inclusion is potentially very significant in monitoring the impact of government policies on the poorest households. The paper produces estimates {{of the value of the}} social wage for 1996 / 7 and 2000 / 01, using data from several large-scale household surveys, and makes comparisons with estimates from previous work going back to 1979. The results show that people in poorer households receive a greater share of <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> from welfare services than those in richer households and that this 'pro-poor' bias has been rising gradually over the long-term. Since 1996 / 7, spending on welfare services has grown faster than in the past and there has been a further incremental shift in favour of lower income groups across all the major services. These changes have reinforced the re-distributional effects of tax and benefit policies over the same period, though they have not prevented inequality from rising. social wage, <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> redistribution, inequality, welfare spending...|$|R
40|$|In Germany, {{individuals}} {{in need of}} long-term care receive support through benefits of the long-term care insurance. A central goal of the insurance is to support informal care provided by family members. Care recipients can choose between <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> (formal home care services) and <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> cash. From a budgetary perspective family care is a cost-saving alternative to formal home care and to stationary nursing care. However, the opportunity costs resulting from reduced labor supply of the carer are often overlooked. We focus on the labor supply decision of family carers and the incentives set by the long-term care insurance. We estimate a structural model of labor supply and the choice of benefits of family carers. We find that <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> have small positive effects on labor supply. Labor supply elasticities of cash benefits are larger and negative. If both types of benefits increase, negative labor supply effects are offset to a large extent...|$|R

In the studied period cash benefits increased more quickly than <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> It seems that together with an increase of the importance of wages — as a basis for compemsation national income for consumption will show a diminishing tendency. This is particularly reffered to <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> because their excessive increase may lead to the waste of funds (e. g. medicines) national income for consumption realized by enterprise has an influence on the staff stabilization and creates basis for more efficient labour. However, different financial possibilities of firms as well as the policy of extra charges from the national budget cause differences <b>in</b> this <b>kind</b> of <b>benefits.</b> They are mostly concentrated in mining industry, heavy industry and chemical industry. They are small in the light industry and food industry — the sphere of non-material production is almost overlooked.

Stillmore, it is absolutely essential for the modern society to make further economic, as well as cultural, progress. Hence, with the establishment and development of the capitalistic societies every national effort has been made to secure medical cares for the sake of maintenance of peoples health. Various kind of systems have been deviced and institutions provided, among which, however, the health insurance has been regarded as the most essential. In the health insurance system, cash benefits for medical care, when an insured has injured his health, are rare case. Direct supplies of medical cares or medicines are more common. This makes a characteristic feature of the health insurance as distinct from insurance <b>in</b> general. Cash <b>benefits</b> are principal <b>in</b> insurance in general <b>in</b> contrast to <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> <b>in</b> health insurance. In the theory of economics of insurance cash benefits are regarded as an essential feature of insurance system in the modern capitalistic society. Cash <b>benefits</b> <b>in</b> the health insurance, a violation to the theory, tell a substantial difference between the health insurance and other categories of insurance.
