50|$|The {{device is}} then placed into a docking station where {{it begins to}} {{recharge}} its battery and awaits transfer of the data it has gathered. The docking station employs a <b>transistor-transistor-logic</b> to Universal Serial Bus (TTL-to-USB) converter module. This is used to send the data to a laptop computer using software developed by PNNL. Once the serial port has been set to 921.6 kbps, 8 data bits, 1 start bit, 1 stop bit, and no parity, transfer can take place. The software can also convert the raw, binary data file into CSV spreadsheet data (comma separated). This enables scientists to plot the data.|$|E
5000|$|Bernard A Yurash (February 17, 1921 - January 25, 2007) was a {{significant}} contributor {{to the creation of}} the first commercially viable CMOS integrated circuits by finding the sources of mobile sodium ions coming from the manufacturing process. Today, virtually all digital electronics use CMOS circuitry. Bernard worked at Fairchild Semiconductor in Silicon Valley from 1958 ( [...] he was employee number 158 [...] ), through the buyouts of the company by Schlumberger and National Semiconductor, and finally retiring in 1990. In the 1960s Fairchild Semiconductor, a division of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corp., and Texas Instruments, revolutionized electronics by employing the first integrated circuit technology. Fairchild's Robert Noyce [...] filed for this patent using deposited (printed) metal lines and Jean Hoerni's Planar Process ( [...] patent also filed by Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments but with using bonding wires [...] ). At the time virtually all the devices were of the bipolar type which were used to construct RTL and DTL type circuits ( [...] Resistor-Transistor-Logic, Diode-Transistor-Logic), which unfortunately drew more power than was desired, and eventually lost ground to Texas Instruments' TTL (<b>Transistor-Transistor-logic).</b> The next great technological leap in computer chips would be CMOS transistors, which promised significantly lower power and greater circuit density than the Bipolar circuitry. Although Frank Wanlass first filed for the CMOS patent in 1963, Fairchild could not produce the devices for commercial output for many years because of the mystery of the mobile ions degrading their performance. Much research time and money was expended in 1967 and 1968 at Fairchild on trying to manufacture the highly promising technology, the MOS SGT ( [...] Metal Oxide Semiconductor Silicon Gate Technology [...] ) circuits utilizing the field effect from the [...] "gate" [...] on the conducting [...] "channel" [...] from source to drain.|$|E
30|$|Each camera {{comprises}} a CMOS {{image sensor}} that triggers an LED flash unit using a dedicated flash sync pulse. The image sensor generates <b>Transistor-Transistor-Logic</b> (TTL) timing signals and drives a video bus while it accepts a clock, an I 2 C serial control bus and a TTL camera reset signal. The cameras {{are connected to}} the video concentrator with a high integrity bidirectional LVDS link which carries the video bus and the timing signals towards the concentrator and carries the camera reset and control bus towards the cameras. TTL to LVDS transceivers at both ends, perform the conversion in both directions.|$|E
40|$|Cyclic {{temperature}} and low temperature operating life tests, and pre-/post-life device evaluations {{were used to}} determine the degrading effects of thermal environments on microcircuit reliability. Low power <b>transistor-transistor-logic</b> gates and linear devices were included in each test group. Device metallization systems included aluminum metallization/aluminum wire, aluminum metallization/gold wire, and gold metallization/gold wire. Fewer than 2 % electrical failures were observed during the cyclic and low temperature life tests and the post-life evaluations revealed approximately 2 % bond pull failures. Reconstruction of aluminum die metallization was observed in all devices and the severity of the reconstruction appeared to be directly related to the magnitude of the temperature excursion. All types of bonds except the gold/gold bonds were weakened by exposure to repeated cyclic temperature stress...|$|E
40|$|An {{electronic}} device using <b>transistor-transistor-logic</b> integrated circuits as primary building blocks {{was designed and}} constructed to accumulate counts for eight classtypes. Selection of the classtypes is provided for by three encoders, X, Y, and Z. Using these encoders allows selection of memory counters for accumulations of 0 to 99 counts per classtype. Making X, Y, and Z the input equivalents of three genes permitted direct tallying and accumulation of totals of individual phenotypes for recombinant progeny containing three scorable genes. The use of the device as a simple one-of-four colony counter is described. Use of the instrument for obtaining counts of multiply characterized colonies was possible. In all tested instances, tedium and the labor of obtaining differential counts was reduced by more than fourfold with a great increase in accuracy of count accumulations. Complete information is provided for the fabrication of the instrument for use in individual laboratories...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} and explored an external automatic tuning/matching (eATM) robot {{that can be}} attached to commercial and/or home-built magic angle spinning (MAS) or static nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probeheads. Complete synchronization and automation with Bruker and Tecmag spectrometers is ensured via <b>transistor-transistor-logic</b> (TTL) signals. The eATM robot enables an automated "on-the-fly" re-calibration of the radio frequency (rf) carrier frequency, which is beneficial whenever tuning/matching of the resonance circuit is required, e. g. variable temperature (VT) NMR, spin-echo mapping (variable offset cumulative spectroscopy, VOCS) and/or in situ NMR experiments of batteries. This allows {{a significant increase in}} efficiency for NMR experiments outside regular working hours (e. g. overnight) and, furthermore, enables measurements of quadrupolar nuclei which would not be possible in reasonable timeframes due to excessively large spectral widths. Additionally, different tuning/matching capacitor (and/or coil) settings for desired frequencies (e. g. $^{ 7 }$Li and $^{ 31 }$P at 117 and 122 MHz, respectively, at 7. 05 T) can be saved and made directly accessible before automatic tuning/matching, thus enabling automated measurements of multiple nuclei for one sample with no manual adjustment required by the user. We have applied this new eATM approach in static and MAS spin-echo mapping NMR experiments in different magnetic fields on four energy storage materials, namely: (1) paramagnetic $^{ 7 }$Li and $^{ 31 }$P MAS NMR (without manual recalibration) of the Li-ion battery cathode material LiFePO$_{ 4 }$; (2) paramagnetic $^{ 17 }$O VT-NMR of the solid oxide fuel cell cathode material La$_{ 2 }$NiO$_{ 4 +δ}$; (3) broadband $^{ 93 }$Nb static NMR of the Li-ion battery material BNb$_{ 2 }$O$_{ 5 }$; and (4) broadband static $^{ 127 }$I NMR of a potential Li-air battery product LiIO$_{ 3 }$. In each case, insight into local atomic structure and dynamics arises primarily from the highly broadened (1 - 25 MHz) NMR lineshapes that the eATM robot is uniquely suited to collect. These new developments in automation of NMR experiments are likely to advance the application of in and ex situ NMR investigations to an ever-increasing range of energy storage materials and systems.
