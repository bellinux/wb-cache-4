The sensory profiles differentiated clover honey (light, fruity and floral flavor with low intensity) from eucalyptus honey (more intense flavors, vegetable notes, aromatic, warm, small crystals with a high tendency to quick crystallization in mass). The analysis by principal components showed higher intensities of sweetness and smell for eucalyptus honeys and graininess for clover honeys.

Here we review the reported incidence of IAN injury after orthognathic surgery and assess recently reported methods for evaluating sensory disturbances. A search was conducted of the English-language scientific literature published between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 2013 using the Limo KU Leuven search platform. Information on various aspects of assessing IAN injury was extracted from 61 reports. In 16 reports (26 %), the incidence of injury was not indicated. Preoperative IAN status was not assessed in 22 reports (36 %). The IAN assessor was described in detail in 21 reports (34 %), while information on the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assessors</b> was mentioned in only two reports (3 %). Subjective evaluation {{was the most common}} method for assessing neurosensory deficit.

40|$|In sensory {{analysis}} a panel <b>of</b> <b>trained</b> <b>assessors</b> evaluates {{a set of}} samples according to specific sensory descriptors.

Monitoring panel performance is then crucial for optimal sensory evaluations. The quality of the results is strongly dependent on the performance <b>of</b> each <b>assessor</b> and <b>of</b> the panel as a whole. The present work proposes to analyze the panel performance within single sensory evaluations and between consecutive evaluations. The basic idea is to use multi-way models to handle the three-way nature of the sensory data. Specifically, a PARAFAC model is used to investigate the panel performance in the single experiment. N-PLS model is used to test the predictive ability of the panel on each experiment. A PARAFAC model is also used for monitoring panel performance over different experiments...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Deficiencies in {{teamwork}} {{skills have}} been shown to contribute to the occurrence of adverse events during surgery. Consequently, several teamwork assessment tools have been developed to evaluate trainee nontechnical performance. This paper aims to provide an overview of these instruments and review the validity of each tool. Furthermore, the present paper aims to review the deficiencies surrounding training and propose several recommendations to address these issues. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify teamwork assessment tools using MEDLINE (1946 to August 2015), EMBASE (1974 to August 2015), and PsycINFO (1806 to August 2015) databases. Results. Eight assessment tools which encompass aspects of teamwork were identified. The Nontechnical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS) assessment was found to possess the highest level of validity from a variety of sources; reliability and acceptability have also been established for this tool. Conclusions. Deficits in current surgical training pathways have prompted several recommendations to meet the evolving requirements of surgeons. Recommendations from the current paper include integration of teamwork training and assessment into medical school curricula, standardised formal <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> to ensure accurate evaluation of nontechnical skill acquisition, and integration of concurrent technical and nontechnical skills training throughout training...|$|E
40|$|With {{the number}} of patient attendances increasing, {{we need to address}} the {{challenges}} facing the emergency care workforce, particularly how the system can survive the shortage of doctors. It is a strategic priority for Health Education England (HEE) to ensure an emergency care workforce with the right numbers, skills and behaviours, that can respond to the changing patterns of service. Possible solutions include raising {{the number of}} trainees, introducing the role of physician???s associate and developing the role of advanced practitioners. These are experienced professionals with expert, evidence-based knowledge who can make complex clinical decisions for patients presenting {{with a wide range of}} life-threatening and self-limiting pathologies. However, professional and regulatory bodies have debated how safe standards of advanced practice should be developed and how staff are prepared for the role for more than three decades. Under the recently introduced Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) credentialing scheme, practitioners each complete an e-portfolio, provide evidence of at least 20 consultant assessments to a <b>trained</b> panel <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> and complete a recognised life-support course. If successful, they receive a certificate and are listed on an RCEM register. The RCN has endorsed the emergency care ACP curriculum, co-produced by RCEM and HEE, while preparing to launch its own credentialing scheme for advanced nurse practitioners this month. The standardisation of advanced practice in emergency care nationally is welcome, but it will be taken up only if it is recognised by employers across the country...|$|R

Participants performed three replicated tests with each pair of drinks, except the groups <b>of</b> 9 <b>assessors</b> who performed six replicated tests. When testing for difference, large inter-groups differences were observed. One consumer group and one trained group from two different laboratories failed by far to reach the critical number of correct responses leading to demonstrate a significant difference between products. For similarity test, all consumer groups demonstrated a significant similarity whereas two qualified groups and one trained group did not. This is explained by a slightly higher level of performance for qualified and trained assessors compared to consumers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

One of the most frequently used violence {{risk assessment}} tools in this specific context is called the Brief Spousal Assault Form for the Evaluation of Risk (B-SAFER), which focuses on intimate partner violence (IPV). The present study examines B-SAFER assessments conducted by police employees, related protective actions and repeat IPV crimes in order to study: 1) to what extent risk- and victim vulnerability factors in the B-SAFER predicted global risk assessments, 2) the predictive accuracy of each B-SAFER item and the global risk assessments with regard to repeat IPV, 3) to what extent recommended protective actions were implemented and 4) the preventive effect of the implemented protective actions on repeat IPV. There were a large number of missing cases in the assessments and the risk and victim vulnerability factors only contributed to the global risk assessments to a minor extent. The predictive validity was low overall, few protective actions were implemented and those which were actually implemented did not appear to prevent repeat IPV.

40|$|Background/Aims: Large {{clinical}} trials including patients with uncommon diseases involve assessors in different geographical locations, resulting in considerable inter-rater variability in assessment scores. As video recordings of examinations, {{which can be}} individually rated, may eliminate such variability, we measured the agreement between a single video rater and multiple examining physicians {{in the context of}} PRION- 1, a clinical trial of the antimalarial drug quinacrine in human prion diseases. Methods: We analysed a 43 -component neurocognitive assessment battery, on 101 patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, focusing on the correlation and agreement between examining physicians and a single video rater. Results: In total, 335 videos of examinations of 101 patients who were video-recorded over the 4 -year trial period were assessed. For neurocognitive examination, inter-observer concordance was generally excellent. Highly visual neurological examination domains (e. g. finger-nose-finger assessment of ataxia) had good inter-rater correlation, whereas those dependent on non-visual clues (e. g. power or reflexes) correlated poorly. Some non-visual neurological domains were surprisingly concordant, such as limb muscle tone. Conclusion: Cognitive assessments and selected neurological domains can be practically and accurately recorded in a clinical trial using video rating. Video recording of examinations is a valuable addition to any trial provided appropriate selection of assessment instruments is used and rigorous <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> is undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Because it is unclear, theoretically, if the {{compensation}} of public employees {{is based on}} performance, this study empirically examines the various factors underlying tax assessor pay. As neoclassical theory suggests, performance, as measured by assess-ment uniformity, is found to positively affect tax assessor pay. In particular, a 10 % increase in assessment uniformity is shown {{to result in a}} 1. 7 %- 2. 3 % increase in tax assessor pay, ceteris paribus. While often criticized on efficiency and equity grounds, the property tax remains a major source of revenues for local governments in the United States, amounting to 26 % of all local revenues in 1991 (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1993, 293). Property tax revenues are particularly important in the northeastern states, especially in Connecticut, where property taxes normally comprise nearly 65 % of all local revenues (Connecticut Public Expenditure Foundation 1993). Critical to the economic success of a property tax revenue system is the uniform assessment of real estate property values by the local tax assessor. Inconsistent assessments of property values cause horizontal and vertical inequities and sometimes result in unwanted and time-consuming assessment review hearings. More-over, as Schroeder and Sjoquist (1976) note, &dquo;knowledge that a neighbor’s house is assessed at only half the rate of your house does not engender support for the property tax&dquo; (p. 221).

40|$|Workplace based {{assessment}} (WPBA) {{was introduced}} into clinical radiology training in 2010. The {{purpose of the}} study was to investigate its implementation by addressing research questions concerning the assessments’ day-to-day realisation, the participants’ influence upon their enactment, and the utility of the process. The prior history of the introduction of WPBA into postgraduate medical training and the Royal College of Radiologists’ guidance regarding the assessments’ usage served as reference points for the study findings. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 20 radiologists (12 trainers, 8 trainees) in order to discover their opinions of the implementation and usage of WPBA in radiology. The interview data were subjected to thematic analysis in order to identify issues of importance to interviewees, address the research questions and suggest any means of improving the assessments. The analysis showed that most interviewees thought that WPBA had a formative purpose, as per central guidance, although some assessors felt it could be used summatively in certain circumstances. The day to day realisation of the assessments was subject to some variation, and although this might be seen as inevitable due to differing circumstances, there was evidence of both trainees and trainers manipulating the process to suit their own purposes. There was also evidence of some trainers frankly adapting the assessments’ usage depending upon trainees’ seniority or time in an attachment. Interviewees described various weaknesses of the process, including the peremptory nature of some assessments, failure to identify underperforming trainees and poor assessor preparedness when WPBA was introduced. Reference to published literature from other postgraduate medical specialties showed that many of these problems were generic in nature, rather than confined to radiology. Suggested means by which WPBA could be improved included joint trainee and trainer leadership of the process, better <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> and refinement of the assessments themselves. ...|$|E

Animal-based measures, {{identified}} {{on the basis}} of scientific evidence, can be used effectively in the evaluationof the welfare of on-farm pigs in relation to laws, codes of practice, quality assurance schemes and management. Some of these measures are also appropriate for ante-mortem inspection and there are additional post-mortemanimal-based measures which can be taken at the slaughterhouse. Non-animal-based measures can be used whenthe association between them and the welfare outcome is strong and when they are more efficient than animalbasedmeasures as a means to safeguard welfare. Both animal-based and non-animal-based measures can beuseful predictors of welfare in pigs. In order to assess welfare, a wide range of measures is needed. However, toassess aspects of welfare it is unnecessary to use all animal-based measures on every occasion. The choice ofanimal-based measures will depend upon the specific objectives of the assessment. The full list is comparable toa ‘toolbox’, from which the appropriate range of measures can be selected. The Welfare Quality® protocolprovides information on the majority of the welfare outcomes of the main hazards identified in the EFSAScientific Opinions but not those where time limitation prevents it. There are currently insufficient animal-basedmeasures to use as welfare outcome indicators on-farm or in the slaughterhouse to assess the issues of pain,frustration and other positive and negative emotional states.

With emerging new treatment modalities such a tool {{has become increasingly}} essential for both clinical practice and therapeutic trials to reproducibly quantify change in disease state. Objective To develop and validate a paediatric vasculitis activity assessment tool based on modification of the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVASv. 3). Methods A paediatric vasculitis registry was reviewed to identify clinical features missing in the BVASv. 3. A modified nominal group technique was used to develop a working version of the Paediatric Vasculitis Activity Score (PVAS). Prospective validation provided tool reliability, reproducibility and responsiveness to change. <b>Training</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> was done according to the BVAS principles. Results BVAS items were redefined (n= 22) and eight paediatric items added in Cutaneous (n= 4), Cardiovascular (n= 3) and Abdominal (n= 1) sections. The final PVAS has 64 active items in nine categories. The principles of new/worse and persistently active disease were retained as were the overall score and weighting of categories. The median PVAS in 63 children with systemic vasculitis was 4 / 63 (0 - 38 / 63). There was a high interobserver agreement for the overall {{as well as for}} subsystem scores (linear-weighted-? = 0. 87). PVAS correlated with physician's global assessment (p< 0. 01); treatment decision (p=< 0. 01) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (p= 0. 01). In response to treatment, 15 / 19 patients assessed demonstrated a significant fall in PVAS (p= 0. 002), with good agreement among assessors for this change. Conclusions The PVAS validity in children with systemic vasculitis was demonstrated. Like the BVAS, we anticipate that the PVAS will provide a robust tool to objectively define disease activity for clinical trials and future research...|$|E

The model consists of five rigid segments (head, thorax, pelvis, shoulder line, spine) and includes {{a detailed analysis of}} spinal segmental movements. Within and between session reliability during gait was tested in 10 children with spastic diplegia (6 - 14 yrs). Reliability of discrete parameters was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and similarity of thorax and pelvis waveforms with the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC). Measurement errors were calculated for all parameters (SEM, σ). Results indicated acceptable within and between session reliability of discrete parameters for thorax, pelvis, shoulder line, angle of kyphosis and the majority of the spinal segmental angles, reflected by low SEMs (0. 60. Within and between session waveform errors were below 4 °. CMCs ranged from poor to very good, with highest values for movements in the frontal and transversal planes. The angle of lordosis showed lower between session reliability for several discrete parameters, although waveform errors were still below 5 °. Head parameters showed lower overall reliability.

40|$|Background to {{the study}} The role <b>of</b> the <b>assessor</b> is ‘to {{reliably}} determine the competencies or lack of competencies of an individual when assessed against a prescribed benchmark’. (Van Berkel, 1996, p. 8) Since the training and workplace reforms of the early 1980 s the development and recognition of competency standards for work have been {{an integral part of}} the vocational education and training landscape. An important part of the process of competency attainment has become the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> workplace <b>assessors</b> who are able to assess competence on site and as a part of their normal work. This <b>training</b> involves completion <b>of</b> the Workplace <b>Assessor</b> component <b>of</b> the endorsed <b>training</b> package, the Certificate IV in Assessment and Workplace Training. This program covers three units of competency: Planning Assessment; Conducting Assessment; and Reviewing Assessment. The mining industry in Queensland has readily embraced the qualifications framework and competency-based standards, and already has a significant history of ensuring the workforce has the appropriate skills and knowledge. Several hundred people have undertaken the workplace assessor program. However, early in 2002 The Queensland Mining Industry Training Advisory Body (QMITAB) was advised by members of its constituency of concerns about the efficacy of the program. The commissioning of this study was timely indeed. Competency-based assessment has been an extensively debated issue in the vocational education and training literature since the early 1990 s. Docking (1998) in a review of literature up to that date concluded that there was an urgent need to undertake further research into the effectiveness of competency-based assessment. Furthermore, Robinson (1998) stated that that the fundamental question as to whether assessor training programs were producing competent assessors was unanswered. Subsequently Smith (2000) found in an extensive review of general assessment practice in Queensland that there was a need to improve the quality of assessment in terms of validity, consistency, usefulness and cost effectiveness. Similarly, Clayton, Booth and Roy (2001) suggested that confidence in assessment decision-making needs to be improved.

40|$|Animal-based measures, {{identified}} {{on the basis}} of scientific evidence, can be used effectively in the evaluation of the welfare of on-farm pigs in relation to laws, codes of practice, quality assurance schemes and management. Some of these measures are also appropriate for ante-mortem inspection and there are additional post-mortem animal-based measures which can be taken at the slaughterhouse. Non-animal-based measures can be used when the association between them and the welfare outcome is strong and when they are more efficient than animalbased measures as a means to safeguard welfare. Both animal-based and non-animal-based measures can be useful predictors of welfare in pigs. In order to assess welfare, a wide range of measures is needed. However, to assess aspects of welfare it is unnecessary to use all animal-based measures on every occasion. The choice of animal-based measures will depend upon the specific objectives of the assessment. The full list is comparable to a ‘toolbox’, from which the appropriate range of measures can be selected. The Welfare Quality® protocol provides information on the majority of the welfare outcomes of the main hazards identified in the EFSA Scientific Opinions but not those where time limitation prevents it. There are currently insufficient animal-based measures to use as welfare outcome indicators on-farm or in the slaughterhouse to assess the issues of pain, frustration and other positive and negative emotional states. The extent to which short-term management can prevent the negative effects of hazards arising from genetic selection, and of most housing-related problems, is extremely limited. Herd monitoring and surveillance programmes should be implemented within the pig industry using a range of appropriate animal-based measures to document welfare changes over time. There should be both initial and ongoing <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> to ensure valid and reliable welfare measurement...|$|E
40|$|Assessment centres are {{generally}} viewed as systems for accurately and comprehensively evaluating {{the performance of}} candidates in relation to several job-relevant dimensions. Put simply, they are construed as machines for measuring 148 potential performance. As a consequence, the literature on assessment centres is dominated by research on their psychometric properties, particularly their construct validity (Jones & Born, 2008; Kolk, Born, & van der Flier, 2002; Lance, Foster, Nemeth, Gentry, & Drollinger, 2007; Schultz, Konig, Hubner, & Stempfle, 2008) and predictive validity (Dilchert & Ones, 2009; Gaugler, Rosenthal, Thornton, & Bentson, 1987; Meriac, Hoffman, Woehr, & Fleisher, 2008). Furthermore, suggestions for improving the performance of assessment centres typically focus on measurement issues, such as improving the <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> {{so that they are}} better able to focus on candidate performance in relation to dimensions (e. g. Krause and Thornton(2009)). As well as being measurement “machines” assessment centres can also be construed as complex social-administrative systems. Examples of the social processes involved in assessment centres are assessors meeting with, and talking to, candidates when these candidates are not performing in exercises; and assessors talking informally to each other about candidates. Examples of administrative issues are finding and booking appropriate in which to assess candidates, and ensuring that exercises start and end on time. Currently {{little is known about the}} nature of these social and administrative processes, including the extent to which they may be dysfunctional and undermine the validity of assessment centres, and the frequency with which they occur. The purpose of this research is to investigate the perceived nature of social and administrative processes and events in assessment centres, focussing in particular on those processes and events which are likely to undermine the effectiveness and fairness of the centres. Because operational assessment centres involve people playing different roles, this issue was investigated by surveying the social-administrative issues in assessment centres from several perspectives: assessment centre designers, administrators, assessors, consensus meeting chairs, and candidates...|$|E
40|$|The {{predictive}} {{influence of}} assessor individual differences on rating errors and accuracy was evaluated {{in a field}} study of assessment centers. Rater errors were based on archival data containing over 20, 000 assessments of candidates for assembly line positions. Cronbach 2 ̆ 7 s four components of rater accuracy were determined by providing assessors with behavioral performance data for candidates who had previously performed in an assessment center. ^ Rater errors {{are assumed to be}} relatively stable rating characteristics. Rater errors investigated were halo error, range restriction, and leniency. Individual differences in ability and motivation were expected to predict rating biases. An interaction model combining assessor ability and motivation was utilized to predict rating accuracy. ^ Eighty-two assessors were measured on five scales: attributional complexity, conscientiousness, intelligence, need to evaluate, and self-monitoring. Assessors were provided with dimensional ratings for 12 candidates. Ratings were then compared to known true scores to determine accuracy. ^ It was hypothesized that assessors with higher levels of ability and motivation would make fewer rating errors. Regression analyses indicated attributionally complex assessors showed less range restriction. More intelligent assessors gave more lenient ratings. Halo error decreased as assessors 2 ̆ 7 experience increased. ^ For rating accuracy, it was hypothesized that higher levels of ability and motivation would interact to predict greater rating accuracy. Moderate support was found for the ability x motivation interactions in predicting accuracy. Regression analyses revealed a mixed pattern of significant interactions. Need to evaluate seems {{to play an important role}} in rating accuracy and appeared in four of the five significant interactions. For less attributionally complex assessors with a higher need to evaluate, greater elevation, differential, and stereotype accuracy were found. More intelligent assessors with higher levels of need to evaluate showed an increase in differential accuracy. ^ Further studies are required to better understand the role of need to evaluate in rating accuracy. Results also suggest that the design of the assessment center and <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>assessors</b> may be key elements in producing accurate, unbiased ratings. ...|$|E
