25|$|Due {{partly to}} budget {{restrictions}} at the BBC, the expected 2012 series, Smith's third, was split into 5 episodes transmitted from September 2012 and a further 8 transmitted from April 2013, with the now traditional Christmas special between these 2 groups of episodes. The {{advent of the}} show's 50th anniversary in November 2013 meant that instead of starting to film an 8th series, the BBC started work on a feature-length special, to be transmitted on 23 November 2013, the precise date of the show's 50th anniversary. As well as being made in 3D for presentation at selected cinemas, the episode was also announced to be co-starring David Tennant and Billie Piper, reprising their roles of the Tenth Doctor and Rose, though ultimately Billie Piper played <b>The</b> <b>Moment,</b> <b>a</b> Gallifreyan Weapon that {{took the form of}} Rose.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, the Swedish media {{reported}} that the public preliminary investigation protocols concerning a child murder case known as the Arboga case had been made available through a torrent on The Pirate Bay. In Sweden, preliminary investigations become publicly available <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> lawsuit is filed and can be ordered from the court by any individual. The document included pictures from the autopsy of the two murdered children, which caused their father Nicklas Jangestig to urge the website to have the pictures removed. The Pirate Bay refused to remove the torrent. The number of downloads increased to about 50,000 a few days later. On 11 September 2008, the website's press contact Peter Sunde participated in the debate program Debatt on the public broadcaster SVT. Sunde had agreed to participate {{on the condition that}} the father Nicklas Jangestig would not take part in the debate. Jangestig ultimately did participate in the program by telephone, which made Sunde feel betrayed by SVT. This caused The Pirate Bay to suspend all of its press contacts the following day.|$|E
25|$|Members of Parliament are {{permitted}} to speak on any subject without fear of censure outside Parliament; the only body that can censure an MP is the House Committee of Privileges. Parliamentary immunity takes effect from <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> member of Parliament is sworn in, and only applies when that member has the floor; it {{does not apply to}} statements made outside the House. An exception to this rule are portions of the constitution related to the social contract, such as the Articles governing citizenship, Bumiputera (Malays and indigenous people) priorities, the Malay language, etc. — all public questioning of these provisions is illegal under the 1971 amendments to the Sedition Act, which Parliament passed {{in the wake of the}} 1969 13 May race riots. Members of Parliament are also forbidden from criticising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and judges. Parliamentary immunity and other such privileges are set out by Article 63 of the Constitution; as such, the specific exceptions to such immunity had to be included in the Constitution by amendment after the 13 May incident.|$|E

25|$|Later, Zuo Ci went to Cao Cao, who granted him {{a pension}} {{to do his}} magics. Cao Cao may have shown an {{interest}} in the Taoist approach to longevity by doing this, but his son Cao Zhi wrote that the pensions are only intended to keep the magicians and their wild teachings under control. Zuo Ci performed a number of magic acts in Cao Cao's court, such as catching an exotic fish from an empty copper pan, and teleporting far away to buy ginger. Zuo Ci once fed a whole court assembly with food and wine, but Cao Cao soon found out that Zuo Ci had emptied every wine shop in the region with his magic for this purpose. Cao Cao tried to execute Zuo Ci, but Zuo escaped by walking through walls. When someone reported that Zuo Ci had been sighted in the market, everyone in the market became identical to Zuo's appearance. Another report said Zuo Ci went to the mountaintop, so Cao Cao and his men went, and realised Zuo was concealed among a flock of sheep. Knowing he could not find him, Cao Cao announced to the flock of sheep that he was merely trying to test Zuo Ci's skill, and had no intention to kill him. At <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>a</b> goat stood on its hind legs and spoke. Cao Cao's men rushed to the goat, only to find the rest of the flock also turned into goats and started standing and speaking like humans. Zuo Ci was never found by Cao Cao's men again.|$|E

Bahler stated, [...] "It's like vocal arranging in a perfect world." [...] Jones disagreed, stating that the task was like [...] "putting a watermelon in a Coke bottle". The following evening, Lionel Richie held a [...] "choreography" [...] session at his home, where it was decided who would stand where.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{characterized}} the initial release of Windows 10 in July 2015 as being rushed, citing the incomplete state {{of some of}} the operating system's bundled software (such as the Edge web browser), as well as the stability of the operating system itself on launch. However, TechRadar felt that Windows10 would be [...] "the new Windows7", citing the operating system's more familiar user interface, improvements to bundled apps, performance improvements, a [...] "rock solid" [...] search system, and the Settings app being more full-featured than its equivalents on8 and8.1. The Microsoft Edge web browser was praised for its performance, albeit not being in a feature-complete state on-launch. While considering them a [...] "great idea in principle", concerns were shown for Microsoft's focus on the universal app ecosystem, noting that [...] "It's by no means certain that developers are going to flock to Windows10 from iOS and Android simply because they can convert their apps easily. It may well become a no-brainer for them, but at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> conscious decision is still required." ...|$|E
500|$|Battles in Final Fantasy XI {{take place}} in the world in which players move around, a first in the series, where battle had {{previously}} taken place in a separate screen via random encounters.

This format would continue in future Final Fantasy games. Monsters within the game operate under a system of [...] "claim" [...] and [...] "". A monster is claimed <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> player performs any offensive action upon it, whether physical, magical or ability related. With some exceptions, once a monster is claimed it can only be attacked by players in the party or alliance of the player that claimed it. A monster will focus its attention on whoever has built up the most enmity. Players have several means at their disposal, including spells, abilities and items, to build up enmity or shed it to their advantage in battle - a factor that features heavily in group, or [...] "party" [...] play.|$|E

HitFix's Newman graded the song with a [...] "B-" [...] mark, and wrote that [...] "Drake comes in for a rap that works {{perfectly}} with the song in their first collaboration". Dave Hanratty of Drowned in Sound stated that [...] "Cabaret" [...] feels [...] "navel-gazing" [...] {{as a result of}} Drake's braggadocios appearance and the mechanical input given by Timbaland. Entertainmentwise's Amy Gravelle stated that Drake is featured on the track to add substance and style and proves that he was the [...] "hottest" [...] rapper at <b>the</b> <b>moment.</b> <b>A</b> reviewer of Capital FM stated that the song proves why Drake was the rapper on everyone's lips and further described [...] "Cabaret" [...] as a smart team-up between the artists backed by Timbaland's classic beats. On the negative side, Lanre Bakare of The Guardian criticized the rapper's verse calling it [...] "predictably self-indulgent". Vibe's Stacy-Ann Ellis noted that although Drake gives some [...] "lover-boy swag" [...] to the song, Jay-Z outperformed him with his verse on [...] "Murder".|$|E
500|$|Bradford Wright {{described}} Watchmen as [...] "Moore's obituary for {{the concept}} of heroes in general and superheroes in particular." [...] Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's [...] "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to [...] "the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be [...] "not anti-Americanism, [...] anti-Reaganism", specifically believing that [...] "at <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable." [...] Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: [...] "There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can see things in it that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...]" [...] While Moore {{wanted to write about}} [...] "power politics" [...] and the [...] "worrying" [...] times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would [...] "switch off" [...] if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he [...] "was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy." ...|$|E
500|$|The table below lists Ottoman sultans, {{as well as}} {{the last}} Ottoman caliph, in chronological order. The tughras were the calligraphic seals or {{signatures}} used by Ottoman sultans. They were displayed on all official documents as well as on coins, and were far more important in identifying a sultan than his portrait. The [...] "Notes" [...] column contains information on each sultan's parentage and fate. For earlier rulers, there is usually a time gap between <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>a</b> sultan's reign ended and the moment his successor was enthroned. This is because the Ottomans in that era practiced what historian Quataert has described as [...] "survival of the fittest, not eldest, son": when a sultan died, his sons had to fight each other for the throne until a victor emerged. Because of the infighting and numerous fratricides that occurred, a sultan's death date therefore did not always coincide with the accession date of his successor. In 1617, the law of succession changed from survival of the fittest to a system based on agnatic seniority ( [...] ekberiyet), whereby the throne went to the oldest male of the family. This in turn explains why from the 17th century onwards a deceased sultan was rarely succeeded by his own son, but usually by an uncle or brother. Agnatic seniority was retained until the abolition of the sultanate, despite unsuccessful attempts in the 19th century to replace it with primogeniture.|$|E
