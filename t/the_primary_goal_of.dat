5|$|The Tiger Woods Foundation was {{established}} in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl, with <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> promoting golf among inner-city children. The foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country, and sponsors the Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team in the Junior World Golf Championships. As of December 2010, TWF employed approximately 55 people.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> AMiBA is {{to observe}} both the {{temperature}} and polarization anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background at multipoles between 800 and 8,000 (corresponding to between 2 and 20 arcminutes on the sky), as well as observing the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies, which has a maximum decrement around 100GHz. In its initial configuration, it measures up to multipoles of 3,000 with a resolution of around 6 arcminutes. The telescope only observes at night during good weather, using planets for calibration.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was {{to acquire}} sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary {{objective of this}} aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result {{of which would be}} a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|During the Portuguese Liberal Revolution of 1820, he {{supported}} the constitutionalists, who advocated a national constitution to limit {{the powers of the}} Portuguese monarchy, against the absolutists, who preferred an absolute monarchy. It is unknown whether he actively took part in the uprising, however, and if so, to what degree. Honório Hermeto {{was a member of a}} secret society called A Gruta (The Den), founded by Brazilian students at Coimbra with <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> changing Brazil from a monarchy into a republic. His republicanism would fade with time and eventually be replaced by staunch support for monarchism.|$|E
5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> beginning riders, a bike must lean {{in order}} to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more {{well-known}} gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who banded together {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.|$|E

5|$|Resistance to Hasan's rule {{outside of}} his family's core region around Mosul remained, however—in Diyar Bakr, the {{governor}} of Mayyafariqin, Ali ibn Ja'far, rebelled against Hasan, and in Diyar Mudar, the Qaysi tribes of the region around Saruj also revolted. Hasan subdued them and secured control over the entire Jazira {{by the end of}} 936, due to the efforts of his brother Ali, who was given the governorship of the two provinces as a reward. In the meantime, the defeated Banu Habib, some 10,000 strong and under the leadership of al-Ala ibn al-Mu'ammar, left their lands and fled to territory controlled by the Byzantine Empire. This unprecedented move may be {{explained by the fact that}} a significant portion of the tribe still practised Christianity, or by pressure upon their grazing lands by tribes from the south, but <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> the move was to escape from Hamdanid authority and taxation. Hasan also attempted to extend his control to Sajid-ruled Azerbaijan in 934 and 938, but his efforts failed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> {{the planned}} University of New England {{extension}} program {{was to provide}} opportunities for people to obtain a university degree who could not easily travel to attend lectures, often because they lived in rural areas. At this time, most Australian universities were opposed to external degree programs because, among other reasons, they considered that they diluted academic standards and provided a sub-standard education. Madgwick felt that these potential issues could be overcome by careful administration and appropriate financial support from the government. In setting up the program, Madgwick directed that the program's instructors also participate in internal education and should be considered {{on a par with}} their internal colleagues. The examinations given to external students would be the same as those given to internal attendees. External students were required to attend some residential courses as part of their degree programs.|$|E

25|$|Those who reload with <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> maximizing {{accuracy}} or terminal performance may end {{up paying}} more per reloaded round than for commercial ammunition—this {{is especially true for}} military calibers which are commonly available as surplus. Maximum performance, however, requires the highest quality components, which are usually the most expensive. Reloaders who reload with <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> <b>of</b> saving money on ammunition, however, can make a few tradeoffs to realize significant cost savings with a minimal sacrifice in quality.|$|E
