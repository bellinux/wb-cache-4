5|$|McKinley {{remained}} well ahead {{when the state}} conventions concluded, leaving his opponents' only hope <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Committee (RNC), which would make initial rulings on which delegates would be seated; there were contested seats or rival delegations in several states, and rulings against McKinley could still deprive him of a first-ballot majority. When the RNC met in mid-June, {{just prior to the}} convention, McKinley was easily victorious in almost all cases.|$|E
5|$|On May 18, at <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>National</b> Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and {{manipulated}} {{and won the}} nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase.
