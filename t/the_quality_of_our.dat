On 9 April 1948, a Hindu article said: [...] "The Indian Screen has, indeed, in this Province {{or any other}} given us little that can bear comparison with Gemini's Chandraleka for the sheer magnificence of its backgrounds. What is more, it is excellent entertainment." [...] On 10 April, an Indian Express article said: [...] "The film is essentially for the young {{of all ages and}} even the harassed house-wife will share the pleasure of children treated unexpectedly to a pride of lions, tigers, ponies and elephants showing their paces along with clowns and acrobats." [...] A Dinamani article that day said, [...] "People who were depressed with <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Tamil pictures so far can now raise their heads and hail proudly that a great picture can be produced in our land also." [...] Kumudam gave the film a lukewarm review: [...] "Though the story is ordinary, the shocking events inserted into the narrative are something new to the Tamil cinema." [...] The magazine criticised the film's songs and length, saying that its time period was inconsistent: [...] "In a scene, there is a wall clock in the King's office, whereas he is writing with a feather-pen."

The normality of these subjects is deceptive, for behind the images {{there is a sense of}} lurking danger."

One of the bleachers, indeed, was an old servant of the vicomte's, and it was a source of pleasure to him to point out any thing to the ladies that he thought might prove interesting. This was the man who so diligently read the Moniteur, giving a religious credence to all it contained.

In the men of means and leisure in this island there was neither enterprise enough, imagination enough, knowledge nor skill enough to lead in this matter. I do not see how one can go into the history of this development and arrive at any other conclusion. The French and Americans can laugh at our aeroplanes, the Germans are ten years ahead of our poor navigables. We are displayed a soft, rather backward people.

60|$|The {{element of}} oligarchical {{sentiment}} in these novels, however, has, I think, another and subtler aspect, an aspect {{more difficult to}} understand and more worth understanding. The modern gentleman, particularly the modern English gentleman, has become so central and important in these books, and through them {{in the whole of}} our current literature and our current mode of thought, that certain qualities of his, whether original or recent, essential or accidental, have altered <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> English comedy. In particular, that stoical ideal, absurdly supposed to be the English ideal, has stiffened and chilled us. It is not the English ideal; but it is to some extent the aristocratic ideal; or it may be only the ideal of aristocracy in its autumn or decay. The gentleman is a Stoic because he is a sort of savage, because he is filled with a great elemental fear that some stranger will speak to him. That is why a third-class carriage is a community, while a first-class carriage is a place of wild hermits. But this matter, which is difficult, I may be permitted to approach in a more circuitous way.|$|E

This formalism {{is based on an}} abstract description achieved through a finite state machine which has a double interpretation: i) it expresses the dynamic behaviour of a value, ii) it represents sub-domains of values with their operations. The axioms of the specification are computed in the following way: conditions and left-hand terms are produced from the finite state machine (following the AG-derivation principle), whereas right-hand conclusion terms are obtained by user interaction. This method yields some interesting properties: whenever termination is ensured, the specification is sufficiently complete and hierarchically consistent. Furthermore, the termination property is often reached applying some results from modular rewrite systems. <b>The</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> approach are: abstract descriptions of values, consistency between dynamic and functiona [...] ...|$|R
