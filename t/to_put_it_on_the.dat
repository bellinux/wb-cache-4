500|$|The first {{definition}} of a [...] "charitable purpose" [...] {{was found in the}} preamble to the Charitable Uses Act 1601. The standard categorisation (since all previous attempts <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> statute books were [...] "unduly cumbersome") was set out by Lord Macnaghten in IRC v Pemsel, where he said that [...] "Charity in its legal sense comprises four principal divisions: Trusts for the relief of poverty; trusts for the advancement of education; trusts for the advancement of religion; and trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community". This [...] "charitable purpose" [...] was expanded on in Section 2(2) of the Charities Act 2006, but the Macnaghten categories are still widely used.|$|E

It was {{originally}} recorded in 2003, shortly after the recording sessions concluded for Rise Against's second album Revolutions per Minute. When producer Bill Stevenson heard the song, he asked McIlrath <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album. Although the band members enjoyed the song, as they questioned how an acoustic ballad could fit in an album characterized by its hardcore sound. Ultimately, the song was shelved. A year later, Fearless Records approached Rise Against about contributing to the Punk Goes Acoustic compilation album, and the band felt that [...] "Swing Life Away would be an appropriate song for the album.|$|E

[...] "I'm not sure about this song. I don't think I want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album. I don't really like it that much. It's just O.K.", she said. However, she was convinced to record it and, once {{she listened to the}} finished product, she changed her mind. She thought it was odd, but in a positive light, and decided to include it on her debut album. Cyrus says [...] "See You Again" [...] is a dance song with a special meaning to her. The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus' second studio album Breakout (2008).|$|E
500|$|The {{featured}} song [...] "The Best Day Ever" [...] {{was composed}} by Tom Kenny, SpongeBob's voice actor, and Andy Paley.

Originally, Kenny and Paley were writing the songs [...] "The Best Day Ever" [...] and [...] "Under My Rock" [...] on what would become The Best Day Ever album. However, at the same time, the team of the 2004 feature film needed two extra filler tracks for the film soundtrack. Eventually, Stephen Hillenburg, the series creator {{and director of the}} film, heard the songs and decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> film's soundtrack.

Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the Western Mail {{that he wanted}} [...] "to do justice" [...] to Willoughby's back story, {{saying that it is}} [...] "quite interesting and steamy stuff like a lot of underage sex that goes on and is just talked about. I want <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen." [...] Davies elaborated on this further in an interview with The Independent's Peter Chapman, saying that the seduction and abandonment of a schoolgirl in the novel needed dramatising. He believed readers [...] "hardly notice" [...] the moment, which he felt was very important. The writer noted that the series was [...] "more overtly sexual" [...] than previous adaptations of Austen's works and added, [...] "The novel is as much about sex and money as social conventions." [...] Davies also included a duel between Colonel Brandon and Willoughby in his screenplay, an event that was absent from Lee's film adaptation of the novel.|$|E
500|$|Incumbent {{governor}} Fletcher {{emerged from}} the Republican primary, and Beshear immediately looked to make the investigation against Fletcher the primary issue of the campaign. Fletcher countered by strengthening his opposition to Beshear's casino expansion plan. In June 2007, Fletcher backed off an earlier commitment to let Kentuckians vote on casino gambling amendment; a campaign staffer told reporters that [...] "The voters will have their chance to decide this issue in [...] November [...] <b>To</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot would be redundant." [...] Fletcher's choice to make casino gambling {{the centerpiece of the}} campaign proved ineffective. After months of campaigning on the issue, a SurveyUSA poll showed that Fletcher had gained only 6 percentage points on Beshear and still trailed him by 16 percentage points. Further, polling showed {{that more than half of}} the state's voters believed Fletcher had acted unethically with regard to the claims in the hiring investigation while 81% believed the casino gambling amendment should be placed on the ballot. Late in the campaign, eight of Kentucky's leading newspapers endorsed Beshear. Ultimately, Beshear was elected by a vote of 619,567 to 435,856.|$|E

In 2001, Dee Dee made a guest appearance on one track of Ramones Maniacs, a multi-artist cover of the entire Ramones Mania compilation album. The Song Ramones the Same, which came out the following year, includes performances by the Dictators, {{who were part of}} the early New York punk scene, and Wayne Kramer, guitarist for the influential protopunk band MC5. , released in 2003, features performers such as Rancid, Green Day, Metallica, Kiss, the Offspring, Red Hot Chili Peppers, U2, and Rob Zombie (who also did the album cover artwork). Also some other famous bands recorded tribute songs. Motörhead's Phil Campbell tells in Jari-Pekka Laitio-Ramone's book Ramones: Soundtrack Of Our Lives: [...] "We did a cover of Rockaway Beach with me on backing vocals, which was quite enjoyable.

Bobby then gave Moolah the crown and told her <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> King's head after the match, [...] "As only the Queen of Wrestling can do". Junkyard Dog came out to the ring to a big ovation in the Silverdome. During the match, the two battled back and forth, with Race even trying unsuccessfully to give the prone Dog a falling headbutt which naturally failed. Following this Race recovered enough to give the Junkyard Dog a belly to belly suplex when he was distracted by Bobby Heenan to get the win. Due to the pre-match stipulation, JYD did a little bow and then hit Race from the blindside with a steel chair to a rousing ovation from the crowd. After attacking Race, Junkyard Dog took the King's royal robe and left the ring with it in hand to a standing ovation.|$|E
500|$|Terry Barrett of Ohio State University calls Children and Television a [...] "serious book", {{something}} that could be read by the general public without compromising the field of education. [...] Barrett also calls the book an informative treatment of an [...] "interesting contemporary educational phenomenon". [...] Joan Tierney of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation calls the book [...] "a well-thought, well-organized historical version" [...] of the early history and development of Sesame Street. [...] She not only considers the book a [...] "how-to" [...] in how to create and produce a children's television show, but also an important exposure to the public the hard work and dedication it required <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air. [...] For Tierney, the most interesting part of the story Lesser tells in the book is how people with strong and different opinions and temperaments learned to work together and to give television [...] "a little bit of class". [...] She applauds Lesser for including the CTW's detractors, but believes that he unnecessarily included the more ridiculous criticisms in order to give Sesame Street and the Workshop more credibility. [...] Rose K. Goldsen of Cornell University criticizes Lesser for legitimizing [...] "the strange folk belief that depositing lore in a child's head is the same as educating a child". [...] She criticizes the research Lesser describes in the book, and insists that it should be considered as product-testing rather than educational research. [...] She also criticizes Lesser for legitimizing consumerism.|$|E
