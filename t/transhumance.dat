5|$|Traditionally, animal {{husbandry}} {{was part of}} the subsistence farmer's way of life, producing not only the food needed by the family but also the fuel, fertiliser, clothing, transport and draught power. Killing the animal for food was a secondary consideration, and wherever possible its products, such as wool, eggs, milk and blood (by the Maasai) were harvested while the animal was still alive. In the traditional system of <b>transhumance,</b> people and livestock moved seasonally between fixed summer and winter pastures; in montane regions the summer pasture was up in the mountains, the winter pasture in the valleys.|$|E
5|$|While some culinary {{practices}} and dishes have been imported from its British neighbors, uniquely Welsh cuisine grew principally from {{the lives of}} Welsh working people, {{largely as a result}} of their isolation from outside culinary influences and the need to produce food based on the limited ingredients they could produce or afford. Welsh Celts and their more recent Welsh descendants originally practiced <b>transhumance,</b> moving their cattle to higher elevations in the summer and back to their home base in the winter. Once they settled to homesteads, a family would have generally eaten meat from a pig primarily, keeping a cow for dairy products.|$|E
5|$|Young Macedonian {{men were}} {{typically}} expected {{to engage in}} hunting and martial combat as a by-product of their <b>transhumance</b> lifestyle of herding livestock such as goats and sheep, while horse breeding and raising cattle were other common pursuits. Some Macedonians engaged in farming, often with irrigation, land reclamation, and horticulture activities supported by the Macedonian state. The Macedonian economy and state finances were mainly supported by logging and by mining valuable minerals such as copper, iron, gold, and silver. The conversion of these raw materials into finished products and the sale of those products encouraged the growth of urban centers and a gradual shift away from the traditional rustic Macedonian lifestyle {{during the course of}} the 5thcenturyBC.|$|E

5|$|Ion Creangă {{was born}} in Humulești in the Principality of Moldavia, a former village which has since been {{incorporated}} into Târgu Neamț city, the son of Orthodox trader Ștefan sin Petre Ciubotariul and his wife Smaranda. His native area, bordering on heavily forested areas, was in the Eastern Carpathian foothills, and included into {{what was then the}} principality of Moldavia. The surrounding region's population preserved an archaic way of life, dominated by shepherding, textile manufacturing and related occupations, and noted for preserving the older forms of local folklore. Another characteristic of the area, which left an impression on Creangă's family history, was related to the practice of <b>transhumance</b> and the links between ethnic Romanian communities {{on both sides of the}} mountains, in Moldavia and Transylvania: on his maternal side, the writer descended from Maramureș-born peasants, while, according to literary historian George Călinescu, his father's origin may have been further southwest, in Transylvania-proper.|$|E
5|$|The Mérens or Cheval de Mérens, still {{occasionally}} {{referred to}} by the older name of Ariégeois pony, is a small, rustic horse native to the Pyrenees and Ariégeois mountains of southern France, where the Ariège River flows, and northern Spain, near Andorra. Two general types, a small, light traditional mountain horse and a taller, sportier modern type, are found. Always black in color, Mérens must meet strict physical standards {{in order to be}} registered in the stud book. The breed is known for its sure-footedness on mountain terrain, as well as for its endurance, hardiness and docility. The French breed registry organizes regional offices, and partners with other national organizations in Europe to preserve and promote the breed. The organization enforces rigorous selection of breeding stock, with a goal of increasing quality in the breed. In the past, the Mérens was used for farm work, draft work and as pack horses. Today it is mainly used as a saddle horse, although some members of the breed have been successful in carriage driving. Many Mérens are taken on an annual <b>transhumance</b> (seasonal migration), in which they are moved higher in the mountains during the summer and into the valleys for the winter. An old practice, it fell into disfavor, but has recently re-emerged.|$|E
25|$|In Scandinavia, <b>transhumance</b> {{is still}} practiced {{to a certain}} extent; however, {{livestock}} are transported between pastures by motorized vehicles, changing {{the character of the}} movement. The Sami people practise <b>transhumance</b> with reindeer by a different system than is described immediately below.|$|E

The first thirty concerts given in the Basque country and in Europe were successful. Kalakan won the song contest 2011 [...] at the <b>Transhumances</b> musicales festival in Laàs. Most Kalakan albums were sold after the shows and they sold out completely before autumn 2011.|$|R
30|$|The tribe that is {{representative}} of this axis is the Sawar or Shawaks tribe. They carry out local seminomadic <b>transhumances.</b> This community speaks Kurmanji and is of the Alevi faith. The Alevi faith is a moderate version of Islam. It is based on faith in Allah, the prophet Muhammad, and Ali the Holy. This belief was already considered heretical by the Sunni Ottoman central government. Today, Alevis face two types of discrimination: religious and cultural (Wikipedia). Due to this, the camps of Sawar are often located in Alevi places of resistance which have become under significant Turkish army control. Alevism, to which 20 % to 30 % {{of the total population}} of Turkey belong (Rollan 2004), suffered a bloody repression from the 1970 s to the 1990 s, which led to Alevism becoming radicalized by the action of small, extreme, left-wing groups advocating secularism (Bozarslan 2002).|$|R
25|$|The word <b>transhumance</b> {{comes from}} French and {{derives from the}} Latin words trans 'across' and humus 'ground'. <b>Transhumance</b> {{developed}} on every inhabited continent. Although there are substantial cultural and technological variations, the underlying practices for taking advantage of remote seasonal pastures are similar.|$|E
25|$|The Berber {{people of}} North Africa were {{traditionally}} farmers, living in mountains relatively {{close to the}} Mediterranean coast, or oasis dwellers. However, the Tuareg and Zenaga of the southern Sahara practice nomadic <b>transhumance.</b> Other groups, such as the Chaouis, practiced fixed <b>transhumance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Mongolia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Bhutan, India, Nepal and Pakistan {{all have}} vestigial <b>transhumance</b> cultures. In Mongolia, <b>transhumance</b> {{is used to}} avoid {{livestock}} loses during harsh winters known as zuds. For regions of the Himalaya, <b>transhumance</b> still provides mainstay for several near-subsistence economies – for example, that of Zanskar in northwest India, Van Gujjars in Western Himalayas, and Kham Magar in western Nepal. In some cases, the distances traveled by the people with their livestock may be great enough to qualify as nomadic pastoralism.|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to define the environmental and settlement context of the important federal sanctuary of S. Antonio mount in Siligo (SS). The archaeological investigation has been focused on the basalt plateau of Pelao mount, geomorphological well-defined entity, on which rises up the place of worship. The archaeological record founded through systematic reconnaissance surveys, assisted by the results of excavations in S. Vincenzo Ferrer nuragic village, has permitted to reconstruct a settlement framework very complicated and unknown until now. The prehistoric population, proved by the presence of nuraghi and wide villages is, certainly, the prelude to the construction of the sanctuary of S. Antonio mount that cannot be considered {{in the same way as}} a cathedral in the desert. The population’s dispersion is implied by reasons where the visual domain and, in particular, the natural routes, play a basic role. Analyzing the geographic influences, the plateau is configured as a pastoral land and likely destination and crossroad of local <b>transhumances.</b> Therefore a plateau that constituted a natural barrier but, at the same time, represented a connection place, a meeting point for people from different territories...|$|R

25|$|Examples {{of fixed}} <b>transhumance</b> {{are found in}} the North Governorate of Lebanon. Towns and villages located in the Qadisha valley are at an average {{altitude}} of 1,400 meters. Some settlements, like Ehden and Kfarsghab, are used during summer periods from beginning of June till mid-October. Inhabitants move in October to coastal towns situated at an average of 200 meters above sea level. The <b>transhumance</b> is motivated by agricultural activities (historically by the mulberry silkworm culture). The main crops in the coastal towns are olive, grape and citrus. For the mountain towns, the crops are summer fruits, mainly apples and pears. Other examples of <b>transhumance</b> exist in Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transhumance</b> is {{historically}} widespread {{throughout much of}} Spain particularly in the regions of Castile, Leon and Extremadura, where nomadic cattle and sheep herders travel long distances in search of greener pastures in summer and warmer climatic conditions in winter. Spanish <b>transhumance</b> is the origin of numerous related cultures in the Americas such as the Cowboys of the United States and the Gauchos of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Traditional or fixed <b>transhumance</b> has {{occurred}} throughout the inhabited world, particularly Europe and western Asia. It is often important to pastoralist societies, as the dairy products of <b>transhumance</b> flocks and herds (milk, butter, yogurt and cheese) may form {{much of the}} diet of such populations. In many languages there are words for the higher summer pastures, and frequently these words {{have been used as}} place names: e.g. Hafod in Wales, Shieling in Scotland.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transhumance</b> is {{currently}} practiced {{at least in}} Argentina, Chile, Peru and Bolivia, {{as well as in}} the Brazilian Pantanal. It mainly involves movement of cattle in the Pantanal and in parts of Argentina. In the Altiplano, communities of indigenous people depend on raising camelids, especially llamas. Herds of goats are managed by <b>transhumance</b> in North Neuquén and South Mendoza, while sheep are more used in the Patagonian plains. Criollos and indigenous peoples use transhumant practices in areas of South America.|$|E
25|$|In Kyrgyzstan, <b>transhumance</b> practices, {{which never}} died {{out during the}} Soviet period, have {{undergone}} a resurgence in the difficult economic times following independence in 1991. <b>Transhumance</b> is integral to Kyrgyz national culture. The people use a wool felt tent, known as the yurt or jailoo, while living on these summer pastures. It is symbolised on their national flag. Those shepherds prize a fermented drink made from mare's milk, known as the kumis. A tool used in its production is the namesake for Bishkek, the country's capital city.|$|E
25|$|In rural areas, the Somali and Afar of Northeast Africa also {{traditionally}} practice nomadic <b>transhumance.</b> Their pastoralism {{is centered}} on camel husbandry, with additional sheep and goat herding.|$|E
25|$|The Navajo {{people began}} {{practicing}} <b>transhumance</b> in the 1850s, {{after they were}} forced out of their traditional homeland in the San Juan River valley. They maintain many sheep.|$|E

25|$|Agriculture and {{forestry}} {{are major}} industries. Agriculture includes dryland and irrigated farming and livestock grazing. Livestock are frequently moved between high-elevation summer pastures and low-elevation winter pastures, a practice known as <b>transhumance.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Transhumance</b> {{related to}} sheep farming is still practiced in Georgia. The shepherds with their flocks {{have to cross}} the 2,826 metre-high Abano Pass from the {{mountains}} of Tusheti to the plains of Kakheti.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transhumance</b> {{practices}} {{are found in}} temperate areas, above ~1000 m in the Himalaya–Hindu Kush area (referred to below as Himalaya); and the cold semi-arid zone north of the Himalaya, through the Tibetan Plateau and northern China to the Eurasian Steppe.|$|E
25|$|In {{the heartland}} of the Swedish <b>transhumance</b> region, the most {{commonly}} used term is bod or bua (the word is also used for small storage houses and the like and has evolved in English as booth), in modern Standard Swedish fäbod.|$|E
25|$|<b>Transhumance</b> in the Pyrenees {{involves}} {{relocation of}} livestock (cows, sheep, horses) to high mountains for summer months, because {{farms in the}} lowland {{are too small to}} support a larger herd all year round. The mountain period starts in late May or early June, and ends in early October. Until the 1970s, <b>transhumance</b> was used mainly for dairy cows, and cheese-making was an important activity in the summer months. In some regions, nearly all members of a family decamped to higher mountains with their cows, living in rudimentary stone cabins for the summer grazing season. That system, which evolved during the Middle Ages, lasted into the 20th century. It declined and broke down under pressure from industrialization, as people left the countryside for jobs in cities.|$|E
25|$|Pastoralist {{strategies}} typify effective {{adaptation to}} the environment. Precipitation differences are evaluated by pastoralists. In East Africa, different animals are taken to specific regions throughout the year that correspond to the seasonal patterns of precipitation. <b>Transhumance</b> is the seasonal migration of livestock and pastoralists between higher and lower pastures.|$|E
25|$|Tacfarinas, as a {{commoner}} of Numidia, {{served for}} a time in the Roman Army occupying its imperial Africa Province, but he later deserted. His loyalty lay with his tribe the Musulamii, pastoralists who practiced <b>transhumance,</b> i.e., wintering their herds in the dryer south, but in summer moving their livestock herds northward to better-watered lands.|$|E
25|$|Scattered nomadic groups {{maintained}} {{herds of}} sheep, goats, horses, and camels, and conducted annual migrations {{to find new}} pastures (a practice known as <b>transhumance).</b> The people lived in yurts (or gers) – tents made of hides and wood that could be disassembled and transported. Each group had several yurts, each accommodating about five people.|$|E
25|$|The Drômois Vercors {{is an area}} made up of {{a number}} of smaller plateaux. In the north of the Drômois Vercors there are several gorges which are traversed by roads cut into the cliffs. Grassy areas are used as {{pastures}} in the summer months, and the biannual migration (<b>transhumance)</b> of animals is a period of celebration for the people of Die.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the area}} was {{frequently}} mapped, due to its location on the Sweden-Norway frontier, which has existed since 1273. In that era, the massif was entirely Norwegian, but in 1644, Sweden succeeded in capturing Särna during the Torstenson War. However, in 1645, the Second Treaty of Brömsebro failed to clearly define the frontier, and not until 1751, after negotiations, was the current frontier established. If the wrangling over the border seemed to take forever, {{all the more so}} since the zone was so trivial. The area around the mountain was not settled until later. This began on the Norwegian side: there was at least one farm at Ljørdalen in 1528. Not until the 18th century did the Swedish part become populated, initially with cabins for <b>transhumance,</b> for example at Mörkret. Virtual villages grew up after the beginning of the 19th century at Gördalen, Storbäcken, Storbron, Hägnåsen, Mörkret, Tjärnvallen and Lillådalen. Many of the park trails date from this era of <b>transhumance.</b>|$|E
