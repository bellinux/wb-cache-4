50|$|Amygdalofugal fibers {{as well as}} fibers {{from the}} nucleus basalis both project to the substantia innominata {{followed}} by the thalamic peduncle and then the magnocellar division of <b>the</b> dorsal <b>medial</b> nucleus. <b>The</b> dorsal <b>medial</b> nucleus therefore receives indirect input from both the amygdala and the nucleus basalis. Lesions to <b>the</b> dorsal <b>medial</b> nucleus cause amnesic syndromes, {{but they need to}} interrupt both the mammillothalamic tract and the amygdalofugal pathway in order to do so. Thus, both pathways play a role in memory.|$|R
5|$|The hippocampus, {{strictly}} speaking, {{is found}} only in mammals. However, the area it derives from, <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> pallium, has counterparts in all vertebrates. There is evidence that {{this part of the}} brain is involved in complex events such as spatial memory and navigation in fishes, birds, reptiles, and mammals.|$|E
5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of basal forebrain structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The basal forebrain, in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{and balance}} are both {{generated}} in the inner ear. The movement of liquids within the inner ear is generated by motion (for balance) and transmitted vibrations generated by the ossicles (for sound). This creates a nerve signal that passes through the vestibulocochlear nerve. From here, it passes through to the cochlear nuclei, the superior olivary nucleus, <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> geniculate nucleus, and finally the auditory radiation to the auditory cortex.|$|E
40|$|Isolated {{fracture}} of <b>the</b> posterior <b>medial</b> tubercle of <b>the</b> talus {{is a rare}} injury, generally thought to result from a pronation-dorsiflexion force causing avulsion of the in-sertion of the posterior talotibial ligament. Originally de-scribed by Cedell, the fracture has subsequently been reported three times to our knowledge, with all cases being attributed to indirect trauma. We describe an iso-lated {{fracture of}} <b>the</b> posterior <b>medial</b> tubercle of <b>the</b> talus caused by direct trauma.

5|$|Scutes {{from the}} postcranial {{region of the}} {{skeleton}} are also known from struthiosaurines. Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus, as well as S. sp.. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups {{of two or three}} osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> edge, and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks. The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape. One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side-to-side and was as long as the whole band itself. The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point, and the upper side of the scute has a smooth, lightly arching shape. Other bands are preserved with a triangular osteoderms with flat tops and rounded bottoms. The exact placement of cervical bands is not known. In 1995, Pereda-Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement, the bands would have been horizontal along the body, with the neural spine {{in the middle of the}} back. That positioning would mean that <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size, and together they would either fuse, like in Edmontonia, or touch, as in Sauropelta. Another possibility, suggested by Ford, was that the bands were along the side of the neck, pointing dorsally. If oriented along the side, the primary scutes would have pointed up and down, like in polacanthids, and <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> scutes would, by definition, become secondary osteoderms. The set of medial scutes (or secondary) would be possibly oval in shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly understood and {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|The soft coat is reddish to golden brown, {{in sharp}} {{contrast}} with the white ventral parts. A brown band runs across the chest, and a distinct rufous collar can be observed on the neck. The chin and <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> surfaces of the legs are also white. The face is characterised by large, round dark brown eyes, small translucent ears, a slim muzzle, and a large grayish pink rhinarium.|$|E

5|$|Transforming a curve {{with equal}} normal speeds at all points {{has been called}} the grassfire transform. Curves evolved in this way will in general develop sharp corners, the trace of which forms <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> axis of the curve. A closely related curve {{evolution}} which moves straight segments of a polygonal curve at equal speeds but allows concave corners to move more quickly than unit speed instead forms a different type of topological skeleton of the given curve, its straight skeleton.|$|E
5|$|While OCD {{may affect}} any joint, the knee—specifically <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> femoral condyle in 75–85% of knee cases—tends {{to be the}} most {{commonly}} affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. The elbow (specifically the capitulum of the humerus) is the second most affected joint with 6% of cases; the talar dome of the ankle represents 4% of cases. Less frequent locations include the patella, vertebrae, the femoral head, and the glenoid of the scapula.|$|E
5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum can be {{separated}} from the morphologically similar individuals of A.aleuticum by the greater length of the stalks on <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> ultimate segments and of the false indusia, measuring greater than 0.9mm and greater than 3.5mm, respectively, in A.viridimontanum. Spore size is also a useful character (although not easily measured in the field); the average A.viridimontanum spore measures 51.4μm in diameter. While A.aleuticum spores can reach up to 53μm, they average about 43μm. In A.aleuticum growing as a disjunct on eastern serpentine (the specimens most likely to be confused with A.viridimontanum), the rhizome is much more frequently branched, with intervals of 1.0 to 2.0mm between nodes.|$|E

5|$|Areas of the {{hippocampus}} are {{shown to be}} functionally and anatomically distinct. The dorsal hippocampus (DH), ventral hippocampus (VH) and intermediate hippocampus serve different functions, project with differing pathways, and have varying degrees of place cells. The dorsal hippocampus serves for spatial memory, verbal memory, and learning of conceptual information. Using the radial arm maze, lesions in the DH were shown to cause spatial memory impairment while VH lesions did not. Its projecting pathways include <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> septal nucleus and supramammillary nucleus. The dorsal hippocampus also has more place cells than both the ventral and intermediate hippocampal regions.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus manavi is a {{diminutive}} species with fur of medium length. The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown. Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter. The ears mostly lack hair and {{end in a}} rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is thin for most of its length, ends in an angular tip, and has a flange at <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> side (towards the midline of the animal). The tragus is differently shaped in other species. The wings and uropatagium (tail membrane) are blackish and are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below, as in M.mahafaliensis and M.brachytragos; M.griveaudi and M.aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia.|$|E

5|$|Most {{species of}} fish and {{amphibians}} possess a lateral line system that senses pressure waves in water. One of the brain areas that receives primary input from the lateral line organ, <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> octavolateral nucleus, has a cerebellum-like structure, with granule cells and parallel fibers. In electrosensitive fish, the input from the electrosensory system goes to the dorsal octavolateral nucleus, which also has a cerebellum-like structure. In ray-finned fishes (by far the largest group), the optic tectum has a layer—the marginal layer—that is cerebellum-like.|$|E
5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> at less than a millimeter in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in symptomatic individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of <b>the</b> <b>medial</b> condyle of the femur.|$|E
