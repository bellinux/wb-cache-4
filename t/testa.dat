5|$|While Degesch {{owned the}} rights to the brand name Zyklon and the patent on the {{packaging}} system, the chemical formula was owned by Degussa. Schlempe GmbH, which was 52 per cent owned by Degussa, owned {{the rights to}} a process to extract hydrogen cyanide from waste products of sugar beet processing. This process was performed under license by two companies, Dessauer Werke and Kaliwerke Kolin, who also combined the resulting hydrogen cyanide with stabilizer from IG Farben and a cautionary agent from Schering AG to form the final product, which was packaged using equipment, labels, and canisters provided by Degesch. The finished goods were sent to Degesch, who forwarded the product to two companies that acted as distributors: Heerdt-Linger GmbH (Heli) of Frankfurt and Tesch & Stabenow (<b>Testa)</b> of Hamburg. Their territory was split along the Elbe river, with Heli handling clients to the west and south, and <b>Testa</b> those to the east. Degesch owned 51 per cent of the shares of Heli, and until 1942 owned 55 per cent of <b>Testa.</b>|$|E
5|$|The androecium {{consists}} of six stamens with filiform (thread like) filaments, which are fasciculate (in close bundles) and declinate or ascendent. The anthers are dorsifixed or versatile. In the gynaecium, the ovary is inferior and trilocular with pluriovulate locules. The style is filiform, and the stigma trifid. The fruit forms a trivalve capsule containing seeds which are dry, flattened, obliquely winged or irregularly discoid, hardly ever turgid, and globose (spherical) or subglobose, with a brown or black phytomelanous <b>testa.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, Zyklon B {{emerged as}} the {{preferred}} killing tool of Nazi Germany for use in extermination camps during the Holocaust. The chemical was used to kill roughly one million people in gas chambers installed in extermination camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and elsewhere. Most {{of the victims were}} Jews, and by far the majority killed using this method died at Auschwitz. Zyklon B was supplied to concentration camps at Mauthausen, Dachau, and Buchenwald by the distributor Heli, and to Auschwitz and Majdanek by <b>Testa.</b> Camps also occasionally bought Zyklon B directly from the manufacturers. Of the 729 metric tons of Zyklon B sold in Germany in 1942–44, 56 metric tons (about 8 per cent of domestic sales) were sold to concentration camps. Auschwitz received 23.8 tons, of which 6 tons were used for fumigation. The remainder was used in the gas chambers or lost to spoilage (the product had a stated shelf life of only three months). <b>Testa</b> conducted fumigations for the Wehrmacht and supplied them with Zyklon B. They also offered courses to the SS in the safe handling and use of the material for fumigation purposes. In April 1941, the German agriculture and interior ministries designated the SS as an authorized applier of the chemical, and thus they were able to use it without any further training or governmental oversight.|$|E
40|$|Studies {{with the}} seeds of soybean, navy bean, pea, and peanut were made to {{determine}} the extent of leakage of intracellular enzymes during imbition. Embryos with intact <b>testae</b> from all four species were found to leak detectable activities of either intracellular enzymes of the cytosol (glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase) or enzymes found in both the cytosol and organelles (malate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase) after 6 hours imbition at 25 C. Pea and peanut embryos with <b>testae</b> leaked considerably lower levels of activity for these enzymes than did those of soybean and bean. Leakage of mitochondrial marker enzymes (fumarase, cytochrome c oxidase, and adenylate kinase) was not detected from embryos with <b>testae,</b> suggesting that a differential diffusion of intracellular components out of cells occurred. Soybean and bean embryos without <b>testae</b> leaked high, and proportionally (per cent dry seed basis) similar, levels of all cytosol, cytosol-organelle, and mitochondrial marker enzymes and protein during imbibition, indicating that cell membranes were not differential to leakage and that they had ruptured. Pea and peanut embryos without <b>testae</b> leaked detectable activities of all cytosol and cytosol-organelle enzymes, although fumarase was the only detectable mitochondrial marker enzyme leaked, suggesting that some degree of differential leakage may have occurred in these species. The outermost layers of embryo cells of seeds without <b>testae</b> of all four species absorbed and sequestered the nonpermeating pigment Evan's blue after 5 to 15 minutes imbibition, indicating that membranes had ruptured. This occurred to a much lesser extent in seeds with intact <b>testae.</b> Both soybean and bean embryos without <b>testae</b> were observed to disintegrate during imbibition, whereas those of pea and peanut did not. These data indicate that seeds of certain legumes are susceptible to cellular rupture during imbibition when seed coats are damaged or missing...|$|R

5|$|Richard Swinefield, Cantilupe's {{successor}} as Bishop of Hereford, {{wrote to}} Pope Nicholas IV {{in a letter}} dated 19 April 1290 proposing the bishop for canonisation, {{but it was not}} until 1307 that an investigation into Cantilupe's saintliness was initiated by Pope Clement V. For the canonisation process to succeed, convincing evidence of miracles that Cantilupe had performed since his death had to be presented, one of which was that William Cragh had been brought back from the dead by the bishop's intercession. Three papal commissioners were appointed to conduct the inquiry: William de <b>Testa,</b> a papal tax collector in England, Ralph Baldock, Bishop of London, and William Durand the Younger, Bishop of Mende.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} Aiphanes species {{is usually a}} red, spherical, single-seeded drupe.

5|$|Brézé, {{unable to}} {{dispatch}} his fireships over the Spanish vessels, {{as he had}} done in his previous battles at Cádiz, Barcelona and Cartagena, lunged over Pimienta's galleon Santiago and riddled the ship with his artillery Santiago lost its main-mast and had to be succored by Linhares and Pablo de Contreras. Fearing the attack of the French fireships or the boarding of Brézé's galleys, Contreras covered the damaged galleon at the head of six vessels, while Linhares flag galley towed it out of danger. The remaining ships engaged Brézé in an inconclusive action which lasted until both fleets separated at dusk. The Spanish lost the frigate Santa Catalina, burnt by its own crew to avoid capture when she was surrounded by the French la Mazarine and three other vessels. The foremost Spanish galleons <b>Testa</b> de Oro, León Rojo and Caballo marino received heavy damage, while a French fireship blew up. Two French galleons were also badly damaged. The human loss aboard the Spanish fleet is unknown. Forty men were killed or wounded aboard the French fleet One of them was Admiral Brézé, cut in half by a cannonball which hit the stern of his flagship Grand Saint Louis.|$|E

5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate <b>testa</b> and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E

25|$|The seed coat {{develops}} {{from the}} maternal tissue, the integuments, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed coat in the mature seed {{can be a}} paper-thin layer (e.g. peanut) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in honey locust and coconut), or fleshy as in the sarcotesta of pomegranate. The seed coat helps protect the embryo from mechanical injury, predators and drying out. Depending on its development, the seed coat is either bitegmic or unitegmic. Bitegmic seeds form a <b>testa</b> from the outer integument and a tegmen from the inner integument while unitegmic seeds have only one integument. Usually parts of the <b>testa</b> or tegmen form a hard protective mechanical layer. The mechanical layer may prevent water penetration and germination. Amongst the barriers may be the presence of lignified sclereids.|$|E
50|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2003 season, Toronto Supra hired the services of Jose <b>Testas</b> who brought back Danny Amaral from Portugal and named him captain. He maintained {{the majority of the}} previous roster while signing a mixture of younger players like Michael Di Luca, Fabio Silva, and Jaroslaw Radzinski - the younger brother of Canadian international Tomasz Radzinski. Supra would go on having a successful season achieving a 16-game undefeated streak, and maintaining their record until the final two games of the season. <b>Testas</b> would lead Toronto to a second-place finish in the Eastern Conference and posting the second best offensive record within the league. In the postseason Supra faced Vaughan Sun Devils with goals coming from Di Luca, and Amaral, but unfortunately Supra fell short with a goal coming from Vaughan in overtime resulting in a 4-3 loss for Supra.
