40|$|Rheumatic fever {{is still}} one of the major public health {{problems}} in developing countries. Recurrences have been reported during continuous regular prophylaxis. Here, we describe a 13 -year-old girl who had four apparent recurrences of carditis while on a regimen of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) every <b>three</b> <b>weeks.</b> The interesting and special features of this case were the presence of frequent recurrences of carditis with no evidence of arthritis despite regular BPG injections every <b>three</b> <b>weeks,</b> the requirement of long-term corticosteroid therapy due to these recurrences, and the shortness of time periods between attacks after withdrawal of steroid therapy. In this case, the administration of supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids caused iatrogenic Cushing syndrome with decreased bone mineral density and bilateral avascular tibial necrosis mimicking the symptoms of arthritis. Thus, this is a rare case. In similar cases with recurrences of either arthritis or carditis, instead of longterm corticosteroid therapy, we suggest a regimen of BPG prophylaxis every two <b>weeks</b> rather <b>than</b> every <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> or monthly BPG injections becaus...|$|R

5|$|Except for the aye-aye and the Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, lemurs are {{seasonal}} breeders {{with very}} short mating and birth seasons {{influenced by the}} highly seasonal availability of resources in their environment. Mating seasons usually last less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>weeks</b> each year, with the female vagina opening up only during a few hours or days of her most receptive time of estrus. These narrow windows for reproduction and resource availability appear to relate to their short gestation periods, rapid maturation, and low basal metabolic rates, {{as well as the}} high energy costs of reproduction for females. This may also relate to the relatively high mortality rate among adult females and the higher proportion of adult males in some lemur populations—both unusual traits among primates. In both the aye-aye and Lac Alaotra gentle lemur, birth (parturition) occurs over a six-month period.|$|E
