50|$|There are {{no obvious}} {{traces of the}} fort or any other {{structures}} from Croghan’s homestead visible on the aerial photographs of the site. Adding to the complications {{is the fact that}} old Pennsylvania State Route 522 could have impacted the fort and village sites. One way to focus the search for a compound structure such as Fort Shirley is to use geophysical prospecting techniques to detect any traces of subsurface features such as foundations, the palisade wall, and the powder magazine. After narrowing the search using the written record, maps, and GIS; a geophysical survey was started in November 2009 with the help of Indiana University of Pennsylvania. A site grid has been established and the <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> have been staked-out using a laser total station; then, ground-penetrating-radar and resistivity equipment were used to collect data during close interval traverses (0.5 or 1.0 m). The geophysical data will be interpreted further to help guide subsequent archaeological testing.|$|E
50|$|The {{greatest}} number of known species of marine fungi are from mangrove swamps. In one study, blocks of mangrove timber and pieces of driftwood of Avicennia alba, Bruguiera cylindrica and Rhizophora apiculata were examined to identify the lignicolous (wood-decaying) fungi they hosted. Also tested were Nypa fruticans, a mangrove palm and Acanthus ilicifolius, a plant often associated with mangroves. Each material {{was found to have}} its own characteristic fungi, the greatest diversity being among those growing on the mangrove palm. It was surmised that this was because the salinity was lower in the estuaries and creeks where Nypa grew, and so it required a lesser degree of adaptation for the fungi to flourish there. Some of these species were closely related to fungi on terrestrial palms. Other studies have shown that driftwood hosts more species of fungus than do exposed <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> of timber of a similar kind. The mangrove leaf litter also supported a large fungal community which was different from that on the timber and living material. However, few of these were multicellular, higher marine fungi.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To {{measure the}} force {{required}} to dislodge three different orthodontic temporary anchorage devices (TADs) from artificial <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> and {{to investigate whether}} varying the cortical thickness of the test block will affect these forces. Materials and Method: The TADs were embedded into <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> consisting of polyurethane foam, laminated with either 2 mm or 3 mm short-fibre-filled epoxy sheets and a horizontal dislodging force applied, using an Instron universal testing machine. The maximum force applied before the TAD was fully dislodged was recorded. Three TADs were tested: InfinitasTM, Ancor ProTM and Ortho ImplantTM. 150 of each design were tested in the 2 mm thickness test block and a further 150 of each were tested in the 3 mm thickness test block. Results: The mean force required was 468 N in the 2 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> and 567 N in the 3 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks.</b> No significant difference was observed between the InfinitasTM and Ancor ProTM TADs, however {{there was a significant}} difference (P> 0. 05) between both of these TADs and the Ortho ImplantTM. The force required in the 3 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> was significantly higher than the force required in the 2 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks.</b> Conclusion: All of the TADs were functionally acceptable, in terms of resistance to dislodgement forces. The Ortho ImplantTM required a significantly higher force to be dislodged from both the 2 mm and 3 mm <b>test</b> <b>blocks.</b> The thickness of the test block had a significant effect on the force required to dislodge each of the TADs. ...|$|E
40|$|Clean bond {{surfaces}} {{are critical to}} the operation of diffusion bonded titanium engine components. These components can be contaminated with machining coolant, shop dirt, and fingerprints during normal processing and handling. These contaminants must be removed to achieve acceptable bond quality. As environmental concerns become more important in manufacturing, elimination {{of the use of}} hazardous materials is desired. For this reason, another process (not using nitric-hydrofluoric acid solution) to clean titanium parts before bonding was sought. Initial cleaning trials were conducted at Honeywell to screen potential cleaning techniques and chemistries. During the initial cleaning process screening phase, Pratt and Whitney provided Honeywell with machined 3 inch x 3 inch x 1 inch titanium <b>test</b> <b>blocks.</b> These <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> were machined with a water-based machining coolant and exposed to a normal shop environment and handling. (Honeywell sectioned one of these blocks into smaller samples to be used for additional cleanliness verification analyses.) The sample <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> were ultrasonically cleaned in alkaline solutions and AUGER analysis was used by Honeywell FM and T to validate their cleanliness. This information enabled selection of final cleaning techniques and solutions to be used for the bonding trials. To validate Honeywell's AUGER data and to verify the cleaning processes in actual situations, additional sample blocks were cleaned (using the chosen processes) and then bonded. The bond quality of the <b>test</b> <b>blocks</b> was analyzed according to Pratt and Whitney's requirements. The Charpy impact testing was performed according to ASTM procedure {number_sign}E- 23.
