40|$|A genomic clone, {{encompassing}} the 5 ' {{flanking region}} and the first seven exons of rat ATP citrate lyase gene, was isolated from a rat genomic library and sequenced. Primer-extension analysis showed that mRNA is transcribed at 4407 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site. Primer-extension analysis and sequencing of ATP citrate lyase cDNA amplified by PCR showed that the promoter used for <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> in mammary gland, lung, liver, brain and kidney. Southern-blot analysis showed that the ATP citrate lyase gene exists as a single copy. The 5 ' flanking region contains several consensus sequences defined as promoter elements. These include a CAAT box and Sp 1 -binding sites. However, a TATA box lacks this promoter. The expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was induced by the 5 ' flanking region (- 2370 to - 1) in the CHO cell line. The 5 ' flanking region also contains several sequence elements that {{may be involved in}} the transcriptional regulation of the gene...|$|E
40|$|Renal cells contain two corticosteroid-binding {{entities}} defined on {{the basis}} of hormone-binding selectivity as type I (mineralocorticoid) and type II (glucocorticoid). The mineralocorticoid, aldosterone can bind to both type I and type II receptors. This poses problems in defining the characteristics of a true mineralocorticoid regulated expression of specific genes. We have used chimaeric constructs bearing the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter to study aldosterone action in the feline renal cell line CRFK. We have shown that in these cells aldosterone induces MMTV transcription through its own receptor (type I). This induction of MMTV transcription by aldosterone is a primary response to the hormone. We have shown that the DNA sequences that mediate the aldosterone response overlap the hormone response element (HRE) required for the glucocorticoid, progestin, and androgen induction of transcription at the MMTV long terminal repeat region. Thus the aldosterone regulation of MMTV long terminal repeat <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> to the mode of action of the other steroid hormones at this promoter...|$|E

Using a combination of pharmacologic inhibitors, dominant-negative mutant, RNA interference, and soluble receptor blocking techniques, we identified a protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) → dual oxidase 1 (Duox 1) → reactive oxygen species (ROS) → TNF-α–converting enzyme (TACE) → TNF-α → TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 → extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) 1 / 2 → Sp 1 pathway as responsible for NE-activated MUC 1 <b>transcription.</b> This cascade <b>was</b> <b>identical</b> {{up to the point}} of TACE with the signaling pathway {{previously reported}} for NE-stimulated MUC 5 AC production.

40|$|Insulin gene <b>transcription</b> <b>is</b> {{a unique}} {{feature of the}} {{pancreatic}} beta cells and is increased in response to glucose. The recent cloning of insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF 1) and somatostatin transcription factor 1 (STF 1) unexpectedly revealed that these are mouse and rat homologues of the same protein mediating transactivation through binding of CT box-like elements in rat insulin 1 and somatostatin promoter/enhancer regions, respectively. By using oligonucleotides representing {{each of the three}} CT boxes of the human insulin (HI) gene enhancer and nuclear extracts from the mouse islet tumor cell lines beta TC 3 and alpha TC 1, we have identified a beta-cell-specific binding activity as reported for IPF 1, which has maximal affinity toward the CT 2 box. However, in pluripotent, HI-transfected rat islet tumor cells, NHI- 6 F, this binding activity is present prior to induction of (human) insulin gene <b>transcription.</b> Its migration <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> to that of in vitro translated STF 1 in electrophoretic mobility-shift assays; it is specifically recognized by anti-STF 1 antibodies and has an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa. Mutation of the CT 2 box decreases transcriptional activity of a HI reporter plasmid by approximately 65 % in beta TC 3 cells and blocks the glucose response in isolated newborn rat islet cells. Furthermore, cotransfection with STF 1 cDNA into the glucagon-producing alpha TC 1 cells increases the activity of the HI enhancer 4 - to 5 -fold, suggesting that STF 1 /IPF 1 can confer on alpha TC 1 cells the ability to transcribe the HI gene. We conclude that STF 1 /IPF 1 is a necessary but not sufficient key regulator of insulin gene activity, possibly also involved in glucose-regulated transcription...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{mutations}} {{have been described}} with pleiotropic effects on the expression of genes for degradative enzymes in Bacillus subtilis. The sacU 32 (Hy) and sacQ 36 (Hy) mutations increase {{the expression of a}} wide variety of enzymes that degrade biological polymers. The phenotypes caused by mutations at the hpr locus are more restricted; they are known to increase expression of the alkaline and neutral proteases. The alkaline protease (aprE) promoter was analyzed to determine the target site for stimulation by these loci. Deletion of upstream regions of the aprE promoter could abolish or greatly reduce stimulation by mutations at these loci. A region upstream of - 200 was necessary for full stimulation by an hpr- 97 mutation, whereas a region between - 141 and - 164 was necessary for full stimulation by the sacU 32 (Hy) and sacQ 36 (Hy) mutations. Northern analyses of mRNA preparations showed that the levels of aprE mRNA were increased in strains carrying the sacU 32 (Hy) or hpr- 97 mutation. Moreover, primer extension analysis of these mRNA preparations revealed that the <b>transcription</b> start point <b>was</b> <b>identical</b> to that in a wild-type strain. We hypothesize that upstream activation of the subtilisin promoter mediated by these genes is a mechanism for global responses to a variety of nutritional conditions...|$|R
40|$|We report here {{studies of}} {{expression}} and functional analysis of a Bacillus subtilis gene, ywcE, which codes for a product with features of a holin. Primer extension analysis of ywcE transcription revealed that a single transcript accumulated from the onset of sporulation onwards, produced from a σA-type promoter bearing the TG dinucleotide motif of “extended” − 10 promoters. No primer extension product was detected in vivo during growth. However, specific runoff products were produced in vitro from the ywcE promoter by purified σA-containing RNA polymerase (EσA), and the in vivo and in vitro <b>transcription</b> start sites <b>were</b> <b>identical.</b> These results suggested that utilization of the ywcE promoter by EσA during growth was subjected to repression. Studies with a lacZ fusion revealed that the transition-state regulator AbrB repressed the transcription of ywcE during growth. This repression was reversed {{at the onset of}} sporulation in a Spo 0 A-dependent manner, but Spo 0 A did not appear to contribute otherwise to ywcE transcription. We found ywcE to be required for proper spore morphogenesis. Spores of the ywcE mutant showed a reduced outer coat which lacked the characteristic striated pattern, and the outer coat failed to attach to the underlying inner coat. The mutant spores also accumulated reduced levels of dipicolinic acid. ywcE was also found to be important for spore germination...|$|R

40|$|The {{sites of}} {{initiation}} for beta-lactamase mRNA transcription and the nucleotide sequences of beta-lactamase plasmids derived from Haemophilus and Neisseria species were determined. In N. gonorrhoeae, transcription from plasmid pFA 3 was initiated from two sites, one located about 20 base pairs (bp) {{and the other}} 210 bp upstream of the beta-lactamase initiating codon, whereas in H. influenzae, transcriptional initiation from plasmid pHD 131 occurred at two different sites, approximately 150 and 170 bp upstream of the initiating codon.

40|$|Gene {{expression}} in nongreen plastids is largely uncharacterized. To compare gene {{expression in}} potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber amyloplasts and leaf chloroplasts, amounts of transcripts of all plastid genes {{were determined by}} hybridization to plastome arrays. Except for a few genes, transcript accumulation was much lower in tubers compared with leaves. Transcripts of photosynthesis-related genes showed a greater reduction in tubers compared with leaves than transcripts of genes for the genetic system. Plastid genome copy number in tubers was 2 - to 3 -fold lower than in leaves and thus cannot account for the observed reduction of transcript accumulation in amyloplasts. Both the plastid-encoded and the nucleus-encoded RNA polymerases were active in potato amyloplasts. <b>Transcription</b> initiation sites <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> in chloroplasts and amyloplasts, although some differences in promoter utilization between the two organelles were evident. For some intron-containing genes, RNA splicing was less efficient in tubers than in leaves. Furthermore, tissue-specific differences in editing of ndh transcripts were detected. Hybridization of the plastome arrays with RNA extracted from polysomes indicated that, in tubers, ribosome association of transcripts was generally low. Nevertheless, some mRNAs, such as the transcript of the fatty acid biosynthesis gene accD, displayed relatively high ribosome association. Selected nuclear genes involved in plastid gene expression were generally significantly less expressed in tubers than in leaves. Hence, compared with leaf chloroplasts, gene expression in tuber amyloplasts is much lower, with control occurring at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional, and translational levels. Candidate regulatory sequences that potentially can improve plastid (trans) gene expression in amyloplasts have been identified...|$|R

40|$|A 3. 8 -kilobase-pair EcoRI {{fragment}} which corrects {{the mutations}} {{carried by the}} NifB- Azotobacter vinelandii strains CA 30 and UW 45 was cloned, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. Four complete open reading frames (ORFs) and two partial ORFs were found. The translation product of the first partial ORF is the carboxy-terminal end of a protein homologous to the nifA gene product from Klebsiella pneumoniae. A 285 -base-pair sequence containing a potential nif promoter and nif regulatory sites separates this nifA gene from the first complete ORF which encodes a protein homologous to nifB gene products from K. pneumoniae and Rhizobium species. The Tn 5 insertion in strain CA 30 and the nif- 45 mutation of strain UW 45 are located within this nifB gene. The ORF downstream from nifB predicts an amino acid sequence with a cysteine residue pattern that is characteristic of ferredoxins. No similarities {{were found between the}} translation product of the third complete ORF and those of nif genes from other organisms. At the carboxy-terminal end of the predicted translation product of the fourth complete ORF, 30 of 60 amino acid residues <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> with the sequence of the nifQ gene product from K. pneumoniae. The partial ORF located {{at the end of the}} fragment encodes the N-terminal part of a potential protein with an unknown function. Northern (RNA) blot analysis indicated that transcripts from the region containing the four complete ORFs were NH 4 + repressible and that the <b>transcription</b> products <b>were</b> <b>identical</b> in cells derepressed under conditions of Mo sufficiency or Mo deficiency or in the presence of vanadium. In contrast to the NifB- strain CA 30, which is Nif- under all conditions, mutants that carry mutations affecting the C-terminal end of nifB or genes located immediately downstream from nifB, grew under all N 2 -fixing conditions. However, in the presence of Mo, most of the strains required 1, 000 times the amount of molybdate that is sufficient for maximal growth of the wild-type strain CA under N 2 -fixing conditions. Growth data from strain CA 37, which carries a Kanr insertion in nifQ, indicate that nifQ in A. vinelandii is not required for N 2 fixation in the presence of V 2 O 5 or under Mo-deficient conditions. Growth studies and acetylene reduction assays performed on two nifEN deletion strains showed that nifE and nifN are required for N 2 fixation under Mo sufficiency, as previously observed (K. E. Brigle, M. C. Weiss, W. E. Newton, and D. R. Dean, J. Bacteriol. 169 : 1547 - 1553, 1987), but not under conditions of Mo deficiency or in the presence of 50 nM V 2 O 5...|$|R
