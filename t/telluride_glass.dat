We {{found that}} the near-infrared 1800 -nm luminescence intensity of (A) Er 3 +(8 %) Tm 3 +(0. 5 %) : <b>telluride</b> <b>glass</b> was approximately 4. 4 to 19. 5 times larger than that of (B) Tm 3 +(0. 5 %) : <b>telluride</b> <b>glass,</b> and approximately 5. 0 times larger than that of (C) Er 3 +(0. 5 %) : <b>telluride</b> <b>glass.</b> Additionally, the infrared excitation spectra of the 1800 nm luminescence, {{as well as the}} visible excitation spectra of the 522 nm and 652 nm luminescence, of (A) Er 3 +(8 %) Tm 3 +(0. 5 %) : <b>telluride</b> <b>glass</b> are very similar to those of Er 3 + ions in (C) Er 3 +(0. 5 %) : <b>telluride</b> <b>glass,</b> with respect to the shapes of their excitation spectral waveforms and peak wavelengths. Moreover, we {{found that the}}re is a strong spectral overlap and energy transfer between the infrared luminescence of Er 3 + donor ions and the infrared absorption of Tm 3 + acceptor ions. The efficiency of this energy transfer {I- 4 (13 / 2) (Er 3 +) -> I- 4 (15 / 2) (Er 3 +), H- 3 (6) (Tm 3 +) -> F- 3 (4) (Tm 3 +) } between the Er 3 + and Tm 3 + ions is approximately 69. 8 %. Therefore, we can conclude that the observed behaviour is an interesting multiphoton, near-infrared, quantum cutting luminescence phenomenon that occurs in novel Er 3 +-Tm 3 + ion pairs. These findings are significant for the development of next-generation environmentally friendly germanium solar cells, and near-to-mid infrared (1. 8 - 2. 0 mu m) lasers pumped by GaN light emitting diodes...|$|E

Among them, selenide glasses exhibit excellent infrared transmission in the 1 to 15 µm region. Due to their good thermo-mechanical properties, these glasses could be easily shaped into optical devices such as lenses and optical fibers. During the past decade of research, selenide glass fibers have been proved to be suitable for infrared sensing in an original spectroscopic method named Fiber Evanescent Wave Spectroscopy (FEWS). FEWS has provided very nice and promising results, for example for medical diagnosis. Then, some sophisticated fibers, also based on selenide glasses, were developed: rare-earth doped fibers and microstructured fibers. In parallel, the study of telluride glasses, which can have transmission up to 28 µm due to its atom heaviness, has been intensified thanks to the DARWIN mission led by the European Space Agency (ESA).

40|$|International audienceTelluride glasses, i. e., nonoxide glasses {{based on}} the chalcogen element tellurium, {{constitute}} a particular class of materials used in numerous technological applications. While many telluride systems are not intrinsically good glass formers, {{a wide range of}} <b>telluride</b> <b>glass</b> compositions have been developed and offer a unique set of optical and electrical properties. Telluride glasses possess a very broad transparency in the infrared, which can range up to more than 20  μm, making them particularly interesting for optical applications in the far-infrared range. Several families of telluride glasses (e. g., ternary and quaternary systems based on tellurium, germanium, and gallium) have been explored and optimized in order to further develop these applications. Indeed, a large number of organic compounds have their specific spectral signature (or “fingerprint”) in the far-infrared, making telluride glasses materials of choice for the fabrication of sensing devices. Tellurides are also found in the fabrication of rewritable optical disks and phase-change memory devices, as some compositions exhibit fast and reversible conversion between crystalline and amorphous (glassy) phases. More recently, telluride glasses have been demonstrated to be promising candidates as thermoelectric materials, due to their semiconducting nature.

40|$|Te 2 As 3 Se 5 (TAS) fibers {{are often}} used in bio-sensing {{applications}} requiring direct contact between the fiber and live cells. However, the toxicity and stability of chalcogenide glasses typically used in such bio-sensing applications are not well known. The stability and toxicity of TAS glass fibers were therefore examined. The surface of TAS fibers stored {{for up to three}} years in air were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is shown that an oxide layer develops on the surface of TAS fibers stored in air. This oxide layer is highly soluble in water and therefore easily removed. Additional studies using cyclic voltammetry show that the fresh TAS glass surface is insoluble in water for at least a few days, and attenuation measurements show that oxidation does not affect the transmission properties of the glass fibers. It was also determined that old, oxidized fibers pose a toxic threat to cells, while washed and new fibers show no toxic effect. Therefore, it is concluded that a soluble oxide layer forms on the surface of TAS fibers stored in air and that this layer has a toxic effect on cells in an aqueous environment. However, through etching, the oxide layer and the toxicity can be easily removed. In other applications of <b>telluride</b> <b>glasses,</b> such as the search for possible signs of life on exoplanets, a glass transmitting further into the IR is required in order to detect molecules, such as CO 2. A new family of Tellurium based glasses from the Ge-Te-I ternary system has therefore been investigated for use in space and bio-sensing applications. A systematic series of compositions has been synthesized in order to explore the ternary phase diagram in an attempt to optimize the glass composition for the fiber drawing and molding process. The resulting glass transition temperature range lies between 139 °C and 174 °C, with deltaT values between 64 °C and 124 °C. The most stable glass composition was found to be Ge 20 Te 73 I 7. The Ge-Te-I glasses were found to have an effective transmission window between 2 - 20 microns, encompassing the region of interest for the identification of biologically relevant species such as carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the successful fibering and molding of the composition Ge 20 Te 73 I 7 are shown. Lastly, an investigation into glass conductivity was completed resulting in a maximum conductivity value on the order of 10 ^- 4 Ohm- 1 cm- 1 for the composition Ge 20 Te 73 I 7. In an attempt {{to take advantage of the}} high conductivity of <b>telluride</b> <b>glasses,</b> a new approach to virus detection in an aqueous environment has been developed using the electrophoretic deposition of protein and viruses on the charged glass surface for in situ infrared characterization and identification. A proof of concept experiment has been completed using a germanium ATR plate and an indium tin oxide (ITO) plate as the experimental electrodes. Charged proteins and viruses were driven to the surface of the oppositely charged germanium ATR crystal, once a potential was applied to the system. FTIR/ATR spectroscopy was used before and throughout electro-deposition to enable the in situ observation of the deposition with time. This technique resulted in the successful deposition and removal of the protein Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), and deposition of the virus MS 2, a bacteriophage that infects only bacteria, with an applied voltage of only 1. 1 V. Furthermore, based on analysis of the ATR spectra, distinct spectral features were identified for the protein and virus showing the potential for identification and characterization of biological molecules in an aqueous environment. A Ge 20 Te 73 I 7 ATR plate was synthesized but unsuccessfully applied as an electrode in these experiments, likely due to an inconsistent conductivity along the plate. A glass from the Ge-As-Te system with a lower but more consistent conductivity was thereafter synthesized and successfully used as an electrode and sensing element in the electro-deposition experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} tune the {{properties}} {{over a wide}} range of values by changing the additives, composition, etc., has made chalcogenide glassy semiconductors, most interesting from both fundamental physics as well as technology point of view. In particular, the occurrence of the two network topological thresholds namely the Rigidity Percolation Threshold (RPT) and the Chemical Threshold (CT) and their influence on various properties of chalcogenide glasses have been of immense interest during the last three decades. The Rigidity Percolation Threshold (also known as the Stiffness Threshold or Mechanical Threshold) corresponds to the composition at which the material transforms from a floppy polymeric glass to a rigid amorphous solid, whereas at Chemical Threshold the sample tends towards an ordered state. Though the rigidity percolation has been considered for long to occur at a critical threshold defined by the constraint’s theory, the recent theoretical and experimental investigations have found the RPT to occur over a range of compositions. In systems exhibiting an extended rigidity percolation, two distinct transitions namely from a floppy to an isostatically rigid phase and from an isostatically rigid to a stressed rigid phase are seen. In the category of chalcogenide <b>glasses,</b> <b>tellurides</b> have been found to exhibit interesting properties including the phenomenon of electrical switching which finds applications in Phase Change Memories (PCM). Studies on various thermal, electrical and photoelectrical properties of glassy tellurides help us in identifying suitable materials for different technological applications. This thesis deals with Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) & Temperature Modulated Alternating Differential Scanning Calorimetric (ADSC) studies, electrical switching investigations, photoconductivity & photothermal measurements on certain metal doped <b>telluride</b> <b>glasses.</b> The composition dependence of properties such as glass transition & crystallization temperatures, switching voltage, thermal diffusivity, photosensitivity, etc., have been analyzed to obtain information about topological thresholds, thermally reversing window, etc. The first chapter of thesis provides an overview of properties of amorphous semiconductors, in particular chalcogenide glasses. The local & defect structure, the electronic band structure & electrical properties, electrical switching behavior, etc., are discussed in detail. The theoretical aspects related to the experiments undertaken in this thesis work have also been described. The instrumentation used for various experiments conducted to measure thermal, electrical, photoelectrical and photothermal properties have been discussed in chapter two. The chapter three deals with the photocurrent measurements on As 40 Te 60 -xInx (7. 5 ≤ x ≤ 16. 5) glasses. In these samples, it has been found that the photocurrent increases with illumination, which is understood {{on the basis of the}} large dielectric constant and also due to the presence of a large number of positively charged defect states. Further, the composition dependence of the conductivity activation energy and the photosensitivity exhibit a maximum at x = 12. 5 (= 2. 65) and a minimum at x = 15. 0 (= 2. 70) which has been identified to be the Rigidity Percolation Threshold (RPT) and the Chemical Threshold (CT) respectively. The results of electrical switching, DSC and Photothermal Deflection (PTD) studies on As 20 Te 80 -xGax (7. 5 ≤ x ≤ 18. 5) glasses, undertaken to elucidate the network topological thresholds, are described in chapter four. It has been found that all the As 20 Te 80 -xGax glasses studied exhibit memory type electrical switching. The switching voltage (VT) of these glasses increases monotonically with x, in the composition range 7. 5 ≤ x ≤ 15. 0. The increase in VT with gallium addition leads to a local maximum at x = 15. 0 and VT decreases with x thereafter, reaching a distinct minimum at x = 17. 5. Based on the variation with composition of the electrical switching voltages, the composition x = 15. 0 and x = 17. 5 have been identified to be the rigidity percolation and chemical thresholds of the As 20 Te 80 -xGax glassy system respectively. Further, the DSC studies indicate that As 20 Te 80 -xGax glasses exhibit a single glass transition (Tg) and two crystallization reactions (Tc 1 & Tc 2) upon heating. There is no appreciable change in Tg of As 20 Te 80 -xGax glasses with the addition of upto about 10 atom% of Ga, whereas a continuous increase is seen in the crystallization temperature (Tc 1). It is interesting to note that both Tg and Tc 1 exhibit a maximum at x = 15. 0 and a minimum at x = 17. 5, the compositions identified to be the RPT and CT respectively by the switching experiments. The composition dependence of thermal diffusivity estimated from the PTD signal, indicate the occurrence of an extended stiffness transition in As 20 Te 80 -xGax glasses, with the compositions x = 9. 0 and x = 15. 0 being the onset and the completion of an extended rigidity percolation. A maximum and a minimum are seen in the thermal diffusivity respectively at these compositions. Further, a second maximum is seen in the thermal diffusivity of As 20 Te 80 -xGax glasses, the Chemical Threshold (CT) of the glassy system. The fifth chapter of the thesis describes the ADSC, electrical switching and photocurrent measurements on Ge 15 Te 85 -xInx (1 ≤ x ≤ 11) glasses. It is found there is not much change in the Tg of Ge 15 Te 85 -xInx glasses in the composition range 1 ≤ x ≤ 3. An increase is seen in Tg beyond x = 3, which continues until x = 11. Further, the composition dependence of non-reversing enthalpy shows the presence of a thermally reversing window in the compositions range x = 3 and x = 7. Electrical switching studies indicate that Ge 15 Te 85 -xInx glasses exhibit threshold type of switching at input currents below 2 mA. It is observed that switching voltages decrease initially with indium addition, exhibiting a minimum at x = 3, the onset of the extended rigidity percolation as revealed by ADSC. An increase is seen in VT above x = 3, which proceeds till x = 8, with a change in slope (lower to higher) seen around 7 atom% of indium which corresponds to the completion of the stiffness transition. The reversal in trend exhibited in the variation of VT at x = 8, leads to a well defined minimum around x = 9, the chemical threshold of the Ge 15 Te 85 -xInx glassy system. Photocurrent measurements indicate that there is no photodegradation in Ge 15 Te 85 -xInx glasses with x < 3, whereas samples with x ≥ 3 show photodegradation behavior. The composition dependent variation in the glass transition temperature has been attributed for this behavior. Further, the composition dependence of photo sensitivity has been found to show the signatures of the extended rigidity percolation and the chemical threshold in Ge 15 Te 85 -xInx glasses. The last chapter of thesis (chapter six) summarizes the results obtained and also the scope of future work to be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Efficient thermal poling of {{electronically}} conducting {{glass is}} prevented by the inherent difficulty {{to record a}} large electrostatic field within such glasses. To overcome this limitation, a waveguide/substrate configuration has been proposed, in which the glass for poling was deposited as a film of appropriate thickness on a substrate chosen for its higher ionic conductivity. Owing to this configuration, the poling voltage drops entirely across the glass film, allowing high electrostatic field to be recorded {{in spite of the}} high electronic conductivity of the glass. The proposed method was demonstrated here in the case of bismuth-zinc-borate glasses, which possess high potential for poling because of their high intrinsic chi(3). A four-fold enhancement of chi(2) compared to bulk glass, from ~ 0. 5 to ~ 2 pm/V, is demonstrated. It is also shown that the chi(2) values obtained are the highest sustainable by the glass limited by the onset of nonlinear conductivity. The waveguide/substrate configuration intrinsically allows obtaining perfect overlap of the poling induced second-order nonlinearity with the guiding region of the waveguide. An equivalent RC-circuit model describing the poled glass reveals that the value of the poling-induced second-order nonlinearity is strongly dependent on the ratio beta between ionic and electronic conductivity. The most promising glass systems for poling are found to be the ones displaying the highest product chi(3). beta. This work is performed on bismuth-zinc-borate heavy metal oxide glasses but the waveguide/substrate configuration proposed here is likely to be equally successful in enhancing the second-order nonlinearity in high chi(3) electronic conducting glasses such as for example <b>telluride</b> and chalcogenide <b>glasses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thin film {{solar cells}} {{with a band}} gap graded in the {{thickness}} direction were prepared by vacuum evaporation of various alloys of Cadmium Sulphide (CdS) and Cadmium <b>Telluride</b> (CdTe) onto <b>glass</b> substrates. Theoretical computer analyses were carried out and show that a solar cell with a graded band gap surface layer {{ought to be a}} more efficient photovoltaic converter than a conventional homojunction device. A vacuum evaporator capable of multiple simultaneous co-evaporations was built and used initially to deposit only the CdS and CdTe films and subsequently mixed and graded films of Cadmium Sulphide Telluride (CdS x Te 1 -x). The composition of the mixed and graded films was controlled by a set of shutters built above the sources, rather than by the control of the temperature of the sources. The electronic properties of the films were adjusted by co-evaporation of dopant materials such as Cadmium (Cd), Indium (In) and Copper (Cu), and measured by Hall Effect measurements. The physical properties of the films such as the band gap, crystal phase and grain size were investigated by optical transmission measurements, X-ray analysis and scanning electron microscopy respectively. Finally, p-n junctions with n-type graded band gap surface layers on top of either pure p-type CdTe films or mixed p-type CdS 0. 5 Te 0. 5 films were prepared. However, the photoresponse of these structures was low, probably due to very short minority carrier life-times, lack of low resistance contacts and cross diffusion of dopant materials. Nevertheless, the characteristics of individual materials and the spectral response of the devices indicated that if these problems could be solved, a successful solar cell could be made...|$|R
40|$|The Phase Change Memories (PCM) {{based on}} chalcogenide glasses are being {{considered}} {{recently as a}} possible replacement for conventional Non Volatile Random Access Memories (NVRAM). The main advantages of chalcogenide phase change memories are their direct write/overwrite capability, lower voltages of operation, large write/erase cycles, easiness to integrate with logic, etc. The phase change random access memories work {{on the principle of}} memory switching exhibited by chalcogenide glasses during which a local structural change (between amorphous and crystalline states) occurs due to an applied electric field. The development of newer phase change materials for NVRAM applications is based on synthesizing newer glass compositions and investigating their electrical switching characteristics by applying current/voltage pulses of different waveforms. The thermal studies on chalcogenide glasses which provide information about thermal stability, glass forming ability, etc., are also important while selecting a chalcogenide glass for PCM applications. The present thesis work deals with electrical switching and thermal studies on certain silicon based ternary <b>telluride</b> <b>glasses</b> (As-Te-Si, Ge-Te-Si and Al-Te-Si). The effect of network topological thresholds on the composition dependence of switching voltages and thermal parameters such as glass transition temperature, specific heat capacity, non-reversing enthalpy, etc., of these glasses has been investigated. The first chapter of the thesis provides an introduction to various properties of chalcogenide glasses, including their applications in phase change memories. The fundamental aspects of amorphous solids such as glass formation, glass transition, etc., are presented. Further, the concepts of rigidity percolation and self organization in glassy networks and the influence of local structural effects on the properties of glassy chalcogenides are discussed. Also, a brief history of evolution of phase change memories is presented. The second chapter deals with the experimental techniques employed in this thesis work; for sample preparation and for electrical switching studies, Alternating Differential Scanning Calorimetry (ADSC), Raman spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, etc. The third chapter discusses the electrical switching and thermal studies on As 30 Te 70 -xSix (2 ≤ x ≤ 22) and As 40 Te 60 -xSix (2 ≤ x ≤ 17) glasses. The composition dependence of electrical switching voltage (VT) and thermal parameters such as glass transition temperature (Tg), crystallization temperature (Tc), thermal stability (Tc-Tg), etc., reveals the occurrence of extended rigidity percolation and chemical thresholds in As 30 Te 70 -xSix and As 40 Te 60 -xSix glasses. Chapter 4 presents the electrical switching and thermal studies on Ge 15 Te 85 -xSix glasses (2 ≤ x ≤ 12). These glasses have been found to exhibit memory type electrical switching. While Ge 15 Te 85 -xSix glasses with x ≤ 5 exhibit a normal electrical switching, an unstable behavior is seen in the I-V characteristics of Ge 15 Te 85 -xSix glasses with x > 5 during the transition to ON state. Further, the switching voltage (VT) and initial resistance (R) are found to increase with addition of Si, exhibiting a change in slope at the rigidity percolation threshold of the Ge 15 Te 85 -xSix system. The ADSC studies on these glasses indicate the presence of an extended stiffness transition and a thermally reversing window in Ge 15 Te 85 -xSix in the composition range of 2 ≤ x ≤ 6. The fifth chapter deals with electrical switching investigations, thermal and structural studies on Al 15 Te 85 -xSix glasses (2 ≤ x ≤ 12). These glasses have been found to exhibit two crystallization reactions (Tc 1 and Tc 2) for compositions with x < 8 and a single stage crystallization is seen for compositions above x = 8. Also, a trough is seen in the composition dependence of non-reversing enthalpy (ΔHNR), based on which it is proposed that there is a thermally reversing window in Al 15 Te 85 -xSix glasses in the composition range 4 ≤ x ≤ 8. Further, Al 15 Te 85 -xSix glasses are found to exhibit a threshold type electrical switching at ON state currents less than 2 mA. The start {{and the end of the}} thermally reversing window seen in the thermal studies are exemplified by a kink and saturation in the composition dependence of switching voltages respectively. 27 Al Solid State NMR measurements reveal that in Al 15 Te 85 -xSix glasses, Al atoms reside in 4 -fold as well as 6 -fold coordinated environments. Unlike in Al-As-Te glasses, there is no correlation seen between the composition dependence of the fraction of 4 -fold and 6 -fold coordinated aluminum atoms and the switching behavior of Al-Te-Si samples. Chapter 6 provides a comparison of the properties of the three glassy systems studied (As-Te-Si, Ge-Te-Si and Al-Te-Si), made to identify the system better suited for phase change memory applications. It is found that the Ge-Te-Si glassy system has better electrical/thermal properties for phase change memory applications. The seventh chapter describes easily reversible SET-RESET processes in Ge 15 Te 83 Si 2 glass which is a promising candidate for phase change memory applications. This sample exhibits memory switching at a comparatively low threshold electric field (Eth) of 7. 3 kV/cm. The SET and RESET processes have been achieved with 1 mA triangular current pulse for the SET process and 1 mA rectangle pulse (of 10 msec width) for RESET operation respectively. Further, a self-resetting effect is seen in this material upon excitation with a saw-tooth/square pulse. About 6. 5 x 104 SET-RESET cycles have been achieved without any damage to the device. In chapter 8, results of in-situ Raman scattering studies on the structural changes occurring during the SET and RESET processes in Ge 15 Te 83 Si 2 sample, are presented. It is found that the degree of disorder in the glass is reduced from OFF to SET state. The local structure of the sample under RESET condition is similar to that in the OFF state. The Raman results are found to be consistent with the switching results which indicate that the Ge 15 Te 83 Si 2 glass can be SET and RESET easily. Further, Electron Microscopic studies on switched samples indicate the formation of nanometer sized particles of cSiTe 2. A summary of the results obtained and the scope for future work are included in the chapter 9 of the thesis...|$|R
