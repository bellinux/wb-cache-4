25|$|How <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> and matrix is {{deposited}} {{on the surface}} of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe needs to be a consideration in sample preparation as well. The dried drop method is the simplest of deposition methods. <b>The</b> matrix and <b>sample</b> solution are mixed together and then a small drop of the mixture is placed on <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe surface and allowed to dry, thus crystallizing. The sandwich method involves depositing a layer of matrix onto the surface of the probe and allowing it to dry. A drop of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> followed by a drop of additional matrix is then applied to the layer of dried matrix and allowed to dry as well. Variations on the sandwich technique involve depositing the matrix on the surface and then depositing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> directly on top of the matrix. A particularly useful method involves depositing the matrix solution {{on the surface of}} <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> probe in a solvent that will evaporate very rapidly, thus forming a very thin fine layer of matrix. <b>The</b> <b>sample</b> solution is then placed on top of the matrix layer and allowed to evaporate slowly, thus integrating <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> into <b>the</b> top layer of matrix as <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> solution evaporates. An addition concern when depositing <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> on <b>the</b> surface of the probe is the solubility of <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> in <b>the</b> matrix.

In {{sampling}} based hotspot detection, performance engineers <b>sample</b> <b>the</b> running program periodically {{and record}} the Instruction Pointer (IP) addresses at <b>the</b> <b>sampling.</b> Empirically, frequently sampled IP addresses are regarded as the hotspot of the program. The question of how well <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> hotspot IP addresses match the real hotspot {{of the program is}} seldom studied by the researchers. In this paper, we use instrumentation tool to count how many times <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> hotspot IP addresses are executed, and compare the real execution result with <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> one to see how well they match. We define the normalized root mean square error, <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> coverage and <b>the</b> order deviation to evaluate the difference between the real execution and <b>the</b> <b>sampled</b> results. Experiment on the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks with various sampling periods is performed to verify the proposed evaluation measurements. Intuitively, <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> accuracy decreases with <b>the</b> increase of <b>sampling</b> period. <b>The</b> experimental results reveal that the order deviation reflects the intuitive relation between <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> accuracy and <b>the</b> <b>sampling</b> period better than the normalized root mean square error and <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> coverage.
