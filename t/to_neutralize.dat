40|$|Pure {{red cell}} aplasia (PRCA) due <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> {{antibodies}} can rarely develop following treatment with epoetin. The treatment of this condition is generally unsatisfactory and immunosuppression is often recommended, which improves chances of hematological recovery. We describe {{a case of}} PRCA due <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> anti-epoetin antibodies following therapy with epoetin-α in a 68 -year-old man on hemodialysis. He presented with severe transfusion-dependent anemia and was initially treated with prednisolone and oral cyclophosphamide. However, within 2 weeks the immunosuppressive drugs had to be stopped due to complications, following which he remained transfusion dependent.

40|$|Serial {{passage of}} the {{prototype}} (PR) cell-adapted Wyoming strain of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) in fetal donkey dermal (FDD) rather than fetal horse (designated fetal equine kidney [FEK]) cell cultures resulted in the generation of a variant virus strain which produced accelerated cytopathic effects in FDD cells and was 100 - to 1, 000 -fold more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies than its parent. This neutralization-sensitive variant was designated the FDD strain. Although there were differences in glycosylation between the PR and FDD strains, {{passage of the}} FDD virus in FEK cells did not reduce its sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> antibody. Nucleotide sequencing of the region encoding the surface unit (SU) protein from the FDD strain revealed nine amino acid substitutions compared with the PR strain. Two of these substitutions resulted in changes in the polarity of charge, four caused {{the introduction of a}} charged residue, and three had no net change in charge. Nucleotide sequence analysis was extended to the region of the FDD virus genome encoding the extracellular domain of the transmembrane envelope glycoprotein (TM). Unlike the situation with the FDD virus coding region, there were minor variations in nucleotide sequence between individual molecular clones containing this region of the TM gene. Although each clone contained three nucleotide substitutions compared with the PR strain, only one of these was common to all, and this did not affect the amino acid content. Of the remaining two nucleotide substitutions, only one resulted in an amino acid change, and in each case, this change appeared to be conservative. To determine if amino acid substitutions in the SU protein of FDD cell-grown viruses were responsible for the enhanced sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies, chimeric viruses were constructed by using an infectious molecular clone of EIAV. These chimeric viruses contained all of the amino acid substitutions found in the FDD virus strain and were significantly more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies than viruses from the parental (PR) molecular clone. These results demonstrated that sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies in EIAV can be conferred by amino acid residues in the SU protein. However, such amino acid substitutions were not sufficient to enhance cytopathogenicity, as the chimeric viruses did not cause excessive degenererative effects in FDD cells, as was observed with the parental FDD virus strain...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{rapid and}} continual viral escape from {{neutralizing}} antibodies {{is well documented}} in HIV- 1 infection. Here we report in vivo emergence of viruses with heightened sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies, sometimes paralleling the development of neutralization escape. Methodology/Principal Findings: Sequential viral envs were amplified from seven HIV- 1 infected men monitored from seroconversion up to 5 years after infection. Env-recombinant infectious molecular clones were generated and tested for coreceptor use, macrophage tropism and neutralization sensitivity to homologous and heterologous serum, soluble CD 4 and monoclonal antibodies IgG 1 b 12, 2 G 12 and 17 b. We found that HIV- 1 evolves sensitivity <b>to</b> contemporaneous <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies during infection. Neutralization sensitive viruses grow out even when potent autologous neutralizing antibodies are present in patient serum. Increased sensitivity to neutralization was associated with susceptibility of the CD 4 binding site or epitopes induced after CD 4 binding, and mediated by complex envelope determinants including V 3 and V 4 residues. The development of neutralization sensitive viruses occurred without clinical progression, coreceptor switch or change in tropism for primary macrophages. Conclusions: We propose that an interplay of selective forces for greater virus replication efficiency without the need <b>to</b> resist <b>neutralizing</b> antibodies in a compartment protected from immune surveillance may explain the temporal cours...|$|R

After the coupling optimization of VLPs to microspheres and the neutralizing mAbs biotinylation, the 2 -plex standard curve was prepared with good fit and high dynamic range.

40|$|A {{search was}} made in LCM virus-immune mice for virus-specific antibodies. With {{the help of an}} L-cell plaque assay, {{neutralizing}} antibody was readily detected. There were no essential differences between mouse strains, but marked differences existed between virus strains.

In addition <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> antibody, LCM virus-infected mice produced sensitizing antibody (detected by the enhancing effect of an anti-mouse lg anti-serum on the ability of a serum to reduce virus infectivity) and complement-fixing antibody.

40|$|Seasonal {{influenza}} A viruses (IAV) {{originate from}} pandemic IAV and have undergone changes in antigenic structure, including addition of glycans to the viral hemagglutinin (HA). Glycans {{on the head}} of HA promote virus survival by shielding antigenic sites, but highly glycosylated seasonal IAV are inactivated by soluble lectins of the innate immune system. In 2009, human strains of pandemic H 1 N 1 [A(H 1 N 1) pdm] expressed a single glycosylation site (Asn(104)) {{on the head of}} HA. Since then, variants with additional glycosylation sites have been detected, and the location of these sites has been distinct to those of recent seasonal H 1 N 1 strains. We have compared wild-type and reverse-engineered A(H 1 N 1) pdm IAV with differing potential glycosylation sites on HA for sensitivity to collectins and <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> Abs. Addition of a glycan (Asn(136)) to A(H 1 N 1) pdm HA was associated with resistance <b>to</b> <b>neutralizing</b> Abs but did not increase sensitivity to collectins. Moreover, variants expressing Asn(136) showed enhanced growth in A(H 1 N 1) pdm-vaccinated mice, consistent with evasion of Ab-mediated immunity in vivo. Thus, a fine balance exists regarding the optimal pattern of HA glycosylation to facilitate evasion of Ab-mediated immunity while maintaining resistance to lectin-mediated defenses of the innate immune system.
