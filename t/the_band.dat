After many years apart, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall and a short tour in 2005. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> has continued as a trio of Hammill, Banton, and Evans, who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career.|$|E
5|$|After the touring {{process for}} the album was over, Tom Gomes left <b>the</b> <b>band</b> and was {{replaced}} by Justin Foley. This line-up of Killswitch Engage would last until early 2012, when Jones left <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> Following Jones' departure, Jesse Leach rejoined <b>the</b> <b>band</b> on the ten-year anniversary of Alive or Just Breathing.|$|E

5|$|Elmore {{requested}} {{a leave of}} absence from Northwestern Law School in 2001 to focus on <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> After ex-Nymb drummer Ben Kane replaced the unavailable Rosenquist, the group signed to Initial Records. Kane left <b>the</b> <b>band,</b> and former Sarge drummer Chad Romanski joined the group after several weeks of Elmore begging. <b>The</b> <b>band</b> completed a fall West Coast tour and began recording their debut album with Romanski. <b>The</b> <b>band</b> took on the name The Reputation at this time.|$|E
5|$|Following the Elliot Minor tour, {{the group}} began writing {{material}} for their debut album. In late November and early December, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> went {{on their first}} headlining tour of the UK, with support from Flood of Red. During the latter month, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> wrote further material. All of the songs on the album were written and arranged by themselves. Typically, Helyer or Franceschi would have an idea that <b>the</b> <b>band</b> would then flesh out together. Occasionally, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> would record demos and change sections of them.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Labonte {{was asked}} to leave <b>the</b> <b>band</b> due to {{personal}} and artistic differences.

After a US Summer tour with Shai Hulud, Overcast disbanded and <b>the</b> <b>band</b> asked Fair if he would like to join Shadows Fall. While on tour Shadows Fall was signed to Century Media Records. <b>The</b> <b>band</b> recorded its second studio album Of One Blood with Fair on vocals in 2000, and the release included re-recorded songs from Somber Eyes to the Sky. In 2001, David Germain decided to leave <b>the</b> <b>band</b> due to alcoholism, and was replaced by former Stigmata and Burning Human drummer Jason Bittner.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> {{played a}} series of low-key concerts as The Dangermen, {{performing}} covers of classic reggae and ska songs.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>band's</b> {{relationship}} with Asian Man Records also yielded a Japanese release Superpositive, a retrospective of <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> earlier releases. It {{was to be}} <b>the</b> <b>band's</b> last release. Mealticket disbanded in 1997 amicably.|$|R

Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> played in Middle East countries such as the United Arab Emirates and India for the first time. <b>The</b> <b>band</b> also played a few select dates in California and Canada in late July.

These shows were opened by Joan Jett. <b>The</b> <b>band</b> also played a private gig in Hawaii. A public show in Maui was canceled for logistical reasons, which spurred a class action lawsuit against <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> In April 2009, Aerosmith agreed to compensate all ticket buyers of the canceled show with a free ticket to a rescheduled Maui show to be held on October 20, 2009, along with reimbursements of all out-of-pocket expenses related to the show.|$|E
5|$|Johnny Rioux, who had {{produced}} Flatfoot 56's last album, Black Thorn, {{was chosen as}} the album's producer. <b>The</b> <b>band</b> felt that having the same producer improved communication and allowed <b>the</b> <b>band</b> to work more freely. According to frontman Tobin Bawinkel, this familiarity allowed Rioux to encourage <b>the</b> <b>band</b> to advance musically and think differently. During January 2012, <b>the</b> <b>band</b> recorded the entire album at the Atlas Studios in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|Josh Grier, Wilco's lawyer, {{was able}} to {{negotiate}} a buy-out of <b>the</b> <b>band</b> from Reprise. <b>The</b> <b>band</b> would keep {{the rights to the}} album if they paid Reprise $50,000.

Soon after the announcement of Jones's departure, rumors began that Phil Labonte of All That Remains would officially take over lead vocals due to his previous history with <b>the</b> <b>band,</b> although Labonte quickly dispelled the rumor. Many vocalists were considered in the search for a new one for <b>the</b> <b>band.</b> The band's search for a new singer concluded in February with the announcement that original lead vocalist Jesse Leach would return to <b>the</b> <b>band,</b> as <b>the</b> <b>band</b> felt that Leach's energy, as well as his overall comfort and command of both the old and new material, made him the clear choice during auditions.
