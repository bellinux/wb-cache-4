The east side includes the neighborhoods of Buckeye-Shaker, Central, Collinwood, Corlett, Euclid-Green, Fairfax, Forest Hills, Glenville, Payne/Goodrich-Kirtland Park, Hough, Kinsman, Lee Harvard/Seville-Miles, Mount Pleasant, Nottingham, St. Clair-Superior, Union-Miles Park, University, Little Italy, and Woodland Hills. The west side includes the neighborhoods of Brooklyn Centre, Clark-Fulton, Detroit-Shoreway, Cudell, Edgewater, Ohio City, Tremont, Old Brooklyn, Stockyards, West Boulevard, and the four neighborhoods colloquially known as West Park: Kamm's Corners, Jefferson, Puritas-Longmead, and Riverside. Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the south side: Industrial Valley/Duck Island, Slavic Village (North and South Broadway), and Tremont.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

25|$|The main {{evidence}} used by {{the prosecution}} in the trial were over thirty years of poetry and prose written by Su Shi. This was collected from many of his associates, and printed editions from the market place were also considered. The analysis as to the meanings and implications of Su Shi's writings was not clear-cut, in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> they were actually treasonous, or whether {{they were in the}} bounds of acceptable expression. Much of Su Shi's testimony revolved around these points, and what was said versus what he intended to imply, a matter much open to interpretation, much of it of an erudite nature, involving scholarly allusions, often obscure, dating back over a millennium and more of a continuous literary tradition.|$|E
25|$|The Penn State child {{sex abuse}} scandal was an {{incident}} in which Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach for the Penn State Nittany Lions, was charged and convicted of multiple counts of sexual abuse of children. Sandusky had located and groomed victims through his charity organization, The Second Mile. Also implicated were several Penn State University officials, whose alleged actions were questioned in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> they met ethical, moral, and legal obligations in reporting any suspected abuse. The scandal broke in early November 2011 when Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation. Although Sandusky's abuse may have begun in the 1970s, {{he was charged with}} abuse that occurred between 1994 and 2009. Additionally, three school officials (including school president Graham Spanier and athletic director Tim Curley) were charged with perjury, obstruction of justice, failure to report suspected child abuse, and related charges. Shortly after the scandal broke, Spanier resigned. The Penn State Board of Trustees terminated the contracts of Curley and of the longtime head football coach, Joe Paterno.|$|E
25|$|The tournament {{scene is}} very formal with a long, {{ceremonial}} introduction, {{but as the}} combatants are about to fight, Richard interrupts and sentences both to banishment from England. Bolingbroke is originally sentenced to ten years' banishment, but Richard reduces this to six years upon seeing John of Gaunt's grieving face, while Mowbray is banished permanently. The king's decision {{can be seen as}} the first mistake in a series leading eventually to his overthrow and death, since it is an error which highlights many of his character flaws, displaying as it does indecisiveness (in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> to allow the duel to go ahead), abruptness (Richard waits until the last possible moment to cancel the duel), and arbitrariness (there is no apparent reason why Bolingbroke should be allowed to return and Mowbray not). In addition, the decision fails to dispel the suspicions surrounding Richard's involvement in the death of the Duke of Gloucester – in fact, by handling the situation so high-handedly and offering no coherent explanation for his reasoning, Richard only manages to appear more guilty. Mowbray predicts that the king will sooner or later fall at the hands of Bolingbroke.|$|E

50|$|One {{advance on}} the {{political}} process theory is the political mediation model, which outlines {{the way in which}} the political context facing movement actors intersects with the strategic choices that movements make. An additional strength of this model is that it can look at the outcomes of social movements not only in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> success or failure but also in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> consequences (<b>whether</b> intentional or unintentional, positive or negative) and in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> collective benefits.|$|R

500|$|On the facts, the Court {{held that}} a plain reading of section8 of the ISA {{suggests}} that where a decision is made that it is [...] "necessary" [...] to detain someone [...] "with a view to preventing that person from acting in any manner prejudicial {{to the security of}} Singapore", the decision will clearly be based on national security considerations. Whether detention is necessary is a matter solely for the executive's judgment.

The process of resolving conflicting claims to reach an equilibrium is called [...] "justice operation". Kohlberg identifies two of these justice operations: [...] "equality", which involves an impartial regard for persons, and [...] "reciprocity", which means a regard for the role of personal merit. For Kohlberg, the most adequate result of both operations is [...] "reversibility", in which a moral or dutiful act within a particular situation is evaluated in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> or not the act would be satisfactory even if particular persons were to switch roles within that situation (also known colloquially as [...] "moral musical chairs").|$|E

Examples include—Beings: well fed, sheltered, healthy; Doings: work, education, voting, participating in community life. It must also be noted that the freedom of choice is central—someone choosing to be hungry (e.g. during a religious fast) is quite different to someone who is hungry because they cannot afford to buy food.|$|E
2500|$|Broadly speaking, the {{categories}} for shanties {{can be understood}} in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>whether</b> the task(s) {{for which they were}} used was/were related to hauling or heaving. [...] "Hauling" [...] (pulling) actions were intermittent in nature. They required a coordinated show of focused exertion, not sustained, but rather at specific moments. Shanties for hauling tasks thus coordinated the timing of those exertions, the [...] "pulls." [...] "Heaving" [...] (pushing) actions were of a continuous nature. In these, coordination was of minor importance as compared to pacing. Rather than rhythmically timing the labor, shanties for heaving were more intended to set an appropriate, manageable pace and to occupy or inspire workers throughout the duration of what could often be long tasks.|$|E

He argues formalism should be conceptually rethought, not in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> merely <b>whether</b> it is a good or bad thing, but rather in <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> how language both can and should be used to restrict the power of decision-makers in the decision-making process.|$|R
