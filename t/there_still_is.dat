5|$|The Poles {{had little}} {{interest}} or desire {{to support the}} French cause in the distant colonies, once again fighting against people who only desired their own independence. In Haiti <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> a popular myth that many Polish soldiers became sympathetic to the former slaves' cause and deserted the French, supporting Jean-Jacques Dessalines in significant numbers, with entire units changing sides. In fact, the actual desertion rate was much lower; nonetheless about 150 Polish soldiers joined the Haitian rebels. The loss of that many patriotic military personnel in the Caribbean was a serious blow to the Polish aspirations for regaining independence. The Haitian experience cast further doubts among Poles about France's and Napoleon's good intentions toward Poland.|$|E

Note that <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> some embrittlement of the workpiece. While this process does not cause problems with hydrogen embrittlement, and electroplating does, it still offers equivalent corrosion protection. There is a great cost savings in using mechanical plating over electroplating on hardened workpieces, because the electroplating processes requires a pre- and post-plating operation to overcome hydrogen embrittlement problems. Moreover, because mechanical plating occurs at room temperature there is no tempering of hardened workpieces.|$|E

If you find his motive, you find the murderer". Kaner argues that this logic is {{more in line with}} what Mulder has subscribed to throughout the series. Furthermore, after Mulder discovers Padgett's manuscript, he arrests him [...] "without a second thought". By relying on empirical logic, Mulder is acting in the way Scully normally thinks.|$|E

500|$|The Greeks {{could not}} {{comprehend}} {{an absence of}} slaves. Slaves exist even in the [...] "" [...] of Aristophanes' The Birds {{as well as in}} the ideal cities of Plato's Laws or Republic. The utopian cities of Phaleas of Chalcedon and Hippodamus of Miletus are based on the equal distribution of property, but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen and land workers. The [...] "reversed cities" [...] placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in Lysistrata or Assemblywomen, but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the Golden Age, where all needs were met without anyone having to work. In this type of society, as explained by Plato, one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' Amphictyons barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honor of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves—dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Similarly, Aristotle said that slaves would not be necessary [...] "if every instrument could accomplish its own work... the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them", like the legendary constructs of Daedalus and Hephaestus. Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a [...] "normal" [...] society, one needs slaves. Aristotle argues that slave are a necessity though, saying [...] "Property is part of the household,... For no man can live well or indeed live at all, unless he provided with necessaries." [...] He also argues that slaves are the most important part of the property as they [...] "take precedence of all the instruments." [...] This would suggest that at least some slaves would be treated well for the same reason one would take great care of their most important tools. By viewing slaves as tools of a household, it creates another reason for acceptance of slavery. Aristotle says [...] "indeed the use of slaves and of tame animals is not very different," [...] showing as well that at least in part, some slaves were thought of no higher than the common tamed animals in use at the time. Antiphon viewed slaves as a bit more than common animals or tools. On the topic of a man killing his own slave, he says that the man should [...] "purify himself and withhold himself from those places prescribed by law, in the hope that by doing so he will best avoid disaster." [...] This suggests that <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> some sense of inappropriateness in killing a slave, even one owned by the killer.|$|E

2500|$|As {{butterfly}} originated as {{a variant}} on breaststroke, {{it would be}} performed with a breaststroke or whip kick by some swimmers. [...] While breaststroke was separated from butterfly in 1953, the breaststroke kick in butterfly was not officially outlawed until 2001. However a number of Masters swimmers were upset with the change since they came from a time when butterfly was usually swum with a breaststroke kick. [...] FINA was then convinced to allow a breaststroke kick in Masters swimming. [...] Given the option, most swimmers choose to use a dolphin kicking action, but <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> {{a small minority of}} swimmers who prefer the breaststroke kick, for recreational swimming and even for competition.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the case}} where no Kohanim {{are present in the}} synagogue (but <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> a minyan) the hazzan will read the prayer verse by verse, and the {{congregation}} will respond after each verse with [...] "ken yehi ratzon" [...] (May it be God's Will). This response is used instead of [...] "Amen", because the hazzan is merely [...] "mentioning" [...] the blessing, essentially quoting it rather than actually performing the ritual. However, some congregations (including Chabad) do indeed respond [...] "Amen". This response is also employed on days and times when the Amidah is repeated but the Kohanim do not recite the priestly blessing. However, according to Abudirham, since the Priestly Blessing is not a conventional benediction (that would begin with [...] "Blessed are You ..."), but rather a prayer for peace, ken yehi ratzon is the more appropriate response at all times.|$|E
2500|$|<b>There</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> controversy, however. Scientists such as Jared Diamond in The Third Chimpanzee, and Morris Goodman of Wayne State University in Detroit {{suggest that}} the bonobo and common {{chimpanzee}} are so closely related to humans that their genus name also should be classified with the human genus Homo: Homo paniscus, Homo sylvestris, or Homo arboreus. An alternative philosophy suggests that the term Homo sapiens is the misnomer [...] rather, and that humans should be reclassified as Pan sapiens, though this would violate the Principle of Priority, as Homo was named before Pan (1758 for the former, 1816 for the latter). In either case, a name change of the genus would have implications on the taxonomy of extinct species closely related to humans, including Australopithecus. The current line between Homo and non-Homo species is drawn about 2.5 million years ago, and chimpanzee and human ancestry converge only about 7 million years ago, {{with the emergence of}} Sahelanthropus, nearly three times longer.|$|E

2500|$|The Jewish {{population}} in the Old Kingdom, numbering between 300,000 and 400,000 people, survived the Holocaust almost intact. Reflecting on this fact, Lucian Boia noted that Antonescu could not [...] "decently" [...] {{be viewed as a}} rescuer of Jews, but that <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> a fundamental difference between the effects of his rule and those of Hitler's, concluding that the overall picture is not [...] "completely dark." [...] For Dennis Deletant, this situation is a [...] "major paradox" [...] of Antonescu's time in power: [...] "more Jews survived under [...] rule than in any other country within Axis Europe." [...] American historian of Romania William O. Oldson views Antonescu's policies as characterized by [...] "violence, inconsistency and inanity", but places them in the wider context of local antisemitism, noting some ideological exceptions from their respective European counterparts. These traits, he argues, became [...] "providential" [...] for the more assimilated Jewish communities of the Old Romanian Kingdom, while exposing Jews perceived as foreign. Discussing Antonescu's policy of ethnic cleansing, Polonksy and Mihlic note: [...] " [...] raises important questions about the thin line between the desire to expel an unwanted minority and a small-scale genocidal project under sanctioned conditions." [...] American military historian Gerhard L. Weinberg made reference to the Antonescu regime's [...] "slaughter of large number of Jews in the areas ceded to the Soviet Union in 1940 when those areas were retaken in 1941 as well as in [...] Transnistria", but commented: [...] "the government of Marshal Ion Antonescu preferred to rob and persecute Jews the government would not turn them over to the Germans for killing." ...|$|E
