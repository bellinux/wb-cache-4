5|$|Although some guides {{indicate}} {{the species is}} edible with suitable preparation (such as boiling), it is generally not recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other toxic Gyromitra species that contain the compound gyromitrin. When boiled in water, or digested in the body, this compound is readily hydrolyzed to the <b>toxic</b> <b>compound</b> monomethylhydrazine—used as a propellant in some rocket fuels.|$|E
5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the <b>toxic</b> <b>compound</b> gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of water, consumption is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the <b>toxic</b> <b>compound</b> monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E

5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the <b>toxic</b> <b>compound</b> gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, {{and for this reason}} it is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{clinical}} use of osmium {{appears to be}} for synovectomy in arthritic patients in Scandinavia. It involves the local administration of osmium tetroxide (OsO4), which is a highly <b>toxic</b> <b>compound.</b> The lack of reports of long-term side effects suggest that osmium itself can be biocompatible, although this depends on the osmium compound administered. In 2011, osmium(VI) and osmium(II) compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo, it indicated a promising future for using osmium compounds as anticancer drugs.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} <b>toxic</b> <b>compound</b> themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. Phyllobates frogs kept in captivity do not develop the toxins, {{and the extent of}} the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the skins and feathers rules out the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E

These <b>toxic</b> <b>compounds</b> are classified in four groups: 1) furan derivatives, 2) pentose and hexose degradation, 3) weak acids, and 4) phenolic compounds from lignin [81].

25|$|Phosphine (PH3) and its organic {{derivatives}} (PR3) are structural analogues with ammonia (NH3) but {{the bond}} angles at phosphorus {{are closer to}} 90° for phosphine and its organic derivatives. It is an ill-smelling, <b>toxic</b> <b>compound.</b> Phosphorus has an oxidation number of -3 in phosphine. Phosphine is produced by hydrolysis of calcium phosphide, Ca3P2. Unlike ammonia, phosphine is oxidised by air. Phosphine is also far less basic than ammonia. Other phophines are known which contain chains of up to nine phosphorus atoms and have the formula PnHn+2. The highly flammable gas diphosphine (P2H4) is an analogue of hydrazine.|$|E
25|$|Thallium, unlike gallium and indium, is {{extremely}} toxic, and has caused many poisoning deaths. Its most noticeable effect, apparent even from tiny doses, is hair loss {{all over the}} body, but it causes {{a wide range of}} other symptoms, disrupting and eventually halting the functions of many organs. The nearly colorless, odorless and tasteless nature of thallium compounds has led to their use by murderers. The incidence of thallium poisoning, intentional and accidental, increased when thallium (with its similarly <b>toxic</b> <b>compound,</b> thallium sulfate) was introduced to control rats and other pests. The use of thallium pesticides has therefore been prohibited since 1975 in many countries, including the USA.|$|E
25|$|Avocado leaves {{contain a}} toxic fatty acid derivative, persin, which in {{sufficient}} quantity can cause colic in horses and without veterinary treatment, death. The symptoms include gastrointestinal irritation, vomiting, diarrhea, respiratory distress, congestion, fluid accumulation around the tissues of the heart, and even death. Birds also seem to be particularly sensitive to this <b>toxic</b> <b>compound.</b> A line of premium dog and cat food, AvoDerm, uses oils and meal made from avocado meat as main ingredients. The manufacturer says the avocado's leaves and pit {{are the source of}} toxicity, and only in the Guatemalan variety of avocados, and the fruit is often eaten by orchard dogs as well as wildlife such as bears and coyotes.|$|E

25|$|The Chisso Minamata factory {{first started}} {{acetaldehyde}} production in 1932, producing 210tons that year. By 1951, production had jumped to 6,000tons {{per year and}} reached a peak of 45,245 tons in 1960. Throughout, the Chisso factory's output amounted to between a quarter {{and a third of}} Japan's total acetaldehyde production. The chemical reaction used to produce the acetaldehyde used mercury sulfate as a catalyst. Starting August 1951, the co-catalyst was changed from manganese dioxide to ferric sulfide. A side reaction of this catalytic cycle led to the production of a small amount of an organic mercury compound, namely methylmercury. This highly <b>toxic</b> <b>compound</b> was released into Minamata Bay from the change of the co-catalyst in 1951 until 1968, when this production method was discontinued.|$|E
500|$|The {{most common}} {{compound}} exhibiting the +8 oxidation state is osmium tetroxide. This <b>toxic</b> <b>compound</b> is formed when powdered osmium {{is exposed to}} air. It is a very volatile, water-soluble, pale yellow, crystalline solid with a strong smell. Osmium powder has the characteristic smell of osmium tetroxide. Osmium tetroxide forms red osmates [...] upon reaction with a base. With ammonia, it forms the nitrido-osmates [...] Osmium tetroxide boils at 130°C and is a powerful oxidizing agent. By contrast, osmium dioxide (OsO2) is black, non-volatile, and much less reactive and toxic.|$|E
500|$|Gyromitra infula, {{commonly}} known as the hooded false morel or the elfin saddle, is a fungus in the family Helvellaceae. The dark reddish-brown caps of the fruit bodies develop a characteristic saddle-shape in maturity, and the ends of both saddle lobes are drawn out to sharp tips that project above the level of the fruit body. The stipe is white or flushed pale brown, smooth on the outside, but hollow with some chambers inside. It is found in the Northern Hemisphere, usually in the late summer and autumn, growing on rotting wood or on hard packed ground. G.infula is considered inedible as it contains the <b>toxic</b> <b>compound</b> gyromitrin, which, when metabolized by the body, is converted into monomethylhydrazine, a component of some rocket fuels. The toxin may be removed by thorough cooking. Gyromitra fungi are included in the informal category [...] "false morels".|$|E

40|$|AbstractMany {{aspects of}} {{physiology}} and behavior in organisms from bacteria to man {{are subjected to}} circadian regulation. Indeed, the major function of the circadian clock consists in the adaptation of physiology to daily environmental change and the accompanying stresses such as exposition to UV-light and food-contained <b>toxic</b> <b>compounds.</b> In this way, most aspects of xenobiotic detoxification are subjected to circadian regulation. These phenomena are now considered as the molecular basis for the time-dependence of drug toxicities and efficacy. However, there is now evidences that these <b>toxic</b> <b>compounds</b> can, in turn, regulate circadian gene expression and thus influence circadian rhythms. As food {{seems to be the}} major regulator of peripheral clock, the possibility that food-contained <b>toxic</b> <b>compounds</b> participate in the entrainment of the clock will be discussed...|$|R
