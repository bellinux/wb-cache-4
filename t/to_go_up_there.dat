Having visited the country many times as a youth, he remarked that after reading about the profits to be made from tobacco he [...] "suddenly got a rush of blood to the crotch about the tobacco boom and decided I was going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and make the family fortune in a place I liked and wanted to be in." [...] He welcomed the move as it allowed him to indulge his hobby of big game hunting: in that year in Angola, then under Portuguese rule, he set a world record for the biggest {{elephant}} shot, which stood until 1955.|$|E
500|$|Appalachian State had {{routinely}} scheduled FBS teams, {{playing against}} schools such as LSU (2005), Auburn (1999), Kansas (2005), and NC State (2006). They also had games against Wake Forest in every season from 1979 to 1996, {{as well as}} in 1998, 2000, and 2001. Appalachian State had won six of these games, all of them against Wake Forest. The Mountaineers had not beaten an FBS team since 2000. Michigan, a historic college football power with a large fan base, had never played an FCS team. According to Appalachian State athletic director Charlie Cobb, both schools had gaps in their schedule as late as February 2007; the friendship between Mountaineers coach Jerry Moore and Wolverines coach Lloyd Carr {{played a key role in}} completing the deal. While attempting to determine the amount of money Appalachian State would be paid for playing Michigan, negotiations between the two schools reached a halt. Moore went to school officials and urged them to accept any offer Michigan gave them; he recalled telling them that [...] "It's an opportunity game. It'll be a one-shot, once-in-a-lifetime deal <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and play. It's an unbelievable environment." [...] Appalachian State ultimately settled on a $400,000 payment in return for playing against Michigan to open the 2007 season.|$|E

50|$|Later in August, Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) {{is doing}} a loft {{conversion}} for Tyrone, and Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) was putting more boards in {{the floor of the}} loft. Jason and Todd leave for the Rovers and warn Tyrone <b>to</b> not <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> Tyrone does though, to video what he is going to do in the loft. He stands on the ladder but falls and crashes through the floor. He has a bloody nose and forehead, 2 broken ribs and a broken wrist. The thing is, Todd put unsteady boards up. Gary Windass (Mikey North) finds out what Todd did and tells Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard). Tony then shouts at Todd.|$|R

"Oh, he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Captain Skinner's {{the first}} of March, chores round, and <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> school <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> Captain is strict, and won't let Bob come to town, except Sundays; but he don't mind it much, for he likes horses, has nice grub, and the Hill fellows are good chaps {{for him to be}} with. So he's all right, if he only behaves." ...|$|R

60|$|Slone {{yielded to}} his strange, wild joy, {{but it did}} not last long, soon {{succeeding}} to sober, keen thought. He rode down into the bowl a mile, making absolutely certain that Wildfire could not climb out on that side. The far end, beyond the monuments, was a sheer wall of rock. Then he crossed to the left side. Here the sandy slope was almost too steep for even him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up.</b> And <b>there</b> was grass that would burn. He returned to the pass assured that Wildfire had at last fallen into a trap the like Slone had never dreamed of. The great horse was doomed to run into living flame or the whirling noose of a lasso.|$|R
60|$|If {{the room}} to which my bed was removed were a sentient thing that could give evidence, I might appeal to it at this day--who sleeps there now, I wonder!--to bear witness for me what a heavy heart I carried <b>to</b> it. I <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> hearing the dog in the yard bark after {{me all the way}} while I climbed the stairs; and, looking as blank and strange upon the room as the room looked upon me, sat down with my small hands crossed, and thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very," [...] said Rollo. [...] "At least, I did {{not think}} so; but uncle George {{told me it was}} a very famous gallery. There were a great many other rooms besides, all carved and gilded most magnificently, and an immense {{staircase}} of marble, wide enough for an army <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> and down. <b>There</b> were several large rooms, too, full of ancient marble statues; but I did not like them very much. They looked very dark and dingy. The paintings were prettier than they.|$|R

60|$|Near me was {{a solitary}} fir tree with a bushy top. The bird, whoever he was, had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> sleep <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> close against the trunk, as birds do, for protection. During the night the soft snow {{gathered}} thicker and thicker upon the flexible branches. Their tips bent with the weight till they touched the trunk below, forming a green bower, about which the snow packed all night long, till it was completely closed in. The bird was a prisoner inside, and singing as the morning sun shone in through {{the walls of his}} prison-house.|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{was also}} {{ready for a}} dinner, {{especially}} for such excellent little dinners of beefsteaks, fried potatoes, nice bread and butter, and coffee, as his uncle usually ordered. So, after refreshing themselves a few minutes in their room, Mr. George and Rollo went down stairs in order <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{into the dining room}} to call for a dinner. As they passed through the hall, they saw a door there which opened out upon beautifully ornamented grounds behind the house. The land ascended very suddenly, it is true, but there were broad gravel paths of easy grade <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> by; and <b>there</b> were groves, and copses of shrubbery, and blooming flowers, in great abundance, on every hand. On looking up, too, Rollo saw several seats, at different elevations, where he supposed there must be good views.|$|R
6000|$|And thus, {{in a word}} or two, I have {{finished}} the first {{two parts of the}} text, and showed you what there is in Peter's counsel and advice; and showed you also, to whom his advice is given: in which last, as you see, I have showed you both what the will of God is, and what to suffer according to it. And particularly, I have, in a few words, handled this last, to show you that our sufferings are ordered and disposed by him, that you might always, when you come into trouble for his name, not stagger nor be at a loss, but be stayed, composed, and settled in your minds, and say, [...] "The will of the Lord be done" [...] (Acts 21:14). I will also say unto you this by the way, that the will of God doth greatly work, even to order and dispose of the spirits of Christians, in order to willingness, disposedness, readiness, and resignation of ourselves to the mind of God. For with respect to this were those words last recited spoken. Paul saw that he had a call <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Jerusalem, <b>there</b> to bear his testimony for Christ and his gospel; but those unto whom he made know his purpose entreated him, with much earnestness, not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> thither, for that, as they believed, it would endanger his life. But he answereth, What, mean ye to weep, and to break my heart? for I am ready, not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. And when he would not be persuaded, says Luke, we ceased, saying, [...] "The will of the Lord be done." [...] From what has been thus discoursed, many things will follow; as, ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{next day}} Mrs. Elwell said, [...] "Ches, Abner Stearns wants you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> for a {{fortnight}} while Tom Bixby is away, {{and drive the}} milk wagon of mornings and do the chores for Mrs. Stearns. You might as well put in the time 'fore harvest that way as any other. So hustle off--and mind you behave yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, my love, that's a joke; as if I hadn't {{heard you}} {{say the same thing}} twenty times. You've complained of having <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> much more bitterly than I ever did. You know I like your sister, and, in his way, Gazebee is a very good fellow; but after three or four hours, one begins to have had enough of him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Miccinio grabs Domenico, {{and drags}} him {{away into the}} forest. It {{is at this point}} that Domenico remembers what Miccinio told him he would do to him if he disobeyed his commands, and passes out from shock. When he comes to, he finds himself at an {{entrance}} of the cave with Miccinio. Miccinio suddenly unbinds Domenico and tells him that he is Alexandro's older brother, and that it was he who protected Domenico from death during his stay at Camoora. Domenico is stunned, and Miccinio explains that all of the rumors surrounding him are just that - rumors, and that the people he drags away to [...] "torture and kill" [...] are actually released and leave the country, just like Domenico's refugee and Domenico himself. Domenico is shocked when Miccinio mentions [...] "his" [...] refugee, but Miccinio tells him that they have very little time and starts to explain their situation: the cave that they are in is actually the [...] "secret hole" [...] through Caatinga that the Marshalls were trying to find out about from Manuelo, who himself was not aware of it. Domenico has two choices - go through the cave and become a pig farmer at a pig farm down that way, or <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> the ruins of Canudos (as if he ran away) and get shot by Camoorian soldiers. Miccinio states that the choice is not simple, as at the farm, Domenico would have to endure dire starvation and violent treatment from his employer, who is a terrible person. He also berates the boy for not leaving a single drahcan back at his village, so he would have an excuse <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> As it stands though, the choice is between death and life full of misery and starvation. Domenico chooses <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the cave. Miccinio gives him some food and instructions on how to navigate the cave, but states that he will be unable to come with him, as he needs to get back to Camoora, which is probably in disarray right now, due to the death of the Grand Marshall.|$|R
