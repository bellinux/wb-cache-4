25|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a <b>tuneable</b> oscillator is more easily realized than a <b>tuneable</b> amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{has proved}} itself on {{numerous}} expeditions in hostile terrain (including Land Rover's own G4 Challenge). The engine's mechanical strength and electronic control systems makes the Td5 much more <b>tuneable</b> than the older engines. Numerous aftermarket companies produced tuning upgrades offering {{as much as}} 220 horsepower (164kW). The Td5 was replaced in the Discovery by the AJD-V6 unit in 2004 and the Ford ZSD-424 in the Defender in 2007. Production of the Td5 at Solihull ceased that year making it the last Land Rover-designed-and-built engine.|$|E
500|$|Terai Engineering {{attempted}} {{to enter the}} J2X-C at the 500 km of Suzuka in April 1992, but the car was far from ready, and did not attend. The J2X-C was first tested on 9 July 1992, with Costas Los selected to drive it at Pembrey Circuit. He said of the car; [...] "the J2X felt very different to a regular Group C car... Contrary to most Group C cars I had driven, {{it was a lot}} more <b>tuneable</b> than I was accustomed to." [...] However, he did state that the car's lack of power-assisted steering was a problem. The team struggled to find a buyer for the car, as the Group C era was drawing to a close by 1992 and 1993; the IMSA GTP Championship was on its last legs, and the World Sportscar Championship was beginning to shift away from the category.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{developments}} in LED technology {{have led to}} commercially available UV-C LEDs. UV-C LEDs use semiconductors to emit light between 255nm-280nm. The wavelength emission is <b>tuneable</b> by adjusting the material of the semiconductor. [...] The reduced size of LEDs open up options for small reactor systems allowing for point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices. Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications.|$|E
2500|$|Turbochargers {{have also}} been of great benefit to recent petrol engines in the Volkswagen Group. [...] Probably their most famous and widely used engine is their highly popular Audi-developed [...] {{inline-four}} engine. [...] This {{has been used in}} many of their mainstream, and high-performance cars; such as the original Audi S3 and Audi TT, the Mk4 VW Golf GTI, the original Škoda Octavia vRS, and the original SEAT León Cupra R. [...] This strong, and highly <b>tuneable</b> engine has won many prestigious awards, and is highly regarded by professional engine tuners and motorsports teams. [...] Furthermore, this same engine is used in a very high state of tune in the one-make Formula Palmer Audi (FPA) open-wheeled racing series.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{sources have}} noted Earhart's {{apparent}} {{lack of understanding of}} her direction-finding system, which had been fitted to the aircraft just prior to the flight. The system was equipped with a new receiver from Bendix that operated on five wavelength [...] "bands", marked 1 to 5. The loop antenna was equipped with a <b>tuneable</b> loading coil that changed the effective length of the antenna to allow it to work efficiently at different wavelengths. The tuner on the antenna was also marked with five settings, 1 to 5, but, critically, these were not the same frequency bands as the corresponding bands on the radio. The two were close enough for settings 1, 2 and 3, but the higher frequency settings, 4 and 5, were entirely different. Earhart's only training on the system was a brief introduction by Joe Gurr at the Lockheed factory, and the topic had not come up. A card displaying the band settings of the antenna was mounted so it was not visible. Gurr explained that higher frequency bands would offer better accuracy and longer range.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{infrared}} microscopy {{refers to}} microscopy performed at infrared wavelengths. In the typical instrument configuration a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) {{is combined with}} an optical microscope and an infrared detector. [...] The infrared detector can be a single point detector, a linear array or a 2D focal plane array. [...] The FTIR provides the ability to perform chemical analysis via infrared spectroscopy and the microscope and point or array detector enable this chemical analysis to be spatially resolved, i.e. performed at {{different regions of the}} sample. As such, the technique is also called infrared microspectroscopy [...] (an alternative architecture involves the combination of a <b>tuneable</b> infrared light source and single point detector on a flying objective). This technique is frequently used for infrared chemical imaging, where the image contrast is determined by the response of individual sample regions to particular IR wavelengths selected by the user, usually specific IR absorption bands and associated molecular resonances [...] A key limitation of conventional infrared microspectroscopy is that the spatial resolution is diffraction-limited. [...] Specifically the spatial resolution is limited to a figure related to the wavelength of the light. [...] For practical IR microscopes, the spatial resolution is limited to 1-3X the wavelength, depending on the specific technique and instrument used. [...] For mid-IR wavelengths, this sets a practical spatial resolution limit of ~3-30 μm.|$|E

6000|$|... 'An {{habitation}} of devils.' Devils: {{not such}} by nature, but by practice. Incarnate devils. For {{when the time}} is come that Babylon must be destroyed, she shall be found to be an habitation for the most vile of the sons of men. For as devils have acted towards the world, so shall the sons of this sorceress, and this whore, act towards Christ and his members in the latter days. And, perhaps, the departing of Zion from the midst of her, will blow her up into this spirit of devilism. Let God's people therefore, when Antichrist is towards her end, look for nothing from her, but what the devil, in times past, used to do; to wit, all sinful subtilty, malice, wrath, fraud, deceit, lying, murder, false accusings, and implacable madness of spirit to do them mischief. (But Lord God! think I, what will become of good men! and where will they be safe in such days? Only I comfort myself, by saying to myself again, this a sign that the ruin of Antichrist is at the door.) But this I say, he must needs be a <b>tuneable</b> man, that shall be able in those days to sing this song to himself at all seasons: for this is to drive reason backward, and to set the cart before the horse. For what will the good man's reason say, when it seeth all Babylonians are become devils, but that the church of God will certainly be torn in pieces? But behold! the text and the Holy Ghost runs counter. 'Babylon is fallen! is fallen! and [or, for it] is become the habitation of devils.' These words for certain are the words of an holy angel; for it could not have entered into the heart of mere man to have conceived them.|$|E

[...] Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, [...] And urg'd me hard with doings, which not will [...] But misery hath rested from me; where [...] 470 [...] Easily canst thou find one miserable, [...] And not inforc'd oft-times to part from truth; [...] If it may stand him more in stead to lye, [...] Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? [...] But thou art plac't above me, thou art Lord; [...] From thee I can and must submiss endure [...] Check or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. [...] Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, [...] Smooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th' ear, [...] And <b>tuneable</b> as Silvan Pipe or Song; [...] 480 [...] What wonder then if I delight to hear [...] Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire [...] Vertue, who follow not her lore: permit me [...] To hear thee when I come (since no man comes) [...] And talk at least, though I despair to attain. [...] Thy Father, who is holy, wise and pure, [...] Suffers the Hypocrite or Atheous Priest [...] To tread his Sacred Courts, and minister [...] About his Altar, handling holy things, [...] Praying or vowing, and vouchsaf'd his voice [...] 490 [...] To Balaam reprobate, a Prophet yet [...] Inspir'd; disdain not such access to me. [...] To whom our Saviour with unalter'd brow [...] Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope, [...] I bid not or forbid; do as thou find'st [...] Permission from above; thou canst not more. [...] He added not; and Satan bowing low [...] His gray dissimulation, disappear'd [...] Into thin Air diffus'd: for now began [...] Night with her sullen wing to double-shade [...] 500 [...] The Desert Fowls in thir clay nests were couch't; [...] And now wild Beasts came forth the woods to roam.|$|E
6000|$|Now Morn her rosie {{steps in}} th' Eastern Clime [...] Advancing, sow'd the Earth with Orient Pearle, [...] When Adam wak't, so customd, for his sleep [...] Was Aerie light, from pure {{digestion}} bred, [...] And temperat vapors bland, which th' only sound [...] Of leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan, [...] Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill Matin Song [...] Of Birds on every bough; {{so much the}} more [...] His wonder was to find unwak'nd Eve [...] With Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek, [...] 10 [...] As through unquiet rest: he on his side [...] Leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial Love [...] Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld [...] Beautie, which whether waking or asleep, [...] Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice [...] Milde, as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes, [...] Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus. Awake [...] My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found, [...] Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight, [...] Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field [...] 20 [...] Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring [...] Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove, [...] What drops the Myrrhe, & what the balmie Reed, [...] How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee [...] Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet. [...] Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye [...] On Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake. [...] O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose, [...] My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see [...] Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night, [...] 30 [...] Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd, [...] If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee, [...] Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe, [...] But of offence and trouble, which my mind [...] Knew never till this irksom night; methought [...] Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk [...] With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said, [...] Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time, [...] The cool, the silent, save where silence yields [...] To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake [...] 40 [...] Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes [...] Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light [...] Shadowie sets {{off the face of}} things; in vain, [...] If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes, [...] Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire, [...] In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment [...] Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze. [...] I rose as at thy call, but found thee not; [...] To find thee I directed then my walk; [...] And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways [...] 50 [...] That brought me on a sudden to the Tree [...] Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd, [...] Much fairer to my Fancie then by day: [...] And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood [...] One shap'd and wing'd like one of those from Heav'n [...] By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd [...] Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd; [...] And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd, [...] Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet, [...] Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd? [...] 60 [...] Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste? [...] Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold [...] Longer thy offerd good, why else set here? [...] This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme [...] He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd [...] At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold: [...] But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine, [...] Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt, [...] Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit [...] For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men: [...] 70 [...] And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more [...] Communicated, more abundant growes, [...] The Author not impair'd, but honourd more? [...] Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve, [...] Partake thou also; happie though thou art, [...] Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be: [...] Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods [...] Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind, [...] But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes [...] Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see [...] 80 [...] What life the Gods live there, and such live thou. [...] So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held, [...] Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part [...] Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell [...] So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought, [...] Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds [...] With him I flew, and underneath beheld [...] The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide [...] And various: wondring at my flight and change [...] To this high exaltation; suddenly [...] 90 [...] My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down, [...] And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd [...] To find this but a dream! Thus Eve her Night [...] Related, and thus Adam answerd sad. [...] Best Image of my self and dearer half, [...] The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep [...] Affects me equally; nor can I like [...] This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear; [...] Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none, [...] Created pure. But know that in the Soule [...] 100 [...] Are many lesser Faculties that serve [...] Reason as chief; among these Fansie next [...] Her office holds; of all external things, [...] Which the five watchful Senses represent, [...] She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes, [...] Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames [...] All what we affirm or what deny, and call [...] Our knowledge or opinion; then retires [...] Into her private Cell when Nature rests. [...] Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes [...] 110 [...] To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes, [...] Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams, [...] Ill matching words and deeds long past or late. [...] Som such resemblances methinks I find [...] Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream, [...] But with addition strange; yet be not sad. [...] Evil into the mind of God or Man [...] May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave [...] No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope [...] That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream, [...] 120 [...] Waking thou never wilt consent to do. [...] Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks [...] That wont to be more chearful and serene [...] Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World, [...] And let us to our fresh imployments rise [...] Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours [...] That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells [...] Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store. [...] So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard, [...] But silently a gentle tear let fall [...] 130 [...] From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire; [...] Two other precious drops that ready stood, [...] Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell [...] Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse [...] And pious awe, that feard to have offended. [...] So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste. [...] But first from under shadie arborous roof, [...] Soon as they forth were come to open sight [...] Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen [...] With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim, [...] 140 [...] Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray, [...] Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East [...] Of Paradise and Edens happie Plains, [...] Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began [...] Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid [...] In various style, for neither various style [...] Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise [...] Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung [...] Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence [...] Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse, [...] 150 [...] More <b>tuneable</b> then needed Lute or Harp [...] To add more sweetness, and they thus began. [...] These are thy glorious works, Parent of good, [...] Almightie, thine this universal Frame, [...] Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then! [...] Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens [...] To us invisible or dimly seen [...] In these thy lowest works, yet these declare [...] Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine: [...] Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light, [...] 160 [...] Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs [...] And choral symphonies, Day without Night, [...] Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n, [...] On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll [...] Him first, him last, him midst, and without end. [...] Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night, [...] If better thou belong not to the dawn, [...] Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn [...] With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare [...] While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime. [...] 170 [...] Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule, [...] Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise [...] In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st, [...] And when high Noon hast gaind, & when thou fallst. [...] Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st [...] With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies, [...] And yee five other wandring Fires that move [...] In mystic Dance not without Song, resound [...] His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light. [...] Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth [...] 180 [...] Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run [...] Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix [...] And nourish all things, let your ceasless change [...] Varie to our great Maker still new praise. [...] Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise [...] From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey, [...] Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold, [...] In honour to the Worlds great Author rise, [...] Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie, [...] Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers, [...] 190 [...] Rising or falling still advance his praise. [...] His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow, [...] Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines, [...] With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave. [...] Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow, [...] Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise. [...] Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds, [...] That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend, [...] Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise; [...] Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk [...] 200 [...] The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep; [...] Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven, [...] To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade [...] Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise. [...] Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still [...] To give us onely good; and if the night [...] Have gathered aught of evil or conceald, [...] Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark. [...] So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts [...] Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm. [...] 210 [...] On to thir mornings rural work they haste [...] Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row [...] Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr [...] Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check [...] Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine [...] To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines [...] Her mariageable arms, and with her brings [...] Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn [...] His barren leaves. Them thus imploid beheld [...] With pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'd [...] 220 [...] Raphael, the sociable Spirit, that deign'd [...] To travel with Tobias, and secur'd [...] His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid. [...] Raphael, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth [...] Satan from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf [...] Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd [...] This night the human pair, how he designes [...] In them at once to ruin all mankind. [...] Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend [...] Converse with Adam, in what Bowre or shade [...] 230 [...] Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd, [...] To respit his day-labour with repast, [...] Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, [...] As may advise him of his happie state, [...] Happiness in his power left free to will, [...] Left to his own free Will, his Will though free, [...] Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware [...] He swerve not too secure: tell him withall [...] His danger, and from whom, what enemie [...] Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now [...] 240 [...] The fall of others from like state of bliss; [...] By violence, no, for that shall be withstood, [...] But by deceit and lies; this let him know, [...] Least wilfully transgressing he pretend [...] Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. [...] So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld [...] All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint [...] After his charge receivd, but from among [...] Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood [...] Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light [...] 250 [...] Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires [...] On each hand parting, to his speed gave way [...] Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate [...] Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide [...] On golden Hinges turning, as by work [...] Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd. [...] From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, [...] Starr interpos'd, however small he sees, [...] Not unconform to other shining Globes, [...] Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd [...] 260 [...] Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass [...] Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes [...] Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon: [...] Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades [...] Delos or Samos first appeering kenns [...] A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight [...] He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie [...] Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing [...] Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann [...] Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare [...] 270 [...] Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems [...] A Phoenix, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird [...] When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's [...] Bright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb's he flies. [...] At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise [...] He lights, and to his proper shape returns [...] A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade [...] His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad [...] Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest [...] With regal Ornament; the middle pair [...] 280 [...] Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round [...] Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold [...] And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet [...] Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile [...] Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood, [...] And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld [...] The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands [...] Of Angels under watch; and to his state, [...] And to his message high in honour rise; [...] For on som message high they guessd him bound. [...] 290 [...] Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come [...] Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe, [...] And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme; [...] A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here [...] Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will [...] Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, [...] Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss. [...] Him through the spicie Forrest onward com [...] Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat [...] Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun [...] 300 [...] Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme [...] Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam need; [...] And Eve within, due at her hour prepar'd [...] For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please [...] True appetite, and not disrelish thirst [...] Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream, [...] Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call'd. [...] Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold [...] Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape [...] Comes this way moving; seems another Morn [...] 310 [...] Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n [...] To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe [...] This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed, [...] And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure [...] Abundance, fit to honour and receive [...] Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford [...] Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow [...] From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies [...] Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows [...] More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. [...] 320 [...] To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould, [...] Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store, [...] All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; [...] Save what by frugal storing firmness gains [...] To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: [...] But I will haste and from each bough and break, [...] Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice [...] To entertain our Angel guest, as hee [...] Beholding shall confess that here on Earth [...] God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. [...] 330 [...] So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste [...] She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent [...] What choice to chuse for delicacie best, [...] What order, so contriv'd as not to mix [...] Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring [...] Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, [...] Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk [...] Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds [...] In India East or West, or middle shoare [...] In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where [...] 340 [...] Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate, [...] Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell [...] She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board [...] Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape [...] She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes [...] From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest [...] She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold [...] Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground [...] With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd. [...] Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet [...] 350 [...] His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train [...] Accompani'd then with his own compleat [...] Perfections, in himself was all his state, [...] More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits [...] On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long [...] Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold [...] Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape. [...] Neerer his presence Adam though not awd, [...] Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, [...] As to a superior Nature, bowing low, [...] 360 [...] Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place [...] None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain; [...] Since by descending from the Thrones above, [...] Those happie places thou hast deignd a while [...] To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us [...] Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess [...] This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre [...] To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears [...] To sit and taste, till this meridian heat [...] Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. [...] 370 [...] Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde. [...] Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such [...] Created, or such place hast here to dwell, [...] As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n [...] To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre [...] Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise [...] I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge [...] They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd [...] With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve [...] Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair [...] 380 [...] Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd [...] Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove, [...] Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile [...] Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme [...] Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel Haile [...] Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd [...] Long after to blest Marie, second Eve. [...] Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb [...] Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons [...] Then with these various fruits the Trees of God [...] 390 [...] Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassie terf [...] Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, [...] And on her ample Square from side to side [...] All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here [...] Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; [...] No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began [...] Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste [...] These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom [...] All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends, [...] To us for food and for delight hath caus'd [...] 400 [...] The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps [...] To spiritual Natures; only this I know, [...] That one Celestial Father gives to all. [...] To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives [...] (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part [...] Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found [...] No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure [...] Intelligential substances require [...] As doth your Rational; and both contain [...] Within them every lower facultie [...] 410 [...] Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, [...] Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, [...] And corporeal to incorporeal turn. [...] For know, whatever was created, needs [...] To be sustaind and fed; of Elements [...] The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, [...] Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires [...] Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon; [...] Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd [...] Vapours not yet into her substance turnd. [...] 420 [...] Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale [...] From her moist Continent to higher Orbes. [...] The Sun that light imparts to all, receives [...] From all his alimental recompence [...] In humid exhalations, and at Even [...] Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees [...] Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines [...] Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn [...] We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground [...] Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here [...] 430 [...] Varied his bounty so with new delights, [...] As may compare with Heaven; and to taste [...] Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat, [...] And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly [...] The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss [...] Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch [...] Of real hunger, and concoctive heate [...] To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires [...] Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire [...] Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist [...] 440 [...] Can turn, or holds it possible to turn [...] Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold [...] As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve [...] Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups [...] With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence [...] Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, [...] Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin [...] Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts [...] Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie [...] Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. [...] 450 [...] Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic'd, [...] Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose [...] In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass [...] Given him by this great Conference to know [...] Of things above his World, and of thir being [...] Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw [...] Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms [...] Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far [...] Exceeded human, and his wary speech [...] Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. [...] 460 [...] Inhabitant with God, now know I well [...] Thy favour, in this honour done to man, [...] Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't [...] To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, [...] Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, [...] As that more willingly thou couldst not seem [...] At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? [...] To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd. [...] O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom [...] All things proceed, and up to him return, [...] 470 [...] If not deprav'd from good, created all [...] Such to perfection, one first matter all, [...] Indu'd with various forms, various degrees [...] Of substance, and in things that live, of life; [...] But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, [...] As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending [...] Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, [...] Till body up to spirit work, in bounds [...] Proportiond to each kind. So from the root [...] Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves [...] 480 [...] More aerie, last the bright consummate floure [...] Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit [...] Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd [...] To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, [...] To intellectual, give both life and sense, [...] Fansie and understanding, whence the soule [...] Reason receives, and reason is her being, [...] Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse [...] Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, [...] Differing but in degree, of kind the same. [...] 490 [...] Wonder not then, what God for you saw good [...] If I refuse not, but convert, as you, [...] To proper substance; time may come when men [...] With Angels may participate, and find [...] No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: [...] And from these corporal nutriments perhaps [...] Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit [...] Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend [...] Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice [...] Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; [...] 500 [...] If ye be found obedient, and retain [...] Unalterably firm his love entire [...] Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy [...] Your fill what happiness this happie state [...] Can comprehend, incapable of more. [...] To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd. [...] O favourable spirit, propitious guest, [...] Well hast thou taught the way that might direct [...] Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set [...] From center to circumference, whereon [...] 510 [...] In contemplation of created things [...] By steps we may ascend to God. But say, [...] What meant that caution joind, If Ye Be Found [...] Obedient? can wee want obedience then [...] To him, or possibly his love desert [...] Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here [...] Full to the utmost measure of what bliss [...] Human desires can seek or apprehend? [...] To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth, [...] Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; [...] 520 [...] That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self, [...] That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. [...] This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd. [...] God made thee perfet, not immutable; [...] And good he made thee, but to persevere [...] He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will [...] By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate [...] Inextricable, or strict necessity; [...] Our voluntarie service he requires, [...] Not our necessitated, such with him [...] 530 [...] Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how [...] Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve [...] Willing or no, who will but what they must [...] By Destinie, and can no other choose? [...] My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand [...] In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state [...] Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; [...] On other surety none; freely we serve. [...] Because wee freely love, as in our will [...] To love or not; in this we stand or fall: [...] 540 [...] And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n, [...] And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall [...] From what high state of bliss into what woe! [...] To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words [...] Attentive, and with more delighted eare [...] Divine instructer, I have heard, then when [...] Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills [...] Aereal Music send: nor knew I not [...] To be both will and deed created free; [...] Yet that we never shall forget to love [...] 550 [...] Our maker, and obey him whose command [...] Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts [...] Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst [...] Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move, [...] But more desire to hear, if thou consent, [...] The full relation, which must needs be strange, [...] Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; [...] And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun [...] Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins [...] His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. [...] 560 [...] Thus Adam made request, and Raphael [...] After short pause assenting, thus began. [...] High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men, [...] Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate [...] To human sense th' invisible exploits [...] Of warring Spirits; how without remorse [...] The ruin of so many glorious once [...] And perfet while they stood; how last unfould [...] The secrets of another world, perhaps [...] Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good [...] 570 [...] This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach [...] Of human sense, I shall delineate so, [...] By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, [...] As may express them best, though what if Earth [...] Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein [...] Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? [...] As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde [...] Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests [...] Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day [...] (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd [...] 580 [...] To motion, measures all things durable [...] By present, past, and future) on such day [...] As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host [...] Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd, [...] Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne [...] Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd [...] Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright [...] Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd, [...] Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare [...] Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve [...] 590 [...] Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees; [...] Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd [...] Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love [...] Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes [...] Of circuit inexpressible they stood, [...] Orb within Orb, the Father infinite, [...] By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son, [...] Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top [...] Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. [...] Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, [...] 600 [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand.

[...] So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words [...] All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all. [...] That day, as other solem dayes, they spent [...] In song and dance about the sacred Hill, [...] Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare [...] 620 [...] Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles [...] Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, [...] Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular [...] Then most, when most irregular they seem: [...] And in thir motions harmonie Divine [...] So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear [...] Listens delighted.

[...] 690 [...] So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd [...] Bad influence into th' unwarie brest [...] Of his Associate; hee together calls, [...] Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, [...] Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught, [...] That the most High commanding, now ere Night, [...] Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n, [...] The great Hierarchal Standard was to move; [...] Tells the suggested cause, and casts between [...] Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound [...] 700 [...] Or taint integritie; but all obey'd [...] The wonted signal, and superior voice [...] Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed [...] His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n; [...] His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides [...] The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host: [...] Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes [...] Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount [...] And from within the golden Lamps that burne [...] 710 [...] Nightly before him, saw without thir light [...] Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred [...] Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes [...] Were banded to oppose his high Decree; [...] And smiling to his onely Son thus said.

Cease then this impious rage, [...] And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease [...] Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son, [...] While Pardon may be found in time besought. [...] So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale [...] None seconded, as out of season judg'd, [...] Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd [...] Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd.

[...] 860 [...] Our puissance is our own, our own right hand [...] Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try [...] Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold [...] Whether by supplication we intend [...] Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne [...] Beseeching or besieging. This report, [...] These tidings carrie to th' anointed King; [...] And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. [...] He said, and as the sound of waters deep [...] Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause [...] 870 [...] Through the infinite Host, nor less for that [...] The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone [...] Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. [...] O alienate from God, O spirit accurst, [...] Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall [...] Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd [...] In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred [...] Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth [...] No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke [...] Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws [...] 880 [...] Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees [...] Against thee are gon forth without recall; [...] That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject [...] Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake [...] Thy disobedience.

[...] 890 [...] Then who created thee lamenting learne, [...] When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know. [...] So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found, [...] Among the faithless, faithful only hee; [...] Among innumerable false, unmov'd, [...] Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd [...] His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale; [...] Nor number, nor example with him wrought [...] To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind [...] Though single.

50|$|Superheterodyne {{receivers}} {{have essentially}} replaced all previous receiver designs. The development of modern semiconductor electronics negated {{the advantages of}} designs (such as the regenerative receiver) that used fewer vacuum tubes. The superheterodyne receiver offers superior sensitivity, frequency stability and selectivity. Compared with the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF) design, superhets offer better stability because a <b>tuneable</b> oscillator is more easily realized than a <b>tuneable</b> amplifier. Operating at a lower frequency, IF filters can give narrower passbands at the same Q factor than an equivalent RF filter. A fixed IF also allows {{the use of a}} crystal filter or similar technologies that cannot be tuned. Regenerative and super-regenerative receivers offered a high sensitivity, but often suffer from stability problems making them difficult to operate.|$|E

50|$|The field {{equations}} of Brans-Dicke theory {{contain a}} parameter, , called the Brans-Dicke coupling constant. This {{is a true}} dimensionless constant which must be chosen once and for all. However, it can be chosen to fit observations. Such parameters are often called <b>tuneable</b> parameters. In addition, the present ambient value of the effective gravitational constant must be chosen as a boundary condition. General relativity contains no dimensionless parameters whatsoever, and therefore is easier to falsify (show whether false) than Brans-Dicke theory. Theories with <b>tuneable</b> parameters are sometimes deprecated on the principle that, of two theories which both agree with observation, the more parsimonious is preferable.
