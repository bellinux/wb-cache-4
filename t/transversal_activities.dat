40|$|International audienceThanks {{to recent}} {{evolutions}} in environmental sensors, new data transmission associated with better autonomy, {{it is now}} feasible toconsider raw data quality with more confidence. Even if human QA/QC activity is still required (at least to check the overall workflowstatus), raw data {{can be considered as}} fitted for direct reuse. Groundwater level data and their near real time availability (raw data) answer to important societal needs:- Natural resource management in a climate change context with even more frequent drought episodes and their impact on qualityand quantity of the resource,- But also civil security in specific geological contexts where surface/ground water connexion associated with water table rise have adirect impact on flood events. Parallel to these, the ICT context is also evolving with more mature international open standards for sensorWeb interoperability(namely the OGC SWE - Sensor Web Enablement Framework) along with their endorsement by Legal obligations (INSPIRE directive) and communities. BRGM is conducting a dedicated joint SensorWeb activity between its IT and Water/Environment/Ecotechnologies division for severalyears. This <b>transversal</b> <b>activity</b> enables both:- The appropriation of the IT context and opportunities by domain experts,- And the possibility to be active on the international IT context (OGC, INSPIRE) so that international interoperability standardsdefinition and application is close to domain needs. This presentation will focus on the IT changes the French national piezometric network is currently going through. From the sensor onthe field, to the central information system, data validation, exploitation and reuse the system is progressively proposing a change ofparadigm in hydrogeologists activities. As a conclusion these changes will be linked to new opportunities, partnerships with other institutions (ex: dynamic Groundwaterlevel forecast – MétéEau des nappes) and but also to new challenges (vendor specific formats, big data, data accessibility) theycreate...|$|R
40|$|Cyclin A-mediated {{activation}} of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) {{is essential for}} cell cycle <b>transversal.</b> Cyclin A <b>activity</b> is regulated on several levels and cyclin A elevation {{in a number of}} cancers suggests a role in tumorigenesis. In the present study, we used a modified DNA binding site selection and PCR amplification procedure to identify DNA binding proteins that are potential substrates of cyclin A–CDK. One of the sequences identified is the Sp 1 transcription factor binding site. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that cyclin A and Sp 1 can interact physically. In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation studies indicate that cyclin A–CDK complexes can phosphorylate Sp 1. The phosphorylation site is located in the N-terminal region of the protein. Cells overexpressing cyclin A have elevated levels of Sp 1 DNA binding activity, suggesting that cyclin A–CDK-mediated phosphorylation augments Sp 1 DNA binding properties. In co-transfection studies, cyclin A expression stimulated transcription from an Sp 1 -regulated promoter. Mutation of the phosphorylation site abrogated cyclin A–CDK-dependent phosphorylation, augmentation of Sp 1 transactivation function and DNA binding activity...|$|R
40|$|Currently, noise {{exposure}} in the occupational setting {{continues to be}} a problem in industrialized countries, not only because this is the most common occupational disease in these countries, but also because it is <b>transversal</b> to all <b>activity</b> sectors, including leisure activities. Exposure to high noise levels can affect the hearing system. For this reason, the legislation requires that the employer implements a set of measures to protect the exposed worker, and as last solution the use of individual hearing protection. However, what occurs in practice and in the majority of cases is the adoption of the use of hearing protection, at the expense of collective protective measures. Nevertheless, not always their selection is made of the most efficient manner. Excessive attenuation of the protectors, as well as the existence of sectors where impulsive noise is produced, are currently the main concerns of safety technicians...|$|R
40|$|If {{we look at}} {{the world}} 30 years ago and the way {{businesses}} worked at the time and compare with today’s world, the difference in terms of tools used by the companies is obvious. Technology has been changing the daily basis processes of the companies significantly. Since the moving from paper to electronic, new business opportunities arise along with the technological evolution. The software industry has its origins back in the late 1950 s and early 1960 s and appeared as a need to support that evolution. The software development projects are considerably expensive, requiring a special attention in terms of costs and rework controlling in order to be competitive in the industry. A solid planning strategy seems the soul of most of the business to deliver a product with quality and efficient cost structure. Isban is the software company of the Santander Bank Group and is represented in ten countries around the globe through the expansion of the Santander Group and its presence in the world. In Portugal, Isban PT is the IT provider for Santander Totta Bank. Isban companies provide <b>transversal</b> support <b>activities</b> between them. For instance, some departments at Isban Portugal work for Isban Spain and the other way around. These cross activities benefits the group as a whole and specially Isban Portugal. Due to the economic situation in Portugal, the Isban PT has been pursuing projects from other countries of the Santander Group because the growth of the business in Portugal has stagnated. Isban Portugal has competitive advantage in some technologies leading to an important role of the national Isban in the Group. This growing transversal support requires a restructuration in the company’s processes. In order to implement those changes the Isban Spain, the parent company, has been giving some guidelines in terms of structure and efficiency benchmarking aiming to standardize processes across the Group, taking into consideration each company competitive advantages. With this dissertation I intend to propose a model that incorporates the Group strategic guidelines and my own analysis of current processes in order to improve Isban Portugal efficiency. Once concluded, this project will be an essential tool for the decision making of the Isban Portugal management team in order to reach the proposed objectives by international guidelines...|$|R

P. E. (Portuguese Oncology Institute-Porto), in the ambit of the Master in Pharmaceutical Medicine at University of Aveiro. This report describes the State of the Art in Pharmaceutical R&D Process in Europe, especially in Oncology, emphasising its current trends and stressing specificities of special and vulnerable populations, in {{the scope of}} the traineeship. The study coordination activities were essentially performed in the Pathology Clinics of Lung, Urology, Gynaecology, Paediatrics, and the Intensive Care Service. The activities developed had the main goal of acquiring experience in oncology clinical trials, while reinforcing the knowledge from my academic background. These activities included screening and randomisation of patients, preparation and processing of study visits, data entry and query resolution, and documents management, among other <b>activities</b> <b>transversal</b> to the 15 clinical trials, accompanied in the traineeship. Globally, the traineeship allowed a good overview of the activities involved in the conduction of clinical trials in a hospital, and a worthy introduction to the marketplace. I strengthened the knowledge acquired from my academic background. I developed competences and skills at the professional and personal level, such as dealing with unforeseen situations, and developed strategies to overcome challenges. I sharpened my vision of careers in clinical research, and hope to continue addressing new challenges in this area. Mestrado em Biomedicina Farmacêutic...|$|R
40|$|For {{treating}} chronic pain, a multifactorial condition, {{is needed}} a suitable diagnosis {{which allows the}} differentiation in its many components. Diabetic neuropathy is a worldwide disease with great impact in the modern society. Diabetes may leads {{to the production of}} reactive oxygen species that are associated to oxidative stress, which may be a key factor in the development of diabetic neuropathy. The main goal is to inquire a potential association between chronic pain, diabetic neuropathy and oxidative stress. Thus, was performed a meta-analysis that permitted the causal evaluation between oxidative stress and diabetic neuropathy, and, a pain evaluation was accomplished in a convenience sample using validated surveys – Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN 4). Through the meta-analysis it was possible evaluate oxidative stress biomarkers, such lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, and reduced glutathione. 9 studies were selected and all were performed in mouse models. The levels of lipid peroxidation were increased in all the studies, however the levels of the other biomarkers were diminished in diabetic models comparatively to healthy controls. In the evaluation of convenience sample, 84 surveys were collected along the four seasons: summer, autumn, winter and spring. The pain complaints were described in terms of local, intensity, impact, relief by medication and its effect on daily activities using BPI questionnaire. The scores obtained in BPI indicate the presence of moderate to severe pain, with increased complaints in autumn and spring, and implications in daily <b>activities,</b> <b>transversal</b> to all groups. To determine the main features associated with neuropathic pain it was used DN 4 questionnaire. The DN 4 indicated the presence of nearly 50 % of patients with neuropathic pain. The results suggest that being female, the increased age and being retired can influence chronic pain and neuropathic pain in patients. As main conclusions, it was possible to verify an association between oxidative stress, and neuropathic pain, and, also, that weather conditions may influence the pain complaints and its prevalence...|$|R
