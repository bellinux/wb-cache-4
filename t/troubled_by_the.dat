For instance, Drizzt {{is concerned that}} if he and his love Cattie-Brie (a human) have children, their offspring will face hostility from both races. Drizzt is also <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lifespan discrepancy between himself and Cattie-Brie.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
5|$|Lang's {{region of}} Stepney within the Diocese of London {{extended}} {{over the whole}} area generally known as London's East End, with two million people in more than 200parishes. Almost all were poor, and housed in overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Lang knew something of the area from his undergraduate activities at Toynbee Hall, and his conscience was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> squalor that he saw as he travelled around the district, usually by bus and tram.|$|E

5|$|The Priory of Sion myth {{has been}} exhaustively debunked by journalists and {{scholars}} {{as one of}} the great hoaxes of the 20th century. Some skeptics have expressed concern that the proliferation and popularity of books, websites and films inspired by this hoax have contributed to the subject of conspiracy theories, pseudohistory and other confusions becoming more mainstream. Others are <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> romantic reactionary ideology unwittingly promoted in these works.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{traveled}} to 79countries during this time, breaking the mark for most-traveled first lady held by Pat Nixon. She {{did not hold}} a security clearance or attend National Security Council meetings, but {{played a role in}} U.S. diplomacy attaining its objectives. A March 1995 five-nation trip to South Asia, on behest of the U.S. State Department and without her husband, sought to improve relations with India and Pakistan. Clinton was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Einstein was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} {{the direction of a}} spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a reflected beam. Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} match, against Leicestershire, Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, {{promoting}} Keith Miller ahead of himself to No. 3. As Miller {{came out to}} bat, the large crowd mobbed the players' entrance only to see that Bradman was not batting in his customary position. Bradman came to the crease at 2/157, and after initially being <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> left-arm unorthodox spin of Australian expatriate Jack Walsh, added 159 with Miller before falling for 81. Australia compiled 448 and bowled out the home side for 130 and 147 to win by an innings, with Bradman taking one catch.|$|E
5|$|John Brownlee, who had {{previously}} been offered the job, succeeded Greenfield. Brownlee's reign as government leader was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> onset of the Great Depression. He resigned in scandal after {{he was accused of}} sexual acts with a minor in the Attorney General's office. This and another scandalous divorce by UFA MLA Oran McPherson, speaker of the Legislative Assembly, gave the United Farmers an image of moral decay. In 1934 Richard Reid replaced Brownlee but served as premier for less than two years, leading the United Farmers government into total defeat {{at the hands of the}} new Social Credit party.|$|E

On 17 December, Joaquim Inácio was named inspetor do arsenal de marinha (inspector of the navy shipyard) in Rio Grande, {{the second most important}} town in Rio Grande do Sul.

5|$|Some of Henry Tudor's ships {{ran into}} a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry himself {{anchored}} off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham's failure. Buckingham's army was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> same storm and deserted when Richard's forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise, but was either turned in by a retainer for the bounty Richard had put on his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor, {{who was in the}} process of organising another rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{rendezvous}} of the Kvant-1 module with Mir on 5 April 1987 was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{failure of}} the onboard control system. After the {{failure of the}} second attempt to dock, the resident cosmonauts, Yuri Romanenko and Aleksandr Laveykin, conducted an EVA to fix the problem. They found a trash bag which had been left in orbit after the departure of one of the previous cargo ships and was now located between the module and the station, which prevented the docking. After removing the bag, docking was completed on 12 April.|$|E
5|$|Veerangan {{now finds}} himself saddled {{with the role}} of king for more days than he had {{initially}} bargained for because of Marthandan's sudden disappearance. He does not let this setback deter him and puts the opportunity to good use by beginning many reforms, and enacting several measures to uplift the poor. These steps are supported by the people while causing a political upheaval among the elite. However, he is <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that he is deceiving Manohari who believes him to be Marthandan. Unable to keep it a secret from her, he tells her the truth. Perceiving his noble character, Manohari accepts him as her brother.|$|E

5|$|Bowling {{for long}} periods caused McCool to {{continually}} tear a callus on his third finger, which he used to impart spin on the ball. As a result, Bradman felt compelled to leave {{him out of the}} Test matches, feeling that his finger {{would not be able to}} handle the necessarily long bowling spells. This decision was aided by England and Australia’s agreement to allow a new ball to be used every 55 overs, instead of the incumbent regulation of permitting a new ball for every 200 runs scored, which usually took longer than 55 overs. This meant the ball was in a shiny state more often, and therefore more conducive to fast and swing bowling, so Bradman relied heavily on his pacemen. For the rest of his career, McCool was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> skin rubbing off his spinning finger.|$|E
5|$|By his return, he was {{critical}} of the Bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. In the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife Emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. The theodicy of Paley and Thomas Malthus vindicated evils such as starvation {{as a result of}} a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. To Darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. He still viewed organisms as perfectly adapted, and On the Origin of Species reflects theological views. Though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, Darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of God as an ultimate lawgiver. He was increasingly <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> problem of evil.|$|E
5|$|Guy's reign was <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{threat of}} the Ottoman Turks, against whom, {{according}} to the Chronographia regum francorum, he proved a courageous leader. To strengthen the security of his domains, on 22 July 1362, Guy became a Venetian citizen, a development that heralded active Venetian involvement {{in the affairs of}} the area. Two years later, soon after his arrival in the Morea, he was involved in the civil war over possession of the Principality of Achaea between Philip II of Taranto and Maria of Bourbon, widow of Philip's older brother Robert, who died in September 1364 without a direct heir. Guy, along with the Despot of the Morea Manuel Kantakouzenos, supported Maria and her son Hugh of Lusignan until 1370, when the latter sold their claims to Philip.|$|E
50|$|The 1740 {{attacks on}} the island of Fuerteventura by English privateers took place within a month of one another, and were both put down with little <b>trouble</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> island's militia. They coincided with the Anglo-Spanish war of 1739. Privateering <b>by</b> <b>the</b> British was common during this {{conflict}} and the attacks on Fuerteventura in 1740 can be seen as an extension of this period of discord between Britain and Spain.|$|R

5|$|However, Sparta {{was then}} thrown into disarray by {{internal}} machinations. The citizens of Aegina had {{submitted to the}} Persian ambassadors, and the Athenians, <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> possibility of Persia using Aegina as a naval base, asked Sparta to intervene. Cleomenes travelled to Aegina to confront the Aeginetans personally, but they appealed to Cleomenes's fellow king Demaratus, who supported their stance. Cleomenes responded by having Demaratus declared illegitimate, {{with the help of}} the priests at Delphi (whom he bribed); Demaratus was replaced by his cousin Leotychides. Now faced with two Spartan kings, the Aeginetans capitulated, and handed over hostages to the Athenians as a guarantee of their good behaviour. However, in Sparta news emerged of the bribes Cleomenes had given at Delphi, and he was expelled from the city. He then sought to rally the northern Peloponnesus to his cause, at which the Spartans relented, and invited him back to the city. By 491 BC though, Cleomenes was widely considered insane and was sentenced to prison where he was found dead the following day. Cleomenes was succeeded by his half-brother Leonidas I.|$|E
5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Vietnam War, a reaction which played {{a large part}} {{in the tone of}} the novel. The tone of the novel is often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E
5|$|On April 12, 2015, Clinton {{formally}} {{announced her}} candidacy {{for the presidency}} in the 2016 election. She had a campaign-in-waiting already in place, including a large donor network, experienced operatives and the Ready for Hillary and Priorities USA Action political action committees and other infrastructure. The campaign's headquarters were established in the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Focuses of her campaign included raising middle class incomes, establishing universal preschool and making college more affordable and improving the Affordable Care Act. Initially considered a prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination, Clinton faced an unexpectedly strong challenge from democratic socialist Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose longtime stance against the influence of corporations and the wealthy in American politics resonated with a dissatisfied citizenry <b>troubled</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> effects of income inequality in the U.S. and contrasted with Clinton's Wall Street ties.|$|E
