6000|$|CLASS IV. When {{the adult}} male {{resemble}}s the adult female, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>of</b> both sexes {{in their first}} plumage resemble the adults.—In this class <b>the</b> <b>young</b> and <b>the</b> adults <b>of</b> both sexes, whether brilliantly or obscurely coloured, resemble each other. Such cases are, I think, more common {{than those in the}} last class. We have in England instances in the kingfisher, some woodpeckers, the jay, magpie, crow, and many small dull-coloured birds, such as the hedge-warbler or kitty-wren. But the similarity in plumage between <b>the</b> <b>young</b> and <b>the</b> old is never absolutely complete, and graduates away into dissimilarity. Thus <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>of</b> some members of the kingfisher family are not only less vividly coloured than the adults, but many of the feathers on the lower surface are edged with brown,[255]—a vestige probably of a former state of the plumage. Frequently in the same group of birds, even within the same genus, for instance in an Australian genus <b>of</b> parrokeets (Platycercus), <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>of</b> some species closely resemble, whilst <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>of</b> other species differ considerably from their parents of both sexes, which are alike.[256] Both sexes and <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> common jay are closely similar; but in the Canada jay (Perisoreus canadensis) <b>the</b> <b>young</b> differ so much from their parents that they were formerly described as distinct species.[257] ...|$|R
