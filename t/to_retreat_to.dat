5|$|Between 21 and 23 September the Ottoman III Corps (Ottoman Seventh Army) {{fought a}} rearguard action from Tubas to the Jordan River, which delayed the British cavalry encirclement and enable what {{remained}} of the Ottoman Eighth Army and the Ottoman Seventh Army <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> {{the eastern side of the}} Jordan River.|$|E
5|$|After this victory, the Normans took Dyrrhachium in February 1082 and {{advanced}} inland, capturing most of Macedonia and Thessaly. Robert was then {{forced to leave}} Greece {{to deal with an}} attack on his ally, the Pope, by the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV (r. 1084–1105). Robert left his son Bohemond in charge of the army in Greece. Bohemond was initially successful, defeating Alexios in several battles, but was defeated by Alexios outside Larissa. Forced <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Italy, Bohemond lost all the territory gained by the Normans in the campaign. The Byzantine recovery began the Komnenian restoration.|$|E
5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was either on the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E
50|$|Dessewffy {{tried to}} stop Liechtenstein with his troops and 3 cannon, but the Austrian army was {{stronger}} and the 4th and 9th legions started <b>to</b> <b>retreat.</b> Dessewffy had <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> too, <b>to</b> avoid the Austrian army cutting him off. The Austrian army pursued the Hungarians.|$|R

5|$|Around 1785BC, as {{the power}} of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, a Western Asian people called the Hyksos had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris, seized control of Egypt, and forced the central {{government}} <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Thebes. The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute. The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Cicero, the Senate {{inducted}} Octavian as senator on 1 January 43BC, yet he also was given the power to vote alongside the former consuls. In addition, Octavian was granted propraetor imperium (commanding power) which legalized his command of troops, sending him to relieve the siege along with Hirtius and Pansa (the consuls for 43BC). In April 43BC, Antony's forces were defeated at the battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, forcing Antony <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Transalpine Gaul. Both consuls were killed, however, leaving Octavian in sole command of their armies.|$|E
5|$|Between 19 September and 25 September 1918, in {{the last}} months of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of the First World War the Battle of Nablus took place, {{together}} with the Battle of Sharon during the set piece Battle of Megiddo. Fighting took place in the Judean Hills where the British Empire's XX Corps and airforce attacked the Ottoman Empire's Yildirim Army Group's Seventh Army which held a defensive position in front of Nablus, and which the Eighth Army had attempted <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to,</b> in vain.|$|E

5|$|Confusion among Jordanians was as {{important}} as among Israelis with the attack on Hill 315 and those of diversion. With the incoming morning and unable to evaluate properly the situation, the Israeli HQ gave orders at 5.30 am for the soldiers <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Bad al-Oued. The losses were also significant. Indeed, the 400-strong Harel battalion numbered 16 dead and 79 injured, and the Yiftach an handful of dead and injured. The Legion numbered several dozen victims.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the fall}} of the Raevsky redoubt did not have much meaning. The Russian troops {{successfully}} moved to the rear without being destroyed (despite suffering heavy losses). So, in spite of losing some areas in the battlefield, the Russian formation was prevented from collapsing. On the French side, the gain of the Raevsky redoubt cost them large casualties and, after that, Napoleon himself ordered his troops <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> the starting line. The Russians then reoccupied their previous positions.|$|E
5|$|In August 1916, a {{combined}} Ottoman and German Empire army {{had been forced}} <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Bir el Abd, after the British victory in the Battle of Romani. During the following three months the defeated force retired further eastwards to El Arish, while the captured territory stretching from the Suez Canal was consolidated and garrisoned by the EEF. Patrols and reconnaissances were carried out by British forces, to protect the continuing construction of the railway and water pipeline and to deny passage across the Sinai desert to the Ottoman forces by destroying water cisterns and wells.|$|E

5|$|In late July, Danzig was re-inforced by a Dutch garrison, and a {{combined}} Danish and Dutch fleet broke the naval blockage imposed on Danzig by Charles X Gustav. On 28–30 July, {{a combined}} Brandenburgian-Swedish army {{was able to}} defeat the Polish–Lithuanian army in the Battle of Warsaw, forcing John II Casimir <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Lublin. In August, Alexis' army took Livonian Kokenhausen (Koknese), laid siege to Riga and Dorpat (Tartu) and raided Estonia, Ingria and Kexholm.|$|E
5|$|In round four, Judah {{landed a}} {{right hand to}} the head that caused Mayweather <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> the ropes and cover up. The {{momentum}} changed in the fifth round, when Mayweather hurt Judah with a combination to the face. Then Mayweather landed a right hand {{on the bridge of}} Judah's nose, and blood began to flow. The seventh round was the most dominant for Mayweather to that point. Once again, he drew blood from Judah's nose. A combination from Mayweather backed Judah into a corner, and Judah's foot movement was considerably slower than it had been earlier in the fight.|$|E
5|$|Nicolls {{participated in}} an {{unsuccessful}} land and naval attack on Fort Bowyer on 15 September. In the fighting, Nicolls was wounded severely three times, and he lost {{the use of his}} right eye for life. The taking of Pensacola in November by an American force under Andrew Jackson forced Nicolls <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> the Apalachicola River with freed slaves from Pensacola. There, Nicolls regrouped at Prospect Bluff, and rallied Indians and refugee ex-slaves living free in Florida, recruiting the latter into his detached unit of the Corps of Colonial Marines.|$|E

Their final battle against Shu is at Yiling, where they use a fire attack to force Liu Bei <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Bai Di Castle, where he is then defeated (or killed). If Wei has fallen first, Wu will defeat the Shu at Chengdu and occupy the lands of Shu Han, killing their officers.|$|E
5|$|The album {{begins with}} two cover songs, and {{features}} a third on Side 2. Lyrics circle various themes, while the structuring {{of the songs}} shifted towards hard rock, psychedelic rock. The album was deemed by critics to be an attempt <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> the band's roots and received mostly positive reviews. Subterranean Jungle was not very successful commercially, peaking at number 83 on the US Billboard 200 and failing to chart internationally. The singles released from the album did not chart either. This is the last album by the band to feature Marky Ramone on drums until the 1989 album Brain Drain.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain of}} the castle, Major Hannibal Bonithon, was invited by Colonel John Arundell <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> the {{stronger}} fortress of Pendennis, but Bonithon and his men surrendered immediately without putting up resistance. This decision has been put down to a result of war-weariness, {{the large numbers of}} Parliamentary troops facing them and the generous surrender terms on offer, although the 19th-century historian Samuel Oliver also suspected that Bonithon might have had Parliamentarian sympathies. 160 small arms and 13 artillery pieces were captured: the castle's guns were removed and redeployed in the siege of Pendennis, which fell that August.|$|E

5|$|When {{division}} commander Major General Robert L. Spragins {{was injured}} and relieved of command in December 1944, Dean {{was promoted to}} command the division. That month, the division {{was caught up in}} the German Army offensive in the Alsace, known as Operation Nordwind. Fort Simserhof was captured by the Germans on December 19 and the 44th Infantry Division was forced <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> defensive positions east of Sarreguemines. On December 21–23, the 44th threw back three attempts by the Germans to cross the Blies River. An aggressive defense of the Sarreguemines area was continued throughout February and most of March 1945.|$|E
5|$|Yaropolk {{is found}} aiding {{his father and}} his uncle Vsevolod in 1078, when Oleg Svyatoslavich (and his brother Boris) {{attempted}} to gain the throne of Chernigov from Vsevolod. Oleg had been allied to the Polovtsy, and with their help defeated Vsevolod in battle. Grand Prince Izyaslav and Yaropolk, as well as Vsevolod's son Vladimir Monomakh, were able to reverse this result, and Oleg was forced <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Tmutorokan. Grand Prince Izyaslav, Yaropolk's father, {{died as a result of}} the battle.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, {{after this}} loss Xerxes {{attempted}} {{to build a}} causeway across the straits to attack Salamis (although Strabo and Ctesias place this attempt before the battle). In any case this project was soon abandoned. With the Persians' naval superiority removed, Xerxes feared that the Greeks might sail to the Hellespont and destroy the pontoon bridges. According to Herodotus, Mardonius volunteered to remain in Greece and complete the conquest with a hand-picked group of troops, while advising Xerxes <b>to</b> <b>retreat</b> <b>to</b> Asia with {{the bulk of the}} army. All of the Persian forces abandoned Attica, with Mardonius over-wintering in Boeotia and Thessaly. The Athenians were thus able to return to their burnt-out city for the winter.|$|E
