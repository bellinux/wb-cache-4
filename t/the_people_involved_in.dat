5|$|While Emperor Daozong's reign {{started off}} strong, it too was {{eventually}} plagued by factional infighting, aggravated by the emperor's own general weakness. The emperor's first major error was in ordering {{the execution of}} Xiao A La, a loyal minister and close friend of the emperor, whom the emperor was nonetheless convinced to execute by a rival minister. The 14th-century History of Liao speculates that had Xiao A La not been killed, two major incidents that came to dominate Emperor Daozong's reign would have been avoided. The first of these incidents was a rebellion in 1063, when several high-ranking members of the Yelü clan, led by a grandson of Emperor Shengzong, attempted to assassinate Emperor Daozong {{while he was on}} a hunting trip. He was saved with the assistance of troops led by his mother, Empress Dowager Ren Yi, and he retaliated by executing all of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the plot, as well as their immediate families.|$|E
5|$|Larrea {{did not get}} on {{well with}} Brown, who blamed him for {{disagreements}} and supply shortages, and even for discontent among the sailors. Buenos Aires {{did not have a}} naval tradition, and therefore most of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the naval campaign were foreigners. As a result, their commitment to the war was often limited. After the capture of Montevideo, Larrea instructed Brown to report directly to the minister of war, and not correspond with himself. Nevertheless, the disagreements continued. Due to the economic crisis caused by the war, Larrea sold the captured ships, decommissioned the navy and sold off the government's own ships, but the sailors complained that they had not received their wages, their reward for the military victory nor their percentage of the sale of the captured ships. Larrea and White were blamed for this. Larrea resigned {{by the end of the}} year, after signing an order for the creation of an infantry and a cavalry regiment for the Army of the Andes. Larrea blamed White for the unresolved dispute over the sailors' wages, declaring that he had arranged that White would organize the payment of the wages. Alvear resigned in 1815 after the mutiny of Álvarez Thomas, and all the members of his administration were put on trial. Larrea was accused of abuse of power, administrative fraud and stealing from the national treasury. All his properties were confiscated, and he was exiled.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the Oregon {{track and}} field program have led changes that benefited {{professional}} athletes and coaches, as well as running enthusiasts. Bill Bowerman experimented with many coaching techniques during his time {{as a head coach}} at the University of Oregon and instilled many of his principles from his days as a Major in the US Army. For example, Bowerman pioneered in using film as a method of teaching technique to his athletes. With Bowerman's meticulous attention to details, he made other discoveries with regards to coaching track. The training schedules he developed for his athletes ran counter to many other coaches' principles at the time. He believed that each individual athlete was different and tailored different workout routines to different athletes. He also scaled his workouts up and down, giving some of his athletes rest on certain days for recovery time. This attention to detail also led him to become obsessed with experimentation of reducing the weight of his athletes' apparel and increasing the traction of their shoes which eventually {{led to the creation of}} the apparel company Nike. Moreover, Bowerman considered himself more of a teacher than a coach and stressed schoolwork as well as mentoring his athletes with regards to life. Tom Heinonen, the former head coach of the Oregon women's {{track and field}} program was a strong advocate of female athletics at a time when female athletics were largely an afterthought. Steve Prefontaine was vehemently outspoken against the Amateur Athletic Union. Kenny Moore, a former University of Oregon student who ran track under Bowerman, was one of the speakers at the President's Commission on Olympic Sports, a series of hearings regarding amateur sports. These efforts along with those from other amateur athletes eventually culminated in the passage of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978.|$|E

5000|$|Historias de corceles y de acero is an Argentine {{book written}} by Daniel Balmaceda in 2010, {{in the context}} of the Argentina Bicentennial.

25|$|Avalanche {{accidents}} are broadly differentiated into 2 categories: accidents in recreational settings, and accidents in residential, industrial, and transportation settings. This distinction {{is motivated by}} the observed difference in the causes of avalanche accidents in the two settings. In the recreational setting most {{accidents are}} caused by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the avalanche. In a 1996 study, Jamieson et al. (pages 7–20) found that 83% of all avalanches in the recreational setting were caused by those {{who were involved in}} the accident. In contrast, all of the accidents in the residential, industrial, and transportation settings were due to spontaneous natural avalanches. Because of the difference in the causes of avalanche accidents, and the activities pursued in the two settings, avalanche and disaster management professionals have developed two related preparedness, rescue, and recovery strategies for each of the settings.|$|E
25|$|Bain became {{involved}} in the Gamergate controversy after discovering that a YouTube vlogger had received a DMCA notice for a video in which Zoë Quinn was discussed, warning that removing the video would cause another instance of the Streisand effect. He was subsequently attacked on Twitter. Bain has since discussed the ethical and professional concerns relevant to the video games press, and has stated that he believes that many of the ethical concerns raised during the controversy are valid or deserve to be addressed. He has stated that the harassment associated with Gamergate was the result of lone actors who wanted to provoke conflict among <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the controversy. Bain interviewed Stephen Totilo of Kotaku about the Gamergate controversy in general, and specifically about Gamergate supporters' concerns with regard to Kotaku's ethics and professionalism.|$|E
25|$|An FAO report {{claims it}} was {{believed}} in colonial times that the forest is a national resource which should be utilised for {{the interests of the}} government. Like coal and gold mines, {{it was believed}} that forests belonged to the state for exploitation. Forest areas became a source of revenue. For example, teak was extensively exploited by the British colonial government for ship construction, sal and pine in India for railway sleepers and so on. Forest contracts, such as that of biri pata (leaves of Diospyros melanoxylon), earned so much revenue that it was often used by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> this business as a leverage for political power. These contracts also created forest zamindars (government recognised forest landowners). Additionally, as in Africa, some forests in India were earmarked by the government officials and the rulers with the sole purpose of using them for hunting and sport for the royalty and the colonial officials.|$|E
