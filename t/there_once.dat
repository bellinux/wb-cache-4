5|$|Vesta is {{the only}} known intact {{asteroid}} that has been resurfaced in this manner. Because of this, some scientists refer to Vesta as a protoplanet. However, the presence of iron meteorites and achondritic meteorite classes without identified parent bodies indicates that <b>there</b> <b>once</b> were other differentiated planetesimals with igneous histories, which have since been shattered by impacts.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} several {{historic}} religious communities in Belgrade, the religious makeup {{of the city is}} relatively homogenous.

5|$|Skiklubben Ull was a Norwegian Nordic skiing club {{based in}} Oslo. Founded in 1883, Skiklubben Ull {{attracted}} several skilled sportsmen who between 1883 and 1891 won six Ladies' Cups and one King's Cup in national skiing events. The sporting facilities belonging the club {{were located in}} Vestre Aker, with the ski jumping hill Ullbakken near Frognerseteren being opened in 1884. The prestigious Husebyrennet was staged <b>there</b> <b>once.</b> Members of SK Ull were later instrumental in moving this prestigious contest to the hill Holmenkollbakken.|$|E
5|$|Wave 9 {{requires}} the player {{to cross a}} river of lava by stunning the monsters that live <b>there.</b> <b>Once</b> across, Jones must grab the Sankara Stones to progress to the Map Room where he can use the map pieces he has collected {{to figure out where}} the secret door exit is in Wave 10. Alternatively, there is a secret idol in Wave 8 that will reveal the hidden exit. To pass {{requires the}} use of both TNT and the Sankara Stones. Wave 11 leads to the exit and Wave 12 recreates the scene with the rope bridge and the final battle with Mola Ram.|$|E

5|$|Cid {{is confronted}} by Vaan, Balthier and {{company at the}} Draklor Laboratory, which results in a fight that Cid loses. Cid survives the {{encounter}} and flees. Cid goes to the Pharos lighthouse to invoke the Sun-Cryst's full power, revealing himself to the main characters <b>there</b> <b>once</b> Gabranth is defeated. Enraged, Gabranth tries to attack Cid, who teleports {{out of the way}} as Venat throws the judge against a wall. Cid fights Vaan, Balthier and the rest of the party once again, and again loses. Cid dies after the battle, dissolving into energy absorbed by the Sun-Cryst before it is destroyed and fully activates his final airship, the Bahamut. A character named Cid appears or is mentioned in every main Final Fantasy. He made his debut appearance in Final Fantasy II, though this appearance is the first Final Fantasy game to feature a Cid character as a villain. Cid was voiced by John Rafter Lee in English and by Chikao Ōtsuka in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The current I-195 was {{initially}} planned as a toll road called the Trenton-Asbury Park Expressway in the 1950s. In the 1960s, it became two proposed freeways Route 37 and Route 38 {{that were to}} cross {{the central part of}} the state. A compromise was reached for a single freeway between Trenton and Belmar which would get Interstate Highway funding as I-195. It was built in several stages during the 1970s and 1980s. <b>There</b> <b>once</b> existed a plan to extend the I-195 designation west to the upcoming interchange between the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) and I-95 in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania, but it was instead decided to extend the I-295 designation west and south, along existing I-95, to the new interchange.|$|E
5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that are inherited together from one of their parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. Mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) passes along the maternal line and can date back thousands of years. A 2005 study compared the mitochondrial DNA sequences of modern wolves with those from thirty-four specimens dated between 1856 and 1915. The historic population was found to possess twice the genetic diversity of modern wolves, which suggests that the mDNA diversity of the wolves eradicated from the western US was more than twice that of the modern population. A 2007 study compared mDNA sequences of modern wolves with those from Beringian wolves. The twenty Beringian wolves yielded sixteen haplotypes that could not be found in modern wolves, compared with seven haplotypes that were found in thirty-two modern Alaskan and Yukon wolves. This finding indicates that Beringian wolves were genetically distinct from modern wolves and possessed greater genetic diversity, and that <b>there</b> <b>once</b> existed in North America a larger wolf population than today.|$|E

5|$|In the foundry, Joule is able {{to analyze}} the {{prismatic}} core. She can make out voices coming from the core – including her father's – thus deducing {{that it is a}} transmission of sorts. Heading to Eden Tower to decrypt the core's transmission, she agrees to meet Kai <b>there.</b> <b>Once</b> reunited, they are ambushed by Victor. Kai stays behind to provide Joule the time to escape. She finds a lost crawler filled with parietal art indicating that Victor had manipulated the other corebots to attack the maintenance habitats. Corebot Duncan enters, lamenting the death of his human companion, and unites with Joule against Victor. Joule approaches Eden Tower to activate it, only to be faced with Victor and his minions. She learns that the ships, once orbiting Far Eden while waiting for its terraforming to complete, are long gone, having been destroyed by Victor. He throws Kai's prosthetic leg to the ground, proclaiming him dead. Finally, Joule bests Victor in combat and activates the terraforming system, materializing a hologram of her father from parts of memories hidden in the cores. In the end, it becomes clear that Kai survived his confrontation with Victor.|$|E
5|$|On 29 December, {{she left}} {{on her first}} war patrol, {{steaming}} for the Mariana Islands. She arrived {{off the coast of}} Guam at 03:00 on 11 January 1945 and Hashimoto ordered four kaitens launched. The kaitens tentatively claimed a tanker sunk, though it was unable to verify if the ship had actually been struck. The strike had been unsuccessful. She then sped back to Kure and arrived there on 20 January. She remained in port there until March, likely due to supply shortages. On 1 March, she was ordered to Iwo Jima to support the battle taking place <b>there.</b> <b>Once</b> there, I-58 was ordered to launch all of its kaitens without their pilots and immediately return home. She was ordered out again on 2 April sailing to support Japanese forces at the Battle of Okinawa. While there, she was attacked by aircraft 50 times. She never surfaced {{for more than a few}} hours. She limped to Kure on 29 April 1945, the only Japanese submarine to withdraw from the operation. She remained in port because of continued mining conducted by U.S. Army Air Forces, and departed on 16 July on another war patrol. At the time, she was one of only four large submarines left in the Japanese Navy, and her mission was to harass Allied lines of communications.|$|E
