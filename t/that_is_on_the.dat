In this concerted reaction the transition state is represented as a square with the corners occupied by carbon, carbon, hydrogen and boron with maximum overlap between the two olefin p-orbitals and the empty boron orbital.|$|E
25|$|Sutton Hoo is {{of primary}} {{importance}} to early medieval historians because it {{sheds light on}} a period of English history <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> margin between myth, legend, and historical documentation. Use of the site culminated {{at a time when}} Rædwald, the ruler of the East Angles, held senior power among the English people and played a dynamic if ambiguous part in the establishment of Christian rulership in England; it is generally thought most likely that he is the person buried in the ship. The site has been vital in understanding the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of East Anglia and the whole early Anglo-Saxon period.|$|E

25|$|When {{friction}} ridges {{come into}} contact with a surface that will take a print, material <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> friction ridges such as perspiration, oil, grease, ink or blood, will be transferred to the surface. Factors which affect the quality of friction ridge impressions are numerous. Pliability of the skin, deposition pressure, slippage, the material from which the surface is made, the roughness of the surface and the substance deposited {{are just some of the}} various factors which can cause a latent print to appear differently from any known recording of the same friction ridges. Indeed, the conditions surrounding every instance of friction ridge deposition are unique and never duplicated. For these reasons, fingerprint examiners are required to undergo extensive training. The scientific study of fingerprints is called dermatoglyphics.|$|E
25|$|Developments within {{analytic}} {{number theory}} are often refinements of earlier techniques, which reduce the error terms and widen their applicability. For example, the circle method of Hardy and Littlewood was conceived as applying to power series near the unit {{circle in the}} complex plane; it is now thought of in terms of finite exponential sums (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> unit circle, but with the power series truncated). The needs of diophantine approximation are for auxiliary functions that are not generating functions—their coefficients are constructed by use of a pigeonhole principle—and involve several complex variables. The fields of diophantine approximation and transcendence theory have expanded, {{to the point that}} the techniques have been applied to the Mordell conjecture.|$|E
25|$|The {{swallows}} generally forage for prey <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing, {{but they}} will on occasion snap prey off branches or on the ground. The flight may be fast and involve a rapid succession of turns and banks when actively chasing fast moving prey; less agile prey may be caught with a slower more leisurely flight that includes flying in circles and bursts of flapping mixed with gliding. Where several species of swallow feed together they will be separated into different niches based on height off the ground, some species feeding closer {{to the ground and}} others feeding at higher levels. Similar separation occurs where feeding overlaps with swifts. Niche separation may also occur with the size of prey chosen.|$|E

25|$|A small, left-facing Indian-style {{swastika}} {{was painted}} {{on the inside of}} the original propeller spinner of the Spirit of St. Louis along with the names of all the Ryan Aircraft employees who designed and built it. It was meant as a message of good luck prior to Lindbergh's solo Atlantic crossing as the symbol was often used as a popular good luck charm with early aviators and others. The inside of the original propeller spinner can be viewed at the National Air and Space Museum. This propeller spinner was found to be cracked when Lindbergh arrived at New York prior to his transatlantic flight. The propeller spinner <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Spirit of St. Louis now was hastily made in New York to replace the cracked original and was on the aircraft during the transatlantic flight.|$|E
25|$|The Downtown Phoenix {{campus was}} {{established}} in 2006 {{on the north side}} of Downtown Phoenix. The campus has an urban design, with several large modern academic buildings intermingled with commercial and retail office buildings. In addition to the new buildings, the campus included the adaptive reuse of several existing structures, including a 1930s era Post Office <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places. Serving 28,746 students, the campus houses the College of Health Solutions, College of Integrative Arts and Sciences, College of Nursing and Health Innovation, College of Public Service and Community Solutions, Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, and Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. In the summer of 2013, the campus added the Sun Devil Fitness Center in conjunction with the original YMCA building. ASU's Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law relocated from Tempe to the Downtown Phoenix campus in 2016.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} the display, placing and {{precedence}} of the national flag by both itself and {{in relation to other}} flags, the Department has made a number of suggestions. No flag or pennant should be flown above the national flag. When the flag is carried with another flag, or flags, it should be carried in the place of honour— <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> marching right, or on the left of an observer towards whom the flags are approaching. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be carried on the immediate left of the national flag, or, as seen by an observer when the flags are approaching, on the immediate right of the national flag. In the event of a display of crossed staffs, the national flag should be to the right and to the fore— that is {{to the left of the}} observer who is facing the flag. Its staff should be in front of the other flag or flags.|$|E

25|$|Running plays a {{much larger}} role in {{baseball}} because of the low scoring; also, players on the batting team must run much further to score a run, because runners may remain in play (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bases) without scoring, and because baserunners can advance to the next base before the ball is hit again (steal the base) {{as soon as the}} ball is live. Base stealing often requires sliding, in which the runner throws himself to the ground to avoid being tagged or over-running the base. The runner may also deliberately slide into the fielder at the base he is trying to steal to keep him from catching the ball or to disrupt a double play. At home plate the runner often will simply, and legally, run into a catcher who is blocking the baseline but who does not have the ball (a defensive player may not impede the runner unless he has the ball or {{is in the process of}} catching it).|$|E
25|$|A {{little more}} {{complicated}} {{problem is to}} find the number of non-attacking arrangements that do not change upon 90° rotation of the board. Let the board has 4n files and 4n ranks, and the number of rooks is also 4n. In this case, the rook <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first file can occupy any square on this file, except the corner squares (a rook cannot be on a corner square because after a 90° rotation there would 2 rooks that attack each other). There are another 3 rooks that correspond to that rook and they stand, respectively, on the last rank, the last file, and the first rank (they are obtained from the first rook by 90°, 180°, and 270° rotations). Removing the files and ranks of those rooks, one obtains the rook arrangements for a (4n−4)(4n−4) board with the required symmetry. Thus, the following recurrence relation is obtained: R4n = (4n−2)R4n−4, where Rn is the number of arrangements for a n'n board. Iterating, it follows that R4n = 2n(2n−1)(2n−3)...1. The number of arrangements for a (4n+1)(4n+1) board is the same as that for a 4n4n board; this is because on a (4n+1)(4n+1) board, one rook must necessarily stand in the centre and thus the central rank and file can be removed. Therefore R4n+1 = R4n. For the traditional chessboard (n = 2), R8 = 431 = 12 possible arrangements with rotational symmetry.|$|E
25|$|When {{the group}} of flags of the European Union are flown, the {{sequence}} is alphabetical, based on the first letter of the country's name. The flags should be flown {{from left to right}} with the European Union flag flown from the first flagstaff before the group. An alternative order of flags is to begin on the left with the national flag and place the European Union flag on the far right of the group, as seen by an observer. With regard to international flags; where either an even or an odd number of flags are flown in line on staffs of equal height, the national flag should be first on the right of the line— <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> observer's left as he or she faces the flags. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown on the immediate left of the national flag, or as seen by an observer, on the immediate right of the national flag. Where, however, an odd number of flags are displayed from staffs grouped so that there is one staff in the centre and higher than the others, the national flag should be displayed from the staff so placed. Where one of these flags is that of the European Union, the European Union flag should be flown from the first flagstaff on the right, or as seen by an observer, on the first flagstaff on the left. Only one national flag should be displayed in each group of flags or at each location. In all cases, the national flag should be in the place of honour. When the national flag is displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall or other background, the green should be on the right (an observer's left) in the horizontal position or uppermost in the vertical position. When displayed on a platform, the national flag should be above and behind the speaker's desk. While being carried, the flag should not be dipped by way of salute or compliment except to the dead during memorial ceremonies.|$|E
