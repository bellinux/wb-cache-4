50|$|Agriculture was practiced for {{thousands}} of years without the use of artificial chemicals. Artificial fertilizers were first created during the mid-19th century. These early fertilizers were cheap, powerful, and easy to <b>transport</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk.</b> Similar advances occurred in chemical pesticides in the 1940s, leading to the decade being referred to as the 'pesticide era'. These new agricultural techniques, while beneficial in the short term, had serious longer term side effects such as soil compaction, erosion, and declines in overall soil fertility, along with health concerns about toxic chemicals entering the food supply. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, soil biology scientists began to seek ways to remedy these side effects while still maintaining higher production.|$|E
5000|$|Tankers {{were first}} {{used by the}} oil {{industry}} to transfer refined fuel in bulk from refineries to customers. This would then be stored in large tanks ashore, and subdivided for delivery to individual locations. The use of tankers caught on because other liquids were also cheaper to <b>transport</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk,</b> store in dedicated terminals, then subdivide. Even the Guinness brewery used tankers to transport the stout across the Irish Sea.Different products require different handling and transport, with specialised variants such as [...] "chemical tankers", [...] "oil tankers", and [...] "LNG carriers" [...] developed to handle dangerous chemicals, oil and oil-derived products, and liquefied natural gas respectively. These broad variants may be further differentiated with respect to ability to carry only a single product or simultaneously transport mixed cargoes such as several different chemicals or refined petroleum products. Among oil tankers, supertankers are designed for transporting oil around the Horn of Africa from the Middle East. The supertanker Seawise Giant, scrapped in 2010, was 458 m in length and 69 m wide. Supertankers {{are one of the}} three preferred methods for transporting large quantities of oil, along with pipeline transport and rail.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBy {{means of}} Monte Carlo {{simulations}} of carrier <b>transport</b> <b>in</b> <b>bulk</b> semiconductors operating under periodic large-signal regime, we show {{the existence of}} upconversion of low-frequency hot-carrier noise associated with velocity fluctuations into a high-frequency region centered around the fundamental frequency of the large-signal. It is found that the upconverted noise corresponds to long-time fluctuations of relative populations of two groups of carriers characterized by different dynamical properties in momentum space. The appearance of the upconversion process is related to kinks of the static velocity-field characteristic when the dynamics of carrier motion in momentum space undergoes drastic changes...|$|E

Disadvantages of unit loads include the negative impact of batching on production system perf load, and the cost of returning empty containers/pallets to their point of origin.|$|R
