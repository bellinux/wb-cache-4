50|$|Although {{the club}} {{had a good}} deal of {{followers}} since it was founded, its first organized group of supporters emerged only in 1986 under the name of Bad Blue Boys (often abbreviated BBB). On the BBB's official website it is stated that the name of the group was inspired by the 1983 film Bad Boys. After its founding, the group aroused great interest in Zagreb and its branches started appearing in all parts and neighbourhoods of the city. They also started being noted throughout Yugoslavia for their self-organized departures to the visiting matches of Dinamo Zagreb, desiring to voice their support for the club, and also for the City of Zagreb and Croatia. During the team's home matches, the BBB <b>traditionally</b> <b>situate</b> themselves on the north stand of Stadion Maksimir. The BBB {{and the rest of the}} club's supporters view Hajduk Split's supporters as their most notable rivals, or more specifically the former's ultras group, Torcida Split.|$|R

Sangharama in Sanskrit means 'community garden' (sangha, community + arama, garden) and thus 'monastery'. The term Sangharama also refer to the dharmapala class of devas and spirits assigned to guard the Buddhist monastery, the dharma, and the faith itself. Over time and {{as an act of}} syncreticism, Guan Yu was seen as the representative guardian of the temple and the garden in which it stands. His statue <b>traditionally</b> is <b>situated</b> in the far left of the main altar, opposite his counterpart Skanda.|$|R

This is mainly a residential area surrounded with Kasba, Haltu, Garfa, Jadavpur, Dhakuria and Salimpur. This is a <b>traditionally</b> upper-middle-class neighborhood <b>situated</b> around the NandiBagan community playground. However, with the newly constructed Prince Anwar Shah Road connector with the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, property prices have skyrocketed in the area. The area is covered by the Kasba Police Station of the Kolkata Police Force. The Haltu Post Office serves the area.|$|R
5000|$|The club's main {{supporters}} {{group is}} known as [...] "Otrovi" [...] (The Poisons). They were founded in 1998, celebrating their 10-year anniversary in a Serbian League East fixture with Župa Aleksandrovac on 15 November 2008. The group is <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> in the east stand of the stadium.|$|E

The tribe was thought to have numbered about 500 members prior to contact with European settlers, though by 1853 a smallpox epidemic had decreased that number to about twenty-five individuals. In 1854 the remnants of the tribe entered into the Medicine Creek Treaty, but did not receive a permanent reservation.|$|E
50|$|The Avenue des Champs-Élysées is {{the avenue}} of luxury {{and beauty of}} France and is the {{location}} of many headquarters of upscale fashion, jewelry and beauty houses. It is often compared with the 5th Avenue of NYC and the Avenue Montaigne, an adjacent avenue that is also known for its prestigious fashion headquarters since the 1980s. The fashion houses have been <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> since the 17th century in the quarter around the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Other areas, such as Le Marais, a traditional Jewish quarter, have also included the clothing industry. The city's numerous fashion districts consolidate it as a fashion capital.|$|E

It experiments with digital technology to re-create a play space wherein children can actively engage {{with each other and}} the space utilizing upon a unique medium of play. As playgrounds have <b>traditionally</b> always been <b>situated</b> within a natural habitat or environment, this further reinforces the concept of developing the idea- based on something closely related to nature.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, global action {{to address the}} {{emerging}} crisis in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has escalated. Central to these efforts has been the support and influence of the World Health Organisation and the United Nations with the 2000 civil societies represented by the Non-Communicable Disease Alliance. In particular this reached expression in the world 2 ̆ 7 s first High Level Meeting on NCDs by the United Nations leading to the 2011 Political Declaration urging a coordinated global response to NCDs. Where then does psycho-oncology sit in this global context? Psycho-oncology practitioners and their collective, the International Psycho-Oncology Society (IPOS), have <b>traditionally</b> been <b>situated</b> within a patient focus and context. However, through linkages with community-based and non-government cancer organisations 2 ̆ 7 agencies, psycho-oncology research and practice has {{played a key role}} in reducing cancer risk, improving cancer survivorship, and influencing social and cultural change to eliminate disease-related stigma. As a discipline, psycho-oncology has contributed to widespread recognition of patient-centred care in cancer and along with a broad acceptance and endorsement of the IPOS International Standard. However psycho-oncology is less well accepted in nation-state cancer plans and herein lies opportunity. This special issue includes research across the illness continuum from cancer prevention to screening and early detection, and then to tertiary prevention with lifestyle considerations for cancer survivors. Importantly this demonstrates the capacity within psycho-oncology to develop new understandings of cancer as not only a disease but also a context linked to individual, community, and society health and well-being...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is a microhistory of a Bible {{class teacher}} from Chicago's West Side named Frank L. Wood. Though a Newspaper editor who never {{rose above the}} title of Sunday school teacher, Wood's self-identification as a fundamentalist in 1927 becomes the window through which I reinterpret the rise of Protestant fundamentalism in America. In contrast to the theological conflicts, denominational schisms, and Scopes Monkey Trial historians have <b>traditionally</b> mined, I <b>situate</b> fundamentalism's origins in the mass migration of rural, native born, lay evangelical women and men from {{the country to the}} city throughout {{the turn of the twentieth}} century. Drawing on an array of often igrnored primary sources such as church records, regional Sunday school association minutes, and the ephemera of lay evangelistic societies, I argue that Bible classes were a crucible in which America's evangelical subculture was forged. In their devotional and political lives, lay evangelicals like Wood drew upon the literalism fundamentalist theologians applied to scripture to sacralize the preindustrial, small-town social values, racial hierarchies, and gender roles they brought to the city, and utilized their Bible classes as the organizational network from which to launch a myriad of prohibition, nativist, and anti-evolution political campaigns. But in contrast to those historians who equate fundamentalism's emergence with the rise of the Religious Right, I uncover a diversity of fundamentalist electoral activity among the laity. Wood himself ran for office as a Socialist, while other Bible class activists similarly supported a number of Progressive reforms typically associated with more theologically "liberal" Social Gospel Protestants. The sacred timelessness lay fundamentalists attributed to their rural origins, I argue, not only informed their efforts to recreate its homogeneity through legislation like Prohibition, but also informed their support for policies intended to restore a preindustrtial moral economy. The conservative tipping point, I argue, lay in the evangelical encounter with the city's increasing diversity. Wood returned to the Republican Party in the 1930 s, for example, not by fundamentalist critiques of the New Deal, but through his reactions to Prohibition's end, the Great Migration of black southerners to Chicago, and the ethnic control of City Hall...|$|R
5000|$|In particular, {{the concept}} of {{identification}} can expand our vision {{of the realm of}} rhetoric as more than solely agonistic. To be sure, that is the way we have <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> it: “Rhetoric,” writes Burke, “is par excellence the region of the Scramble, of insult and injury, bickering, squabbling, malice and the lie, cloaked malice and the subsidized lie[...] [...] [...] We begin with an anecdote of killing (in Samson Agonistes and “Empedocles on Etna”), because invective, eristic, polemic, and logomachy are so pronounced an aspect of rhetoric” (19-20). But while impelled to acknowledge this nature, we can look for more from rhetoric, he argues: ...|$|E

Both men were painters of touch, but of touch on different keys [...] - [...] Rembrandt was the bass, Hals the treble. Hals seized {{a moment in the}} life of his subjects with rare intuition. What nature displayed in that moment he reproduced thoroughly in a delicate scale of color and with mastery over every form of expression. He became so clever that exact tone, light and shade, and modeling were obtained with a few marked and fluid strokes of the brush. He became a popular portrait painter, and painted the wealthy of Haarlem on special occasions. He won many commissions for wedding portraits (the husband is <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> on the left, and the wife situated on the right). His double portrait of the newly married Olycans hang {{side by side in the}} Mauritshuis, but many of his wedding portrait pairs have since been split up and are rarely seen together.|$|E
50|$|The side altar, {{also known}} as prothesis, is <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> on the Northern part of the {{sanctuary}} in the Byzantine rite churches. Priests prepare the bread and the wine on this smaller altar table for the holy liturgy. In the Cathedral of Hajdúdorog the prothesis {{was part of the}} original, early 19th century furniture made by Miklós Jankovits. It didn't go through major changes, like the main altar did. The parts above the altar table are original carvings. The table itself was changed probably in the 1870s. The arched volutes {{on the top of the}} prothesis are part of the original, Baroque structure. Two Corinthian columns hold the top structure of the prothesis, and they frame the painting of the side altar. The Descent from the Cross was painted by György Révész, approximately in 1870. He copied the composition of Rembrandt's 1634 master piece. The prothesis is ornated with typical Jankovits motifs. The gilded festoons, rose heads and acanthus leaves appear on the iconostasis and on other furniture too. The prothesis was over-painted with white oil paint during the Latinizing 1937 renovations. It was restored in 2005.|$|E
40|$|Employing the {{pioneering}} work of Charles Parrish {{as a basis}} of comparison, this study serves as a follow-up to “Color Names and Color Notions ” by deconstructing the contemporary language and attitudes surrounding skin color. Nine focus groups with 58 black {{women between the ages}} of 18 and 25 reveal that the color names and color notions offered were consistent with many of the terms and stereotypes that Parrish found, thereby indicating that there has been no change in colorist ideology among African Americans. Participants discussed 40 color names regularly employed to describe light, medium, and dark skin tones. The terms and attitudes associated with light skin tones were generally negative; conversely, the terms and attitudes asso-ciated with dark skin tones were derogatory. The language and beliefs con-nected to medium skin tones indicate that colorism operates as a three-tiered structure rather than the <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> binary paradigm...|$|E
40|$|SCIENTIFIC TRAVELS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL IDEAS IN PORTUGAL DURING THE 19 TH CENTURY - The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{establish}} the relationship between scientists movements, the circulation of ideas and the appearance of some basic works for modern Portuguese geography, around 1870. The break between a purely descriptive geography and modern geography is <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> in the 1870 's. Perhaps it was prepared by the contacts established inside Europe between scientists. It seems that natural sciences, agronomy and forest science had leading roles in this process. On this subject, we will try to explore the official missions and the stay of portuguese students in Northern Europe. This way, we will be able to trace the contribution of the ideas of Bernardino de Barros Gomes, who contributed towards the development of geographic thought a long time before geography became a University institution...|$|E
40|$|The {{networked}} {{medium of}} the Internet lowers the technical barriers for distributed collaboration and peer production, however {{the challenges of}} creating and sustaining large social and cooperative enterprise are immense. This paper is a survey of prior literature and current theories of cooperation and property rights, particularly {{in the context of}} distributed online communities. The recent Open Source phenomenon has been influential in the software community; for many people, this notion of distributed production in the public domain appears appealing in different contexts of human enterprise. What are the social incentives, norms and mechanisms that emerge in such distributed communities to support peer production? Under what conditions is an Open Source approach effective and what are its serious limitations? Few studies manage to address such questions in a critical manner. While Open Source is appealing for `socially closedknit ' and technically savvy communities, it presents many challenges for sustaining the social organization and productive capacity in diverse distributed networks. Applying models of distributed peer-production towards knowledge-intensive design, which is <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> in physical and cultural settings, requires careful consideration. What can we learn from cooperation, user innovation and social norms in co-located communities to understand innovation in distributed online settings? Transferring the Open Source model to knowledge-intensive domains like craft and product design, requires us to critically examine the nature of the design process, role of physical interaction, culture and "place" as well as the social norms and notions of intellectual property rights in such "communities of practice". Distinct notions of property rights [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{comparative}} study {{that focuses on}} the writings of an Oxford-trained Indian Christian theologian, priest and Bishop named A. J. Appasamy (1891 - 1975), and his theological interaction with the texts and tradition of the Srivaiṣṇava reformer Rāmānuja (1017 - 1137). For my doctrinal focus I have chosen to explore Appasamy’s four-fold Johannine application of the ‘Body of God’ analogy - the ‘Universe’, ‘Incarnation’, ‘Eucharist’ and ‘Church’ being his four divine embodiments. Post-Independence, Appasamy faced criticisms from expatriate theologians who described his theological project as ‘bold heresies’, a ‘synthesis of Christianity and Vedanta’ that has ‘shifted the axis’ from Christianity to ‘Hindu religion’. By following the leads in Appasamy writings back to his devotional tradition, I argue that such charges are, in fact, baseless and that his application of the analogy is rooted, rather, in the sacramental theology of his own Anglican tradition. To do so I demonstrate how his views on divine embodiment closely reflect the theological developments {{that took place in the}} first half of the last century between the time of Charles Gore and William Temple. Methodologically, I am arguing for the need to understand theological discourse as being semiotically and <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated,</b> embedded in mythic narrative and embodied in ritual practice. In doing so, however, I further argue that just as Appasamy’s detractors have failed to read him in the context of his devotional tradition, so, too, has Appasamy done with Rāmānuja. By reading Rāmānuja more as a Vedāntic philosophical theologian than as a sectarian practitioner, he has abstracted the Ācārya from his tradition - a tradition that is undoubtedly temple-based. On this basis I challenge Appasamy’s use of Rāmānuja’s terms and propose what I believe to be a better reading of John’s Gospel for future comparative interaction with the Srivaiṣṇava tradition.

40|$|Translation of {{computer}} software is commonly separated into two key terms, internationalization (i 18 n) as an enabling factor and localization (l 10 n) {{as the process}} of translating the software to be suitable for a specific context. With an emphasis on distributed development and software design, I present the internationalization and localization efforts of a Health Information System (HIS) situated {{in the context of}} developing countries. Through an action research approach, which includes a 4 month field study in Vietnam, I investigate the use of open source software (OSS) in developing countries. In collaboration with a Vietnamese team, I developed the first internationalization solution for the second generation of the District Health Information Software (DHIS 2), and localized the software for Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). DHIS 2 is an OSS project and a product of the Health Information Systems Programme (HISP), which is an organization dedicated to improving health care in developing countries. Based on my discoveries, I discuss the establishment of localization teams in developing countries and their integration into a global OSS project. I point to a shift of focus on internationalization and localization as processes of isolating culture specific data, to a broader perspective on how organizational structures and technology can be adapted to support such change. Modularization and how general solutions can be reached are discussed based on cases from the development of DHIS 2, and a digital divide between developing nations and OSS communities in the effective use of communication technology is identified. Internationalization is <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> at the presentation layer of applications. Based on an implementation in the DHIS 2 project, I present an aspect oriented concept for enabling internationalization on the lower layers of software projects, and how this concept can be aligned with existing installations...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{find out}} the effect of higher and wider cage on {{production}} in farmed blue fox. Three different cage setups formed the three experimental groups: 1) control group in standard cage; 2) high cage, walls heightened close to the roof of shed; 3) wide cage, cage built to fit between the supporting structures of the shed. The weight development was normal in all groups. Capture test showed that the fox was caught ca. 3 seconds faster from the standard cage than from the high cage. It took longest to catch a fox from the wide cage. The time it took to catch a fox increased in all groups as the foxes grew. At pelting, the capture time was longest in a high cage and shortest in a standard cage [...] The foxes remained healthy throughout the study and the results of small blood picture indicated of good general health in all groups. Right and left adrenal glands were heaviest in foxes with high cages. Raising the roof of the cage succeeded without difficulties. The door is <b>traditionally</b> <b>situated</b> on the roof of a cage which now had to be displaced on the front wall of the cage. The door needs more developing. When foxes grew, a second person was needed to hold the door when catching a fox, which prolonged the time needed to catch a fox. The two doors in the wide cage were situated on both ends of the cage, thereby complicating the capture. Only one door situated {{in the middle of the}} cage could ease the capture. The animal grew well, remained healthy and produced a good fur, so high cage seems to be suited for housing foxes. High cage also seamed to be the less stressful cage setup of all three. Because of the high roof, foxes are able to sit on the self and the roof does not wear down the fur on the back. Moreover, a great height makes it possible to attach another self on the wall. vo...|$|E
