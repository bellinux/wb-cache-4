25|$|AC {{traction}} still occasionally uses dual {{overhead wires}} instead of single phase lines. The resulting <b>three-phase</b> <b>current</b> drives induction motors, {{which do not}} have sensitive commutators and permit easy realisation of a regenerative brake. Speed is controlled by changing the number of pole pairs in the stator circuit, with acceleration controlled by switching additional resistors in, or out, of the rotor circuit. The two-phase lines are heavy and complicated near switches, where the phases have to cross each other. The system was widely used in northern Italy until 1976 and is still in use on some Swiss rack railways. The simple feasibility of a fail-safe electric brake is an advantage of the system, while speed control and the two-phase lines are problematic.|$|E

Accurate algorithms for fault classification and location based on artificial neural network are suggested in this paper.

Three fault locators are proposed and a comparative study of the three fault locators is carried out in order to determine which fault locator architecture leads to the accurate fault location.

5000|$|Prompted by the Paris [...] "Exposition Universelle" [...] (World Fair) of 1889, Leopold Sonnemann, {{publisher}} of the Frankfurter Zeitung newspaper, interested the Electrotechnical Society {{in the idea of}} an exhibition. The Society expressed an interest and started preparations in the same year. However, there was another consideration apart from the setting up of an international exhibition - Frankfurt had an urgent problem to solve. The construction of a central power station had been under discussion in the city’s political and technical committees since 1886. However, agreement had still to be reached over the type of current, and opinions were divided between direct current, alternating current and <b>three-phase</b> <b>current.</b> It fell to the exhibition to demonstrate a commercially viable method for the transmission of electricity. <b>Three-phase</b> <b>current</b> with a minimal loss of 25% would be transmitted at high voltage from Lauffen am Neckar to Frankfurt. This took centre stage at the exhibition and was evidenced in the large three-section entrance gate. The central section took the form of an arch bearing the inscription [...] "Power Transmission Lauffen-Frankfurt 175 km." [...] Rectangular panels flanked the arch: the one to the right carrying the name of the [...] "Allgemeine Electricitätsgesellschaft" [...] ("AEG" [...] - General Electricity Company), which had been founded in 1887; the left-hand panel displayed the name of the [...] "Maschinenfabrik Oerlikon" [...] (Oerlikon Engineering Works).

40|$|A {{three-phase}} four-leg inverter-based shunt {{active power}} filter (APF) is proposed to compensate <b>three-phase</b> unbalanced <b>currents</b> under unbalanced load conditions in grid-connected operation in this study.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{studies the}} {{performance}} of the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) under unbalanced conditions when the internal circulating currents are controlled to follow a reference value given by Lagrange-based optimization applied in the abc frame. The Lagrange-based current reference calculation is constrained to ensure that the MMC is providing constant, non-oscillatory, power flow at the DC-side even the case the AC grid voltage is unbalanced. Such operation can be achieved by the investigated Lagrange-based control while either controlling the differential currents of the MMC to have only a DC-component or while minimizing the sum energy oscillations in each phase of the MMC. The objective of preventing DC power oscillations can also be achieved independently of the power control strategy applied to control the <b>three-phase</b> <b>currents</b> on the AC side of the converter. The operation of the MMC is studied with three different objectives for the control of the AC currents: 1) Constant instantaneous three-phase power with sinusoidal currents, 2) Balanced sinusoidal <b>three-phase</b> <b>currents,</b> and 3) Constant instantaneous reactive power with sinusoidal currents. The impact of these different AC power control strategies on the oscillations of capacitor voltages and stored energy in the MMC is then analyzed and discussed, verifying how the Lagrange-based control is always able to keep the DC power flow free of second harmonic oscillations...|$|R
