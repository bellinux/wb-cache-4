30|$|From a {{mechanistic}} perspective, {{although we}} are uncertain as to exactly why women experienced a much blunted oxidative stress response as compared to men, we propose the following for consideration. First, a correlation exists between the systemic TAG response <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> {{and the increase in}} RONS production and subsequent oxidative stress biomarkers. In the present study we noted a lower TAG response <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> in women compared to men. These findings agree with those of Kolovou et al. (Kolovou et al. 2006) who observed greater postprandial TAG with delayed TAG clearance in men compared to women. It is certainly conceivable that a blunted postprandial TAG response <b>to</b> <b>feeding</b> ameliorates postprandial oxidative stress in women.|$|R

5|$|Fin whales {{suffer from}} a number of {{pathological}} conditions. The parasitic copepod Pennella balaenopterae—usually found on the flank of fin whales—burrows into their blubber <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> on their blood, while the pseudo-stalked barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis is generally found more often on the dorsal fin, pectoral fins, and flukes.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, {{the female}} Polish {{cochineal}} lays approximately 600-700 eggs, encased {{with a white}} waxy ootheca, in the ground. When the larvae hatch in late August or early September, they do not leave the egg case but remain inside {{until the end of}} winter. In late March or early April, the larvae emerge from the ground <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> for a short time on the low-growing leaves of the host plant before returning underground <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> on the plant's roots. At this point, the larvae undergo ecdysis, shedding their exoskeletons together with their legs and antennae, and they encyst by forming outer protective coatings (cysts) within the root tissues.|$|E
5|$|Like their {{relatives}} the honeybees, bumblebees feed on nectar, using their long hairy tongues to lap up the liquid; the proboscis is folded under the head during flight. Bumblebees gather nectar {{to add to}} the stores in the nest, and pollen <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> their young. They forage using colour and spatial relationships to identify flowers <b>to</b> <b>feed</b> from. Some bumblebees rob nectar, making a hole near the base of a flower to access the nectar while avoiding pollen transfer. Bumblebees are important agricultural pollinators, so their decline in Europe, North America, and Asia is a cause for concern. The decline has been caused by habitat loss, the mechanisation of agriculture, and pesticides.|$|E
