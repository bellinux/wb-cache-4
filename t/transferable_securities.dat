2500|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} governance standards are rights vote for {{who is on the}} board of directors for investors of labour and capital. A Draft Fifth Company Law Directive proposed in 1972, which would have required EU-wide rights for employees to vote for boards stalled mainly because it attempted to require two-tier board structures, although most EU member states have codetermination today with unified boards. The Shareholder Rights Directive 2007 requires shareholders be able to make proposals, ask questions at meetings, vote by proxy and vote through intermediaries. This has become increasingly important as most company shares are held by institutional investors (primarily asset managers or banks, depending on the member state) who are holding [...] "other people's money". A large proportion of this money comes from employees and other people saving for retirement, but who do not have an effective voice. Unlike Switzerland after a 2013 people's initiative, or the U.S. Dodd-Frank Act 2010 in relation to brokers, the EU has not yet prevented intermediaries casting votes without express instructions of beneficiaries. This concentrates power into a small number of financial institutions, and creates the potential for conflicts of interest where financial institutions sell retirement, banking or products to companies in which they cast votes with other people's money. A series of rights for ultimate investors exist in the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2003. This requires duties of disclosure in how a retirement fund is run, funding and insurance to guard against insolvency, but not yet that voting rights are only cast on the instructions of investors. By contrast, the Undertakings for Collective Investment in <b>Transferable</b> <b>Securities</b> Directive 2009 does suggest that investors in a mutual fund or ("collective investment scheme") should control the voting rights. The UCITS Directive 2009 is primarily concerned with creating a [...] "passport". If a firm complies with rules on authorisation, and governance of the management and investment companies in an overall fund structure, it can sell its shares in a collective investment scheme across the EU. This forms a broader package of Directives on securities and financial market regulation, much of which has been shaped by experience in the banking crisis of 2007–08. Additional rules on remuneration practices, separating depositary bodies in firms from management and investment companies, and more penalties for violations were inserted in 2014. These measures are meant to decrease the risk to investors that an investment goes insolvent. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 applies to other businesses selling financial instruments. It requires similar authorisation procedures to have a [...] "passport" [...] to sell in any EU country, and transparency of financial contracts through duties to disclose material information about products being sold, including disclosure of potential conflicts of interest with clients. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive 2011 applies to firms with massive quantities of capital, over €100million, essentially hedge funds and private equity firms. Similarly, it requires authorisation to sell products EU wide, and then basic transparency requirements on products being sold, requirements in remuneration policies for fund managers that are perceived to reduce [...] "risk" [...] or make pay [...] "performance" [...] related. They do not, however, require limits to pay. There are general prohibitions on conflicts of interest, and specialised prohibitions on asset stripping. The Solvency II Directive 2009 is directed particularly at insurance firms, requiring minimum capital and best practices in valuation of assets, again to avoid insolvency. The Capital Requirements Directives contain analogous rules, with a similar goals, for banks. To administer the new rules, the European System of Financial Supervision was established in 2011, and consists of three main branches: the European Securities and Markets Authority in Paris, the European Banking Authority in London and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority in Frankfurt.|$|E

40|$|The {{security}} {{institutions and}} policies in Kosovo have been controlled and {{shaped by the}} international actors {{since the end of}} the Kosovo war. Due to the large amount of actors with differing objectives, as well as the problematic relationship with Serbia and the unresolved status of Kosovo, the security sector has suffered from the lack of systematic institutional development. This thesis looks into the transformation of Kosovo's security sector in the post-conflict period from 1999 through early 2015. The central focus of the study is on how the international community first took over the ownership and management of the security institutions and how it was later gradually transferred to the local community. The objective here is to point out the potential pitfalls and structural inefficiencies of the policies that have steered the security sector's development process. The analytical part of this thesis consists of three sections, which all mark a certain period of time. During the first phase (1999 - 2005) the first Kosovo security institutions, including the Kosovo Police, were established. The demilitarization efforts of the KLA, and their implications, will be dealt with as well. The second phase (2005 - 2008) looks into the initial handover of the responsibilities from the international community to the Kosovo Government and the third phase (2008 - 2013) concentrates on the new security sector architecture introduced following Kosovo's declaration of independence. The observations made suggest that the international community has failed in providing sufficient support for the local community to develop <b>transferable</b> skills in <b>security</b> management. On one hand the international community has managed to stabilize the situation quickly by taking over all institutions, but on the other, this has crippled the Kosovars as they are not prepared to run them on their own. The recent Security Sector Review paves the way for a presentable transformation, but it is clear that the Kosovars are no longer willing to let the international community dictate how the security sector is structured, managed and resourced...|$|R
5000|$|Eurotreasury WarrantsQuadrex Holdings first subsidiary, Quadrex Securities Ltd. {{specialized}} in international financial transactions. [...] Its first deal as lead manager {{was an issue}} for the U.S conglomerate Transamerica of [...] "Eurotreasury" [...] warrants. This {{was an attempt to}} create a vehicle for trading in Europe what would have been in effect options on long-term US Treasury Bonds. In spite of the issue being heavily advertised on the day, the offer was cancelled several hours later as demand proved insufficient. However, two days later, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Salomon Brothers Inc. unit of Philbro-Salmon duplicated the Transamerica Treasury warrant offering in almost every aspect except the price. After duplicating Klesch’s idea, Hansgeorg Hofmann, executive director of Merrill Lynch International said [...] "He (Klesch) was the first who had the guts to try it but in circumstances that made it difficult to succeed. In 1987, Klesch was recognized as the acknowledged developer of [...] "EuroTreasury" [...] Warrants with the Institutional Investor award for best idea. Following on from its first deal, Quadrex Securities Ltd. managed a series of other deals in 1984, including the $50 million 10 year issue for Equitable Bancorp and its first international deal, Citicorp’s $100 million offering of two year extendable bonds. By early 1985, Klesch had begun to look beyond Eurobond trading and started to undertake a series of acquisitions for his investment group including the first leveraged buyout of a public company in the United Kingdom, the tender offer for R P Martin PLC, one of the largest foreign exchange brokers in the world. Also in 1985, Quadrex Securities Ltd., announced the offering of the first Euro-sterling zero coupon obligations backed by United Kingdom government securities, a new financial instrument to the securities market. The securities, known as STAGS (Sterling <b>Transferable</b> Accruing Government <b>Securities),</b> were issued in the Euro-sterling sector of the Eurobond market. However, the technique which had proved successful in the United States failed to attract enough attention and was withdrawn shortly after they were launched. After this, Klesch bought Polymer Corp, a maker of plastic parts, in 1986, and BoreSteel, a steel company in 1987 in an attempt to diversify Quadrex away from finance. He also drew up a plan for a consortium bid to break up Pearson PLC, the conglomerate that owned the Financial Times, although theoretically sound the plan was leaked to the media and appeared superficial and therefore ultimately failed. By 1990 Quadrex Holdings had been wound down and was officially dissolved in 1999. It was a victim of the decline in the bond market and had also become entangled in a lawsuit with British & Commonwealth Holdings PLC over the acquisition of the money broking side of financial service group, Mercantile House.|$|R

The Undertakings for Collective Investment in <b>Transferable</b> <b>Securities</b> Directives 85/611/EEC, as amended by 2001/107/EC and 2001/108/EC (typically known as UCITS for short) created an EU wide structure, so that funds fulfilling its basic regulations could be marketed in any member state.

5000|$|Terminology {{varies with}} country but {{investment}} funds are {{often referred to}} as investment pools, collective investment vehicles, collective investment schemes, managed funds, or simply funds.

An investment fund may be held by the public, such as a mutual fund, exchange-traded fund, special-purpose acquisition company or closed-end fund, or it may be sold only in a private placement, such as a hedge fund or private equity fund.
