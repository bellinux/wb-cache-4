40|$|A {{successful}} {{setup for}} a calibration {{of a model}} for separation of BSA monomer and dimer is described. The BSA model is calibrated in steps using different experiments and residuals before a tuning of the model <b>to</b> all <b>experiments</b> is performed. The steps include isotherm calibration <b>to</b> gradient <b>experiments,</b> capacity calibration <b>to</b> load <b>experiments,</b> transfer resistance calibration <b>to</b> all <b>experiments</b> and pH dependency calibration <b>to</b> <b>experiments</b> with different buffers. The advantages with this method are that iterations are not necessary and the whole process from the first <b>experiments</b> <b>to</b> the calibrated model takes only a few days. The disadvantages are that some parameters are very hard to calibrate with the used simple method...|$|R

5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> with musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E

5|$|Haynes {{continued}} his research into ways to produce corrosion resistant metals. While working on alloys {{for use in}} spark plugs, he created a metal he named stellite.

He continued <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> with it until 1910 when he published his findings in a paper to the International Congress of Applied Chemistry and the American Institute of Metals, where he held memberships. His final version was completed in 1912 and his patent issued on June 20.|$|E

Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light guns are not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading developers <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> with hybrid controllers, particularly with the Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4.
