5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and <b>the</b> <b>Gamut</b> Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). <b>The</b> <b>Gamut</b> Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E

5|$|For the 2010–2011 {{academic}} year, Florida Atlantic had approximately 300registered student organizations. Among {{the groups}} are academic organizations, honor societies, spiritual/religious organizations, diversity-appreciation organizations, service organizations, personal interest organizations, sports clubs, and student government agencies. These clubs and organizations run <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> from sailing to Ultimate Frisbee, from varsity and club sports and a jazz group to a pottery guild, from political organizations to chess and video game clubs. These organizations are funded by student tuition, from which $10.00 per credit hour goes toward an activities and service fee fund. This generates approximately $9million that is then given to student government for allocation to student clubs and organizations. The student government also finances other student life programs, including career fairs, the University Press, OWL TV and Owl Radio, and Homecoming.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} of Terminator 2 spanned 171 days between October 9, 1990, and March 28, 1991, {{during which}} the crew filmed at the Mojave Desert before visiting 20 different sites throughout California and New Mexico. These locations ran <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> from the crowded Santa Monica Place shopping mall, where the two Terminators converged on John, with brief shots coming from the Westfield MainPlace and Los Cerritos Center, to flood control channels in the San Fernando Valley, which played host to the chase between the Terminators and John; a river had to be redirected to allow filming on the otherwise wet channels. Cameron and his crew also filmed Terminator 2 at The Corral Bar and the Lake View Medical Center (known as Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in the film), both located in Lake View Terrace. The external shots of Cyberdyne Systems Corporation were filmed on location at an office building {{on the corner of}} Gateway Boulevard and Bayside Parkway in Fremont, California. Working with up to 1,000 crew members, the production team oversaw numerous stunts and chase sequences, the most notable of which took place on the Los Angeles–Long Beach Terminal Island Freeway, prior to Terminator 2s climax. Tenmiles (16km) of electric cables were laid to illuminate the night-time chase, which saw a full-scale helicopter crash, a sliding tanker, and other elaborate paraphernalia.|$|E

25|$|The diagram {{represents}} {{all of the}} chromaticities {{visible to}} the average person.

The curved edge of <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> is called the spectral locus and corresponds to monochromatic light (each point representing a pure hue of a single wavelength), with wavelengths listed in nanometers. The straight edge on {{the lower part of}} <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> is called the line of purples.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} constructing a lookup table relating a three-dimensional CMY coordinate system to CMYK colorant amounts {{in a way that}} maximizes the utilization of <b>the</b> printer <b>gamut</b> volume. <b>The</b> method is based on an assumption, satisfied by most printers, that adding a black colorant to any combination of CMY colorants does not result in a color with more chroma. Therefore <b>the</b> CMYK <b>gamut</b> can be obtained from <b>the</b> CMY <b>gamut</b> by expanding it towards lower lightness values. Use of black colorant on the gray axis is enforced by modifying the initial distribution of CMY points through an approximate black generation transform. Lightness values of a resulting set of points in CIELAB space are scaled to fill <b>the</b> four-color <b>gamut</b> volume. <b>The</b> output CMYK values corresponding to the modified CIELAB colors are found by inverting a printer model. This last step determines a specific black use rate which can depend on the region of the color space. Keywords: color conversion, black [...] ...|$|R

25|$|CRI merely {{measures}} the faithfulness of any illuminant to an ideal source {{with the same}} CCT, but the ideal source itself may not render colors well if it has an extreme color temperature, {{due to a lack}} of energy at either short or long wavelengths (i.e., it may be excessively blue or red). Weight the result by the ratio of <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> area of the polygon formed by the fifteen samples in CIELAB for 6500nbsp&K to <b>the</b> <b>gamut</b> area for the test source. 6500nbsp&K is chosen for reference since it has a relatively even distribution of energy over the visible spectrum and hence high gamut area.
