25|$|Pieces cannot move {{until they}} have been dalled. A die showing the dal allows the player to dal one piece, which means to turn it {{parallel}} to its row and move it one position ahead. With the first dal, only the piece closest to the stern can be dalled, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> into row C. With no dalled pieces, a throw with no dals is a lost move.|$|E
25|$|Located in South East England, {{the road}} starts at Aldgate, in central London, and then travels through Limehouse (Commercial Road); it then goes past the Isle of Dogs, Canning Town and Silvertown, {{skipping}} the Limehouse link, it then goes past the East Ham Sainsbury's and then past other major road in London, the A406. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through Barking, Dagenham and Rainham {{before it reaches}} the M25, a motorway that rings around London. After then going past Lakeside, Grays, Tilbury, Orsett and Stanford-le-Hope it reaches where a new crossing linking Kent to Essex is planned, it {{is yet to be}} confirmed and many local residents are against this project. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> past Pitsea and a new junction that turns the A13 in to the A130. Then the A13 is no longer a dual carriageway and then is a A road that goes past South Benfleet, Leigh-on-Sea, Westcliff and then reaching Southend-on-Sea, where it meets the A127, another road that goes into London. Then the A13 continues on to Shoeburyness where the road ends.|$|E

25|$|The path descends {{into the}} Lea Valley, passing under the railway lines before {{crossing}} the B653 road. The route now follows the track of a disused railway, the former Luton, Dunstable and Welwyn Junction line. After Harpenden the path leaves the railway track and heads uphill into Wheathampstead, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> through the village, past the church, and crosses {{over to the}} other bank of the river. The path now follows the river towards Water End Lane and the grounds of Brocket Hall where it crosses the middle of a golf course on its way towards Lemsford. The path goes under the A1 road to Stanborough Park.|$|E
25|$|The Orange Line {{will start}} from Min Buri as {{elevated}} structure on Ramkhamhaeng Road (former Suka Phiban III Road) from eastern suburb in Min Buri District and goes underground near Lam Sali intersection in Bang Kapi District, also transfers to MRT Yellow Line. It continues southwest along Ramkhamhaeng Road, passing Hua Mak Stadium and Ramkhamhaeng University. Then it {{turns to the}} west and crosses Pradit Manutham Road to the current MRT depot. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> to Thailand Cultural Centre Station, the alignment crosses over and transfers to the current MRT Blue Line. It continues via Din Daeng housing estates and Bangkok City Hall 2 to Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, Sam Liam Din Daeng Junction. Then turn left into Ratchaprarop Road towards Pratunam and turn right into Phetchaburi Road then interchange with BTS Sukhumvit Line at Ratchathewi Station. It continues along Larn Luang Road and Ratchadamnoen Road. Then crosses the Chao Phraya River near Phra Pinklao Bridge, passes Siriraj Hospital and goes along Bangkok Noi Rail line and terminates at Bang Khun Non Station, interchanges with MRT Blue Line again. The total length is 37.5km.|$|E
25|$|The line north {{west from}} Harrow was {{electrified}} in stages. In 1925, four rail electrification reached Rickmansworth and Watford, and the Metropolitan Railway planned to electrify the line {{as far as}} Aylesbury by 1935. However, when the Met was absorbed into LT the plans were put on hold. Electrification of the final leg of the Met finally got {{under way in the}} late 1950s, but LT decided later to electrify only up to Amersham. The original intention to electrify further is evidenced by the colour light signalling which was fully installed as far as Aylesbury and by platform extensions up to Stoke Mandeville. In 1961 LT withdrew the Metropolitan line from Aylesbury and since <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> only as far as Amersham. Following the end of steam-hauled Metropolitan line trains in 1961 the service was provided by British Rail Class 115 diesel multiple units until 1992 (which were then replaced by the line's current rolling stock) - along with Metropolitan line electric multiple units south of Amersham. Responsibility for the line north of Amersham was transferred from London Transport to British Railways on 11 September 1961; London Underground signage at the stations on this section was gradually replaced by those of British Railways.|$|E

[...] It goes from screaming heavy metal to techno dance, to Country and Western; there's even a flamenco hootenanny where everyone comes down front, beats on logs and plays acoustic guitars and pennywhistles. <b>Then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> back to 'Holiday' which is an old dance number. It keeps you steppin'. Madonna sings everything live. She's been that way {{from the beginning of}} her career, even with all the athletic dancing.

500|$|Pete Rock said of {{his studio}} {{experience}} with West, [...] "He's definitely hip-hop, his roots, I was testing him on joints...He takes it to another level which is dope. He had these musicians and this song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made it real. I love the way he works — he goes from one room, writing rhymes then goes to another beat and goes to another room and does something else — I love what he's done". Rapper Pusha T characterized the album as [...] "a collage of sounds" [...] and found West's methods unorthodox when recording, saying that [...] "We could easily be working on one song, thinking we're in a mode, and he'll hear a sound from someone like [...] Jeff Bhasker and immediately turn his whole attention to that sound and go through his mental Rolodex to where that sound belongs on his album, and <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> straight to that song, immediately". DJ Premier said of the production in comparison to West's previous work, [...] "Well, first of all, {{if you look at}} all of Kanye West's output, he actually did a lot to bring back sampling and make it cool again, even though he's more of a mainstream artist...but his new album is strictly hard beats and rhyme. He's totally done with electro. You're gonna be surprised what you hear".|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{then said}} she was [...] "doing this to {{liberate}} America — free us all of our hang-ups". She told Spin magazine [...] "We live in a very repressed society, and I deal with erotic themes. The point I try to make is: Why should we feel ashamed of our sexuality?". Later she revealed that [...] " [...] does not condone unsafe sexual practices". Nicholas Callaway from Callaway Arts & Entertainment said that the book [...] was [...] "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy. It's hard to calculate the effect, , Sex should be considered 'art'". Originally it was rumored that Time Warner was nervous about {{the release of the}} book; however, in an interview with Vanity Fair, William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt that Madonna [...] "should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it". The Warner company had also previously assured that they would make sure Sex reached its main target audience and also reminded that the book was safely wrapped in a Mylar bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label. Michael Kilian of the Chicago Tribune published an article on October 7, 1992, regarding the then upcoming release of Sex: [...] "Prepare thyself, , The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It's an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of Leanza Cornett as the new Miss America." [...] Kilian also described it as the [...] "personal sexual fantasy picture book in all Christendom, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> far beyond all previous 'truly twisted' personal sexual fantasy picture books—perhaps beyond all imagining what such a book could be".|$|E

2500|$|Jeff Koons rose to {{prominence}} in the mid-1980s {{as part of a}} generation of artists who explored the meaning of art in a media-saturated era. He gained recognition in the 1980s and subsequently set up a factory-like studio in a SoHo loft on the corner of Houston Street and Broadway in New York. It was staffed with over 30 assistants, each assigned to a different aspect of producing his workin a similar mode as Andy Warhol's Factory (notable because all of his work is produced using a method known as art fabrication). Today, he has a [...] factory near the old Hudson rail yards in Chelsea, working with 90 to 120 regular assistants. Koons developed a color-by-numbers system, so that each of his assistants could execute his canvases and sculptures {{as if they had been}} done [...] "by a single hand". [...] "I think art takes you outside yourself, takes you past yourself. I believe that my journey has really been to remove my own anxiety. That's the key. The more anxiety you can remove, the more free you are to make that gesture, whatever the gesture is. The dialogue is first with the artist, but <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> outward, and is shared with other people. And if the anxiety is removed everything is so close, everything is available, and it's just this little bit of confidence, or trust, that people have to delve into." ...|$|E
