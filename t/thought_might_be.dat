5|$|The one-act opera genre {{had become}} {{increasingly}} popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno {{for the best}} such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> made into a trilogy of one-act operas.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{throughout the}} night of 15 October and into the following day. It focused on finding survivors and fighting the fire that blocked the entry into some workings of the western returns. The fire caused the roof supports to become unstable, and falls triggered outbursts of methane. Several rescuers were injured by the falls, one fatally. Before descending the mine many of the firefighters wrote what they <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> their last letters home, and some made their wills. As the water pipe in the shaft was out of operation, fire-fighting continued with hand extinguishers and work was only possible in 20-minute shifts. Despite wearing respirators, several rescuers were overcome by the effects of firedamp. During {{the course of the}} day, 56 bodies were raised to the surface and, that evening, a new water supply, connected by three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) of pipes to a nearby reservoir, was installed in the Lancaster shaft.|$|E

He noted that the Slavonic people, from the steppes, worshipped stones, streams and hills, while the Finno-Ugrian people, from the forests, worshipped trees or groves.|$|E

25|$|The Army's {{response}} to McNamara's memo was {{to form a}} board organized like the earlier Rogers Board. Howze, who had served on the Rogers Board (and was named in McNamara's memo), was selected to chair the Tactical Mobility Requirements Board on 25 April. The actual directive establishing the board was not issued until 3 May, after the board had started working, and Howze was given wide authority to deal with any agencies (military or civilian) he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> necessary for the board to complete its evaluation.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 the Association of Independent Navigation Authorities (AINA) {{published}} a report called Demonstrating {{the value of}} waterways, in which they outlined methods for assessing restoration projects, and their likely social and economic benefits. British Waterways produced {{a report in the}} following year, called Waterways 2025 – Our vision for the shape of the Waterways Network, which used many of the methods suggested by the AINA report to identify 18 restoration schemes which they <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> completed before 2025, and which they would support. The Wendover Arm appeared in the list, but the report was abandoned two years later, after other groups claimed that not being included undermined their ability to raise funds.|$|E
25|$|Evans {{continued}} to use his Ojibwe orthography in his work in Ontario. As was common at the time, the orthography called for hyphens between the syllables of words, giving written Ojibwe a partially syllabic structure. However, his students appear to have had conceptual difficulties using the same alphabet for two different languages with very different sounds, and Evans himself found this approach awkward. Furthermore, the Ojibwe language was polysynthetic but had few distinct syllables, meaning that most words had {{a large number of}} syllables; this made them quite long when written with the Latin script. He began to experiment with creating a more syllabic script that he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> less awkward for his students to use.|$|E

25|$|Construction on the Hubbard House's two-story front {{elevation}} began around 1872 {{at the urging}} of Mrs. Hubbard who felt the family had outgrown the small cottage that occupied the site from 1857 until 1872. Despite her desires and Silas Hubbard's prominent position as the only doctor in Hudson, the family had little money with which to pursue the addition to their home. Hubbard was known not to push his clients for payment. In response, Elbert and his mother pored over Silas' records searching for any one they <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> able to make payment through labor or construction materials. Elbert, already a considerable salesman by 1872, then rode about McLean County to obtain cash, materials and promises of labor from his father's clientele. Soon the new section of the house was completed.|$|E
25|$|In March 1973, five fascists, commissioned—according to some rumors—by {{high-ranking}} {{officials in}} Milan's Carabinieri, abducted Rame, held her at gunpoint and dumped {{her in a}} van. They raped her, beat her, burnt her with cigarettes, slashed her with razor blades and left her in a park. Fo and Rame continued to tour around Lombardy and Veneto throughout that year, despite a split in La Comune; the short piece Mamma Togni dates from this time. In September 1973, after the suicide of Salvador Allende in Chile, Guerra di popolo in Cile (The People's War in Chile) was produced, and toured the country attracting great interest. This was particularly due to a part at the end that unnerved audiences, who thought a coup had been declared across Italy. According to Chiara Valentini, {{a member of the}} audience panicked during a performance in Turin and ate ten pages of what he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> compromising names, while in Merano a student broke the glass in an attempt to flee through a window. The actual police arrested Fo in Sassari in November 1973, leading to nationwide uproar when it emerged that under Italian law the police could not enter the theatre during the performance; the outcry served only to boost attendances at future performances.|$|E
25|$|Despite that it {{was unusual}} for women to {{participate}} in archaeology at the time, in 1901, encouraged by Howard Carter, Lady William Cecil began excavations at Qubbet el-Hawa near Aswan. Her family was wintering {{in the area and}} while exploring on {{the west bank of the}} Nile had discovered what she <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> an ancient cemetery. Carter, who in 1899 had been appointed by the Antiquities Service as one of two European Chief Inspectors and in charge of excavations in the Nile Valley south from Qus to the Sudanese border, came to see the find the following day. He arranged for permits to excavate and provided an inspector and workers to assist in the dig. She kept a diary of the details of the expedition in which multiple tombs were found, as well as wooden anthropoid coffins of the Saite Era. Though the entire necropolis was infested with termites, Tomb 21 yielded two burial boxes. The male's coffin disintegrated when it was touched, but the female's coffin remained intact and was removed. The exterior was painted in yellow and devoid of any inscription. The mummy was covered with a blue network of beading. A coarse blue glaze was used on the winged scarabs and Amenti gods depicted on the canopic jars. The sole adornment of the mummy was a one inch by half inch opaque green stone. Lady William's diary recorded that the names found in the tomb were Bao-bao, daughter of Pawebas and Shepentanefet and her brother Waher. She also reported remnants of a former burial, which may have been the tomb of Shepentanefret.|$|E

500|$|Phillips, {{who lives}} in the United Kingdom, {{sometimes}} has difficulty accurately portraying modern America and said [...] "1948 Hollywood might as well be sci-fi". Since there was not enough time for him to do his own research and maintain a monthly schedule, Brubaker hired Amy Condit as a research assistant. Condit, who is the manager of the Los Angeles Police Museum, supplied Phillips with thousands of reference photos. Phillips also bought some DVDs he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> useful, but never found time to watch them.|$|E
500|$|To {{generate}} {{funds for}} the film, Raimi approached Phil Gillis, a lawyer {{to one of his}} friends.

With his advice in mind, Raimi asked a variety of people for donations, and even eventually [...] "begged" [...] some. Campbell had to ask several of his own family members, and Raimi asked every individual he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> interested. He eventually raised enough money to produce a full-length film, though not the full amount he originally wanted.|$|E

500|$|Cockcroft {{was elected}} a Fellow of St. John's College on 5 November 1928. He and Walton began {{operating}} their accelerator in March 1932, bombarding lithium and beryllium with high-energy protons. They {{expected to see}} gamma rays, which French scientists had reported, but none were found. In February 1932, James Chadwick demonstrated that what had been observed were actually neutrons. Cockcroft and Walton then switched to looking for alpha particles instead. On 14 April 1932, Walton bombarded a lithium target and noticed what he <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> alpha particles. Cockcroft and then Rutherford were summoned, and confirmed that this was indeed the case. That evening, Cockcroft and Walton met at Rutherford's home and produced a letter for Nature in which they announced their results, the first artificial disintegration of an atomic nucleus, which can be described thus: ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of Johnson suffering from bouts {{of depression and}} what Johnson <b>thought</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> madness.

To overcome these feelings, Johnson tried to constantly involve himself with various activities, but this did not seem to help. Taylor said that Johnson [...] "at one time strongly entertained thoughts of Suicide". Boswell claimed that Johnson [...] "felt himself overwhelmed with an horrible melancholia, with perpetual irritation, fretfulness, and impatience; and with a dejection, gloom, and despair, which made existence misery".|$|E
