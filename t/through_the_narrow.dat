5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained indifferent.|$|E
5|$|Newman and Copland led {{the charge}} from the old town across a bridge raked by machine gun fire and {{advanced}} into the new town. The Commandos attempted to get <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> streets {{of the town and}} into the surrounding countryside, but were eventually surrounded. When their ammunition was expended their only option was to surrender. Not all the Commandos were captured; five men reached neutral Spain, from where they eventually returned to England.|$|E

5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E
5|$|During the floods, flow <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which {{formed in the}} lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of the suspended materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E
5|$|Manuel made serious {{tactical}} errors, such as {{failing to}} properly scout out the route ahead. These failings {{caused him to}} lead his forces straight into a classic ambush. On 17 September 1176 Manuel was decisively defeated by Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan II at the Battle of Myriokephalon (in highlands near the Tzibritze pass), in which his army was ambushed while marching <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> mountain pass. The Byzantines were too dispersed, and were surrounded. The army's siege equipment was quickly destroyed, and Manuel was forced to withdraw – without siege engines, the conquest of Iconium was impossible. According to Byzantine sources, Manuel lost his nerve both {{during and after the}} battle, fluctuating between extremes of self-delusion and self-abasement; according to William of Tyre, he was never the same again.|$|E

5000|$|Under the Ballachulish Bridge, at the {{entrance}} to the loch, is <b>the</b> <b>narrows</b> Caolas Mhic Phàdraig. The settlements either side are North and South Ballachulish - Baile a' Chaolais (the settlement on <b>the</b> <b>narrows).</b> There is a fast tidal stream <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrows,</b> running at up to seven knots at springs; it is wise, therefore, to time any passage <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrows</b> with <b>the</b> tides. Further up the loch, there are several other narrows - principally Caolas na Con - with significant, but diminishing tidal streams. The loch is navigable as far as Kinlochleven, and was used by ships bringing alumina to the smelter there until its closure.|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of 10–11 November a Russian column under Strik's command began its passage <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> canyons, intent on {{arriving}} at Dürenstein by noon; two more columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, moved in wider semicircles, planning {{to pass through the}} mountains and attack the French, who were extended along the river bank. According to the plan, in late morning Strik's column would emerge from the mountains first and launch a flanking assault on the French right. This flanking attack, combined with Miloradovich's frontal assault from Stein, would force the French into a vise; encircled, they would have no option but to surrender—or die. To ensure the success of the plan, the second and third columns, under Dokhtorov and Schmitt, would arrive in early and mid-afternoon and support the earlier assaults. In this way, even if the French tried to retreat west to Marbach, they would not escape the vise-like grip of the Coalition army.|$|E
5|$|The summer aggregations of the short-tail {{stingray}} at the Poor Knights Islands seem to {{at least}} partly serve a reproductive purpose, as both mating and birthing have been observed among the gathered rays. Courtship and mating take place in mid-water, {{and it has been}} speculated that the rising current flowing continuously <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> archways aids the rays in maintaining their position. Each receptive female may be followed by several males, who attempt to bite and grip her disc. One or two males may be dragged by the female for hours before she accedes; the successful male flips upside-down beneath her, inserting one of his claspers into her vent and rhythmically waving his tail from side to side. Copulation lasts 3–5 minutes. Females in captivity have been observed mating with up to three different males in succession.|$|E
5|$|This new sail {{was much}} larger than the others sighted earlier in the day, and the {{detached}} squadron abandoned their former pursuit and turned towards the new arrival, Hercule. By 17:45, L'Héritier was in full flight with the British force strung out behind him, the rest of Bridport's fleet far to the west. Jason had the lead with Mars shortly behind, although Inman on Ramillies had lost his fore topmast and had dropped back. Hood, an experienced officer and a nephew of both Bridport and the veteran Admiral Lord Hood, pressed his ship forwards and gradually gained on both Jason and Hercule. L'Héritier knew that in open water he would be caught and overwhelmed, and sought instead to escape <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> and dangerous channel of the Raz de Sein, a rocky passage between the Île de Sein and the Pointe du Raz: during the Expédition d'Irlande the French ship of the line Séduisant had been wrecked in the Raz de Sein with 680 lives.|$|E
5|$|Multiple realignments of {{the road}} that is now Alt US40 have {{occurred}} since it was originally built as the National Road. Most such realignments are minor, such as to bypass an old bridge, but some have significantly affected the path {{of the road}}. One such realignment occurred in 1834, when a new route for the National Road was built <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Cumberland <b>Narrows.</b> <b>The</b> previous route had followed the Braddock Road, a route which is now followed by MD49. The route following Braddock Road passed over Haystack Mountain and was much steeper than <b>the</b> newer route <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Narrows.</b> <b>The</b> route <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Narrows</b> allowed <b>the</b> road to bypass this steep mountain ascent. The stone arch bridge built across Will's Creek for the new alignment remained in service until 1932, when a new bridge which is the present bridge across Will's Creek replaced it. The old bridge was torn down during the construction of the Will's Creek flood control system in the 1950s.|$|R

5|$|This {{ship was}} the 74-gun Hercule under Captain Louis L'Héritier, newly {{commissioned}} at Lorient and sailing to Brest {{to join the}} main French fleet and the British squadron immediately changed direction to intercept the new target. Facing overwhelming odds L'Héritier attempted to escape <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> Raz de Sein passage, but found the tide against him and so anchored {{at the mouth of}} the passage to await the British attack. At 21:15 Mars reached Hercule, coming under heavy fire as Hood manoeuvred into position, bringing his ship crashing alongside the French vessel. For more than an hour the ships fired directly into one another, so close that their guns could not be run out but had to be fired from inside the ships. Damage and casualties were severe on both sides, the latter including Hood who was mortally wounded at the height of the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Fighting paused. Mortier and Gazan {{waited for}} Dupont's arrival while Kutuzov and Miloradovich waited for Strik's and Dokhturov's. Schmitt's column was {{expected}} to be the last to join the fight because it had to march the greatest distance. The timing of the respite12:00 or 14:00varies, depending on whose reports are consulted. Strik arrived first and immediately assaulted Gazan's line with three battalions, pushing the French out of Dürenstein. Caught between two strong forces, Gazan attempted to push his way back through Dürenstein, to reach the river where the flotilla could evacuate his exhausted troops. Withdrawing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> Danube canyon and fighting off the Russian force at their rear, Gazan and his division were trapped when more of Strik's Russians appeared to block their retreat. The narrow defiles hampered the Russians; Strik's men had to march out of the canyons, form ranks and attack in waves. Despite Strik's continuous assault in the next two to three hours, Mortier and Gazan pushed the Russians back up the narrow fissure in the hillside. At this point, Dokhturov's column appeared behind the French line and joined the battle. The French were outnumbered more than three to one, assaulted in the front by Miloradovich's column, in the middle by Strik's and in the rear by Dokhturov.|$|E
5|$|US-89 leaves Salt Lake City at exit 312 of I-15, {{where it}} acts as I-15's {{frontage}} roads. Just south of I-15's junction with I-215, US-89 splits to the northeast, passing through Bountiful and Woods Cross. A northerly curve onto 500 West removes the highway from Bountiful's Main Street, and it merges with I-15 at exit 317 to bypass Centerville and Farmington, where the old road (former US-91, but never US-89) is SR-106, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>narrow</b> strip of land that separates Farmington Bay from the Wasatch Mountains. US-89 leaves I-15 at exit 324, where the Legacy Parkway also ends, and proceeds north on a freeway. This portion of US-89 {{is the only one}} to include exit numbers based on its own mileage, as opposed to the overlapping I-15 or I-70. The freeway ends after US-89 crosses SR-273, the former surface alignment of US-91 in both directions, and heads north as a four-lane road along the Wasatch foothills, to the east of Layton and Hill Air Force Base. After crossing I-84 in Uintah, US-89 enters Ogden, which it traverses via Washington Boulevard, rejoining old US-91 (now SR-26) south of downtown. Beyond Ogden, US-89 continues in a general northerly direction along the thin strip between Willard Bay and the Wasatch Mountains to Brigham City, where it finally turns east away from the I-15 corridor.|$|E
50|$|In 1907 the {{syndicate}} acquired several railroad companies, {{including the}} George's Creek and Cumberland Railroad (GC&C), which {{had built a}} line west <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Cumberland <b>Narrows,</b> and then south to Lonaconing, Maryland. Using the portion of <b>the</b> line <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Narrows,</b> <b>the</b> Connellsville Extension was built west from Cumberland to Connellsville, Pennsylvania, beginning in 1910, and it was completed in 1912.
