500|$|Marjorie Gilberg, {{executive}} director of the anti-teenage violence group Break the Cycle, commented that [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] can teach listeners about the dangers of abusive relationships if interpreted correctly. She believed that because popular culture often depicts what is socially acceptable, people may accept such violence more easily. She added, [...] "One problem, though,... is that the song reflects myths about domestic violence—myths that lead to blaming the victim." [...] Gilberg said the victim is often accused of being as guilty as the partner but wants to be loved, not abused. Terry O'Neill, a feminist {{and the president of the}} National Organization for Women, criticized the lyric, [...] "But your temper's just as bad as mine is / You're the same as me", saying it is a typical excuse used by abusive men for aggression and that [...] "it's only 2-year-olds and violent men who use violence <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want." [...] She added that Rihanna unintentionally glorifies domestic violence in the song despite attempting to fight it.|$|E
500|$|Keith Baxter {{compared}} Welles to Falstaff, {{since they}} were both perpetually short of money, often lied and cheated people <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> needed and were always merry and fun loving. Film scholar Jack Jorgens also compared Welles to Falstaff, stating that [...] "to a man who directed and starred in a masterpiece and has since staggered through three decades of underfinanced, hurried, flawed films, scores of bit parts, narrations, and interviews which debased his talent, dozens of projects which died for want of persistence and financing, {{the story of a}} fat, aging jester exiled from his audience and no longer able to triumph over impossible obstacles with wit and torrential imagination might well seem tragic." [...] When Joss Ackland played Falstaff on the stage in 1982, {{he said that he was}} more inspired by Welles than by Welles's performance as Falstaff, stating that [...] "like Falstaff, I believe he could have achieved so much, but it was frittered away." [...] Kenneth S. Rothwell has called Hal's rejection of Falstaff allegorical to Hollywood's rejection of Welles. Welles had become deeply depressed in the late 1950s after the disappointment of making Touch of Evil, his intended Hollywood comeback.|$|E

"The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] is {{the most}} obvious {{reference}} to Frankenstein made by the series, although traces of the story are seen elsewhere in the first season episode [...] "Young at Heart" [...] and the sixth season episode [...] "The Beginning". In addition, the series' overarching mythology revolves around shadowy Syndicate leaders who salvage alien spacecraft for their own technological use and create human-alien hybrids. The episode contains themes relating to motherhood and sexuality. According to film studies writer Linda Badley, this episode, and season four's [...] "Home", foreshadow Scully's impending motherhood and her realization, in following episodes [...] "Christmas Carol" [...] and [...] "Emily", {{that she has been}} used to create a human-alien hybrid, Emily. Diane Negra, in her book Off-White Hollywood: American Culture and Ethnic Female Stardom, points out that while The Great Mutato impregnates both Shaineh Berkowitz and Elizabeth Pollidori without their consent or knowledge, it is [...] "an oversimplification" [...] to label the monster as a rapist, because both Berkowitz and Pollidori [...] "desire for children through unconventional means".

With puppy socialization, classical conditioning involves pairing something they love with something within the environment. Additionally, operant conditioning involves the puppy learning to do something <b>to</b> achieve <b>getting</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> want. These two learning types can occur simultaneously with a puppy having the ability to learn both an internal and external response to a stimulus. In contrast, a puppy can also demonstrate methods of actively avoiding a situation they do not enjoy.|$|R

Ethical physicians could and should not consider money in deciding <b>what</b> <b>they</b> should do for sick patients. Patients were to receive whatever services they needed, regardless of its cost. Reasoning based on cost has been strenuously resisted; it violated the Hippocratic Oath, was associated with rationing, and derided as putting a price on life, akin to the economist who knew the price of everything but the value of nothing.

2500|$|On {{the night}} of July 13, 1977, a major {{blackout}} occurred in New York City, affecting all five boroughs. Arson, looting, and vandalism occurred in low-income neighborhoods across the city. Bushwick {{saw some of the}} most devastating damage and losses. While local owners in the predominantly Puerto Rican Knickerbocker Avenue and Graham Avenue shopping districts were able to defend their stores with force, suburban owners with stores on the Broadway shopping district saw their shops looted and burned. Twenty-seven stores, some of which were of mixed use, along Broadway were burned (Goodman 104). Looters (and residents who bought from looters) saw the blackout as an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> otherwise could not afford. Fires spread to many residential buildings as well. After the riots were over and the fires were put out, residents saw [...] "some streets that looked like Brooklyn Heights, and others that looked like Dresden in 1945" [...] (Goodman 181): unsafe dwellings and empty lots among surviving buildings.

2500|$|Her {{following}} effort, Klondike Annie (1936) dealt, as best {{it could}} given the heavy censorship, with religion and hypocrisy. Some critics called the film her screen masterpiece, {{but not everyone}} felt the same way. Press baron and would-be film mogul William Randolph Hearst, ostensibly offended by an offhanded remark West made about his mistress, Marion Davies, sent a private memo to all his editors stating, [...] "That Mae West picture 'Klondike Annie' is a filthy picture...We should have editorials roasting that picture, Mae West, and Paramount...DO NOT ACCEPT ANY ADVERTISING OF THIS PICTURE." [...] At one point, Hearst asked aloud, [...] "Isn't it time Congress did something about the Mae West menace?" [...] Paramount executives felt they had to tone down the West characterization, or face further recrimination. This may be surprising by today's standards, as West's films contained no nudity, no profanity, and very little violence. Though raised {{in an era when}} women held second-place roles in society, West portrayed confident women who were not afraid to use their sexual wiles <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted.

2500|$|The fourth grave {{strategic}} miscalculation {{made by the}} Chiang {{government was}} financial / economical: {{due to the lack}} of money, those bandits turned guerrillas were not sufficiently provided with supplies and money. [...] The bandits turned guerrilla had no problem of looting the local population <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> need, as they had done for decades, which inevitably drove the general popular support further into the communist side. [...] The little financial support provided by the nationalists was simply not enough to support such guerrilla and insurgency warfare on such a large scale, when the country was in desperate need of resources to recover from the devastation of war. [...] Another unexpected but disastrous result of the insufficient financial support was that it had greatly eroded the support of the nationalists within its own ranks. [...] The wealthy landowners and businessmen were the strong supporters of Chiang’s government and as their properties were confiscated by the communists and redistributed to the poor, their hatred toward the communist regime was enough to cause many of them to stay behind voluntarily to fight behind the enemy line. [...] However, the landowners and businessmen were also longtime victims of bandits due to their wealth, and suffered even more than the general populace. [...] As these former landowners and businessmen turned guerrilla fighters were ordered to join their former bandits who once threatened, looted, kidnapped and even killed them and their relatives, it was obvious that such cooperation was in name only and cannot produce any actual benefits, and the alienation and discontent toward the nationalist regime harbored by these once ardent nationalists would only grow greater.|$|E
2500|$|The Dubois Brothers {{were known}} to terrorize the owners of nightclubs and bars in order to force the owners into paying {{protection}} taxes and then would begin to take over their business. They {{were known to}} use these tactics similarly with drug dealers, prostitutes, pimps, loan sharks, strippers, thieves and fences. The Brothers would start by frequenting a bar or nightclub either themselves or through sending an associate or cronies, they would begin by seeming friendly {{and then move on}} to picking fights with patrons, vandalizing the premises, commence harassing staff and assaulting the owner in a hostile take over. It would continue to get progressively worse until the owner could not take anymore of the attacks and agreed to what they Dubois Brothers were wanting. Majority of the time {{there seemed to be no}} option for the owners once the Brothers became interested, they would do what it took in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted. [...] The Dubois Brothers would often settle for $100 a week in protection tax or payments, which at the time would have been equivalent to around $1000 a week today, with the Brothers collecting individually from dozens of bars or clubs. One witness, Charles Houle, who owned a bar on Notre Dame street west in Montreal claimed to police that the Dubois Brothers, specifically Raymond, in 1965 had paid a quick visit to his bar shortly they had opened and demanded he pay the weekly fee for the protection tax. It turned out that even at his testimony many years later he was still paying the tax and at this time it was believed to have totalled $50,000. Once there was control over the bar by Dubois Brother they would force integration of other criminal activities such as: control hiring so they could hire criminals, loansharking, drugs, gambling, etc. The owners would have no say in the matter and the criminal activities and the Dubois Brothers would gain a business or home base for their transactions and other criminal business.|$|E
