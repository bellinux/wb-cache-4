40|$|It is an {{appealing}} {{notion that the}} movements of the speech organs may at some level in the control chain be initiated by step commands. Clearly, many muscular movements, not only in the speech apparatus, can be described as responses of an inertial system to a more or less complex set of step forces. The inertia is then not only mechanical but also due to neural propagation and other delays. <b>The</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organ</b> movements are eventually manifested in the appearance and movements of the formants in the speech wave. The experiment to be described here is a drastic shortcut across the whole set of nonlinear transformations from imaginary stepwise muscular excitations, over movements and area functions to the speech wave. Thus the principle here used is to operate with the formant parameters themselves as being well behaved step responses. Of course one may then not hope for more than a moderate approximation to the natural speech, but the method is very well suited for a technical implementation of a synthesis by rule system. The setup for the experiment coasists of a CDC 1700 computer interfaced with the OVE I 11 serial formant synthesizer and various equipment for operator control and monitoring. The initial work is to build up a library of typical formant frequency and excitation level values. For this purpose the operator works with a handle that can be moved over a plane surface. The handle has two sensors to convey its location to the computer which plots a mark at the pertinent coordinates on a display oscilloscope. The plot on the oscilloscope shows as a time-frequency diagram the synthesis parameters in the stylized square wave form shown in Fig. 111 -A- 1. A set of program control commands are displayed {{at the edge of the}} plot. By pointing at these using the handle the operator can initiate such things as to insert, delete, or move data points, and select parameters to display. ...|$|E

50|$|In articulatory phonetics, {{the manner}} of {{articulation}} is the configuration and interaction of <b>the</b> articulators (<b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> such as <b>the</b> tongue, lips, and palate) when making a speech sound.

2500|$|Following the Indic tradition, Hangul consonants are {{classified}} according to <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> {{involved in their}} production.

Contributions of the muscles to the tongue movement were evaluated by the distance between the equilibrium positions. Based on the EPs and the muscle contributions, an invariant mapping (the EP map) was established to function the connection of a spatial location to a muscle force. Co-contractions between agonist and antagonist muscles were simulated using the EP maps. The simulations demonstrated that coarticulation with multiple targets could be compatibly realized using the co-contraction mechanism. The implementation of the co-contraction mechanism enables relatively independent control over the tongue tip and body. 1...|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{disorders}} {{that affect the}} human voice; these include speech impediments, and growths and lesions on the vocal folds. Talking improperly {{for long periods of}} time causes vocal loading, which is stress inflicted on <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs.</b> When vocal injury is done, often an ENT specialist may be able to help, but the best treatment is the prevention of injuries through good vocal production. Voice therapy is generally delivered by a speech-language pathologist.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> of {{different}} speakers differ in size. As children grow up, their <b>organs</b> of <b>speech</b> become larger {{and there are}} differences between male and female adults. The differences concern not only size, but also proportions. They affect the pitch of the voice and to a substantial extent also the formant frequencies, which characterize <b>the</b> different <b>speech</b> sounds. <b>The</b> organic quality of speech has a communicative function in a restricted sense, since it is merely informative about the speaker. It will be expressed independently of the speaker’s intention.|$|R
50|$|The vocal-auditory channel {{describes}} the way vocal signals {{can be used}} to produce language. The speaker uses a vocal tract (containing most of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs)</b> to produce <b>speech</b> sounds, and <b>the</b> hearer employs an auditory apparatus (the sense of hearing) to receive and process <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> sounds. This is why human language is said to be based on speech sounds produced by the articulatory system and received through the auditory system. The vocal channel is a particularly excellent means through which speech sounds can be accompanied or substituted by gestures, facial expressions, body movement, and way of dressing.|$|R
50|$|Visible Speech is {{a system}} of phonetic symbols {{developed}} by Alexander Melville Bell in 1867 to represent the position of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> in articulating sounds. Bell was known internationally as a teacher of speech and proper elocution and an author of books on the subject. The system is composed of symbols that show the position and movement of the throat, tongue, and lips as they produce the sounds of language, {{and it is a}} type of phonetic notation. The system was used to aid the deaf in learning to speak.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs,</b> {{everyone}} agrees, {{evolved in}} the first instance not for speech but for more basic bodily functions such as feeding and breathing. Nonhuman primates have broadly similar organs, but with different neural controls. Apes use their highly flexible, maneuverable tongues for eating but not for vocalizing. [...] When an ape is not eating, fine motor control over its tongue is deactivated. Either it is performing gymnastics with its tongue or it is vocalising; it cannot perform both activities simultaneously. Since this applies to mammals in general, Homo sapiens is exceptional in harnessing mechanisms designed for respiration and ingestion to the radically different requirements of articulate speech.|$|R
50|$|In {{linguistics}} (articulatory phonetics), articulation {{refers to}} how the tongue, lips, jaw, vocal cords, and other <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> used to produce sounds are used to make sounds. Speech sounds are categorized by manner of articulation and place of articulation. Place of articulation refers to where the airstream in the mouth is constricted. Manner of articulation refers to {{the manner in which}} <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> interact, such as how closely the air is restricted, what form of airstream is used (e.g. pulmonic, implosive, ejectives, and clicks), whether or not the vocal cords are vibrating, and whether the nasal cavity is opened to the airstream. The concept is primarily used for the production of consonants, but can be used for vowels in qualities such as voicing and nasalization. For any place of articulation, there may be several manners of articulation, and therefore several homorganic consonants.|$|R
30|$|Dysphonia or {{pathological}} voice {{refers to}} speech problems resulting from damage to or malformation of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs.</b> Currently, patients {{are required to}} routinely visit a specialist to follow up their progress. Moreover, the traditional ways to diagnose voice pathology are subjective, and depending {{on the experience of}} the specialist, different evaluations can be resulted. Developing an automated technique saves time for both the patients and the specialist, and can improve the accuracy of the assessments. In a previous study from our group [7], we introduced the joint TF feature extraction and classification for pathological speech verification. In this study, we provide this application with a focus on non-stationary TF feature analysis + hard cluster labeling, and compare its performance with traditional clustering methods.|$|R

40|$|A general ageing of the organism, {{including}} hormonal, psychological, {{and cognitive}} changes, affects <b>the</b> person’s <b>speech</b> production, too. <b>The</b> slowdown of mental operations and of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> may affect <b>the</b> fluency of <b>speech,</b> but relatively few papers are specifically devoted to disfluencies in old people’s <b>speech,</b> and <b>the</b> various authors disagree concerning frequency data. In the present paper, we examine disfluencies of {{young and old}} speakers {{from the point of}} view of their frequency and temporal features. The results show that in natural spontaneous narratives, when the task did not involve any particular mental effort, disfluencies occurred in roughly equal numbers with both age groups. In a speech situation made mentally more demanding, we attested such phenomena more frequently in our young subjects’ speech. There are differences between the two age groups both with respect to the types and temporal features of disfluencies...|$|R

25|$|Articulation is {{the process}} by which the joint product of the {{vibrator}} and the resonators is shaped into recognizable <b>speech</b> sounds through <b>the</b> muscular adjustments and movements of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs.</b> These adjustments and movements of the articulators result in verbal communication and thus form the essential difference between the human voice and other musical instruments. Singing without understandable words limits the voice to nonverbal communication. In relation to the physical process of singing, vocal instructors tend to focus more on active articulation as opposed to passive articulation. There are five basic active articulators: the lip ("labial consonants"), the flexible front of the tongue ("coronal consonants"), the middle/back of the tongue ("dorsal consonants"), the root of the tongue together with the epiglottis ("pharyngeal consonants"), and the glottis ("glottal consonants"). These articulators can act independently of each other, and two or more may work together in what is called coarticulation.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{long-term}} goal of LPP {{is to achieve}} an integrated model of phonetics and phonology. It also works on applications to clinical phonetics and language learning. LPP has recently assembled a research platform for investigating the behavior of each <b>speech</b> <b>organ</b> involved in <b>speech</b> production. <b>The</b> platform is elaborated by a joint effort between engineers, phoneticians and clinicians. It provides tools to investigate various phenomena of coordination and compensation across <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> that are observed in <b>the</b> production of <b>speech</b> by normal or pathological speakers, foreign language learners, and singers. The paper described the instrumentation techniques, both conventional and new, that are currently used at our laboratory for investigating the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> involved in <b>speech</b> production. <b>The</b> examples that were provided highlight the innovative value of the multisensory platform for phonetic studies.

Both illustrate the benefit of using several exploratory techniques in parallel, suggesting that data based on a single technique can be misleading. Research issues in phonetics and phonology include patterns of synchronic variation and evolutionary paths (in particular prosodic influences over the realization of segments) and typological patterns of phoneme distributions and phonotactic constraints (in particular recurrent asymmetries within sound systems).

The most evident for of process is epenthesis of schwa in consonant clusters and epithesis of a stop or a fricative before fricatives. The data show that vocalic epenthesis frequently occurs in consonant clusters, especially in those clusters which require different manner of articulation, or articulatory organ (or part of it) for example between obstruents and sonorants, between obstruents and between sonorants. Consonantal epenthesis occurs in words with difficult phonemes, especially obstruents, before the velars, before sibilant, before fricatives (adding affricates).

40|$|Computational {{modeling}} of <b>the</b> <b>speech</b> <b>organs</b> {{is able to}} improve our understanding of human speech motor control. In order to investigate muscle activation in speech motor control, we have developed an automatic estimation method based on a 3 D physiological articulatory model. In this method, the articulatory target was defined by the entire posture of the tongue and jaw in the midsagittal plane, which {{was reduced to a}} six-dimensional space by principal component analysis (PCA). In the PCA space, the distance between an articulatory target and the model was gradually minimized by automatically adjusting muscle activations. The adjustment of muscle activations was guided by a dynamic PCA workspace that was used to predict individual muscle functions in a given position. This dynamic PCA workspace was estimated on the basis of an interpolation of eight reference PCA workspaces. The proposed method was assessed by estimating muscle activations for five Japanese vowel postures that were extracted from magnetic resonance images. The results showed that the proposed method can generate muscle activation patterns that can control the model to realize given articulatory targets. In addition, the estimated muscle activation patterns were consistent with anatomical knowledge and previously reported measurement data...|$|R
