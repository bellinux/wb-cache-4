5|$|Elsewhere, {{during their}} girls night out, Ruby {{is trying to}} {{convince}} Ashley to find another guy since Sean is always working. Ashley tells Mary Margaret that all she wants is to be with Sean. Mary Margaret understands since her own romantic arrangement is not ideal. Sean shows up on a break from work and proposes to Ashley; she accepts and they {{go out for a}} drive. David shows up next to give Mary Margret her Valentine, but mistakenly gives her Kathryn's. Mary Margaret says she <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> two people were meant to be together they would find a way, but maybe she and David need another way. She tells him he should probably go home.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{repeatedly}} questions Vaughn, {{believing he}} is {{acting as the}} fall guy for his two friends. Vaughn says nothing, but eventually writes a letter of apology to Ellison. Felton closes the case despite Howard's protests for more time to investigate. Vaughn eventually pleads guilty at his arraignment and insists on serving life without parole. Marvin and Tweety are sentenced to 30 years in prison, but Ellison tells Howard he feels no comfort because his wife is still dead. Howard tries to give Vaughn's letter to Ellison, but he refuses to accept it. Howard eventually speaks directly to Vaughn in prison, where Vaughn admits he handled the gun during the stick-up because he <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> he had the gun, he could control the situation and prevent anyone from getting hurt. Vaughn said he {{lost control of the}} robbery, and insists he needs to serve the life sentence to make amends. A devastated Howard finally agrees with Felton's opinion that Vaughn was indeed the shooter.|$|E
25|$|Two dozen Labour MPs {{issued a}} {{statement}} on 8 August stating that forcing Nasser to denationalise the canal against Egypt's wishes would violate the UN charter. Other opposition politicians were less conditional in their support. Former Labour Foreign Minister Herbert Morrison hinted that he would support unilateral action by the government. Jo Grimond, who became Liberal Party leader that November, <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> Nasser went unchallenged the whole Middle East would go his way.|$|E

25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about things {{in a way that}} he never would have <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> he had not portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful sense he has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E
25|$|I thought I {{would write}} Memories and the City in six months, {{but it took}} me one year to complete. And I was working twelve hours a day, just reading and working. My life, because of so many things, was in a crisis; I don’t {{want to go into}} those details: divorce, father dying, {{professional}} problems, problems with this, problems with that, everything was bad. I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> I were to be weak I would have a depression. But every day I would wake up and have a cold shower and sit down and remember and write, always paying attention to the beauty of the book. Honestly, I may have hurt my mother, my family. My father was dead, but my mother is still alive. But I can’t care about that; I must care about the beauty of the book.|$|E

500|$|I {{love this}} song for many reasons. It had a {{different}} sound {{than a lot of}} my songs. I related to it personally more than other songs, and I have so much fun with it. I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> it could be a single that it would be incredible to perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal. I was just so excited when I heard this one, 'cause it's the epitome of where I want to go with the future.|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Thompson {{was cast}} in the West End revival of the musical Me and My Girl, co-starring Robert Lindsay. It {{provided}} a breakthrough in her career, as the production earned rave reviews. She {{played the role of}} Sally Smith for 15 months, which exhausted the actress; she [...] later remarked [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> I did the fucking [...] "Lambeth Walk" [...] one more time I was going to fucking throw up." [...] At the end of 1985, she wrote and starred in her own one-off special for Channel 4, Emma Thompson: Up for Grabs.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} from the war, Lavelli was again offered {{a chance to play}} baseball with the Tigers. He saw a matchup in late 1945 between the National Football League's New York Giants and Washington Redskins and noticed that a former teammate at Ohio State named Sam Fox was an end for the Giants. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> he could make the grade, so could I," [...] Lavelli later said. When Paul Brown offered him a chance to play on a new professional team he was coaching in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) in 1946, Lavelli jumped at the opportunity. He was given a $500 bonus ($ in today's dollars) for signing with the team, called the Cleveland Browns.|$|E
500|$|Otto {{hoped to}} remain in Calgary after his {{contract}} expired following the 1995 season, but with the Flames facing financial difficulties as the NHL's salary structure rapidly changed, the team was unable {{to agree to a}} new contract. He was among the most sought after players in free agency, and was pursued by the New York Rangers, who hoped that he could help their team shut down Eric Lindros of the Philadelphia Flyers. [...] Otto considered the offer, and <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> the Rangers thought that highly of their opponent, he would be better off playing with Lindros than against him. [...] Otto signed a three-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 21, 1995.|$|E
500|$|With Singer busy {{preparing}} X2, Confessions was rejuvenated with Clooney {{taking over}} as director. Miramax Films agreed to cover distribution duties and co-finance the film. In the end, funding for Confessions came from Miramax, Clooney's own Section Eight Productions, Village Roadshow Pictures, producer Andrew Lazar's Mad Chance, Allied Filmmakers, and The Kushner-Locke Company. Clooney explained, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> I {{came on board}} as a director, for scale, {{and was able to}} bring everybody else on inexpensively, if I could get the film back down to $30 million, then I {{was going to be able}} to get the film made.

500|$|Lew Grade, the ITC Entertainment financier, ordered Anderson {{to cancel}} {{production}} on The Secret Service during a test {{screening of the}} pilot episode, [...] "A Case for the Bishop", in December 1968. Objecting to the concept {{on the grounds that}} audiences in the United States would be confused by the Unwinese, Grade capped the production at the thirteen episodes that either had been completed or were in production {{at the time of the}} screening. Anderson countered that a nonsense language such as Unwinese is inherently incomprehensible, and questioned Grade's reasoning for the cancellation, responding that [...] "I chose Stanley Unwin because you are not supposed to understand Stanley Unwin, even if you're British.

500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape {{was the first time he}} touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> I spoke, my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".|$|E

500|$|Gosling's first action {{role was}} in Drive, {{based on a}} novel by James Sallis. Gosling portrayed a Hollywood stunt {{performer}} who moonlights as a getaway driver and he has described the film as a [...] "violent John Hughes movie": [...] "I always <b>thought</b> <b>if</b> Pretty in Pink had head-smashing it would be perfect". Roger Ebert compared Gosling to Steve McQueen and stated that he [...] "embodies presence and sincerity ... he has shown a gift for finding arresting, powerful characters [...] can achieve just about anything. Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal pondered [...] "the ongoing mystery of how he manages {{to have so much}} impact with so little apparent effort. It's irresistible to liken his economical style to that of Marlon Brando." [...] The film was a box office success, grossing $70 million worldwide from a production budget of $15 million.|$|E

Five {{said that they would}} take him first in the draft; Sid Gillman said of Manning, [...] "this is a pro quarterback". The Colts' scouts initially favored Leaf, but the team's management and coaches were gradually won over by Manning's attitude, particularly as Manning showed up prepared to a scheduled interview meeting with the Colts' staff while Leaf arrived late. Colts general manager Bill Polian who had the final say on the draft selection recalled Manning saying [...] "I'll leave you with this <b>thought.</b> <b>If</b> you take me, I promise you we will win a championship.

The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice.
