40|$|The {{qualitative}} {{assessment of}} general movements (GMs) in preterm infants is a sensitive method {{to investigate the}} integrity of the central nervous system. The question arises whether systemic infections affect <b>the</b> quality of <b>GMs</b> in a similar fashion to brain lesions. We were able to provide an answer to this problem in six infants (gestational age 24. 4 - 32. 4 weeks, birth weight 600 - 1660 grams), who had initially normal GMs as analyzed from sequential video-recordings. All infants sustained a proven septicaemia (Candida albicans in two, Staphylococcus aureus in three, a coagulase-negative staphylococcus in one infant). Unintentionally, recordings were also made during the acute phase. The complexity and variability of <b>the</b> <b>GMs</b> remained largely intact in five of the six infants; only one infant had transiently abnormal GMs. Compared with 1 week before the acute phase, the speed and amplitude of <b>the</b> <b>GMs</b> were diminished, giving <b>the</b> <b>GMs</b> a sluggish appearance. One to two weeks after the acute phase of septicaemia, <b>the</b> quality of <b>GMs,</b> i. e. speed and amplitude, had normalized in all infants. This study demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} discriminate between abnormal GMs due to cerebral lesions and sluggish GMs due to severe systemic infections, when the complexity of <b>the</b> <b>GMs</b> is considered as the main characteristic for judgement of normality of GM-quality.

5|$|Arrangers called gamemasters (GMs) {{determine}} {{the rules and}} setting of a LARP, and may also influence an event and act as referees while it is taking place. The GMs may also do the logistical work, or {{there may be other}} arrangers who handle details such as advertising the event, booking a venue, and financial management. Unlike <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> in a tabletop role-playing game, a LARP GM seldom has an overview of everything that is happening during play because numerous participants may be interacting at once. For this reason, a LARP GM's role is often less concerned with tightly maintaining a narrative or directly entertaining the players, and more with arranging the structure of the LARP before play begins and facilitating the players and crew to maintain the fictional environment during play.|$|E

In a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|R

5|$|The blow dealt to the community's {{industrial}} {{economy in the}} 1970s was slightly mitigated {{by the presence of}} auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker to compete with the Corvette, was manufactured in an industrial complex on Youngstown's Albert Street. This company moved away after just a few years. A mainstay of Youngstown's {{industrial economy}} has long been <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> Lordstown plant. The General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant is the largest industrial employer in the area. One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier.

Later buses included a combination of single-door, suburban-type transit buses built by Orion Bus Industries and New Flyer, and single-level highway coaches built by Prevost Car and Motor Coach Industries (MCI, now a subsidiary of New Flyer).|$|E
40|$|The {{emerging}} pathogenicity of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) {{is evident}} by {{the increasing number}} of clinical cases of liver abscess (LA) due to KP infection. A unique property of KP is its thick mucoid capsule. The bacterial capsule has been found to contain fucose in KP strains causing LA but not in those causing urinary tract infections. The products of <b>the</b> <b>gmd</b> and wcaG genes are responsible for converting mannose to fucose in KP. A KP strain, KpL 1, which is known to have a high death rate in infected mice, was mutated by inserting an apramycin-resistance gene into <b>the</b> <b>gmd.</b> <b>The</b> mutant expressed genes upstream and downstream of gmd, but not gmd itself, as determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The DNA mapping confirmed the disruption of <b>the</b> <b>gmd</b> gene. This mutant decreased its ability to kill infected mice and showed decreased virulence in infected HepG 2 cells. Compared with wild-type KpL 1, <b>the</b> <b>gmd</b> mutant lost fucose in capsular polysaccharides, increased biofilm formation and interacted more readily with macrophages. The mutant displayed morphological changes with long filament forms and less uniform sizes. The mutation also converted the serotype from K 1 of wild-type to K 2 and weak K 3. The results indicate that disruption of the fucose synthesis gene affected the pathophysiology of this bacterium and {{may be related to the}} virulence of this KpL 1 strain...|$|R

5|$|A more {{upmarket}} SS, the SS V-Series {{represents the}} first time this type of naming has been applied to Holden products. The V-Series naming is reminiscent of the V-badging on selected Cadillac models, another member of <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> family. The badge design on the bootlid bears strong resemblance to the ones used by Cadillac. But whereas Cadillac uses it to signify high-performance versions of its products, Holden V-Series variants boast extra features. The V-Series variants were introduced, largely due to a fully optioned Commodore SS in the VZ range being rather successful. The SS V offers extra luxuries at a similar price point to the preceding SS. Inside, it is recognisable by the metallic look pedals and instruments matched with the exterior colour. Additionally, the entire dashboard can be optioned in a range of loud colours: bright red, orange or black. The SS V exterior is equally adventurous, exhibiting five-spoke 19-inch alloy wheels and the option of larger 20-inch wheels: the largest wheels ever fitted to a Holden car.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma interior package could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as <b>the</b> <b>GM</b> Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|The National League {{franchise}} in Philadelphia {{was established in}} 1883 following the dissolution of Worcester. The team adopted the Philadelphia Phillies name in 1884 and has used the moniker, and been located in the city, since that time. The team's first manager was Bob Ferguson. Charlie Manuel was the manager from 2005 to 2013 until he was fired on August 16, 2013 he {{was replaced by the}} 3rd base coach Ryne Sandberg. Sandberg resigned on June 26, 2015. Pete Mackanin was the replacement. Manuel was the first Phillies manager since Dallas Green in 1980 to win a World Series (2008) and to lead his team to five consecutive playoff appearances since Danny Ozark (1976–1978). Manuel's career managerial record is 867–678, having previously managed the Cleveland Indians; his record with the Phillies was 780-636 surpassing Gene Mauch's previous regular season record of 645 wins (1960–68). The Phillies won five consecutive division championships (2007–2011) and back-to-back National League pennants (2008–2009) during Manuel's tenure. Manuel has the most postseason wins (27) in team history, while Ozark has the most playoff losses (9). Larry Bowa is the only Phillies skipper to capture the Manager of the Year Award, which he won in 2001. Four Phillies managers have been inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame for service to the Phillies: Paul Owens, Bowa, Gavvy Cravath, and Green. Mackanin will not return as manager for 2018 season, but will be a Senior Adviser to <b>the</b> <b>GM.</b> Brad Ausmus, John Farrell, Dusty Baker, Mickey Callaway, and Raul Ibanez are all candidates to replace Mackanin. On October 29, 2017, the Phillies reportedly decided that Gabe Kapler would be their next manager.|$|E

40|$|There {{are quite}} a number of {{different}} metrics of network robustness. This paper addresses the rationality of four metrics of network robustness (the algebraic connectivity, the effective resistance, the average edge betweenness, and the efficiency) by investigating the robust growth of generalized meshes (GMs). First, a heuristic growth algorithm (the Proximity-Growth algorithm) is proposed. <b>The</b> resulting proximity-optimal <b>GMs</b> are intuitively robust and hence are adopted as the benchmark. Then, a generalized mesh (GM) is grown up by stepwise optimizing a given measure of network robustness. The following findings are presented: (1) <b>The</b> algebraic connectivity-optimal <b>GMs</b> deviate quickly from <b>the</b> proximity-optimal <b>GMs,</b> yielding a number of less robust GMs. This hints that the rationality of the algebraic connectivity as a measure of network robustness is still in doubt. (2) <b>The</b> effective resistace-optimal <b>GMs</b> and <b>the</b> average edge betweenness-optimal GMs are in line with <b>the</b> proximity-optimal <b>GMs.</b> This partly justifies the two quantities as metrics of network robustness. (3) <b>The</b> efficiency-optimal <b>GMs</b> deviate gradually from <b>the</b> proximity-optimal <b>GMs,</b> yielding some less robust <b>GMs.</b> This suggests <b>the</b> limited utility of the efficiency as a measure of network robustness...|$|R
