5|$|It is {{believed}} that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada's elite military unit, Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2). The first investigation, named Sand Trap, examined allegations that a JTF2 member {{was involved in the}} 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering. No charges were laid {{at the conclusion of the}} investigation. However, a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man. <b>This</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service, and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2.|$|E

25|$|Some {{critics argue}} {{that the lack of}} results arising from <b>this</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> the result of {{systemic}} racism. This was also believed to be an issue in the case of Vancouver's missing women and the Robert Pickton murders. The issue of systemic racism in these cases is explored in Finding Dawn, the 2006 documentary by Christine Welsh whose film includes a section on the Highway of Tears victim Ramona Wilson, including interviews with family and community members. Often overlooked in reports on the Highway of Tears is the fact that over half of the missing women are First Nation.|$|E
25|$|For hemorrhagic strokes, a CT or MRI scan with {{intravascular}} contrast {{may be able}} {{to identify}} abnormalities in the brain arteries (such as aneurysms) or other sources of bleeding, and structural MRI if this shows no cause. If this too does not identify an underlying reason for the bleeding, invasive cerebral angiography could be performed but this requires access to the bloodstream with an intravascular catheter and can cause further strokes as well as complications at the insertion site and <b>this</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> therefore reserved for specific situations. If there are symptoms suggesting that the hemorrhage might have occurred as a result of venous thrombosis, CT or MRI venography can be used to examine the cerebral veins.|$|E

2500|$|Cleland was {{originally}} appointed {{to serve on}} the 9/11 Commission but resigned shortly after, having been appointed to the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Before his resignation, he said that the Bush administration was [...] "stonewalling" [...] and blocking the committee's access to key documents and witnesses. A key figure in the widespread criticism of governmental opacity regarding 9/11, he was quoted as saying in November 2003: [...] "I... cannot look any American in the eye, especially family members of victims, and say the commission had full access. <b>This</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> now compromised." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the general}} Scipio Africanus wanted to confront Hannibal, a plan [...] "strongly {{favored by the}} plebs". Plautus {{apparently}} pushes for the plan {{to be approved by}} the senate, working his audience up with the thought of an enemy in close proximity and a call to outmaneuver him. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that Plautus, according to P. B. Harvey, was [...] "willing to insert [...] highly specific allusions comprehensible to the audience". M. Leigh writes in his chapter on Plautus and Hannibal that [...] "the Plautus who emerges from <b>this</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> one whose comedies persistently touch the rawest nerves in the audience for whom he writes".|$|E

2500|$|The book Hitler – Karriere eines Wahns (2000) is {{the result}} from a joint effort of the {{psychiatrist}} Paul Matussek, the media theorist Peter Matussek, and the sociologist Jan Marbach, to overcome the tradition of one-dimensional psychiatric pathography and to seek an interdisciplinary approach instead, taking into account socio-historical dimensions, too. <b>This</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>is</b> focused {{not so much on}} Hitler's personal psychopathology, but rather on a description of the interaction between individual and collective factors that accounted for the overall dynamics of the Hitler madness. The book specifies the interplay between Hitler’s leader role (which was charged with psychotic symptoms) on the one hand, and the fascination that this role invoked in his followers on the other hand. The authors conclude that the Nazi crimes had indeed been an expression of madness, but of a madness which was so strongly accepted by the public that the psychotic Hitler and his followers were factually stabilizing each other in their [...] "mad" [...] worldview.|$|E
