Room temperature deposition of indium on the (2 X 4) /c(2 X 8) surface and subsequent annealing at 450 degrees C leads to the formation of an In-terminated surface showing a (4 X 2) LEED pattern, accompanied with strong changes in the measured surface optical anisotropy. When indium is deposited onto the (4 X 2) /c(8 X 2) surface, on the contrary, the (4 X 2) In-terminated surface is already formed at room temperature deposition without needing annealing, as demonstrated by the RAS spectra.

In the present work, we employ the present EOS to calculate the Ga-Pb phase diagram along the immiscibility gap region. The accuracy of the EOS is tested by consulting the empirical binodal curve. A statistical-mechanical-based theory for the surface tension is employed to obtain an analytical expression for the alloy surface tension.

40|$|Two {{copies of}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 RNA are incorporated into each virus particle and are further converted to a stable dimer as the virus particle matures. Several RNA segments that flank the 5 ′ splice donor site at nucleotide (nt) 289 {{have been shown to}} act as packaging signals. Among these, RNA stem-loop 1 (SL 1) (nt 243 to 277) can trigger RNA dimerization through a “kissing-loop” mechanism and thus is termed the dimerization initiation site. However, it is unknown whether other packaging signals are also needed for dimerization. To pursue this subject, we mutated stem-loop 3 (SL 3) (nt 312 to 325), a GA-rich region (nt 325 to 336), and two G-rich repeats (nt 363 to 367 and nt 405 to 409) in proviral DNA and assessed the effects on RNA dimerization by performing native Northern blot analyses. Our results show that the structure but not the specific RNA sequence of SL 3 is needed not only for efficient viral RNA packaging but also for dimerization. Mutations of <b>the</b> <b>GA-rich</b> sequence severely diminished viral RNA dimerization as well as packaging; the combination of mutations in both SL 3 and <b>the</b> <b>GA-rich</b> region led to further decreases, implying independent roles for each of these two RNA motifs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on the research efforts to develop the growth, processing, and modeling technologies for GaN-based Heterojunction Field Effect Transistors (HFETs). The interest in investigating GaN HFETs is motivated by the advantageous material properties of nitride semiconductor such as large band gap, large breakdown voltage, and high saturation velocity, which make it very promising for the high power and microwave applications. Although enormous progress has been made on GaN transistors in the past decades, the technologies for nitride transistors are still not mature, especially concerning the reliability and stability of the device. In order to improve the device performance, we first optimized the growth and fabrication procedures for the conventional AlGaN barrier HFET, on which high carrier mobility and sheet density were achieved. Second, the AlInN barrier HFET was successfully processed, with which we obtained improved I-V characteristics compared with conventional structure. The lattice-matched AlInN barrier is beneficial in the removal of strain, which leads to better carrier transport characteristics. Furthermore, new device structures have been examined, including recess-gate HFET with n+ GaN cap layer and gate-on-insulator HFET, among which the insertion of gate dielectrics helps to leverage both DC and microwave performances. In order to depict the microwave behavior of the HFET, small signal modeling approaches were used to extract the extrinsic and intrinsic parameters of the device. An 18 -element equivalent circuit model for GaN HFET has been proposed, from which various extraction methods have been tested. Combining the advantages from the cold-FET measurements and hot-FET optimizations, a hybrid extraction method has been developed, in which the parasitic capacitances were attained from the cold pinch-off measurements {{while the rest of the}} parameters from the optimization routine. Small simulation error can be achieved by this method over various bias conditions, demonstrating its capability for the circuit level design applications for GaN HFET. Device physics modeling, on the other hand, can help us to reveal the underlying physics for the device to operate. With the development of quantum drift-diffusion modeling, the self-consistent solution to the Schrödinger-Poisson equations and carrier transport equations were fulfilled. Lots of useful information such as band diagram, potential profile, and carrier distribution can be retrieved.

For x= 0. 4 competition of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions causes a complicated behaviour characterized by two types of magnetic transitions. Huge magnetocrystalline anisotropy {{is responsible for the}} rather anomalous behaviour of the ferromagnetic compositions...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} second-order {{nonlinear}} bulk and third-order nonlinear surface electric-field-induced optical rectification is developed for zinc-blende 4 ¯ 3 m crystal faces of arbitrary indices (hkl). The theory is {{then used to}} account for our experimental results for terahertz generation from GaAs high-index planes (11 N) A and (11 N) B, where N= 2, 3, 4, and 5. The data combined with the calculations allow us to demonstrate that a surface field is present on both <b>the</b> <b>Ga-rich</b> and As-rich faces and to determine that the signs are opposite and that the strengths are similar. Such conclusions are inaccessible by work restricted to low-index planes...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{and thermal}} decomposition of PH 3 and NH 3 on <b>the</b> <b>Ga-rich</b> GaAs(100) -(4 * 1) {{has been studied}} using temperature programmed desorption, isotope exchange reactions and high resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). At 120 K PH 3 adsorbs molecularly while HREELS and isotope exchange reactions with deuterium suggest that PH 2 is the major species present at 300 K. Molecular adsorption is also observed for NH 3 at 150 K when both the physisorbed and chemisorbed states are formed. HREELS and isotope exchange reactions show that dissociation of the molecular state to form NH 2 occurs when the adsorbed phase is heated...|$|E
40|$|The atomic {{structures}} and energies of Ga-rich GaAs(0 0 1) surface reconstructions are examined {{by means of}} first-principles total-energy calculations based on a real-space multigrid method. Our calculations confirm {{the existence of the}} novel f(4 2) structure suggested by Lee et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 (2000) 3890]. (4 6) surface reconstructions suggested to explain STM experiments are found to be unstable. The calculations indicate that the adsorption of Ga adatoms in the trenches of the f(4 2) surface could possibly explain the observed structures. The diffusion of Ga/As adatoms on <b>the</b> <b>Ga-rich</b> GaAs surface is predicted to be anisotropic and should preferably take place parallel to th...|$|E
40|$|Cesium {{adsorption}} on 2 x 4 GaAs (001) was {{studied by}} photoemission and low energy electron diffraction. The different Cs induced {{changes of the}} As 3 d and Ga 3 d core level spectra show that charge transfer is almost complete for Ga surface sites, but is negligible to surface As at a coverage smaller than 0. 3 ML. The situation is opposite for a coverage larger than 0. 3 ML, at which transfer occurs to As but no longer to Ga. Charge transfer to As atoms leads to disordering and destabilization and induces surface conversion from the As-rich surface to <b>the</b> <b>Ga-rich</b> 4 x 2 one after annealing at a reduced temperature of 450 C...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{compositional}} and optical characterization of three series of dilute-Sb GaN 1 − xSbx alloys grown with various Sb flux, under N and Ga-rich conditions, are presented. Using wavelength dispersive x-ray microanalysis and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy {{it is found}} that the N-rich samples (Ga flux 2. 3 × 10 − 7 Torr) under the same growth conditions. The optical properties of <b>the</b> <b>Ga-rich</b> samples are measured using room temperature cathodoluminescence (CL), photoluminescence (PL) and absorption measurements. A broad luminescence peak is observed around 2. 2 eV. The nature and properties of this peak are considered, as is the suitability of these dilute-Sb alloys for use in solar energy conversion devices...|$|E
