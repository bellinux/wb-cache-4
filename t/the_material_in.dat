5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>in</b> the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{consequence}} of generation of dense electronic excitation along {{the paths of}} energetic heavy ions is discussed, emphasizing the fates of electron–hole pairs. It is pointed out that {{a substantial part of}} the energy imparted to electron–hole pairs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> which excitons are self-trapped is converted directly to defect formation energy but do not contribute to heating. However, the thermal spike model can be an appropriate macroscopic model of the track registration of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> which excitons are self-trapped, because energy deposited to <b>the</b> <b>material</b> remains along <b>the</b> ion paths. The energy imparted to electron–hole pairs is diffused away from the ion paths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> which excitons are not self-trapped. This explains the reason why the critical stopping power for track registration is higher <b>in</b> these <b>materials.</b> <b>The</b> difficulty for application of the thermal spike model to these materials is pointed out and it is suggested that nominal defects in densely excited region nucleate fragmental tracks...|$|R
