His {{knowledge}} of her {{made it easy for}} him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>door</b> as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E

5|$|Recording {{sessions}} and meetings for No Doubt's third studio album Tragic Kingdom (1995) began in 1993 between members Eric Stefani, Gwen Stefani, Tony Kanal, Tom Dumont, Adrian Young, and musician Gary Angle. The material produced with Angle was hugely rejected by Interscope Records' officials, {{and had the}} members work with producer Matthew Wilder instead. Upset with working with someone outside the band, Eric eventually stopped recording with the band, and encouraged the remaining members to write the group's songs, as he felt threatened when he did so. After Kanal broke off his seven-year relationship with Gwen, both of them wrote several more songs, until there was enough material for an album. The single's inspiration came when Kanal was having a fight with Stefani, his then-girlfriend, through <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>door</b> of his parents' house in Yorba Linda, California; Stefani later revamped the lyrics to discuss her breakup with Kanal.|$|E

Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder goes around the complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them that the thing is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents.

Fatboy loses his market stall but gets a job selling cars for Max Branning (Jake Wood). He discovers Mercy is leaving, so tries to stop her from leaving but is unable to, and they say an {{emotional}} goodbye. Fatboy is distraught over his loss, and eventually decides to move in with Dot. He helps Dot to track down her half sister Rose Cotton (Polly Perkins) and helps Whitney when her former pimp, Rob Grayson (Jody Latham) tracks her down. Fatboy feels put out when Rose and Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) both move in with Dot.

Following this, Fatboy develops feelings for his friend Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), though Whitney is involved with Tyler Moon (Tony Discipline). When Whitney and Tyler's relationship breaks down, Fatboy admits his feelings for Whitney and the pair start a relationship. Fatboy buys a car for Whitney, but she is initially angry, saying she doesn't want to be owned. However, Whitney relents and accepts the gift. Fatboy notices that Tyler continues to want Whitney, and so warns him off. However, after Whitney gets angry at Lucy (now Hetti Bywater) for dancing with Fatboy, Lucy convinces Tyler to talk to her. They accidentally get locked in a bathroom and Fatboy assumes Whitney has cheated on him, so ends the relationship. Fatboy later visits Tyler, who shows Fatboy that <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>door</b> sticks, and Tyler says that he is happy for Fatboy and Whitney as a couple. However, Whitney soon feels smothered by Fatboy's affection, and when he is about to take Whitney away on holiday, she refuses, and when they kiss she says it is like kissing a friend. She admits that she wants Tyler, and Fatboy is heartbroken. He later punches Tyler. He then becomes a regular DJ at R, and gets a job at the local fast food restaurant, McKlunkies. However, he is sacked when he stands up to his manager, Nico Papadopoulos (Aykut Hilmi) after taking advice from Alfie Moon (Shane Richie).

25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle {{with a smile on}} his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury if she did not testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find any blood on <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>door.</b> Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E

50|$|The 'Gothenburg' {{house was}} first {{produced}} in the early 1960s. As with most Lundby dollshouses produced from the mid-1940s to the 1990s there were many significant and minor variations on each model. This particularly applied to the Gothenburg dollshouse first introduced in the early 1960s. With funky wallpaper, a white frame, a bright red pitched roof, 2 rooms {{on the first floor}} and 3 rooms on the ground floor it became Lundby's most popular house and gradually their mainstay of dollshouse production. It is easy to distinguish between early and later versions of this house during the 1960s. The early model (1960-1964) featured light blue floors, a wooden staircase with full banisters, a tall chimney (1.7") and a wall with an open doorway which divided <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> in two. This model was further refined by giving <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> a separate <b>door</b> this Swedish Fenom. But this privacy only lasted a matter of two or three years and <b>the</b> <b>bathroom's</b> <b>door</b> and dividing wall went all together. Later models (1967-1969) reduced the height of the chimney (0.75") to its present-day size. The 'Terrace' or 'Flat Roof' house was also {{produced in the}} 1960s. Lundby's success with the Gothenburg model gave them the chance to experiment with new house designs. This culminated in the production of the 'Flat Roof' or 'Terrace' house between 1966-67. As its name suggests it had a flat roof, allowing children to place garden furniture on it. Two different models were produced - one which was a solid two storey house and another which came flat packed and could be constructed up to three or four storeys high.|$|R

[...] "Sunday Morning" [...] was released as the album's sixth single. It peaked at number 35 on the Billboard Top 40 Mainstream chart, number 21 in Australia, number 42 in New Zealand, and number 55 in Sweden. Composing the song began when Kanal was having a fight with Stefani, then his girlfriend, through <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>door</b> of his parents' house in Yorba Linda, California. Stefani later changed the lyrics to discuss dealing with her breakup with Kanal. [...] "Hey You!"

500|$|... "Excelsis Dei" [...] {{was written}} by Paul Brown, his second and last script after the earlier episode [...] "Ascension". The episode was {{directed}} by Stephen Surjik, his only credit for the series. Surjik requested to direct an episode {{because he was a}} fan of the show. The episode was noticeably difficult to create; the book The Complete X-Files notes that the entry [...] "gave the staff headaches—both during the shoot and editing process". This was due largely {{to the fact that the}} script arrived for the cast and crew to film only two days in advance. In order to film the scene featuring <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>door</b> bursting with water—a scene Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles called [...] "nail-biting"—special effects supervisor Dave Gauthier built a tank and flooded the set hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. One part of the episode that never made the final cut was an extended look at Michelle's love life. In the script, she is explicitly described as a lesbian and her lover enters her apartment to talk to her. Series creator Chris Carter eventually decided to remove the scene because he felt it [...] "felt gratuitous at that point".|$|E

Other episodes include major scenes set in <b>the</b> boys' <b>bathroom.</b> Additionally, in almost every scene set in the boys' bedroom, the bathtub, shower curtain, or vanity can be seen through <b>the</b> open <b>bathroom</b> <b>door.</b> Beaver uses <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> several times to escape his brother when angry, slamming the door to express his emotions.
