5|$|Following {{seven months}} in Mexico, Middleton's return to Galveston brought a special anticipation. He had {{proposed}} to Jerusha Collins {{at an earlier}} time, and renewed the proposal upon his return. The couple was married on 6 January 1915, and this allowed them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Orleans two days later {{with other members of}} Middleton's unit for the one hundredth anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans in which the 7th Regiment had served a century earlier. After a week in New Orleans, the couple returned to Galveston, and were invited to move into the Hagemann's house, where they were given a large upstairs room.|$|E
25|$|Scooter's uncle J.P. Grosse {{owns the}} theatre, and rents {{it to the}} Muppets, as Scooter is {{only too happy to}} remind Kermit. In a deleted scene from It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie, Kermit reveals that J.P. has died and left the theatre to the Muppets in his will. This would have taken place some time after 1996, as J.P. can be seen (and {{referred}} to as such by the head of the KMUP network) in episode 107 of Muppets Tonight, the 1990s reworking of The Muppet Show. The Muppet Theater is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City as Rachel Bitterman plots to tear down the Muppet Theater and build a club. She is thwarted when Pepe the King Prawn manages to get the Muppet Theater to be made into a national landmark.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Eleanor {{encountered}} her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on a train to Tivoli, New York. The two began a secret correspondence and romance, and became engaged on November 22, 1903. Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, opposed the union, and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year. [...] "I know what pain I must have caused you," [...] he wrote his mother of his decision. But, he added, [...] "I know my own mind, and known {{it for a long}} time, and know that I could never think otherwise." [...] Sara took her son on a Caribbean cruise in 1904, hoping that a separation would squelch the romance, but Franklin remained determined. The wedding date was set to accommodate President Theodore Roosevelt, who was scheduled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City for the St. Patrick's Day parade, and who agreed to give the bride away.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} the casting process, Van Ark explained: [...] "It all {{happened}} so fast. They sent me a script for a [...] two-part guest shot, but I was supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York recording commercials. My husband - much like Larry Hagman's wife, Maj, talked him into playing J.R. - basically talked me into playing Val." [...] She later added, [...] "I thought the script was wonderful, and [...] was a great character. But we created her within those two episodes. I remember going to wardrobe and getting a peachy pink waitress uniform, and the shoes. And then I {{was trying to get}} that Texas sound, her all important accent. And so we created her layer by layer." [...] During the second season of Dallas, David Jacobs decided to create a spin-off for the quickly growing franchise. He wanted to create a television show based on [...] "family issues and examining relationships at the middle class level". The production company, CBS, turned down this idea, as they wanted something more [...] "glitzy" [...] to put on the air, with wealthier characters, which would become Dallas.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, it was {{reported}} that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February. Simultaneously, it was declared that the film would be shot in 3D, although Mark Ruffalo later tweeted that this was not the case. In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations, with set construction slated to begin in November, but as Whedon later explained, [...] "Originally {{we were supposed to be}} in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque." [...] Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115million for the worldwide distribution rights to Iron Man3 and The Avengers. The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company's production logo on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads [...] "Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures" [...] though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's Epix retained pay TV rights.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Beck {{caught a}} bus to New York City {{with little more than}} eight dollars and a guitar. He spent the summer {{attempting}} to find a job and a place to live with little success. Beck eventually began to frequent Manhattan's Lower East Side and stumbled upon {{the tail end of the}} East Village's anti-folk scene's first wave. Beck became involved in a loose posse of acoustic musicians—including Cindy Lee Berryhill, Kirk Kelly, Paleface, and Lach, headed by Roger Manning—whose raggedness and eccentricity placed them well outside the acoustic mainstream. [...] "The whole mission was to destroy all the clichés and make up some new ones," [...] said Beck of his New York years. [...] "Everybody knew each other. You could go up onstage and say anything, and you wouldn't feel weird or feel any pressure." [...] Inspired by that freedom and by the local spoken-word performers, Beck began to write free-associative, surrealistic songs about pizza, MTV, and working at McDonald's, turning mundane thoughts into songs. Beck was roommates with Paleface, sleeping on his couch and attending open mic nights together. Daunted by the prospect of another homeless New York winter, Beck returned to his home of Los Angeles in early 1991. [...] "I was tired of being cold, tired of getting beat up," [...] he later remarked. [...] "It was hard <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York with no money, no place I kinda used up all the friends I had. Everyone on the scene got sick of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adams {{had played}} over 100 dates with Journey during 1983, {{serving as the}} opening act on their Frontiers Tour. During that time, he and Jim Vallance co-wrote [...] "Heaven", which was {{inspired}} by Journey's hit [...] "Faithfully". It was recorded at the Power Station in New York City on June 6 and 7, 1983. Halfway through the recording session, drummer Mickey Curry – who had warned Adams about his limited availability that day – {{announced that he had}} to leave since he had committed in advance to a Hall & Oates session. Since the recording session for [...] "Heaven" [...] was running behind schedule, Adams called Journey drummer Steve Smith, who happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York City at the time and he filled Curry's drumming position.

2500|$|When {{the draft}} {{was put to}} {{referendum}} in New South Wales in 1899, Reid (Free Trade Premier from 1894 to 1899), adopted an equivocal position, earning him the nickname [...] "Yes-No Reid." [...] The draft was rejected, mainly because New South Wales voters thought it gave the proposed Senate, which would be dominated by the smaller states, too much power. Reid was able to bargain with the other Premiers to modify the draft so that it suited New South Wales interests, and the draft was then approved. On 1 January 1901, following a proclamation by Queen Victoria, New South Wales {{ceased to be a}} self-governing colony and became a state of the Commonwealth of Australia. Although the new Governor-General and Prime Minister were sworn in in Sydney, Melbourne was to be the temporary seat of government until the permanent seat of government was established. This was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> South Wales, but at least 100 miles (160km) from Sydney.

2500|$|Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love {{begins with}} Shinjiro Taiga departing from Tokyo to New York City. Shortly after {{arriving}} there, Shinjiro witnesses a bank robbery being foiled by Gemini Sunrise, a samurai cowgirl. Shinjiro is apprehended, but is vouched for by Kayama {{and led to}} the Little Lip Theater to meet Shinjiro's captain, Ratchet Altair, and the Star Division's commander, Michael Sunnyside. Taiga and Gemini meet each other in Midtown, and then head to a district known as [...] "The Village", where Shinjiro's apartment is based. Ratchet then introduces Shinjiro to Subaru Kujo, a Japanese musician. Shinjiro also encounters Cheiron Archer, a lawyer. Cheiron reveals that his uncle, Imperial Assault Force Commander Ichiro Ogami, was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York in place of Shinjiro. Just after Taiga finishes watching the musical Cleopatra, an emergency occurs. Shinjiro is assigned by Sunnyside to be an usher. While at Central Park, Shinjiro meets Diana Caprice, a local birdwatcher and doctor who helps Shinjiro acclimate himself with the city. Eventually, Shinjiro becomes a member of the Star Division. The New York Combat Revue engages demon forces near the Statue of Liberty led by Ranmaru, a recurring antagonist in the game. During the battle, Ratchet is wounded, forcing Shinjiro to assume command. After thwarting Ranmaru's invasion, Shinjiro becomes the New York Combat Revue's Captain-in-Training and Ratchet fills the role of Vice Commander.|$|E
2500|$|Birdman was {{edited by}} Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, who had both {{worked with the}} {{director}} before on 21 Grams and Babel. Stitching shots together was, of course, a crucial component of the editing, but Crise and Mirrone already had experience doing this. The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked they {{had the ability to}} introduce cuts. Mirrone said that in Birdman Iñárritu had [...] "let go of that safety net". Because of this the editors needed {{to be involved in the}} project early on, and during principal photography Crise was on set every day. (Mirrone was busy so unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> York.) Crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy Iñárritu [...] "dragged it out" [...] of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so needed to get them right. For stitching, aside from the director Crise also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies. The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used Sánchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to Crise early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, Crise described it as [...] "pretty traditional". The editors cut the film together back in Los Angeles. A few weeks after shooting they were quite far along the cut itself, and transitioned into visual-effects mode, where they fine-tuned the shots.|$|E
