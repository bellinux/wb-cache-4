5|$|Kilve has {{the remains}} of a red-brick retort built in 1924 after the shale in the cliffs was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>rich</b> in oil. Along this coast, the cliffs are layered with {{compressed}} strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown Lias embedded with fossils. The Shaline Company was founded in 1924 to exploit these strata but was unable to raise sufficient capital. The company's retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil and is all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E

The area comprising Ireland, southern England, Atlantic France and Spain may be considered a “hot-spot ” of species richness.

25|$|The {{first major}} {{interest}} in the ornithology of the area arose following the inspections leading to the border in 1826.

The most important work was carried out by Hans Tho. L. Schaanning and Johan Koren, who settled in the valley in 1900. The area was also of interest for Swedish and Russian expeditions and scientists. Schaanning remained for twelve years.|$|E

The atmosphere also contains hydrogen gas, which is cycling through the atmosphere and the surface environment, and which living things comparable to Earth methanogens could combine with some of the organic compounds (such as acetylene) to obtain energy.|$|E

The authors warn of the middle-class squeeze and the harm this will cause to the American middle class.

They argue students should be taught how to become business owners instead of learning how to go work for another company. Trump and Kiyosaki write that such students are instructed to achieve academic excellence through avoiding risk.

25|$|Why We Want You <b>to</b> <b>Be</b> <b>Rich</b> {{notes in}} the {{introduction}} it is not intended as a technical manual with specific recommendations. The book warns the reader that the American middle class strata is shrinking due to multiple factors including oncoming retirement of the baby boomers, rising costs of light crude oil, decreasing employer pay to employees, increasing national debt of the United States, and a declining power of the United States dollar. The authors caution that individuals should not rely on the federal bureaucracy for support from problems including the middle-class squeeze, economic globalization, and threats of terrorism. They assert that employment opportunities are not formed from the government but rather through entrepreneurship.|$|E

Europe {{at the same time}} was undergoing an industrial revolution and this created a huge demand for tin. The British as well as the Dutch were active in the states, each seeking to monopolise production of tin and other commodities. However, the political atmosphere in Perak was sufficiently volatile to raise the cost of tin mining operations. For instance, in 1818 Siam ordered Kedah to attack Perak. The lack of security in Perak forced the British to protect Perak in 1826.|$|E
