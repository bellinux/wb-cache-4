40|$|How can {{we prepare}} for and motivate ongoing {{improvements}} in development {{practice in the}} world of universal sustainable development goals? International Development Studies courses are a relatively new phenomenon. Earlier, people entered the field with technical backgrounds and learnt on the job. Similarly, many took the road from long-term international volunteering or Junior Expert/Junior Professional Officer posts, and moved into a career in international development [Baillie Smith, M. and N. Laurie, 2011, ‘International volunteering and development: Global citizenship and neoliberal professionalisation today’, Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers; Devereux, P., 2008, ‘International volunteering for development and sustainability: Outdated paternalism or a radical response to globalisation?’, Development in Practice, Vol. 18, No. 3, pp. 357 – 370; White, P., 2015, ‘The spectrum of motivations, experiences and attitudes in technical development cooperation’, Forum for Development Studies, Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 89 – 112]. More recently, development studies courses have emerged. Are they finding the right balance between critical approaches, history and vocational skills? A difference in motivations and expectations between early and mid-late career Finnish development workers was found from earlier research (White, 2015). With this case study we add a focus on the pre-career stage (via questionnaires and interviews), considering the motivations of Finnish development studies students in first year, postgraduate studies and after graduation. The article acknowledges the range of motivations and experience of those engaged with international development. It also considers the tension between critical theory and vocational skills. Competencies for development practice encompass a combination of theoretical knowledge, <b>technical</b> skills, administrative <b>knowhow</b> and attitudinal factors. We conclude that co-production, combining academic courses and research, including reflective and experiential practice, is a positive step forward...|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that climate change is causing sea levels to change worldwide. This sea level {{increase}} is causing loss of land and changes to water table in coastal zones. There are sophisticated models such as ARCGIS, FEEFLOW etc. to model and accurately calculate the changes occurring in these areas. In order to use these models one requires good quality data sets coupled with experienced modellers which is at times sparse and hard to source. Therefore here in this research a simplified method is proposed to estimate the changes occurring in these areas. Initially sea level changes were projected using linear regression method. Changes to land and water table in Wellington New Zealand were simulated, modelled and a simple model was developed using this data to estimate changes. The model was validated using a different data set series. This model could now be used to easily estimate the changes to ground water and land loss in other coastal zones, particularly where data is sparse and <b>technical</b> <b>knowhow</b> on modelling is limited, which is generally the case in most areas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—An {{extensive}} {{amount of}} {{research has been done}} in the important domain of Supply Chain Management (SCM) and its Integration with Information and Communication Technology (ICT). However pragmatic insight to address the SCM-ICT integration challenges based upon real world contemporary case studies are scant. This work targets Fast Moving Consumer Good (FMCG) companies located in Pakistan. This paper examines data from the FMCG sector in Pakistan and proposes a model for Key Realization Concepts for Supply Chain Success (KRC-SCS). During the course of this study it was discovered that those FMCG companies which integrated ICT with SCM in a sequentially structured approach, took shorter learning curves, had realistic Return on Investment (ROI) expectations, and where the top management demonstrated greater appreciation and commitment towards technology as a solution facilitator, proved to be more successful {{than those who did not}} have these characteristics.

30|$|As {{one of the}} {{landscape}} architects interviewed involved remarked: “if {{we really want to}} design, it [UM] needs to have spatial references, but also temporal references. We have to know when flows are there and when they are not there” (D 2). For {{the landscape}} architects the advantage of having designers involved in the process is to reflect on what closing the cycles might mean in terms of how housing, and more generally the urban landscape, might appear, when “working technically, but also esthetically and socially, and landscape architects can help bring those aspects into metabolism” (D 2). However, the complexity of the challenge emerges with the understanding that collaboration between experts and the use of improved <b>technical</b> <b>knowhow</b> is a fundamental prerequisite. Designers can help to engage the inhabitants as end-users of the city by considering “how new solutions impact on people’s daily life and how people might integrate it into their lifestyles” (D 2). Here we found that the spatial component in the form of data analysis and the preoccupation of urban landscape effects is linked in the discourse of the designers with the topic of the inhabitants’ awareness of resource management.|$|E
