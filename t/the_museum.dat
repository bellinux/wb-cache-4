5|$|Although the {{facility}} did attract visitors, local residents' support {{failed to reach}} the numbers expected by the founders.

At the time, Copia had $68 million ($ today) in debt. That year <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> also lowered its original adult admission fee of $12.50 to $5. For three months in 2006, <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> admitted guests free of charge, and attendance and revenue increased. <b>The</b> <b>museum</b> also began hosting weddings and renting its space more frequently {{in order to raise}} revenue. In 2007, <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> altered its theme significantly by removing its focus on food and art, and instead focusing solely on wine. It replaced some of its gardens with vineyards, changed its displays to focus more on the history and aspects of wine and viticulture, and decreased the restaurant's and programs' focus on food.|$|E

5|$|As of {{the late}} 2000s, The Washington Post wrote that <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> {{struggled}} with low attendance, modest budget, concealed location, and leadership turnovers. Thirty years after joining the Smithsonian, <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> {{remains one of the}} smallest museums in the complex, with 213,000 visitors in 2016about half of the 2009 count and {{less than one percent of}} the 28 million annual Smithsonian visitors. This is due, in part, to its location, which is hidden from the National Mall by the original Smithsonian Institution Building, known as the Castle. Visitor numbers have fluctuated between 200,000 and 400,000 since the 2000s, and in the mid-2000s were comparable with its underground neighbor museum, the Sackler Gallery. The museum's annual budget has fluctuated from $4.3 million (late 1990s) to $6 million (mid-2000s), and was $5 million in 2016. By comparison, <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> had a 34-person staff in 2016, down from 48 in the late 1990s. Like many other museums in the 2000s, the institute has sought private funding and endowments. It trailed behind other Smithsonian entities in fundraising campaigns, into which <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> was expected to pay about $2.1 million.

5|$|As {{the city}} water supply from Aldershawe was {{diminishing}} {{in the early}} 19th century, money was spent diverting surface waters from 'Swan Moggs' into a common conduit. The two streams across it were diverted into underground culverts; the land was raised with silt and mud dredged from Minster Pool. The area was subsequently developed into the formal gardens of Beacon Park by the Lichfield Corporation, but {{paid for by the}} Conduit Lands Trust. <b>The</b> <b>Museum</b> Gardens were opened in 1859 to complement the new Italianate Free Library and Museum. The Recreation Grounds, opened in 1891, is the small area between <b>the</b> <b>Museum</b> Gardens and the wider Beacon Park.

5|$|Following a major {{expansion}} in 2003, {{a suite of}} rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, was added to <b>the</b> <b>museum.</b> The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million.

5|$|In 1922, the National Museum was {{transferred}} from Palazzo Xara to Auberge d'Italie. <b>The</b> <b>museum</b> {{was directed by}} Sir Themistocles Zammit, and it was divided into archaeology, history, arts, natural history and mineralogical sections. <b>The</b> <b>museum</b> closed down during World War II, and the building received two direct hits on 7 April 1942.

5|$|In 1966 the Museum's Southwark {{building}} {{was extended to}} provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since <b>the</b> <b>Museum</b> {{had moved to the}} site.

One had been mounted on the Royal Navy's HMS Ramillies and the other on both HMS Resolution and HMS Roberts. Both had been fired in action during the Second World War. They went on permanent display outside <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> in May 1968. The acquisition of these guns, representative of the dreadnought era of British battleships, led <b>the</b> <b>museum</b> to seek to acquire a 6-inch triple turret that would be representative of a number of classes of British cruisers.
