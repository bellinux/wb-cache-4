5|$|Voyager 1 {{found that}} about {{seven percent of}} the volume of Saturn's upper {{atmosphere}} is helium (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is hydrogen. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds in Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500m/s (1,100mph). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.|$|E

25|$|The {{contrasting}} {{characteristics of}} the 1906 and 1989 events were examined by seismologists Hiroo Kanamori and Kenji Satake. The significant amount of vertical displacement in 1989 was a key aspect to consider because a long-term sequence of 1989-type events (with an 80–100-year recurrence interval) normally result in regions with high topographic relief, which is not seen in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three scenarios were presented <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> this disparity. The first is that the geometry of the San Andreas Fault goes through a transition every several thousand years. Secondly, slip type could vary from event to event. And lastly, the 1989 event did not occur on the San Andreas Fault.|$|E
500|$|Superconductivity {{has been}} {{detected}} in 3C-SiC:Al, 3C-SiC:B and 6H-SiC:B {{at the same}} temperature of 1.5 K. A crucial difference is however observed for the magnetic field behavior between aluminium and boron doping: SiC:Al is type-II, same as Si:B. On the contrary, SiC:B is type-I. In attempt to explain this difference, {{it was noted that}} Si sites are more important than carbon sites for superconductivity in SiC. Whereas boron substitutes carbon in SiC, Al substitutes Si sites. Therefore, Al and B [...] "see" [...] different environments <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> different properties of SiC:Al and SiC:B.|$|E
500|$|It {{is unclear}} whether Dover began the Games from scratch, or took over from an {{existing}} event, perhaps a church ale. The Games had the approval of King James, who in his book of advice to his son, Basilikon Doron (1599), had written that to promote good feeling among the common people towards their king, [...] "certain days in the year would be appointed, for delighting the people with public spectacles of all honest games, and exercise of arms". Although there {{was at that time}} in England a growing admiration for the ancient Greeks, Dover may have been motivated by military rather than cultural considerations. His biographer, Christopher Whitfield, claimed that Dover combined ancient countryside practices with [...] "classical mythology and Renaissance culture, whilst linking them with the throne and the King's Protestant Church". Dover believed that physical exercise was necessary for the defence of the kingdom. He may also have believed that the Games would bring rich and poor together, increasing social harmony, an ideal <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> why the event captured the public imagination.|$|E

500|$|Mormons and ex-Mormons have {{produced}} {{a large amount of}} scholarly work about Smith, and to a large extent the result has been two discordant pictures of very different people: a man of God on the one hand, and on the other, a fraud preying on the ignorance of his followers. Believers tend to focus on his achievements and religious teachings, deemphasizing his personal defects, while detractors focus on his mistakes, legal troubles, and controversial doctrines. During {{the first half of the}} 20th century, some writers suggested that Smith might have suffered from epileptic seizures or from psychological disorders such as paranoid delusions or manic-depressive illness <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> his visions and revelations. Many modern biographers disagree with these ideas. More nuanced interpretations include viewing Smith as: a prophet who had normal human weaknesses; a [...] "pious fraud" [...] who believed he was called of God to preach repentance and felt justified inventing visions in order to convert people; or a gifted [...] "mythmaker" [...] who was the product of his Yankee environment. Biographers, Mormon and non-Mormon alike, agree that Smith was one of the most influential, charismatic, and innovative figures in American religious history.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{the treatment of}} prisoners, Lewy shows his reasonableness by acknowledging “several cases of US maltreatment and torture.” These are treated with antiseptic brevity, and Lewy takes pains to put them into a context of the “frustration resulting from fighting an often unseen enemy, the resentments created by casualties,” etc. In dealing with Communist inhumaneness, however, he gives a plenitude of detail, with an unconcealed moral indignation totally absent from his grudging admission of US-Saigon torture, and factors <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> such acts by the enemy are treated with sarcasm. He even matter-of-factly explains Saigon torture: “The police were not highly professional, prison guards were underpaid, and South Vietnamese have a low regard for human life.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Meetings of {{this kind}} were kept under wraps by the studios {{in order to avoid}} {{litigation}} and, although there are circumstances <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> it, Paramount's reasons for calling Wray in remain a matter of speculation. [...] What is known is that work on A Mask for Lucrezia was suspended for a time, and after that Richard Maibaum took over as producer. [...] Production began in the fall of 1948, {{and by the time the}} movie was released in 1949 it had a new title -- Bride of Vengeance -- and the screenplay was based on a story by Michael Hogan with writing credits for two other writers and no mention of Wray's original screenplay.|$|E

2500|$|In conditioning, {{a neutral}} {{stimulus}} saccharin is paired in {{a drink with}} an agent that produces an unconditioned response. For example, that agent might be cyclophosphamide, which causes immunosuppression. After learning this pairing, the taste of saccharin by itself is able to cause immunosuppression, as a new conditioned response via neural top-down control. Such conditioning {{has been found to}} affect a diverse variety of not just basic physiological processes in the immune system but ones such as serum iron levels, oxidative DNA damage levels, and insulin secretion. Recent reviews have argued that the placebo effect is due to top-down control by the brain for immunity and pain. Pacheco-López and colleagues have raised the possibility of [...] "neocortical-sympathetic-immune axis providing neuroanatomical substrates <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> the link between placebo/conditioned and placebo/expectation responses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditional Pentecostal worship {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "gestalt made up of prayer, singing, sermon, the operation of the gifts of the Spirit, altar intercession, offering, announcements, testimonies, musical specials, Scripture reading, and occasionally the Lord's supper". Russell P. Spittler identified five values that govern Pentecostal spirituality. The first was individual experience, which emphasizes the Holy Spirit's personal work in the life of the believer. Second was orality, a feature <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> Pentecostalism's success in evangelizing nonliterate cultures. The third was spontaneity; members of Pentecostal congregations are expected to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, sometimes resulting in unpredictable services. The fourth value governing Pentecostal spirituality was [...] "otherworldliness" [...] or asceticism, which was partly informed by Pentecostal eschatology. The final and fifth value was a commitment to biblical authority, and many of the distinctive practices of Pentecostals are derived from a literal reading of scripture.|$|E
2500|$|By the 8th century, {{cannabis}} {{had been}} introduced by Arab traders to Central and Southern Africa, where it is known as [...] "dagga" [...] and many Rastas {{say it is a}} part of their African culture that they are reclaiming. It is sometimes also referred to as [...] "the healing of the nation", a phrase adapted from Revelation 22:2. There are various methods of transmission <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> how cannabis smoking came to be part of Rastafari. One possible source was the African diasporic religion of Kumina, based on the practices of Bakongo enslaved people and indentured labourers who were brought to Jamaica in the mid-nineteenth century. In Kumina, cannabis was smoked during religious ceremonies in the belief that it facilitated possession by ancestral spirits. The religion was largely practiced in south-east Jamaica's Saint Thomas Parish, where a prominent early Rasta, Leonard Howell, lived during the period he was developing many of Rastafari's beliefs and practices.|$|E

2500|$|Cleckley argues under a {{subsection}} titled [...] "Not {{as single}} spies but in battalions" [...] (a phrase appearing in Hamlet), that although reliable statistics {{are hard to}} come by, there are various reasons to suspect both psychiatric and prison admission rates are an underestimate, and the incidence of the condition is in his opinion [...] "exceedingly high". He does present some statistics from a survey whereby he and nine other psychiatrists diagnosed 1/8th of patients as having psychopathic personality without any other mental disorder <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> the condition, and considers that quite a few others classified as alcoholic or drug addicted would actually have qualified too. Their survey is further detailed in the book's appendix, where Cleckley clarifies it took place between 1937 and 1939 at a federal Veterans Administration hospital, located on the Southeastern seaboard, for the care of ex-service men, mainly from World War I. He critiques the 'benign policy' of the VA of not diagnosing more psychopathic personality due to giving {{the benefit of the doubt}} to issues such as neurasthenia, hysteria, psychasthenia, posttraumatic neuroses, or cerebral trauma from skull injuries and concussions. He concludes they have [...] "records of the utmost folly and misery and idleness over many years" [...] and if considering the number in every community who are protected by relatives, [...] "the prevalence of this disorder is seen to be appalling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{those who}} earned their {{living in the}} streets of London, the more criticized were the hackney coach drivers. Moreton defines them [...] "the scum of the people, and, {{generally}} speaking, the worst of rogues", robbing their customers on a regular basis, and often in league with highway robbers. Hackney coach travellers were generally at the mercy of their carriers, and even the simplest travel could easily turn into a real danger. Even the most [...] "honest" [...] among them were used to rework the city routes and rates as they pleased in order to increase their profits. Hackney coach drivers were so severely criticized for being rude and abusive, that in 1682 the Common Council had to pass an act for their regulation aiming: to limit their number, to establish a valid licence and a fair charge, and to set out places where they could wait for hire. Moreton brings the attention of the reader on a technicality <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>explain</b> why these drivers most of the time managed to walk unpunished. As a matter of fact, the renter of the coach rarely appears to be the actual driver (although they might be in league), therefore [...] "the penalty, which used to be on the renter, being now on the driver, the renter or owner of that figure is clear, and the driver has nothing to do but to be absent and laugh at the complainant". For this reason, the law needs to be amended so that both the driver and the renter (for Moreton equally guilty) might be accountable for extortion, insolence, or offences. In addition, the renter should be obliged to register and respond for the behaviour of the driver he rented his coach to.|$|E
