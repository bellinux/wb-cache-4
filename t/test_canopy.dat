40|$|Tree {{canopy cover}} is a {{fundamental}} component of the landscape, {{and the amount of}} cover influences fire behavior, air pollution mitigation, and carbon storage. As such, efforts to empirically model percent tree canopy cover across the United States are a critical area of research. The 2001 national-scale canopy cover modeling and mapping effort was completed in 2006, and here we present results from a pilot study for a 2011 product. We examined the influence of two different modeling techniques (random forests and beta regression), two different Landsat imagery normalization processes, and eight different sampling intensities across five different pilot areas. We found that random forest out-performed beta regression techniques and that there was little difference between models developed based on the two different normalization techniques. Based on these results we present a prototype study design which will <b>test</b> <b>canopy</b> cover modeling approaches across a broader spatial scale...|$|E
40|$|The Low Density Supersonic Decelerator project {{performed}} a wind tunnel experiment on the structural design and geometric porosity of various sub-scale parachutes {{in order to}} inform {{the design of the}} 110 ft nominal diameter flight <b>test</b> <b>canopy.</b> Thirteen different parachute configurations, including disk-gap-band, ring sail, disk sail, and star sail canopies, were tested at the National Full-scale Aerodynamics Complex 80 - by 120 -foot Wind Tunnel at NASA Ames Research Center. Canopy drag load, dynamic pressure, and canopy position data were recorded in order to quantify there lative drag performance and stability of the various canopies. Desirable designs would yield increased drag above the disk-gap-band with similar, or improved, stability characteristics. Ring sail parachutes were tested at geometric porosities ranging from 10 % to 22 % with most of the porosity taken from the shoulder region near the canopy skirt. The disk sail canopy replaced the rings lot portion of the ring sail canopy with a flat circular disk and wastested at geometric porosities ranging from 9 % to 19 %. The star sail canopy replaced several ringsail gores with solid gores and was tested at 13 % geometric porosity. Two disk sail configurations exhibited desirable properties such as an increase of 6 - 14 % in the tangential force coefficient above the DGB with essentially equivalent stability. However, these data are presented with caveats including the inherent differences between wind tunnel and flight behavior and qualitative uncertainty in the aerodynamic coefficients...|$|E
40|$|Incremental {{gains in}} grain yield of maize hybrids {{over the decades}} are the {{consequence}} of genotype, environment and management interactions. Historically, genetic improvements in newer hybrids have included longer active grain filling periods (achieved by advancing silking and extending functional stay green in maize leaves); stronger source and sink during grain filling; enhanced tolerance to higher density; and canopy architecture changes. Newer hybrids were known to accumulate more dry matter and nitrogen in the post-silking period, but achieving a more comprehensive knowledge of pre-silking and post-silking dynamics required further understanding of dry matter and nitrogen partitioning in individual organs, {{as well as their}} associations with canopy traits. Genetic improvement studies would ideally involve side-by-side direct comparisons of hybrids from different eras with synchronized management strategies under a variety of environment conditions. The primary objectives of this field study were to: 1) quantify dry matter and nitrogen partitioning in organs (stem versus leaf) at silking and its impact on post-silking dry matter and nitrogen accumulation for different hybrid eras under a variety of management conditions; 2) evaluate historic improvement in source strength, including post-silking dry matter accumulation, and sink strength, including kernel number, kernel weight, and ear growth rates; 3) quantify historic changes in dry matter and nitrogen dynamics during pre-silking and post-silking periods, as well as nitrogen internal efficiency; and 4) quantify the correlations between canopy attributes with grain yield and its components. ^ This study began in 2012 with a detailed consideration of 3 genotypes (two 2005 hybrids versus one 1975 hybrid); this study was then expanded to 8 genotypes in 2013 and 2014 (using a series of DeKalb hybrids from 1967 to 2005). Hybrids selected for this study represented some of the most widely grown US Corn Belt commercial germplasm from Monsanto between the mid 1960 s and the mid to late 2000 s. The six location-years of field research included three growing seasons (2012, 2013, and 2014) at two locations in Indiana. ^ Leaf and stem dry matter and N dynamics were explored intensively in 2012 and 2013. Across treatments and environments, the net leaf source (i. e. between R 1 and R 6 stages) contributed 33 % of the grain N content and 0 % of the grain dry matter at maturity, while the net stem source contributed 22 % of grain N content and 20 % of grain dry matter at maturity. Both 2005 hybrids partitioned more dry matter to leaf than stem at silking, and maintained higher leaf dry mater and leaf N content at maturity, when compared with 1967 and 1975 hybrids, indicating more retention of leaf function during grain fill in newer hybrids. ^ Both 2005 hybrids where more intensively contrasted with 1975 and 1967 hybrids in 2012 and 2013 to <b>test</b> <b>canopy</b> traits changes that were correlated with grain yield and its components. The two newer hybrids had higher leaf biomass and leaf N content at silking, which leads to higher leaf N content per unit leaf area at the onset of grain filling, and eventually resulted in a higher green leaf number during grain filling and kernel weight at maturity. Increasing N rate decreased the correlations between grain yield with secondary traits, including green leaf number during grain filling in both years, but with leaf biomass, leaf N content and leaf area index at silking only in the more favorable year (2013). In contrast, increased density enhanced correlations between grain yield and specific secondary traits, including leaf area index at the onset of and during grain filling, as well as with leaf biomass and leaf N content at silking, in both years. ^ These findings from this study: 1) documented the primary role of leaves as a remobilized N source and the role of stems as both N and dry matter sources for kernels during the grain filling period; 2) confirmed breeding gains over time in retaining functional activities during the grain filling period in newer hybrids, and extended this finding to widely contrasting N rate and plant density conditions; 3) documented greater post-silking dry matter and nitrogen gains in more recent hybrids that suggested a newer opportunity for later-season N fertilizer applications; 4) highlighted the sometimes dominant pathway for achieving yield gain in newer hybrids by enhancing kernel weight instead of kernel number through a more robust source-driven grain filling period; and 5) found, via the non-significance of most hybrid by N rate or hybrid by plant density interactions, that the genetic gains in this series of DeKalb hybrids were predominantly independent of the management treatments under which all hybrids were compared.

40|$|Variability in fruit set and yield is {{a serious}} problem in Oregon viticulture, {{particularly}} with Pinot noir. Climatic variation during the flowering period contributes significantly to this problem by affecting fruit set and cluster weight. Cool wet weather during bloom results in poor set, small clusters, and low yields. Seasons with warm dry weather often have good set but yields are often above desirable levels with the potential to interfere with wine quality. Commercial vineyards in Oregon deal with excessively high yields by removing excess crop with hand cluster thinning.

The objective of our work was to develop and <b>test</b> a <b>canopy</b> reflectance-based Nsidedress system for potato in humid climates. In four years of experiments with ware potato on a sandy soil it was determined that the reflectance index WDVI correlates well with N uptake, that sidedressN should be applied at around the time of canopy closing, and that the sidedressNrate should be calculated as the difference between a (fixed) desired N uptake and a reflectance-based measurement of N uptake. The calculated N saving in these experiments was between 10 and 109 (average 56) kg N ha- 1. The reflectance-based Nsidedress system was tested at an additional two locations, with ware potatoes on a loamy soil and with starch potatoes on a sandy soil, in two further years of experiments.

An invertible plant canopy reflectance model is tested {{for its ability to}} estimate the amount of woody vegetation cover in areas of sparsely wooded grassland from remotely sensed data. Dry woodlands and wooded grasslands, commonly referred to as savannas, are important ecologically and economically in Africa, and cover approximately forty percent of the continent by some estimates. The Sahelian and Sudanian savanna make up the important and sensitive transition zone between the tropical forests and the arid Saharan region. The depletion of woody cover, used for fodder and fuel in these regions, has become a very severe problem for the people living there. LANDSAT Thematic Mapper (TM) data is used to stratify woodland and wooded grassland into areas of relatively homogeneous canopy cover, and then by applying an invertible forest canopy reflectance model to estimate directly the height and spacing of the trees in the stands. Since height and spacing are proportional to biomass in some cases, a successful application of the segmentation/modeling techniques will allow direct estimation of woody biomass, as well as cover density, over significant areas of these valuable and sensitive ecosystems.

40|$|The {{effect of}} water stress on canopy {{development}} of sugarcane cultivars N 22 and NCo 376 was evaluated in a rain shelter facility at the South African Sugarcane Research Institute at Mount Edgecombe. The crop was grown under unstressed conditions for four months. Subsequently, water was withheld from {{one half of}} the trial for a period of 42 days. Soil water content in the stressed plots decreased from field capacity of 26 % at the start of drying to 15 % on day 15, and to a permanent wilting point of 10 % at approximately day 40. Shoot survival in N 22 was more sensitive to water stress than in NCo 376. Water stress caused a simultaneous reduction in leaf appearance rate and an increase in leaf senescence rate, and consequently markedly reduced green leaf number in both cultivars. Leaf senescence appears very sensitive to water stress, with increases apparent at high relative soil water content (RSWC). Interception of radiation was not as sensitive to water stress as leaf area, and in both cultivars decreased only after RSWC dropped below 0. 5. NCo 376 was able to maintain canopy development processes longer under conditions of increasing water stress, and thus maintained a higher green leaf area index for longer than N 22. This was achieved by extracting more water from the profile than N 22, thereby maintaining a high turgor for longer, and supporting growth processes for longer.

In reality, for-est canopies are far from homogeneous, and this has led to the use of detailed light extinction models that account for group-ing of foliage between and within trees. Because such models require detailed parameterization and fine resolution inputs, they are impractical in larger-scale applications. Thus, there is interest in simplified models that can be readily parameterized. We developed two equations {{that can be used to}} estimate mean annual light interception by single unshaded trees and by stands of Poisson distributed trees. Interception by single trees is a function of crown surface area, the ratio of leaf area to crown surface area, the extinction coefficient in a homoge-neous canopy—which can be determined separately—and one empirical parameter that depends on the mean solar angle. The summary model was tested against a detailed model of inter-ception, and showed good agreement, although with slight bi-as. The results showed that crown surface area is a good sum-mary variable for crown size and shape, because errors are independent of crown shape (ellipsoids, cones and height: width ratios). We also <b>tested</b> whether <b>canopy</b> photosynthesis is proportional to light interception across canopies differing in structure and leaf area index, and found that light-use effi-ciency is influenced by canopy structure. The model is useful in larger-scale applications because it can be parameterized with available data without the need for additional empirical param-eters. It can also be used to study the effect of stand structure on mean annual light interception and productivity...|$|R
40|$|This U. S. Bureau of Mines report {{presents}} the results of structural analyses and full-scale physical tests conducted on a steel-set arch and tri-set. The purpose of the analyses and tests was to evaluate the suitability of these structures for use in roof-fall prone areas. The arch <b>canopy</b> <b>test</b> and design procedures previously developed by the Bureau were utilized in this evaluation. Theoretical resistance functions were established for the steel-set arch and tri-set and were representative of the experimental behavior of the structures. The resistance functions were used to determine the energy absorption capacity of the structures and to predict their dynamic response to impact loading. The dynamic tests demonstrated that the arch canopy design procedure is appropriate for tri-sets and yields conservative designs for both steel-set arches and tri-sets. As a result of this work, it is recommended that these two structures may be considered for use in roof-fall prone areas and for rehabilitation work, provided the arch canopy design procedure is utilized for each application and the principles underlying the design procedure are understood...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{modelling}} of mechanisms {{underlying processes}} {{in the real world}} can be of great value in understanding complex biological behaviours. Uptake in general biology and ecology has been rapid. However, it often requires specific data sets that are overly costly in time and resources to collect. The aim of the current study was to test whether a generic behavioural ecology model constructed using published data could give realistic outputs for individual species. An individual-based model was developed using the Pattern-Oriented Modelling (POM) strategy and protocol, based on behavioural rules associated with insect movement choices. Frugivorous Tephritidae (fruit flies) were chosen because of economic significance in global agriculture and the multiple published data sets available for a range of species. The Queensland fruit fly (Qfly), Bactrocera tryoni, was identified as a suitable individual species for <b>testing.</b> Plant <b>canopies</b> with modified architecture were used to run predictive simulations. A field study was then conducted to validate our model predictions on how plant architecture affects fruit flies' behaviours. Characteristics of plant architecture such as different shapes, e. g., closed-canopy and vase-shaped, affected fly movement patterns and time spent on host fruit. The number of visits to host fruit also differed between the edge and centre in closed-canopy plants. Compared to plant architecture, host fruit has less contribution to effects on flies' movement patterns. The results from this model, combined with our field study and published empirical data suggest that placing fly traps in the upper canopy at the edge should work best. Such a modelling approach allows rapid testing of ideas about organismal interactions with environmental substrates in silico rather than in vivo, to generate new perspectives. Using published data provides a saving in time and resources. Adjustments for specific questions can be achieved by refinement of parameters based on targeted experiments...|$|R
