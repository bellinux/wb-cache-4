The borders of ecological regions are transitional or mosaic. For rationalisation of the delimitation of the regions of provenance in the field and easier control of usage, the borders of the regions of provenance are, as much as possible, adapted to the management and administrative borders, which are marked in the field.

In this Article, the author responds {{to the emergence of}} baby markets with great skepticism, but reluctant acceptance.

In addition, although there are risks of markets, the risk-benefit calculus calls for allowing markets to exist, provided there is careful and serious regulation of such markets.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the cases for and against commercializing, or 2 ̆ 2 commodifying, 2 ̆ 2 <b>reproductive</b> <b>materials</b> and services. Using a supply/demand third-party framework, three basic scenarios in which commercial-exchange relationships may be possible-exchange of gametes and zygotes, exchange of gestational services, and exchange of fetal material-and the major parties of interest, or stakeholders, are identified. The study sketches the liberal, essentialist, and radical contingency theories that shape {{the debate over the}} commercialization of <b>reproductive</b> <b>materials</b> and services. The article then attempts to derive some basic governing principles that reflect as much common ground as possible amongst these various normative perspectives, while recognizing that complete reconciliation is impossible. Taken together, these principles are designed to reflect a strategy of 2 ̆ 2 constrained commodification, 2 ̆ 2 where commercialization or commodification, that is, financial remuneration, plays a relatively neutral role in the utilization of <b>reproductive</b> <b>materials</b> and services.

The existing legal regulation on forest <b>reproductive</b> <b>material</b> moving in trade can only provide an absolute proof of identity, at an unproportionally intense level of controlling. Techniques based on the analysis of DNA markers are a powerful tool for the genetic traceability of forest <b>reproductive</b> <b>material,</b> but on a European level, the traceability systems are yet missing, excepting the two certification systems implemented in Germany (ZüF and FfV). The reference samples collected from individuals in different steps of the forest <b>reproductive</b> <b>material</b> production, and the comparison of their genetic composition, are the principle underlying the German certification systems. The seeds from seed orchards can be identified with highly polymorphic SSR markers, once the the genetic profile of the reference clone is known, without reference samples.

Different statistical approaches can still be used to assign individual or groups of individuals to a population, but this requires further evaluation for their use in traceability.

By applying the linear regressions method it was established that the total variability of both thousand seed weight and the amount of essential oil per seed were due to its association with harvest index.

40|$|AbstractThe {{debate on}} both the {{appropriateness}} of allowing healthy women to provide oocytes for research use {{and the use of}} financial incentives is increasingly reduced to a confrontation between ethics, science, and the welfare of women. It is plausible that the expansion of national and international research efforts, paired with the growing trend toward liberalizing stem cell research policies, will inevitably result in increased demand for the materials needed to conduct such research. The scarcity of human <b>reproductive</b> <b>materials</b> that are available for research generates concerns over, the emergence of a “black market”, an increase in financial incentives for donors, and the appropriateness of current regulatory frameworks that aim to safeguard donors. In this article we explore the conceptual models for categorizing oocyte donors and analyze the use of financial incentives as well as the compensation models proposed and implemented in various jurisdictions. Finally, we propose the adoption of a mixed model that both respects altruism and provides a feasible solution to an issue that could be situated only {{in the context of the}} overall acceptability of providing financial rewards to donors of human <b>reproductive</b> <b>materials</b> for assisted <b>reproductive</b> technologies...|$|R

The Act seems calibrated to prohibit the creation of animal-human combinations that are currently unsafe and scientifically and ethically problematic, while leaving open the possibility of regulating other such combinations with more immediate scientific potential, although these also raise ethical questions. Currently, certain differences subsist in Canada between what is permissible for researchers and institutions funded by federal agencies and those in privately funded research.
