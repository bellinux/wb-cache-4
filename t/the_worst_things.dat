500|$|Zhou Lian, an {{associate}} professor of philosophy at Renmin University of China, and Ai Weiwei, an artist in Beijing, have publicly criticized Bo and his Chongqing Model for being wrong and lowering trust. Li Zhuang, a lawyer who was imprisoned as part of the [...] "Striking Black" [...] policy, said that [...] "the Chongqing model is problematic because the city's leaders do not follow the rule of law". According to Andrew J. Nathan, a political scientist at Columbia University, [...] "the risk for China is that this scandal could taint everyone in power and challenge the legitimacy of the regime". Furthermore, he said, “All <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> you ever imagined are actually true” and “It’s not like nobody knew about this stuff, but now they know that it really is true and it’s as bad as it can possibly be.” ...|$|E
500|$|On April 5, 2011, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted that The Path to Prosperity was [...] "a path {{to poverty}} for America's seniors and children". On April 13, 2011, {{speaking}} of Ryan's budget proposal, Obama said: [...] "I don't think there's anything courageous about asking for sacrifice {{from those who}} can least afford it. There's nothing serious about a plan that claims {{to reduce the deficit}} by spending a trillion dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires." [...] The House passed the Ryan plan on April 15, 2011, by a vote of 235–193. Four Republicans joined all House Democrats in voting against it. On an April 27, 2011, conference call with reporters Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said that passage of the Ryan plan [...] "would be one of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> to happen to this country". On May 25, 2011, the Ryan budget plan was defeated in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|MacArthur {{remains a}} {{controversial}} and enigmatic figure. He has been {{portrayed as a}} reactionary, although he was in many respects ahead of his time. He championed a progressive approach to the reconstruction of Japanese society, arguing that all occupations ultimately ended badly for the occupier and the occupied. He was often {{out of step with}} his contemporaries, such as in 1941 when he contended that Nazi Germany could not defeat the Soviet Union, when he argued that North Korea and China were no mere Soviet puppets, and throughout his career in his insistence that the future lay in the Far East. This implicitly rejected White American contemporary notions of their own racial superiority. He always treated Filipino and Japanese leaders with respect as equals. At the same time, his Victorian sensibilities recoiled at leveling Manila with aerial bombing, an attitude the hardened World War II generation regarded as old fashioned. When asked about MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey once said that [...] "The best and <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> you hear about him are both true." ...|$|E

500|$|Commentators mainly praised Hutton's {{concentration}} and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly {{when compared to}} Bradman's innings of 334, was excused {{on the grounds that}} the Oval match was played without a time limit, and run accumulation was more important than fast scoring. Furthermore, Hammond had instructed Hutton to bat as long as possible. Among views expressed by Test cricketers, Les Ames believed that while Hutton had shown great skill, a combination of a very easy wicket for batting and an unusually weak bowling attack presented an ideal opportunity. Former England captain Bob Wyatt described the innings as one of the greatest feats of {{concentration and}} endurance in the history of the game. Some critics expressed distaste at England's approach, but this opinion was not widely shared. In the aftermath of the innings, Hutton became famous, [...] in constant demand from the public and press who compared him to Bradman. Hutton later described the acclamation he received as one of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> that happened to him, not least because expectations were unreasonably high every time he subsequently batted. When the season ended, Hutton had scored 1,874 runs in all matches at an average of 60.45.|$|E
2500|$|Altogether 20,057 Jews {{from the}} Reich were {{deported}} to Riga. By February 10, 1942, only 15,000 remained alive.

2500|$|Commentating for Channel 9 at the time, former Australian captain Richie Benaud {{described}} the act as [...] "disgraceful" [...] {{and said it}} was [...] "one of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> I have ever seen done on a cricket field." [...] According to Benaud, Greg Chappell [...] "got his sums wrong" [...] and instead of using Dennis Lillee for the last over, he was forced to use his brother Trevor, a considerably less talented bowler. (In limited-overs cricket, a bowler can only bowl 10 out of 50 overs in an innings, and in this match, Lillee had already bowled his maximum number of allotted overs.) ...|$|E

2500|$|While an {{undergraduate}} in {{college at the}} age of 22, the unmarried Ireland became pregnant with a daughter. After discussing the situation with her parents, she went to a special home for single mothers in Colorado where she gave birth. Ireland put the baby up for adoption, in what she called [...] "...one of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> that ever happened in my life" [...] and [...] "the hardest decision I've ever had to make in my life." [...] She later joined an adoption registry and re-united with her then adult daughter in 1997. Ireland chose to speak out about the adoption as a Justice, saying [...] "I wanted to help reduce some of the shame around issues of adoption and let young people know that you can be a birth parent and still go on and have a successful career and a successful life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pentangle {{are often}} characterised as a folk-rock band. Danny Thompson {{preferred}} {{to describe the}} group as a [...] "folk-jazz band." [...] John Renbourn also rejected the [...] "folk-rock" [...] categorisation, saying, [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> you can do to a folk song is inflict a rock beat on it[...] [...] Most of the old songs that I have heard have their own internal rhythm. When we worked on those in the group, Terry Cox worked out his percussion patterns to match the patterns in the songs exactly. In that respect he was the opposite of a folk-rock drummer." [...] This approach to songs led to the use of unusual time signatures: [...] "Market Song" [...] from Sweet Child moves from 7/4 to 11/4 and 4/4 time, and [...] "Light Flight" [...] from Basket of Light includes sections in 5/8, 7/8 and 6/4.|$|E
2500|$|Reaction to Dancer in the Dark was polarized. For example, on The Movie Show, Margaret Pomeranz gave it five stars while David Stratton {{gave it a}} zero, a score shared only by Geoffrey Wright's Romper Stomper (1992). Stratton later {{described}} it as his [...] "favourite horror film". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian said it was [...] "{{one of the worst}} films, one of the worst artworks and perhaps one of <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> {{in the history of the}} world." [...] The response is reflected in the film's official website, which posts both positive and negative reviews on its main page. The diverse reviews result in an overall 68% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Dancer in Dark can be grim, dull, and difficult to watch, but even so, it has a powerful and moving performance from Björk and is something quite new and visionary." ...|$|E

2500|$|Almodóvar {{revealed}} the film's original title, Silencio, {{in an interview}} with the Financial Times after attending a preview of the musical of his film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown at the Playhouse Theatre, London, in January 2015. Silence is [...] "the principal element that drives <b>the</b> <b>worst</b> <b>things</b> that happen to the main female protagonist", Almodóvar said. He also stated that the film was a return to drama and his [...] "cinema of women", [...] but claimed that the tone was different to that of his other feminine dramas like The Flower of My Secret (1995), All About My Mother (1999) and Volver (2006). He explained that he had finished the script, but was in the process of casting. In March 2015, Rossy de Palma, who frequently appears in Almodóvar's films, confirmed she had a role in the film, followed by the announcement that Emma Suárez and Adriana Ugarte were playing the older and younger versions of the film's protagonist. On the employment of two actresses, Almodóvar later said, [...] "I don't trust the effects of make-up for aging, and it's almost impossible for a young woman of 25 to have the presence of someone of 50. It isn't a matter of wrinkles, it's something more profound, the passing of time, on the outside and on the inside". Suárez also revealed that using two actresses was an homage to That Obscure Object of Desire (1977) by Luis Buñuel, in which two actresses also play the same character at different stages in life. El Deseo revealed more casting in March 2015.|$|E
