5|$|The South Lhasa terrane {{experienced}} metamorphism and magmatism in the Early Cenozoic (55–45 Ma) and metamorphism in the Late Eocene (40–30 Ma), presumably due to {{the collision}} between <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> of India and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientist}} to extrapolate the current motions of <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> was Canadian geologist Paul F. Hoffman of Harvard University. In 1992, Hoffman predicted that <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> of North and South America {{would continue to}} advance across the Pacific Ocean, pivoting about Siberia until they begin to merge with Asia. He dubbed the resulting supercontinent, Amasia. Later, in the 1990s, Roy Livermore calculated a similar scenario. He predicted that Antarctica would start to migrate northward, and east Africa and Madagascar would move across the Indian Ocean to collide with Asia.|$|E
50|$|The Intermontane Islands {{were too}} big to sink beneath <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> <b>The</b> {{subduction}} zone of the Intermontane Plate shut down, ending the volcanic arc. As the Intermontane Belt accreted {{to the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> <b>the</b> subduction zone of the Insular Plate became the active subduction zone along the edge of <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b>|$|R

5|$|Continents formed, {{then broke}} up and {{reformed}} as {{the surface of}} Earth reshaped over {{hundreds of millions of}} years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent. Roughly 750million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. <b>The</b> <b>continents</b> later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Lithic peaks: a {{far smaller}} {{proportion}} of lithics (3,000 vs. 6,000 grains per gram) is observed in H3 and H6, {{which means that}} the role of <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> in providing sediments to the oceans was relatively lower.|$|E

50|$|While Antarctica {{does have}} some small areas of tundra on the {{northern}} fringes, {{the vast majority of}} <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> is extremely cold and permanently frozen.

50|$|Colonization of Antarctica {{refers to}} having humans {{including}} families living permanently on <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> of Antarctica. Currently, <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> only hosts a temporary transient population {{of scientists and}} support staff.

5|$|As this {{scenario}} continues, by 100 million {{years from the}} present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the South Pole, building up a new ice cap.|$|E
5|$|At present, <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> of North and South America {{are moving}} westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E
5|$|Bears are carnivoran mammals of {{the family}} Ursidae. They are {{classified}} as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing {{in a wide variety}} of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.|$|E

5|$|Earth has {{undergone}} periodic climate {{shifts in the}} past, including four major ice ages. These consisting of glacial periods where conditions are colder than normal, separated by interglacial periods. The accumulation of snow and ice during a glacial period increases the surface albedo, reflecting more of the Sun's energy into space and maintaining a lower atmospheric temperature. Increases in greenhouse gases, such as by volcanic activity, can increase the global temperature and produce an interglacial period. Suggested causes of ice age periods include the positions of <b>the</b> <b>continents,</b> variations in the Earth's orbit, changes in the solar output, and volcanism.|$|E
5|$|Polacanthids {{are known}} from pre-Aptian fauna from both Europe and North America. The {{timing of the}} {{appearance}} of nodosaurids on both continents indicates {{the origins of the}} clade preceded the isolation of North America and Europe, thereby pushing the group's date of evolution back to at least the middle Aptian. The separation of Nodosauridae into European Struthiosaurinae and North American Nodosaurinae {{by the end of the}} Aptian provides a revised date for the isolation of <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> from each other with rising sealevel.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants and}} animals are generalists, and their habitat {{requirements}} are met {{in a wide range}} of locations. The small white butterfly (Pieris rapae) for example is found on all <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> of the world apart from Antarctica. Its larvae feed on a wide range of Brassicas and various other plant species, and it thrives in any open location with diverse plant associations. The large blue butterfly is much more specific in its requirements; it is found only in chalk grassland areas, its larvae feed on Thymus species and because of complex lifecycle requirements it inhabits only areas in which Myrmica ants live.|$|E
5000|$|The African Plate {{is a major}} {{tectonic plate}} {{straddling}} the equator {{as well as the}} prime meridian. It includes much of <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> of Africa, as well as oceanic crust which lies between <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> and various surrounding ocean ridges. Between [...] and , the Somali Plate began rifting from the African Plate along the East African Rift. Since <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> of Africa consists of crust from both the African and the Somali plates, some literature refers to the African Plate as the Nubian Plate to distinguish it from <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> as a whole.|$|R

5|$|The major oceanic {{divisions}} are defined {{in part by}} <b>the</b> <b>continents,</b> various archipelagos, and other criteria: these {{divisions are}} (in descending order of size) the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean. Smaller regions of the oceans are called seas, gulfs, bays and other names. There are also salt lakes, which are smaller bodies of landlocked saltwater that are not interconnected with the World Ocean. Two notable examples of salt lakes are the Aral Sea and the Great Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are pigs and birds, {{although it has}} probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> throughout the ages. The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} plate {{tectonics}} demonstrates that <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> of the Earth are {{moving across the}} surface {{at the rate of}} a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction {{for at least the next}} 1.1 billion years.|$|E
50|$|Islands of the Moon (달의 섬): Currently is {{independent}} of the nations of <b>the</b> <b>continent.</b> <b>The</b> only way to reach the island is by stopping at Ebb Island (썰물섬), between <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> and <b>the</b> Islands of the Moon. The people worship the Goddess of the Moon and want to reconstruct 'the ancient kingdom'. Many things resemble Ganapoly. The names of people are said to predict their life. People on <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> don't know <b>the</b> island exists.|$|R
500|$|East Antarctica is {{colder than}} its western {{counterpart}} {{because of its}} higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> leaving <b>the</b> centre cold and dry.

Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> where snowfalls of up to [...] in 48 hours have been recorded.|$|R
50|$|Firefighting in Antarctica {{encompasses}} various {{organizations and}} procedures designed to fight fires on <b>the</b> <b>continent</b> of Antarctica. Firefighting in Antarctica {{is complicated by}} the harsh conditions of <b>the</b> <b>continent,</b> <b>the</b> remoteness of the locations to be serviced, and the importance of protecting life-supporting shelter from immolation.|$|R
5|$|Tyrannosauroidea (meaning 'tyrant lizard forms') is a {{superfamily}} (or clade) of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs {{that includes}} the family Tyrannosauridae {{as well as more}} basal relatives. Tyrannosauroids lived on the Laurasian supercontinent beginning in the Jurassic Period. By the end of the Cretaceous Period, tyrannosauroids were the dominant large predators in the Northern Hemisphere, culminating in the gigantic Tyrannosaurus itself. Fossils of tyrannosauroids have been recovered on what are now <b>the</b> <b>continents</b> of North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has {{the highest}} average {{elevation}} of all <b>the</b> <b>continents.</b> Antarctica is a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200mm (8in) along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached −89.2°C (−128.6°F) (or even −94.7 as measured from space), though the average {{for the third quarter}} (the coldest part of the year) is −63°C (−81°F). Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Vegetation, where it occurs, is tundra.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for the {{existence}} of sharks dates from the Ordovician period, 450–420 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before many plants had colonized <b>the</b> <b>continents.</b> Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the Silurian period. The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. The majority of modern sharks {{can be traced back to}} around 100 million years ago. Most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. The teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. When a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.|$|E
