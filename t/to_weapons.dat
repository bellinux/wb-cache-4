5|$|After the 1990 electoral {{defeat of}} the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia ethnic tensions between Croats and Croatian Serbs worsened, and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija, or JNA) confiscated Croatia's Territorial Defence (Teritorijalna obrana, or <b>TO)</b> <b>weapons</b> to minimize resistance. On 17 August an open revolt broke out among the Croatian Serbs, centred on the predominantly Serb-populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland near Knin and parts of Lika, Kordun, Banovina and Slavonia.|$|E

British intervention in Iraq promoted public protest. Crowds numbering 400,000 and more demonstrated in October 2002, and again the following spring. On 15th February 2003, over 1,000,000 people demonstrated {{against the war in}} Iraq, and 60,000 marched in Manchester before the Labour Party Conference, with the demonstrators' issues including British occupation of Afghanistan and the forthcoming invasion of Iraq.|$|E

5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access <b>to</b> <b>weapons</b> such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
5|$|Forensic firearm {{examination}} is {{the forensic}} process of examining {{the characteristics of}} firearms {{as well as any}} cartridges or bullets left behind at a crime scene. Specialists in this field are tasked with linking bullets and cartridges <b>to</b> <b>weapons</b> and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E

50|$|Rao is {{responsible}} {{for the creation of a}} new military close quarter battle art called Advanced Commando Combat System (ACCS) which incorporates hand to hand), hand <b>to</b> <b>weapon),</b> <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> hand and <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> <b>weapon</b> tactics, small team tactics & CQB simulation exercises. ACCS is renowned for this innovative technique of close quarter shooting. It advocates a different aiming method from conventional WWII Snap Shooting. This technique was incorporated into the training curriculum of the Corps battle schools of the Northern and Eastern Commands of the Indian Army in 2006-2008. The Rao System of Reflex Fire, an innovative method of shooting at close quarters was also pioneered by Deepak Rao.|$|R

5|$|Ryse: Son of Rome is an action-adventure hack and slash {{game played}} in a third-person perspective. Players assume control of Marius Titus, a Roman general who is on a quest to avenge his murdered family. Throughout the game, players gain access <b>to</b> <b>weapons</b> {{that can be used}} to assault enemies or defend themselves. For instance, players are {{equipped}} with a sword {{that can be used to}} strike and kill enemies, and a shield that can be used to deflect enemies' attack and break their defense. The strength of each attack can be decided by players. In addition to melee-based combat, the game features spears and javelins, which serve as ranged weapons.|$|E
5|$|The JNA also {{evacuated}} its facilities {{elsewhere in}} Croatia. Pullout from the Maršal Tito and Kerestinec barracks in Zagreb started on 30 November, and {{was completed by}} the end of 1991. Istria was evacuated by the JNA and the Yugoslav Navy on 15 December, handing over the Croatian <b>TO</b> <b>weapons</b> to the HV. The quantity of the <b>TO</b> <b>weapons</b> handed over in Istriawhere the JNA evacuated 78 facilitieswas enough to arm two combat brigades. In December 1991, only minor clashes occurred around the JNA facilities that were still under the HV blockade, including a minor, unsuccessful HV attack on Mekušje barracks in Karlovac. Despite the Geneva Accord requiring an immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment, the JNA remained for seven to eight months. When its troops eventually withdrew from Croatia, the JNA left their equipment to the Republic of Serbian Krajina, established in the JNA-held areas of Croatia on 19 December. The JNA and the Yugoslav Navy kept their bases on Vis and Lastovo islands until early June 1992 before pulling out unilaterally. The JNA maintained positions near Dubrovnik until July, while the naval blockade of the city was lifted on 26 May 1992.|$|E

50|$|Lethality (also called deadliness or perniciousness) is how capable {{something}} is of causing death. Most {{often it is}} used when referring <b>to</b> chemical <b>weapons,</b> biological weapons, or their toxic chemical components. The use of this term denotes the ability of these <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> kill, but also {{the possibility that they}} may not kill. Reasons for the lethality of a <b>weapon</b> <b>to</b> be inconsistent, or expressed by percentage, can be as varied as minimized exposure <b>to</b> the <b>weapon,</b> previous exposure <b>to</b> the <b>weapon</b> minimizing susceptibility, degradation of the weapon over time and/or distance, and incorrect deployment of a multi-component weapon.|$|R

The Russians remained active on the south-eastern front, mainly in the Battle of Rautu, Karelian Isthmus, between 21 February and 6 April 1918. They defended the approaches to Petrograd.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} the on-screen character directly using the keyboard or gamepad. The player progresses by navigating platform game puzzles and shooting enemies with the equipped weapon. When the player collects multiple weapons, {{they may be}} toggled at any time with the press of a button. Defeating enemies sometimes yields yellow triangular objects, which give experience points <b>to</b> <b>weapons</b> when collected. Weapons may be improved up to level three, but taking damage causes weapons to lose experience and levels. Health and missile capacity upgrades are scattered throughout the game world. The player must interact {{with a variety of}} non-player characters and objects to complete the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related <b>to</b> <b>weapons,</b> such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E
500|$|In 1994 Folkvord criticised the Labour Government for {{exporting}} <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> Turkey, {{which at}} that time was engaged in a civil war against the Kurdish people. He claimed it violated a parliamentary decision made in 1959 which said that the government would not distribute, or export, <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> countries involved in a civil war. Folkvord earned the support of the Socialist Left, the Centre Party and the Christian Democratic Party who all sought <b>to</b> end <b>weapon</b> exports <b>to</b> Turkey. The Conservative Party supported the Labour Party's decision however, with the then party leader Jan Petersen claiming that the Kurdish liberators were [...] "terrorists". According to Arbeiderbladet the Norwegian Government had sold [...] worth of <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> the Turkish Government in 1989 alone. Folkvord sent a letter to Bjørn Tore Godal, the then Minister of Foreign Affairs, and asked if the Norwegian Government had gotten the approval of the parliament's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence <b>to</b> sell <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> Turkey. In a 1967 decree it became illegal <b>to</b> sell <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> civil war torned countries, and Folkvord believed that Norway should stopp selling <b>weapons</b> <b>to</b> a country which he considered to be embroilled by civil war.|$|R

5|$|All {{enemies are}} {{protected}} by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and <b>to</b> <b>weapons</b> with a low rate of fire such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like submachine guns and assault rifles. Barriers are typically used by boss-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporary benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in bullet time. Powers do not require any sort of expendable resource; they only have a global refresh time period.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{take place}} on a grid-based map, with the battle system {{employing}} a turn-based system for the player, enemy units and allied units. The movement and attack ranges of enemies can be optionally displayed to players. While seventy-four units are accessible in-game by completing its chapters, only twelve can be taken into battle at any one time. When two units engage, a separate battle screen activates, and the battle plays out automatically. Enemy resistances <b>to</b> <b>weapons</b> are covered by the Weapon Triangle: lances are strong against swords, swords are strong against axes, and axes are strong against lances. Each unit gains experience points with each action, and when they accumulate 100 points, they level up and their stats are randomly raised. Each unit has a class, which affects their weaponry and movement range: these classes, when at level 10, can be promoted to a stronger class using a Master Seal item.|$|E
