Before Brian can present the petition to the mayor, Chris burns it because Alyssa has agreed he may touch her breasts if he destroys the document, much to Brian's anger. Brian manages to get 10,000 more signatures on a new petition <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Mayor West, but West still won't change his mind.

That same day, the killer hides in another open house, later murdering {{a woman with a}} shotgun before calling the police to the scene. Black finds an X drawn in blood under the house's welcome mat; Patricia has begun drawing red Xs in her crayon pictures, which Catherine takes notice of. Black reviews the videotape, finding a reflection of the killer in a glass pane. Extracting a picture from this, he requests <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Patricia, but stops himself, realizing that the killer let Patricia live so that she could relive the events when questioned.|$|E

Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open up about his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves {{in the middle of}} the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Dixie.

25|$|Robertson and Haig met (9 June) {{after the}} victory at Messines. Robertson warned Haig that the {{government}} were diverting manpower into shipbuilding, ship crews and agriculture rather than the Army, and that a prolonged offensive would leave Britain “without an Army” by the autumn, and suggested that attacks against Austria-Hungary might be more prudent. Haig, dismayed, retorted that “Great Britain must … win the war by herself” and {{that the government}} were “failing at the XIIth hour”. Haig also showed Robertson his “Present Situation and Future Plans” (dated 12 June) in which he argued that he had a good chance of clearing the Belgian Coast provided the Germans were unable to transfer reinforcements from the Eastern Front (in the event German reinforcements did not start to arrive in number until November), and that victory at Ypres “might quite possibly lead to (German) collapse”. Robertson told Haig he disagreed with the statistical appendix (prepared by Charteris who was thought “a dangerous fool” in the War Office) showing German manpower near breaking point and refused <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the War Cabinet.|$|E

Vocalist Anthony Kiedis wrote the lyrics to express feelings of loneliness and despondency, and to reflect on narcotics {{and their impact on}} his life. Kiedis initially did not feel that [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] would fit into the Chili Peppers' repertoire, and was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> his bandmates until producer Rick Rubin implored him to do so.

500|$|Following {{a journey}} to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, van Meegeren painted The Supper at Emmaus using the {{ultramarine}} blues and yellows preferred by Johannes Vermeer and other Dutch Golden Age painters. The experts assumed that Vermeer had studied in Italy, so van Meegeren used [...] by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio located at Italy’s Pinacoteca di Brera as a model. He {{had always wanted to}} walk in the steps of the masters, and he felt that his forgery was a fine work in its own right. He gave it to his friend, attorney C. A. Boon, telling him that it was a genuine Vermeer, and asked him <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Dr. Abraham Bredius in Monaco.

Unaware that the book is the legendary Gran Grimoire, Mewt brings the book over to Marche's house along with Ritz. The old book is written in a language none of them have ever seen before, and a single inscription reads: [...] "Alta oron, Sondus kameela". The next morning, Marche wakes up in the world of Ivalice. The fantasy Ivalice is supposedly a reincarnation of Mewt's memories from a Final Fantasy game.|$|E
500|$|The Ironclad Board {{initially}} accepted two of {{the sixteen}} designs submitted in early September, the armored frigate that became [...] and Bushnell's design. The board required a guarantee from Bushnell that his ship would float despite the weight of its armor and he needed to have his design reviewed by a naval constructor to that end. Cornelius H. DeLamater recommended that Bushnell consult with his friend John Ericsson. The two first met on 9 September and again on the following day, after Ericsson had time to evaluate Galenas design and give his guarantee. During this second meeting Ericsson showed Bushnell his own design, the future Monitor. Bushnell got Ericsson's permission to show the model of his design to Welles and the latter told Bushnell <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the board.

500|$|Petr Harmáček (known online by the alias [...] "Harmy") {{had watched}} a dubbed {{version of the}} {{original}} cut of Star Wars {{at the age of}} six, and had then seen the Special Editions of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi on their 1997 release. Although initially admiring them, he became disappointed when he learnt how much the films had been changed retroactively; he argued that replacing the original effects with re-composited digital effects was [...] "an act of cultural vandalism". A fan of the original trilogy, he had written his undergraduate thesis on their cultural impact. After seeing a trailer for Adywan's cut of The Empire Strikes Back, Harmáček was inspired to create a version of the film that [...] "undid" [...] the post-1977 changes and restored the theatrical releases in high-definition. He described his motivation as: [...] "I {{wanted to be able to}} show people who haven't seen Star Wars yet, like my little brother or my girlfriend, the original, Oscar-winning version, but I didn't want to have <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> them in bad quality."

500|$|Ericsson {{originally}} made no {{submission to}} the board, but became involved when Cornelius Bushnell, the {{sponsor of the}} proposal that became the armored sloop , needed to have his design reviewed by a naval constructor. The board required a guarantee from Bushnell that his ship would float despite the weight of its armor and Cornelius H. DeLamater of New York City recommended that Bushnell consult with his friend Ericsson. The two first met on 9 September and again on the following day, after Ericsson had time to evaluate Galenas design. During this second meeting Ericsson showed Bushnell a model of his own design, the future Monitor, derived from his 1854 design. Bushnell got Ericsson's permission to show the model to Welles, who told Bushnell <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the board. Upon review of Ericsson's unusual design, the board was skeptical, concerned that such a vessel would not float, especially in rough seas, and rejected the proposal of a completely iron laden ship. President Lincoln, who had also examined the design, overruled them. Ericsson assured the board his ship would float exclaiming, [...] "The sea shall ride over her and she shall live in it like a duck". On 15 September, after further deliberations, the board accepted Ericsson's proposal. The Ironclad Board evaluated 17 different designs, but recommended only three for procurement on 16 September, including Ericsson's Monitor design.|$|E

500|$|Welles {{signed his}} {{contract}} with RKO on August 21. This legendary contract stipulated that Welles would act in, direct, produce and write two films. Mercury would get $100,000 for the first film by January 1, 1940, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000, and $125,000 for a second film by January 1, 1941, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000. The most controversial aspect of the contract was granting Welles complete artistic control of the two films so long as RKO approved both project's stories and {{so long as the}} budget did not exceed $500,000. RKO executives {{would not be allowed to}} see any footage until Welles chose <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> them, and no cuts could be made to either film without Welles's approval. Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, select his own cast and crew, and have the right of final cut. Granting final cut privilege was unprecedented for a studio since it placed artistic considerations over financial investment. The contract was deeply resented in the film industry, and the Hollywood press took every opportunity to mock RKO and Welles. Schaefer remained a great supporter and saw the unprecedented contract as good publicity. Film scholar Robert L. Carringer wrote: [...] "The simple fact seems to be that Schaefer believed Welles was going to pull off something really big almost as much as Welles did himself." ...|$|E
