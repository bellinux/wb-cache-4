5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E
25|$|Artists {{from around}} the world also {{expressed}} their concern and were very upset by <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> act. Pakistani artist and singer Shehzad Roy sang a new song for the victims of the Peshawar attack, which is now the official song on the National TV channel of Pakistan, PTV.|$|E

You are not partners in the Zionist enterprise. You are a foreign implant. You are an errant weed. Sensible Judaism spits you out. You placed yourself outside the wall of Jewish law... We say to <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> man and those like him: you are a shame on Zionism and an embarrassment to Judaism.|$|E

25|$|In the 1993 pre-season, the Gins {{were given}} the second overall pick in the 1993 PBA draft behind new team Sta. Lucia Realty which {{replaced}} Presto. They drafted former FEU power forward Victor Pablo but immediately traded him to 7-Up for veterans Manny Victorino and Alejo Alolor. The said trade was lambasted by most fans, and it cost Ginebra their performance for the year where they compiled a 9–26 record in all three conferences. <b>This</b> <b>horrible</b> performance gave them the top pick in the next draft.|$|E
500|$|William Winstanley {{described}} him as [...] "not so much famous for his valour as his villainy, being remarkable for nothing but <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> business of the king's murther, for which {{he came into the}} pack to have a share in the spoyle." ...|$|E
500|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a television series, Mulholland Drive began as a 90-minute pilot produced for Touchstone Television and intended for the ABC television network. David Lynch sold the idea to ABC executives based only {{on the story of}} Rita emerging from the car accident with her purse containing $125,000 in cash and the blue key, and Betty trying to help her figure out who she is. An ABC executive recalled, [...] "I remember the creepiness of this woman in <b>this</b> <b>horrible,</b> horrible crash, and David teasing us with the notion that people are chasing her. She's not just 'in' trouble—she is trouble. Obviously, we asked, 'What happens next?' And David said, 'You have to buy the pitch for me to tell you.|$|E

She described it as a [...] "very difficult instrument" [...] and stated, [...] "There was so much noise in [...] It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh , I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> melody, if you could call it a melody, and I knew I had to feel something. It took a few takes because I thought, 'oh, how could [...] listen to that? The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Given {{the large}} number of FMV games and Genesis ports, the Sega CD's game library has been criticized for its lack of depth. Full motion video quality was {{substandard}} on the Sega CD due to poor video compression software and the system's limited color palette, and the concept never caught on with the public. According to Digital Pictures founder Tom Zito, [...] "Sega CD could only put up 32 colors at a time, so you had <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> grainy look to the images," [...] though the system was able to put up 64 colors at one time. Likewise, most Genesis ports for the Sega CD featured additional full motion video sequences, extra levels, and enhanced audio, but were otherwise identical to their Genesis release. The video quality in these sequences has also been criticized as comparable to an old VHS tape.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{ceremony}} {{was described as}} a [...] "colourful spectacle" [...] due to the Army's [...] Western Command Band wearing scarlet jackets and white helmets, the Army Guard of Honour in jungle green clothing and the blue uniforms of the mounted escort. The order of the wheelpast was Singapore, India, New Zealand, Rhodesia, Wales, Northern Ireland, England and the host country Australia. Hugh Leslie, the Games Chairman, in his speech said [...] "This event, apart from helping the participants, is designed to prove to the public that the person who is badly handicapped is not a cripple. I hope that <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> word will eventually be wiped out of use." [...] Senator Shane Paltridge, who was representing the Federal Government, said [...] "This is one fine example of leadership taken by this State in the work to lift the paraplegic from a life of resignation to one of self respect and purpose in the community." ...|$|E

500|$|Wong was {{disappointed}} with director Harry Longstreet, claiming {{he did not}} have respect for the script. Longstreet had failed to film one of the script's scenes, and had not obtained additional camera coverage for the scenes which had been filmed. As a result, Wong and another director, Michael Katleman, re-shot several scenes for additional coverage to complete the episode, and filmed the omitted scene and some inserts. Hutchison also had difficulty with Longstreet's directing; he found the acting instructions he was given [...] "ridiculous". Morgan said that the episode's production was problematic, feeling that [...] "Squeeze" [...] "was truly saved in postproduction". Duchovny also found issue with Longstreet's direction, and disagreed with the director's take on how Fox Mulder should be portrayed. Describing their different opinions, Duchovny noted [...] "the director wanted me to be mad about <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> serial killer. I was like, 'No, this is an amazing discovery! He's not morally culpable, because he's genetically driven.' I judge no one".|$|E
500|$|... "Speak Now" [...] {{was written}} by Swift, as were all the tracks for the album. The song was {{inspired}} by the story of her friend and her high school boyfriend. The couple went their separate ways after high school – with the idea that they would get back together. One day, Swift's friend informed Swift that her high school boyfriend would soon wed. [...] "He had met this girl who's just <b>this</b> <b>horrible,</b> mean person who made him completely stop talking to all of his friends, cut off his family. She had him so completely isolated," [...] said Swift. She asked her friend if she would [...] "speak now." [...] Perplexed, her friend asked for an explanation, and she answered, [...] "You know, storm the church. 'Speak now or forever hold your peace.' I'll go with you. I'll play guitar. It'd be great." [...] Swift's friend found this to be humorous, laughing at the idea.|$|E
500|$|On 11 December 1980 Hodgson {{asked to}} see a priest, Father Frank Moran, to whom he confessed {{that he was having}} nightmares and the face of a woman he had killed [...] "kept coming back to him". He said that the murder had {{happened}} in Southampton the previous year and [...] "that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death". He repeated the confession to a prison officer the following day, and subsequently wrote a note which stated: [...] "After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> crime, I wish now that it was me that was dead and not the person I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. ... I did the murder, why I don't know. So all I can say is let justice be done".|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} many positive reviews from fans and television critics. One-time The Simpsons writer and comedian Ricky Gervais named it his second favorite episode, and said: [...] "Mr. Burns gives [...] this terrible plaque above his desk that says, 'Don't forget: You're here forever.' It's about how sometimes things don't {{go the way}} you planned, which is pretty amazing in a cartoon. Homer then puts up all the pictures of Maggie he's ever taken to strategically cover <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> thing so it now reads, 'Do it for her.' It gives me a lump in the throat thinking about it." [...] Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said: [...] "A surprisingly traditional episode. The flashback to 1993 seems a bit odd, but this {{is a good example of}} a story that doesn't overly rely on set pieces and confounded expectations for its success." [...] In a review of the sixth season, Joshua Klein of the Chicago Tribune cited [...] "And Maggie Makes Three", [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", [...] "Homer Badman", and [...] "Lisa's Rival" [...] among his favorite episodes of the season.|$|E
500|$|Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation {{received}} strong {{criticism for}} designing the stunt {{and allowing the}} event to continue after Owen Hart's fall. In his weekly column for the Calgary Sun—a major newspaper in Hart's hometown—on May 31, 1999, Bret Hart blamed Vince McMahon for his brother's death. He [...] "question if this was really necessary" [...] and said, [...] "Shame on you, Vince McMahon." [...] He also claimed that the tribute show [...] "reeked of disrespect," [...] stating, [...] "Yes, the so-called tribute where afterward wrestlers point to their crotches and say: 'Suck it!' It makes me nauseous." [...] Other members of the Hart family also blamed Vince McMahon for Owen's death, claiming that the accident was the inevitable outcome of [...] "an obsession for ratings and revenues." [...] While in Calgary for Owen's funeral, wrestler Hulk Hogan stated, [...] "Hopefully something good will happen. Wrestling's gotten... way too over the top". In reference to McMahon, he added, [...] "I hope he learns a lesson from <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> accident". Ralph Klein, Alberta's premier at the time, expressed a hope that Hart's death would lead to changes in wrestling, stating, [...] "Maybe the various federations will rethink the gimmickry." ...|$|E
500|$|When Principal Skinner {{tells the}} {{children}} at school that Valentine's Day is not a joke (due to Bart fabricating candy hearts with mean insults), he has a flashback {{in which he is}} sitting in a PBR somewhere in Da Nang in 1969. On an oil drum next to him is a manila envelope and a photograph of Colonel Kurtz. Skinner sees Johnny, one of his army friends, holding a Valentine card and asks him, [...] "Sending your chick a Valentine?", to which Johnny replies [...] "Yep", right before he is shot to death. Cutting back to the present, Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny's name in anguish, to which a perplexed Bart states [...] "Cool! I broke his brain." [...] After the episode aired, a Vietnam veteran sent {{in a letter to the}} show that read, [...] "I was watching the Valentine's Day episode of your cartoon and I saw the horrifying Vietnam flashback. Do you really think this was funny, <b>this</b> <b>horrible</b> experience?" [...] The staff ignored the letter and, as Wes Archer pointed out, the scene was [...] "an obvious" [...] reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne). In contrast, Mark Groening—the brother of Matt Groening and himself a Vietnam veteran—"loved" [...] the sequence as well as the episode.|$|E

500|$|... io9 {{felt the}} {{character}} of Danes to be a cross between Freddy Krueger and Jesus. Commenting on the Christ comparison, Pullman felt that his character {{was sort of the}} [...] "doppelganger of Jesus or something." [...] He stated of Danes: [...] "It's like he's been out in the desert, and he comes back in, and there is a certain kind of way in which he still has pride." [...] SFX described Oswald's journey as one from a Hannibal Lecter type character to a Billy Graham or messianic figure. Pullman observed that Oswald's failure to die [...] "becomes the pivot for a whole world that has changed"; feeling that his character was an intelligent one who knows he can provide a message people want to hear. Discussing Oswald's fall from grace, series writer Jane Espenson explains that [...] "humanity doesn't seize on heroes for the long–term", and that Oswald's descent from fame was a way to make his arc more realistic. Though Oswald dies helping the Torchwood team, Espenson remarked that [...] "we didn't want to outright redeem <b>this</b> <b>horrible,</b> horrible man" [...] commenting that his death is intended as [...] "redemption and comeuppance both." [...] The Independents Neela Debnath observed that whilst {{the character of}} Danes had [...] "become likeable in an odd-sort of way" [...] his last scenes [...] "reiterated just how despicable he was" [...] and that it was the right time for him to depart the cast.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} after the lynching, {{newspapers}} fiercely condemned the event. Within a week, news of the lynching was published as far away as London. A New York Times editorial opined that, [...] "in no other land even pretending to be civilized could a man be burned to death in the streets of a considerable city amid the savage exultation of its inhabitants". In the New York Age, James Weldon Johnson described the members of the lynch mob as [...] "lower than any other people who at present inhabit the earth". Although many southern newspapers had previously defended lynching as a defense of civilized society, after Washington's death, they did not cast the practice in such terms. The Montgomery Advertiser wrote that, [...] "no savage was ever more cruel ... than the men who participated in <b>this</b> <b>horrible,</b> almost unbelievable episode". In Texas, the Houston Chronicle and the Austin American criticized the lynch mob, but spoke highly of Waco. The Morning News of Dallas reported the story, but did not publish an accompanying editorial. In Waco, the Times-Herald refrained from editorializing about the lynching. The Waco Morning News briefly noted their disapproval of the lynching, focusing their criticism on papers they felt had attacked the city unfairly. They cast the condemnatory editorials {{in the aftermath of the}} lynching as [...] "Holier than thou" [...] remarks. A writer for the Waco Semi-Weekly Tribune defended the lynching, stating that Washington deserved to die and that blacks should view Washington's death as a warning against crime. The paper later carried an editorial from the Houston Post condemning the lynching, characterizing the column as part of an attack on the city.|$|E
