60|$|I {{went up to}} the Hardingham {{through a}} dense London fog to see how things really stood. Before I had <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle for ten minutes I felt like a man who has just awakened in a bleak, inhospitable room out of a grandiose dream.|$|E

5000|$|Grant's second book, <b>Talking</b> <b>To</b> <b>My</b> Country, was {{published}} in February 2016. The origins of the book came from the abuse of Adam Goodes in 2015. In a review for The Saturday Paper, [...] <b>Talking</b> <b>To</b> <b>My</b> Country was described as [...] "Australia viewed from the riverbank {{on the edge of}} town; great affection mixed with discomfort about 'Advance Australia Fair'".|$|R

We're ashore now, remember, {{and there is no}} more ship for you to command, so were I you I'd be mighty careful how I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> betters." ...|$|E

I saw that your eyes were not opened, but I think I {{had a certain}} presentiment, for which I do not pretend to account, {{that they would be}} opened." ...|$|E

You will see presently how this room can get full. Every seat’ll be occupied, and as you notice, the tables are set close, so that the backs of the chairs are almost touching. There is also a good deal of noisy talk here about one o’clock.|$|E
60|$|I {{went back}} very dejected to my hut and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mare which whinnied and rubbed its nose against me, for {{although}} it was well fed and looked after, the poor beast seemed as lonely as I was myself. No wonder, since like myself it was separated from all its kind and weary of inaction. After this I ate and smoked and finally dozed, no more, for whenever I tried {{to go to sleep}} I thought that I heard Zikali laughing at me, as mayhap he was doing yonder in his hut.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{you need}} not be afraid. I have got {{permission}} to ask you. What do you think? I actually <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father for ten whole minutes yesterday; he wanted to avoid me when he saw me, but I caught him in a corner. He {{took advantage of the}} opportunity to try to prevent me from going to see Pigott, but I would not listen to him, so he gave it up. What did he mean by that? Why did he send her away? What does it all mean? Oh! Arthur, when will you come back, Arthur?" [...] and, to Mr. Fraser's infinite distress, she burst into tears.|$|E

60|$|The hours {{passed as}} though in a dream. I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sister and her husband, and {{exchanged}} the usual gossip with their callers. I even paid a call or two on my own account; but I have no recollection of whom I went to see or what we talked about. I had no chance to visit either Mr. Parker or Eve, for neither of them left their places {{and they were in}} the middle of a row; but I took good care that we were close together in the vestibule toward the end. With a little shiver I saw that Lady Orstline was there too--next Mr. Parker. I was a few feet behind them both, with my sister. I found myself watching almost feverishly.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{think of}} dining at five to-morrow, my Lady Papua," [...] said the facetious bishop; [...] "will that suit his lordship and {{the affairs of}} State? he! he! he!" [...] And the good prelate laughed at the fun. How pleasantly {{young men and women}} of fifty or thereabouts can joke and flirt and poke their fun about, {{laughing}} and holding their sides, dealing in little innuendoes and rejoicing in nicknames, when they have no Mentors of twenty-five or thirty near them to keep them in order! The vicar of Framley might perhaps have been regarded as such a Mentor, were it not for that capability of adapting himself to the company immediately around him on which he so much piqued himself. He therefore also <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Lady Papua, and was jocose about the Baron,--not altogether to the satisfaction of Mr. Harold Smith himself. For Mr. Harold Smith was in earnest, and did not quite relish these jocundities. He had an idea that he could in about three months talk the British world into civilizing New Guinea, and that the world of Barsetshire would be made to go with him by one night's efforts. He did not understand why others should be less serious, and was inclined to resent somewhat stiffly the amenities of our friend Mark.|$|E
60|$|This mob {{was one of}} many {{thousands}} that were going about the country at that time, huzzaing for the acquittal of the seven bishops who had been tried just then, and about whom little Harry Esmond at that time knew scarce anything. It was assizes at Hexton, and there was a great meeting of the gentry at the “Bell”; and my lord’s people had their new liveries on, and Harry a little suit of blue and silver, which he wore upon occasions of state; and the gentlefolks came round and <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> lord; and a judge in a red gown, who seemed a very great personage, especially complimented him and my lady, who was mighty grand. Harry remembers her train borne up by her gentlewoman. There was an assembly and ball at the great room at the “Bell”, and other young gentlemen of the county families looked on as he did. One of them jeered him for his black eye, which was swelled by the potato, and another called him a bastard, on which he and Harry fell to fisticuffs. My lord’s cousin, Colonel Esmond of Walcote, was there, and separated the two lads, a great tall gentleman with a handsome, good-natured face. The boy did not know how nearly in after-life he should be allied to Colonel Esmond, and how much kindness he should have to owe him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I rarely <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle, as you know, {{and never}} about such things. He thinks {{everything}} but sewing and cooking above women's comprehension, {{and out of}} their line." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{wonder what}} powers she {{will give me}} over her West Indian property; I must try,' said John; 'it will make a great {{difference}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> opportunities of usefulness. I must <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father about it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was a Prince. Yes! Think of {{a little}} Prince who had never known rough words in his own house handed over to shouting, bearded Rabbis, who pulled his ears and filliped his nose, all that he might learn--learn--learn to be King when his time came. Hé! Such a little Prince it was! One eye he kept on the stone-throwing Moorish boys, and the other it roved about the streets looking for his Kingdom. Yes, and he learned to cry softly when he was hunted up and down those streets. He learned to do all things without noise. He played beneath his father's table when the Great Candle was lit, and he listened as {{children}} listen to the talk of his father's friends above the table. They came across the mountains, from {{out of all the}} world, for my Prince's father was their counsellor. They came from behind the armies of Sala-ud-Din: from Rome: from Venice: from England. They stole down our alley, they tapped secretly at our door, they took off their rags, they arrayed themselves, and they <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> father at the wine. All over the world the heathen fought each other. They brought news of these wars, and while he played beneath the table, my Prince heard these meanly dressed ones decide between themselves how, and when, and for how long King should draw sword against King, and People rise up against People. Why not? There can be no war without gold, and we Jews know how the earth's gold moves with the seasons, and the crops, and the winds; circling and looping and rising and sinking away like a river--a wonderful underground river. How should the foolish Kings know that while they fight and steal and kill?' ...|$|E
60|$|I gladly let him assist Demetria to {{her seat}} on the side-saddle, for that was perhaps the last {{personal}} service {{he would be able}} to render her. The poor old fellow was crying, I believe, his utterance was so husky. Before leaving I gave him on a scrap of paper my address in Montevideo, and bade him take it to Don Florentino Blanco with a request to write me a letter in the course of the next two or three days to inform me of Don Hilario's movements. We then trotted softly away over the sward, and in about half an hour struck the road leading from Rocha to Montevideo. This we followed till daylight, scarcely pausing once from our swift gallop, and a hundred times during that dark ride over a country utterly unknown to me I blessed the little witch Cleta; for never was there a more steady, sure-footed beast than the ugly roan that carried my companion, and when we drew rein in the pale morning light he seemed fresh as when we started. We then left the highway and rode across country in a north-westerly direction for a distance of eight or nine miles, for I was anxious to be far away from public roads and from the prying, prating people that use them. About eleven o'clock that morning we had breakfast at a rancho, then rode on again till we came to a forest of scattered thorn-trees growing on the slopes of a range of hills. It was a wild, secluded spot, with water and good pasturage for the horses and pleasant shade for ourselves; so, after unsaddling and turning loose our horses to feed, we sat down to rest under a large tree with our backs against its portly trunk. From our shady retreat we commanded a splendid view of the country over which we had been riding all the morning, extending for many leagues behind us, and while I smoked my cigar I <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> companion, calling her attention to the beauty of that wide, sunlit prospect.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009, Neil {{worked on}} a pilot for an A&E reality TV show. According to Neil, the program would follow {{him and his family}} after his parents moved in with him.
