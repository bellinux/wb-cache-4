The production received a 25% tax credit for filming in the state. Berg shot Lone Survivor with creative autonomy as Universal did not fully oversee the film's production. [...] "Not having the studio <b>there</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> ... I respect Universal and get along great with them, but {{we were on our}} own completely, and in many ways, it was a more autonomous experience".|$|E
500|$|A 2007 {{research}} study by historian Đuro Zatezalo lists {{the names of}} 10,502 identified victims, of whom 9,663 were Serbs, 762 Jews, 55 Croats and 22 others. Zatezalo estimated that {{the total number of}} deaths at the camp was 40,123 (38,010 Serbs, 1,998 Jews, 88 Croats and 27 others). 1,000 children also perished in camp, as did 55 Serbian Orthodox priests according to Zatezalo's data. As it operated over a period of 122 days, this would suggest that an average of 329 people were killed <b>there</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
500|$|Norman Reynolds {{could not}} return for Temple of Doom {{because of his}} {{commitment}} to Return of the Jedi. Elliot Scott (Labyrinth, Who Framed Roger Rabbit), Reynolds' mentor, was hired. To build the rope bridge the filmmakers found a group of British engineers from Balfour Beatty working on the nearby Victoria Dam. Harrison Ford suffered a severe spinal disc herniation by performing a somersault while filming the scene with the assassin in Jones' bedroom. A hospital bed was brought on set for Ford to rest between takes. Lucas stated, [...] "He could barely stand up, yet he was <b>there</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> so shooting would not stop. He was in incomprehensible pain, {{but he was still}} trying to make it happen." [...] With no alternatives, Lucas shut down production while Ford was flown to Centinela Hospital on June 21 for recovery. Stunt double Vic Armstrong spent five weeks as a stand-in for various shots. Wendy Leech, Armstrong's wife, served as Capshaw's stunt double.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{sings the}} end of the theme song to Family Ties while talking to an {{administrator}} at the annex center. Smithers's recollection of his marriage parodies the two plays Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and A Streetcar Named Desire, both written by American playwright Tennessee Williams. Homer's bedroom rant to Marge is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All (1979), A Few Good Men (1992), Patton (1970), and Chinatown (1974). He says: [...] "Look Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out <b>there</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown," [...] all of which are lines from those films.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1940 season, {{government}} {{construction of}} air fields and radio beacon stations created {{a lot of}} business for Northwestern. [...] Northwestern made 5 and 1/2 round trips, of 550 miles one way from Bethel to McGrath, in the 1940 season, which lasted five months and ended October 1, 1940. [...] According to Robert W. “Bert” Kern, chief engineer and a Portland resident, “we pushed two barges most of the time, hauling mining machinery, caterpillars, bulldozers, dredging outfits, ready-built houses to be put together at McGrath, and anything else you can imagine they might need. [...] The airfield at McGrath was almost midway between Anchorage and Nome, and 8 to 10 planes were landing <b>there</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> during the summer of 1940.|$|E
2500|$|Examples of {{contemporary}} uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants {{or on the}} inside of engagement- and wedding rings to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy. [...] Another application of modern engraving is found in the printing industry. <b>There,</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto rotogravure cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6µm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed printing presses. [...] Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.|$|E

2500|$|Discussing {{his life}} in New York, Popović said: [...] "I never stopped keeping tabs on things back home. Personally, I felt like my life ended. War, the country disintegrated, I lost the job that I worked for so many years, the only thing I had left was raising my children. There was a {{newsstand}} on the 42nd Street that sold Večernje novosti and Vreme and I'd go <b>there</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> to get the paper and read it cover to cover. I was well informed. I also had contacts with numerous human rights {{organizations such as the}} Human Rights Watch and UN Human Rights Committee that asked for my input on the situation once they found out I'm in New York. In the beginning, the information coming out of the Balkans was unclear, incomplete, and misinterpreted. Yugoslavia was low on their list of priorities. Germany was uniting, USSR was disintegrating, we were the last item on the priority list. I never turned down invitations to speak at meetings and lectures that were being held everywhere from schools, churches and city chambers. People from all over the former Yugoslavia would come and I always used my participation to insist on the establishment of the international war crimes tribunal".|$|E
2500|$|Alexandria Hotel: 210 W. 5th Street – Built in 1906, the eight-story Alexandria Hotel {{is another}} {{building}} designed by John Parkinson. [...] With 500 rooms, an elaborate wood lobby, and the glamorous Palm Court with its stained glass dome, the Alexandria {{was the most}} luxurious hotel in Los Angeles from the time it opened until the Biltmore opened in the mid-1920s. [...] Movie stars and other celebrities, including Mae West, Humphrey Bogart, Rudolph Valentino, Clark Gable, Greta Garbo, Sarah Bernhardt, Enrico Caruso and Jack Dempsey were guests. [...] Charlie Chaplin kept a suite at the Alexandria and did improvisations in the lobby where Tom Mix reportedly rode his horse. [...] The carpet in the lobby was called the [...] "million-dollar carpet", because there was purportedly a $1 million worth of business done <b>there</b> <b>every</b> <b>day.</b> [...] It was there that D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks met in 1919 to form United Artists. U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, and many foreign dignitaries, including King Edward VIII, also stayed at the hotel while visiting Los Angeles. [...] The hotel declined after the Biltmore opened and closed in 1934, with its chandelier and gold leaf covering of the mezzanine lobby being stripped and sold. [...] It reopened in 1937 but declined again in the 1950s, become a transient hotel with the Grand Ballroom {{being used as a}} training ring for boxers.
