30|$|The fifth {{professional}} {{learning activity}} is {{the sharing of}} information. This is also a social learning activity and refers to the effort of any team member to keep {{the flow of information}} going within a team. Ongoing information sharing means not only making knowledge explicit but also discussing how this information is to be used, and to what purpose. In contrast to asking for feedback, sharing of information is less concerned with something which has come to one teacher’s attention for improvement, and more concerned with stimulating all teachers to attend to things <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>improved.</b> Similar to self-reflection, information sharing helps the team in general to monitor its progress (Cochran-Smith and Lytle, 1999; van Woerkom, 2003).|$|E

30|$|The kinetic {{evaluation}} of QOL at 3  months and 1  year offers {{the opportunity to}} focus on aspects of QOL <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>improved</b> by therapeutic interventions {{during the first year}} after ICU discharge.

In general ICU populations, previous {{studies have shown that the}} majority of the QOL scores recover over time [5]. Impairment of SF and RE suggests that patients with HMs may be socially isolated because of their condition.

40|$|Increasingly, {{microcontrollers}} {{are being}} used in automotive systems to handle sophisticated control and monitoring activities.

We present some of the features and optimizations that make EMERALDSOSEK appropriate for small, low-cost microcontrollers typically found in automotive applications. We also present measurements of operating system performance. We find EMERALDS-OSEK to be efficient, both in terms of processing overheads and memory usage.
