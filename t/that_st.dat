5|$|According to unverified reports it is {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Thaddeus was buried {{at the site of}} the St. Thaddeus Monastery in the 1st century A.D., and <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Gregory was responsible for establishing a monastery here in the 4th century. However, there is recorded proof <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Thaddeus Monastery dates to the 7th century. It was the second Armenian church to be built, following the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and was the seat of the diocese in the 10th century. It was destroyed in an earthquake in 1319 and was rebuilt due to the efforts of Bishop Zachariah in the 1320s.|$|E
5|$|Monk's {{assistant}} Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) suspects <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Claire's wife Miranda was {{the person}} who ordered her husband's assassination. Sharona's theory {{is supported by the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Claire is worth $150 million, but Monk thinks about other hypotheses, including one in which Miranda is having an affair with one of St. Claire's assistants. Things become clearer in Monk's mind when he watches a news report on the assassination attempt. Monk regroups everyone at the place of the campaign rally to recreate what happened that day.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|E

In the following year he built his best organ, that of Christ Church, Spitalfields, which cost the low sum of £600. In the same year he built the organ at St Paul's, Deptford, in 1733 <b>that</b> of <b>St</b> George's-in-the-East, in 1741 <b>that</b> of <b>St</b> Anne's, Limehouse, in 1753 that of Enfield parish church, and in 1757 <b>that</b> of <b>St</b> Leonard's, Shoreditch.|$|R

5|$|At one time, {{the church}} on this site {{was used as a}} chapel of ease to Llantrisant church. In the 15th century, St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio, was built to serve as a chapel of ease for St Ceidio's. In 2006, one author noted <b>that</b> <b>St</b> Ceidio's had not been {{regularly}} used for some years, but restoration work had been carried out by local people. St Mary's, which is about 0.75miles (1.25km) to the west, is no longer used for services either, but is in ruins.|$|E
5|$|British General John Burgoyne moved {{south from}} the {{province}} of Quebec in June 1777 {{to gain control of}} the upper Hudson River valley. His campaign had become bogged down in difficulties following a victory at Fort Ticonderoga. Elements of the army had reached the upper Hudson as early as the end of July, but logistical and supply difficulties delayed the main army at Fort Edward. One attempt to alleviate these difficulties failed when nearly 1,000 men were killed or captured at the August 16 Battle of Bennington. Furthermore, news reached Burgoyne on August 28 <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Leger's expedition down the Mohawk River valley had turned back after the failed Siege of Fort Stanwix.|$|E
5|$|C. L. R. James {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>St</b> Hill {{planned to}} play professional cricket in England around this point, but his {{failure in the}} trial matches meant {{that he was not}} selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1923. James records how upset St Hill's supporters were by his omission and they believed the West Indian selectors feared a black batsman being successful in England. He also describes St Hill became more single-minded and less willing to moderate his approach after this decision.|$|E
2500|$|Sting's drawing ability {{has been}} disputed. Journalist Dave Scherer of PWInsider wrote: [...] "Sting is an all timer for sure, {{but the fact}} is that when he was the man in WCW, even before the NWO came in, he didn't draw huge". Pro wrestling {{historian}} Dave Meltzer also reported <b>that</b> <b>Sting</b> was not a formidable draw. Fin Martin of Power Slam felt <b>that</b> while <b>Sting</b> did not make [...] "essential improvements" [...] nor [...] "grow into the champion's role" [...] during his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign from 1990 to 1991, he suffered from a weak line-up of potential opponents and poor creative handling. Martin said <b>that</b> <b>Sting</b> never truly established himself as 'The Man'.|$|R

5|$|In 1906, {{a survey}} of church plate within the Bangor diocese {{recorded}} <b>that</b> <b>St</b> Nidan's had a silver chalice and alms dish. These were donated probably in 1701 and remade in 1871–72. It also had a silver paten and two cruets with silver handles, all marked with the date 1871–72. Records from the 19th century indicated that two tankards (one silver, one pewter) and a silver chalice had been lost.|$|E
5|$|It appears <b>that</b> <b>St</b> Peter's church, {{the remains}} of which stand in modern Castle Park, may have been another minster, {{possibly}} with 8th-century origins. By the time of Domesday the church held three hides of land, which was a sizeable holding for a mere parish church. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1052 Harold Godwinson took ship to Brycgstow and later in 1062 he took ships from the town to subdue the forces of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn of Wales, indicating {{the status of the}} town as a port.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known for some time <b>that</b> <b>St</b> Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E

50|$|In 1841 {{the church}} became a parish {{in its own}} right, with land taken from <b>that</b> of <b>St</b> Martin in the Bull Ring. In 1947, St Mark’s Church, King Edward's Road was demolished, and the parish was joined with <b>that</b> of <b>St</b> Paul’s.|$|R
5|$|Much of the {{interest}} in the 1886 season concerned the newly inaugurated Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, which offered a then record prize of £10,000. From {{the start of the}} year, St. Gatien was seen as one of the leading contenders for the new race together with Bendigo and Minting. For the second year in succession, St. Gatien's spring preparation was disrupted, this time by injury, although he was able to resume his training in time for Royal Ascot. It was reported <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Gatien had been defeated by Melton in a private trial race in early 1886, but there are few details and it is unclear whether or not this was a serious contest.|$|E
5|$|Other {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} the manner of St Edmund's death, veneration and culthood define him as a sacral king. It has been argued <b>that</b> <b>St</b> Edmund's story was informed by common Celtic and Germanic notions of sacred kingship. Comparable kings who also embodied theories of divinely-ordained rule, rightful sovereignty and the binding links between king, land and society, include: Conaire Mór, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King Dómaldi and Halfdan the Black.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility {{for local}} {{education}} fell to Cheshire County Council in 1903. Loreto Convent, the County High School for Girls, and Altrincham County High School for Boys, were founded in 1909, 1910, and 1912 respectively. Although still open these schools have since changed {{their names to}} Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, and Loreto Grammar School. Altrincham received evacuees during the Second World War, {{and it was in}} this period <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Ambrose College was founded.|$|E
5000|$|The B-side of {{the song}} in Britain, [...] "Someone to Talk To," [...] was written by guitarist Andy Summers. Sting refused to provide vocals, leaving Summers to sing. Summers {{expressed}} disappointment at this, saying, [...] "Maybe I had just split up from my wife. It was a nice thing I had on the guitar and I was disappointed <b>that</b> <b>Sting</b> wouldn't sing it. That would have given it more of an official stamp." [...] Drummer Stewart Copeland said of this conflict, [...] "Andy did his best on vocals but I too was disappointed <b>that</b> <b>Sting</b> didn't sing it. He was very touchy about lyrics." [...] The American B-side, [...] "Tea in the Sahara" [...] (live), comes from the Synchronicity Tour.|$|R
40|$|The {{evidence}} that nuclear proteins can be degraded by cytosolic proteasomes has received considerable experimental support. However, {{the presence of}} proteasome subunits in the nucleus also suggests that protein degradation could occur within this organelle. We determined <b>that</b> <b>Sts</b> 1 can target proteasomes to the nucleus and facilitate the degradation of a nuclear protein. Specific sts 1 mutants showed reduced nuclear proteasomes at the nonpermissive temperature. In contrast, high expression of Sts 1 increased the levels of nuclear proteasomes. Sts 1 targets proteasomes to the nucleus by interacting with Srp 1, a nuclear import factor that binds nuclear localization signals. Deletion of the NLS in Sts 1 prevented its interaction with Srp 1 and caused proteasome mislocalization. In agreement with this observation, a mutation in Srp 1 that weakened its interaction with Sts 1 also reduced nuclear targeting of proteasomes. We reported <b>that</b> <b>Sts</b> 1 could suppress growth and proteolytic defects of rad 23 Δ rpn 10 Δ. We show here <b>that</b> <b>Sts</b> 1 suppresses a previously undetected proteasome localization defect in this mutant. Taken together, these findings explain the suppression of rad 23 Δ rpn 10 Δ by Sts 1 and suggest that the degradation of nuclear substrates requires efficient proteasome localization...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{weeks after}} Sting and Christian Cage {{defeated}} Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown at Final Resolution, Sting made his Impact! debut and announced his retirement. Jarrett {{wasted no time}} in pointing out that [...] "after one match with me, Sting took his ball and went home", and most of Planet Jarrett agreed with that assessment. Young, however, became convinced <b>that</b> <b>Sting</b> was not gone, and raised the ire of Jarrett and Scott D'Amore by frequently expressing that belief. In an attempt to persuade Young <b>that</b> <b>Sting</b> had left, Jarrett commissioned Alex Shelley to obtain footage of Sting at home with his children; however, this failed to allay Young's fears. He insisted <b>that</b> <b>Sting</b> would come back and get each of them, he would even go as far as to insist that the fellow Planet Jarrett members should not call him by his nickname [...] "Showtime" [...] any more, due to Sting's catchphrase [...] "It's showtime, folks!". Young lost to Sting in the main event of the April 13, 2006 Impact!. Young's paranoia did not always hinder his abilities during a match. He remained aggressive (even putting people through a table), would not hesitate to cheat, and was not afraid to capitalize on outside interference. He continued to be aided by Team Canada and Planet Jarrett.|$|R
5|$|St. Seiriol {{established}} a cell {{and a community}} on Puffin Island (in Welsh, Ynys Seiriol or Seiriol's Island) {{half a mile from}} the coast {{at the same time as}} he founded the monastery. There is a tower of a 12th-century church on Puffin Island still. There is a tradition <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Seiriol and perhaps Maelgwn Gwynedd (king of Gwynedd in the first half of the 6th century) were buried there. The island once had large numbers of puffins and guillemots. However, rats reduced the bird population to 40 in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|The St. Vrain {{massacre}} was {{an incident}} in the Black Hawk War. It occurred near present-day Pearl City, Illinois, in Kellogg's Grove, on May 24, 1832. The massacre was most likely committed by Ho-Chunk warriors who were unaffiliated with Black Hawk's band of warriors. It is also unlikely that the group of Ho-Chunk had the sanction of their nation. Killed in the massacre were United States Indian Agent Felix St. Vrain and three of his companions. Some accounts reported <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Vrain's body was mutilated.|$|E
5|$|The date of {{foundation}} of the first building on this site is unknown. Geraint Jones, in a 2006 guide to Anglesey churches, wrote that it is thought <b>that</b> <b>St</b> Cristiolus established a church here in 610. Cristiolus, a 7th-century saint about whom little detail is known, was a follower of St Cadfan, a Breton saint associated with the Christian community on Bardsey Island in Wales. Cristiolus is also credited with the {{foundation of}} the church in Eglwyswrw in modern-day Pembrokeshire, south Wales. He was the brother of St Rhystud, who established the church at Llanrhystud in mid-Wales.|$|E

5|$|The {{opinion that}} Eclogue 4 was a {{reference}} to the coming of Jesus was not universally held by early members of the early Church, however. St. Jerome, an early Church writer noted for translating the Bible into Latin, specifically wrote that Virgil could not have been a Christian prophet without having accepted Christ, and claimed that anyone that had accepted that Virgil was a pre-Christian prophet was being childish. Classicist Ella Bourne, however, noted that the mere fact <b>that</b> <b>St.</b> Jerome responded to the idea {{is a testament to the}} belief's pervasiveness.|$|E
5|$|Theobald was {{instrumental}} in securing the subordination of the Welsh bishoprics to Canterbury. His first act in this area was the consecration of Meurig as Bishop of Bangor in 1140, during which Meurig made a profession of obedience like those made by other bishops subject to Canterbury. Bernard, Bishop of St David's, contested Theobald's right to consecrate Meurig and instead asserted <b>that</b> <b>St</b> David's should be considered an archbishopric, and that Bernard should receive a pallium. This went against the last half-century of precedent that Canterbury had jurisdiction over the four Welsh sees, a precedent that dated back to Anselm's days when Anselm had consecrated Urban as Bishop of Llandaff in 1107.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was <b>that</b> <b>St</b> Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately that officers would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
50|$|Following the event, WWE {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>Sting</b> sustained {{an injury}} during his match with Rollins. Sting injured his neck {{when he received}} a powerbomb onto a turnbuckle.
