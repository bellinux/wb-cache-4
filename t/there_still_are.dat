25|$|The {{most common}} {{hypothesis}} {{for the cause}} of motion sickness is that it functions as a defense mechanism against neurotoxins. The area postrema in the brain is responsible for inducing vomiting when poisons are detected, and for resolving conflicts between vision and balance. When feeling motion but not seeing it (for example, in a ship with no windows), the inner ear transmits to the brain that it senses motion, but the eyes tell the brain that everything is still. As a result of the discordance, the brain will {{come to the conclusion that}} the individual is hallucinating and further conclude that the hallucination is due to poison ingestion. The brain responds by inducing vomiting, to clear the supposed toxin. Treisman's indirect argument has recently been questioned via an alternative direct evolutionary hypothesis, as well as modified and extended via a direct poison hypothesis. The direct evolutionary hypothesis essentially argues that there are plausible means by which ancient real or apparent motion could have contributed directly to the evolution of aversive reactions, without the need for the co-opting of a poison response as posited by Treisman. Nevertheless, the direct poison hypothesis argues that <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> plausible ways in which the body's poison response system may have played a role in shaping the evolution of some of the signature symptoms that characterize motion sickness.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} crossover episode with the CBS show Picket Fences, which was set in another town in Wisconsin. David E. Kelley, the series creator of Picket Fences, and Chris Carter, the series creator of The X-Files, were talking in a parking lot and thought it might be interesting to have Mulder and Scully visit Rome, Wisconsin for an X-Files episode. Unlike a traditional crossover, the two shows would be shot with different viewpoints and one would be aired as an X-Files episode and the other as an episode of Picket Fences. Ultimately, CBS decided against the crossover and both episodes created ended up becoming stand-alones. Executive producer Robert Goodwin said of the experience [...] "I spent days on the phone with a producer of Picket Fences. We spent days organizing our schedules. Then at the very last minute, of course, we found out that no one had told CBS, and they said 'Forget it. We're having enough trouble on Friday nights without publicizing The X-Files.' It's too bad." [...] The Picket Fences episode intended {{to be part of the}} crossover was called [...] "Away in the Manger" [...] and aired the week following [...] "Red Museum." [...] While every reference to Picket Fences has been purged from the X-Files episode, <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> some small winks left in the Picket Fences episode referring to the happenings at the X-Files, including a mention of Dr. Larson.

2500|$|Many {{different}} fibers are twisted, knotted and {{woven into}} textiles and objects. [...] Materials include rushes, reeds, thread, plastic string and rope {{as well as}} many more. Historically, fibers were dyed using pigments created from plants and animals. Synthetic dyes have replaced natural ones for many craftspeople, but <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> some, especially in Oaxaca state that still use traditional dyes. Woven materials in Mexico started with basketry and mat-making. The agave plant was an important source of fibers and thread and is still used to day for thread and paper. Cotton was also used, spun into thread by itself or combined with feathers or animal fur to provide warmth. Very traditional Mexican women still spin their own thread, which are made from cotton or wool and can be very fine or very coarse. Textiles have long history of tradition. Brightly colored embroidered designs on female garments can identify tribe, age, and marital status of the wearer. [...] Woven textiles were known to pre-Hispanic cultures for hundreds of years before the arrival of the Spanish, using a back-strap loom fastened between a tree and the weaver’s back. The Spanish introduced the treadle loom, which can make larger pieces of cloth.|$|E
2500|$|Basque {{surnames}} usually {{denote the}} patronymic {{house of the}} bearer; e.g. Etxebarria – [...] "new house", from etxe (house) + barri (new), denotes [...] "related to a so-named farmhouse"; in the same way, Garaikoetxea – [...] "house in the heights", garai ("height") + etxe ("house"). Sometimes, surnames denote not the house itself but a characteristic of the place, e.g. Saratxaga – [...] "willow-place", from saratze ("willow") + -aga ("place of"); Loyola, from loi ("mud") + ola ("iron smithery"); Arriortua – [...] "stone orchard", from harri ("stone") + ortua ("orchard"). Before the 20th century all Basque men were considered nobles (indeed, some Basque surnames, e.g. Irujo or Medoza, were related {{to some of the}} oldest Spanish noble families), and many of them used their status to emigrate with privileges to other regions of the Spanish Empire, especially the Americas, due to which some Basque surnames became common to the Spanish-American world; e.g. Mendoza – [...] "cold mountain", from mendi ("mountain" [...] + hotza ("cold"); Salazar – [...] "Old hall", from sala ("hall") + zahar ("old"). Until 1978, Spanish was the single official language of the Spanish civil registries and Basque surnames had to be registered according to the Spanish phonetical rules (for example, the Spanish [...] "ch" [...] sound merges the Basque [...] "ts", [...] "tx", and [...] "tz", and someone whose surname in Standard Basque would be [...] "Krutxaga" [...] would have to write it as [...] "Cruchaga", letter [...] "k" [...] also not being used in Spanish). Although the democratic restoration ended this policy, allowing surnames to be officially changed into their Basque phonology, <b>there</b> <b>still</b> <b>are</b> many people who hold Spanish-written Basque surnames, even in the same family: a father born before 1978 would be surnamed [...] "Echepare" [...] and his children, [...] "Etxepare". This policy even changed the usual pronunciation of some Basque surnames. For instance, in Basque, the letter [...] "z" [...] maintained a sibilant [...] "s"-like sound, while Spanish changed it; thus, a surname such as [...] "Zabala" [...] should be properly read similar to [...] "sabala" [...] (...) , although in Spanish, because the [...] "z" [...] denotes a [...] "th" [...] sound (...) , it would be read as [...] "Tha-bala" [...] (...) [...] However, since the letter [...] "z" [...] exists in Spanish, the registries did not force the Zabalas to transliterate their surname.|$|E
