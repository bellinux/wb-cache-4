5|$|Quantum Reality is a 1985 popular science book by {{physicist}} Nick Herbert, {{a member}} the Fundamental Fysiks Group which {{was formed to}} explore the philosophical implications of quantum theory. The book attempts to address the ontology of quantum objects, their attributes, and their interactions, without reliance on advanced mathematical concepts. Herbert discusses the most common interpretations of quantum mechanics and <b>their</b> <b>consequences</b> in turn, highlighting the conceptual advantages and drawbacks of each.|$|E

5|$|Since a {{major cause}} of TBI are vehicle accidents, their {{prevention}} or the amelioration of <b>their</b> <b>consequences</b> can both reduce the incidence and gravity of TBI. In accidents, damage can be reduced by use of seat belts, child safety seats and motorcycle helmets, and presence of roll bars and airbags. Education programs exist to lower the number of crashes. In addition, changes to public policy and safety laws can be made; these include speed limits, seat belt and helmet laws, and road engineering practices.|$|E

5|$|Smedley Darlington Butler (July 30, 1881June 21, 1940) was a United States Marine Corps major general, {{the highest}} rank {{authorized}} at that time, {{and at the}} time of his death the most decorated Marine in U.S. history. During his 34-year career as a Marine, he participated in military actions in the Philippines, China, in Central America and the Caribbean during the Banana Wars, and France in World War I. Butler later became an outspoken critic of U.S. wars and <b>their</b> <b>consequences,</b> as well as exposing the Business Plot, an alleged plan to overthrow the U.S. government.|$|E
5|$|That evening Napoleon and {{the four}} merchants {{discussed}} the revolution, subsequent rebellions, and <b>their</b> <b>consequences.</b> Speaking as a pro-Republican, Napoleon supported the Jacobin cause, and explained {{the benefits of the}} revolution, whilst defending Carteaux's actions in Avignon. One of the merchants from Marseille expressed his moderate views regarding the revolution, and reasons for supporting civil war against a central government. The merchant stressed that Marseille did not fight for the Royalist cause, but opposed the nature of the Convention itself, condemning its decrees and deeming the execution of citizens as unlawful. Napoleon concluded that the people of Marseille should reject counter-revolutionary ideals and adopt the constitution of the French Republic in order to end the civil war and allow the regular army to restore France.|$|E

In {{the same year}} he introduced training in morse code for police officers, presaging the introduction of radio to the police force. In 1938, Leane {{was placed on the}} retired list of military officers, having reached 60 years of age. His service in the police was extended by an act of Parliament allowing him to serve until he was 65. Leane's continuing concern about traffic accidents and <b>their</b> <b>consequences</b> was highlighted by a map maintained in his office, on which all accidents were marked. In April 1939, with the danger of war in Europe, Leane {{became a member of the}} State Emergency Civil Defence Council, with responsibilities for internal security, protection of vulnerable points, control of the civil population, intelligence, detention of enemy civil aircraft, civil flying, and the air examination service.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of This World is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of This World has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of This World has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and <b>their</b> <b>consequences.</b> The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E

This study appears {{to be the first to}} provide experimental support suggesting that middle ear muscles (MEM) may behave abnormally after an acoustic shock. It is suggested that abnormal contractions (eg tonic contractions) of the tympanic tensor muscle may trigger neurogenic inflammation. Indeed, fibers with substances P and CGRP were found in close proximity.|$|E

25|$|Dudley Docker {{had joined}} the board in 1906 and was {{appointed}} deputy chairman of BSA in 1909. He had made a spectacular financial success of a merger of five large rolling-stock companies in 1902 and become {{the leader of the}} period's merger movement. Believing he could buy the missing management skills that could not be found within BSA, he started merger talks with The Daimler Company Limited of Coventry. Daimler and Rover were then the largest British car producers. Daimler was immensely profitable. After its capital reconstruction in 1904, Daimler's profits were 57% and 150% returns on invested capital in 1905 and 1906. The attraction for Daimler shareholders, was the apparent stability of BSA. So, in 1910, BSA purchased Daimler with BSA shares, but Docker, who negotiated the arrangements, either ignored or failed in his assessment of <b>their</b> <b>consequences</b> for the new combine. The combine was never adequately balanced or co-ordinated.|$|E
25|$|Decisions can be complex {{admixtures}} {{of facts}} and values. Information about facts, especially empirically-proven facts or facts derived from specialized experience, are more easily transmitted {{in the exercise of}} authority than are the expressions of values. Simon is primarily interested in seeking identification of the individual employee with the organizational goals and values. Following Lasswell, he states that “a person identifies himself with a group when, in making a decision, he evaluates the several alternatives of choice in terms of <b>their</b> <b>consequences</b> for the specified group”. A person may identify himself with any number of social, geographic, economic, racial, religious, familial, educational, gender, political, and sports groups. Indeed, the number and variety are unlimited. The fundamental problem for organizations is to recognize that personal and group identifications may either facilitate or obstruct correct decision making for the organization. A specific organization has to determine deliberately, and specify in appropriate detail and clear language, its own goals, objectives, means, ends, and values.|$|E

25|$|Nuclear safety {{covers the}} actions taken to prevent nuclear and {{radiation}} {{accidents and incidents}} or to limit <b>their</b> <b>consequences.</b> The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs {{but there is no}} guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly. Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake, despite multiple warnings by the NRG and the Japanese nuclear safety administration. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable. An interdisciplinary team from MIT has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005–2055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{decreasing}} {{rates in}} fertility and increasing life expectancy could have damaging consequences for almost every European nation. One consequence of ageing might be lower inflation rates as elderly {{people are more}} inflation averse and have sufficient political power for governments to care about their preferences. These demographic trends provoked debate over the best policies that can reverse these trends and lessen <b>their</b> <b>consequences.</b> RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states {{that there should be}} an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement of social policy in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends. The research intends {{to examine the relationship between}} demographic trends and European government policies and determine which policies can reduce the consequences of low fertility and population ageing.|$|E
