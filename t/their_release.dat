5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign {{the average length of}} detention was only two months. Prisoners would still be expected to sign a document on <b>their</b> <b>release,</b> promising not to talk about the Bastille or their time within it, but by the 1780s this agreement was frequently broken. Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on <b>their</b> <b>release</b> by the Crown, either as a form of compensation or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E

5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Berkman served as editor of Goldman's anarchist journal, Mother Earth, and later {{established}} his own journal, The Blast. In 1917, Berkman and Goldman were sentenced {{to two years in}} jail for conspiracy against the newly instated draft. After <b>their</b> <b>release</b> from prison, they were arrested—along with hundreds of others—and deported to Russia. Initially supportive of that country's Bolshevik revolution, Berkman and Goldman soon became disillusioned, voicing their opposition to the Soviet's use of terror after seizing power and their repression of fellow revolutionaries. In 1925, he published a book about his experiences, The Bolshevik Myth.|$|E

5|$|After <b>their</b> <b>release,</b> {{the journalists}} {{went to the}} US embassy in Saigon to {{complain}} about their treatment {{at the hands of}} Diệm's officials and asked for US government protection. Their appeals were dismissed, as was a direct appeal to the White House. Through the efforts of US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, the assault charges laid against the journalists were subsequently dropped. Vietnamese Buddhists reacted to the incident by contending that Diệm's men were planning to assassinate monks, while Madame Nhu repeated earlier claims that the US government had been trying to overthrow her brother-in-law.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of World War I in 1914, Dr. Robert Heindl of Germany had noted that the 15,000 political prisoners at the penal colony could create an undesirable revolution and therefore <b>their</b> <b>release</b> in one stage, following capture of the island by a German ship by bombardment, was risky. He suggested that after due care and adequate security had {{been put in place}} the convicts of the penal colony could be shifted to the mainland in small boats.|$|E

Guildford Dudley was executed in February 1554. The surviving brothers were released in the autumn; working for <b>their</b> <b>release,</b> their mother (who died in January 1555) and their brother-in-law, Henry Sidney, had befriended the incoming Spanish nobles around Philip of Spain, Mary's husband.|$|E

5|$|Most {{anthozoans}} are unisexual {{but some}} stony corals are hermaphrodite. The germ cells {{originate in the}} endoderm {{and move to the}} gastrodermis where they differentiate. When mature, they are liberated into the coelenteron and thence to the open sea, with fertilisation being external. To make fertilisation more likely, corals emit vast numbers of gametes, and many species synchronise <b>their</b> <b>release</b> in relation to the time of day and the phase of the moon.|$|E
