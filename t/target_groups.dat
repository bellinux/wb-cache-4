40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} how Huset KBH can communicate to exchange students in Copenhagen. The goal is to attract this <b>target</b> <b>group</b> {{to the events of}} the culture house. The event, Husets PULS 2013, is used as a case in this study. The quantitative method is used to gather information about the <b>target</b> <b>group’s</b> media- and culture habits. It is concluded that the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> do not know about Huset KBH. Furthermore the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> favours concerts, movies and theatre and it often uses Facebook, which is the <b>target</b> <b>group’s</b> preferred communication channel. The results are used in an analysis of the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> and {{on the basis of the}} analysis a facebook event is produced for the case, Husets PULS 2013. After evaluating the facebook event it is assessed as being insufficient regarding attracting the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> to Huset KBH. A SWOT-analysis is therefore composed. This contributes to identify Huset KBHs opportunities and threats. It is concluded that communicating successfully to the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> involves an interaction with different communication channels. The channels are among others the use of ambassadors, posters and Facebook. This papers outcome is a plan of action that Huset KBH from now on can pursue when communicating to the <b>target</b> <b>group...</b>|$|R

All four use speech presentations in connection with their work. Through <b>target</b> <b>group</b> analysis and observation, qualitative interviews and quantitative questionnaires are we able to identify our <b>target</b> <b>group’s</b> needs in speech communication. The <b>target</b> <b>group</b> analysis {{has made it possible}} for us to get a clear insight in their oral presentations and their strengths and weaknesses in their presentations. We focused on various rhetorical elements in our empirical study. However, we chose only to focus on the most central rhetorical elements such as body language, nervousness, speaking loudly and clearly and structuring presentations and time. Our <b>target</b> <b>group</b> was in general competent speakers, but they could advantageously improve their body language and speak more clearly and loudly...|$|R

To plan for public environments that enable mobility for everybody, knowledge about various user groups' mobility is important. Up until now, knowledge concerning the mobility of people with cognitive functional limitations has been scarce. The aim of this paper is to explore, from experts' perspectives, mobility in public environments among people with cognitive functional limitations (<b>target</b> <b>group).</b> The findings of focus group interviews with experts showed that the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> had to keep external and internal challenges at a manageable level in order to maintain mobility. The <b>target</b> <b>group's</b> mobility is interpreted as depending on both the individuals' cognitive capacity in relation to environmental demands as well as the motility of the members of the <b>target</b> <b>group,</b> i. e. how they form their opinions about their possibilities for mobility. Both those aspects are important for planners to consider in order keep the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> mobile...|$|R
40|$|The central {{question}} {{in this study}} is whether the language and math delays of the different socio-economic and ethnic minority <b>groups</b> <b>targeted</b> by Dutch educational disadvantage policy have diminished or not. Data are from the years 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2008. Information from a total of 90, 000 pupils in Grades 2 and 8 was selected to represent the start and end points of primary education. The conclusion is that large differences exist between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged pupils at the start of primary school. Minority <b>target</b> <b>group</b> pupils have a substantial language delay. In the last year of primary school, this delay has diminished somewhat but it is still substantial. In the period 1995 - 2008 the delays of the minority <b>target</b> <b>group</b> pupils have declined by more than 40 %. Part of the non-minority <b>target</b> <b>group</b> pupils also made gains, but these are less than those observed for the minority <b>target</b> <b>group</b> pupils.

500|$|The {{most common}} natural {{predator}} of sperm whales is the orca, but pilot whales and false killer whales sometimes harass them. Orcas prey on <b>target</b> <b>groups</b> of females with young, usually {{making an effort}} to extract and kill a calf. The adults will protect their calves or an injured adult by encircling them. [...] They may face inwards with their tails out (the 'marguerite formation', named after the flower). The heavy and powerful tail of an adult whale can deliver lethal blows. Alternatively, they may face outwards (the 'heads-out formation'). Other than sperm whales, southern right whales had been observed to perform similar formations. However, formations in non dangerous situations have been recorded as well. Early whalers exploited this behaviour, attracting a whole unit by injuring one of its members. If the orca pod is extremely large, its members may sometimes be able to kill adult female sperm whales. Solitary mature males are known to interfere and {{come to the aid of}} vulnerable groups nearby. Individual large mature male sperm whales have no non-human predators, and are believed to be too large, powerful and aggressive to be threatened by orcas. In addition, male sperm whales have been observed to attack and intimidate orca pods. An incident was filmed from a long-line trawler: an orca pod was systematically taking fish caught on the trawler's long lines (as the lines were being pulled into the ship) when a male sperm whale appeared to repeatedly charge the orca pod in an attempt to drive them away; it was speculated by the film crew that the sperm whale was attempting to access the same fish. The orcas employed a tail outward and tail slapping defensive position against the bull sperm whale similar to that used by female sperm whales against attacking orcas.|$|E
