5|$|James Maurice Kilburn (8 July 1909 – 28 August 1993) was a British sports {{journalist}} who {{wrote for the}} Yorkshire Post between 1934 and 1976. Well-regarded for the style of his writing and his refusal to write about off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did <b>they</b> <b>value</b> his impact.|$|E

Taking a different route, they find Sir Henry's brother stranded in an oasis by a broken leg, unable to go forward or back. They return to Durban and eventually to England, wealthy enough to live comfortable lives.|$|E

25|$|People with BPD {{can be very}} {{sensitive}} to the way others treat them, by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness, and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness. Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment, a threat of losing someone, or a perceived loss of esteem {{in the eyes of}} someone <b>they</b> <b>value.</b> This phenomenon, sometimes called splitting, includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them. Combined with mood disturbances, idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family, friends, and co-workers. Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy.|$|E
25|$|Third, Searle {{argues that}} much of {{rational}} deliberation involves adjusting our (often inconsistent) patterns of desires to decide between outcomes, {{not the other way}} around. While in the Classical Model, one would start from a desire to go to Paris greater than that of saving money and calculate the cheapest way to get there, in reality people balance the niceness of Paris against the costs of travel to decide which desire (visiting Paris or saving money) <b>they</b> <b>value</b> more. Hence, he believes rationality is not a system of rules, but more of an adverb. We see certain behavior as rational, no matter what its source, and our system of rules derives from finding patterns in what we see as rational.|$|E
25|$|User {{privacy in}} China {{is not as}} cut-and-dry {{as it is in}} other parts of the world. China, reportedly, has a much more {{invasive}} policy when Internet activity involves the Chinese government. For this reason, search engines are under constant pressure to conform to Chinese rules and regulations on censorship while still attempting to keep their integrity. Therefore, most search engines operate differently in China than in the other countries, such as the US or Britain, if they operate in China at all. There are two types of intrusions that occur in China regarding the internet: the alleged intrusion of the company providing users with Internet service, and the alleged intrusion of the Chinese government. The intrusion allegations made against companies providing users with Internet service are based upon reports that companies, such as Yahoo! in the previous example, are using their access to the internet users' private information to track and monitor users' Internet activity. The claims made against the Chinese government lies in the fact that the government is forcing Internet-based companies to track users private online data without the user knowing that they are being monitored. Both alleged intrusions are relatively harsh and possibly force foreign Internet service providers to decide if <b>they</b> <b>value</b> the Chinese market over internet privacy. Also, many websites are blocked in China such as Facebook and Twitter. However many Chinese internet users use special methods like a VPN to unblock websites that are blocked.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} social {{effects of}} incentivizing people in teams. In two field experiments featuring exogenous team formation {{and opportunities for}} repeated social interactions, we find large team effects that operate through social channels.

We conclude that social effects of monetary team incentives exist and can induce effort at lower cost than through direct individual payment. ...|$|R
25|$|Professor Katarina Sjöberg {{argues in}} The Wall Street Culture {{that within the}} media {{negative}} images of Wall Street are painted {{in terms of the}} district's market falls, money losses and deceitful gains. However, this is not what Wall Street investors are bothered by. Instead, it is the public's words and opinions which they feel mold their image. Sjöberg notes that in the American culture, money making is of utmost importance and knowing how to make money is considered to be respectable. Therefore, Wall Street investors prioritize their work as well as strive to climb the corporate ladder. They also feel obligated to maintain the image the public creates, because it strengthens their position as a Wall Street employee. <b>They</b> <b>value</b> seeing themselves as experts in their field, especially since they live in a society that values wealth. This justifies their acts of greed, and allows them to take part in activities often deemed as criminal because they feel as though it is expected. Moreover, they do not regret their actions because to them, it is part of being an American. Aside from living up to the public's image, Wall Street workers justify their high salaries with an argument pointed out by Karen Ho in Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis, the Downsizing of Corporate America. She argues that {{due to the fact that}} the financial market is volatile in conjunction with the existence of job insecurity, Wall Street workers are compensated through their salaries.|$|E

We redesigned these computers {{from the ground up}} with the features customers have told us <b>they</b> <b>value</b> most." [...] Apple's new pricing strategy caused concern among investors, who thought it would reduce profit margins. Brodie Keast, an Apple product marketing manager, said, [...] "We are prepared {{to do whatever it takes}} to reach more people with Macintosh.... The plan is to get as aggressive on price as we need to be." [...] After the release of the Classic, Apple's share price closed at $27.75 per share, down 50cents from October 12, 1990, and far below its previous 12-month high of $50.37.|$|E

500|$|Through the {{depiction}} of the polytheism of Ansul, Le Guin suggests that their beliefs make them more tolerant of religious difference. The Alds refer {{to those who do}} not believe in their god as heathens. Memer, however, thinks to herself that [...] "If [...] meant anything, it meant people who don’t know what’s sacred. Are there any such people? 'Heathen' is merely a word for somebody who knows a different sacredness than you know." [...] Literature scholar Elizabeth Anderson argues that Le Guin's critique is directed more at religious fundamentalism than at monotheism. The Alds' beliefs are more complex than Memer believes: while they despise writing, <b>they</b> <b>value</b> poetry and spoken words, and are moved by Orrec's recitations. While Le Guin criticizes the violence of the Alds, she also depicts the failed violent uprising in a negative light. A diplomatic settlement is ultimately what ends the conflict, though Memer acknowledges her unsatisfied desire for revenge as Iddor and his followers are escorted out of Ansul to be tried for treason.|$|E
500|$|Literary critic Richard Erlich {{wrote in}} 2006 that the {{depiction}} of the religious cult of Bliss was influenced by Le Guin's interest in Taoist thought, and an example of Le Guin's critique of Christianity. The angels use of the phrase [...] "the planetary hypothesis" [...] to refer to their terrestrial origin was a gentle dig at Christian fundamentalism in the United States, with its insistence that evolution is [...] "merely a theory." [...] The story also refers {{to the success of}} Christian fundamentalists in taking over school boards in the US. A more direct criticism of Christianity comes in Le Guin's depiction of the cult of Bliss being disrespectful of women, as well as of believing in a nuclear, patriarchal family. Bliss is portrayed as a closed system; members reinforce manipulate the ship's data banks to remove references to Earth and their destination, because <b>they</b> <b>value</b> stability {{even to the point of}} denying some of their own knowledge. A reference to Christianity is also present in Le Guin's word to describe activity outside the ship: the real-world term [...] "extravehicular activity" [...] or EVA is used as a single word [...] "Eva," [...] in reference to the biblical [...] "Eve": angels in the story see going outside the ship as an act of transgression associated with death.|$|E
500|$|The series {{begins by}} {{introducing}} childhood friends with quite {{a strong and}} close friendship: , a young archaeologist who is investigating a ruin within the Kingdom of Clow, and , princess of the Kingdom of Clow and daughter of the late king [...] When Sakura visits Syaoran in the ruins, her spirit takes on {{the form of a}} pair of ghostly feathered wings that disintegrate to other dimensions. As she descends into a catatonic near death state, Syaoran meets the Dimensional Witch, Yūko Ichihara, to whom he begs for help to save Sakura. Yūko is also visited by two others who each have their own wish: , a ninja who wishes to return to his home world after being banished from his world by [...] to allow him to learn what true strength is; and Fai D. Flowright, a magician who wishes to never return to his home world, Celes, to avoid his king, [...] In exchange for the ability to travel across dimensions, Yūko demands that each pay with that <b>they</b> <b>value</b> most: Kurogane offers his sword Ginryū; Fai offers the tattoo that suppresses his enormous magical strength and power; and Syaoran offers all of Sakura's memories that involve him. Yūko then presents them with a creature named Mokona Modoki that sends the group on a journey across dimensions in search of Sakura's feathers. After obtaining the first feathers, Sakura awakens from her catatonic state and starts recovering her memories. During their adventures, the group gradually grows closer to the point that Fai jokingly labels them as relatives. As they travel, they learn that the feathers have their own unique abilities and can bestow several supernatural abilities to those who possess them.|$|E

2500|$|People with BPD tend to {{have trouble}} seeing {{a clear picture of}} their identity.

This difficulty with knowing who they are and what <b>they</b> <b>value</b> can cause people with BPD to experience feeling [...] "empty" [...] and [...] "lost".|$|E

2500|$|The USA-born British {{economist}} Edith Penrose has {{highlighted the}} collective nature of entrepreneurship.

[...] The sociologist Paul DiMaggio (1988:14) has expanded this view to say that [...] "new institutions arise when organized actors with sufficient resources [...] see in them an opportunity to realize interests that <b>they</b> <b>value</b> highly".

2500|$|One {{facet of}} intertemporal choice is the {{possibility}} for preference reversal, when a tempting reward becomes more highly valued than abstaining only when immediately available. [...] For example, when sitting home alone, a person may report that <b>they</b> <b>value</b> the health benefit of not smoking a cigarette over the effect of smoking one. [...] However, later at night when the cigarette is immediately available, their subjective value of the cigarette may rise and they may choose to smoke it.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the late}} 1990s, {{scientific}} understanding, precision and technology became characteristic of modern cuisine, in so-called [...] "molecular gastronomy".

In it they emphasize that openness to novel techniques and ingredients {{can be used as}} a means to achieve excellent dishes, but <b>they</b> <b>value</b> tradition. Novel techniques and ingredients should only be used when they contribute to a dish. For example liquid nitrogen should not be used for the sake of novelty. And that progress can come from collaboration, for example with chemists and psychologists.|$|E
2500|$|Relational transgressions {{are a part}} of any relationship. [...] In each instance, {{partners}} must {{weigh the}} severity of the transgression against how much <b>they</b> <b>value</b> the relationship. [...] In some cases, trust can be so severely damaged that repair strategies are fruitless. [...] With each transgression both transgressor and victim assume risks. [...] The transgressor’s efforts at reconciliation may be rejected by the victim, which results in loss of face and potentially an avenue of attack by the victim. [...] If the victim offers forgiveness, there is risk that the transgressor may view the forgiveness as a personality trait that may prompt future transgressions (e.g., “I’ll be forgiven by my partner just like every other time”).|$|E
