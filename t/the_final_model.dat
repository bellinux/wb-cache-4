25|$|The ERCO Ercoupe is a low-wing {{monoplane}} {{aircraft that}} was designed and built in the United States. It was first manufactured by the Engineering and Research Corporation (ERCO) shortly before World War II; several other manufacturers continued its production after the war. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>model,</b> the Mooney M-10, first flew in 1968 and the last model year was 1970.

25|$|The {{homology}} modeling procedure can {{be broken}} down into four sequential steps: template selection, target-template alignment, model construction, and model assessment. The first two steps are often essentially performed together, as the most common methods of identifying templates rely on the production of sequence alignments; however, these alignments may not be of sufficient quality because database search techniques prioritize speed over alignment quality. These processes can be performed iteratively {{to improve the quality of}} <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>model,</b> although quality assessments that are not dependent on the true target structure are still under development process.|$|E

The total amount of variance {{accounted for by the}} multiple regression model of stand density was markedly lower at 0.55. The RMSE of <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>models</b> was relatively low for all variables apart from stand density. Values of RMSE for <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>models</b> of mean top height, green crown height, stem volume, mean diameter, basal area and stand density were, respectively, 1.02  m, 0.427  m, 20.2  m 3  ha- 1, 13.9  mm, 3.81  m 2 and 355 stems ha- 1. All variables included within the six models were highly significant (Table  4). The highest variance inflation factor in for any of the terms in the multiple regression model was 1.97 indicating that multicollinearity was well within acceptable limits.|$|R
25|$|The most {{prolific}} and enduring of the Fairey IIIs was <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>model,</b> the IIIF, {{which was designed}} to meet Air Ministry Specification 19/24 for a three-seat spotter/reconnaissance aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm and a two-seat general purpose aircraft for the Royal Air Force.

25|$|DmC is {{the first}} Ninja Theory game written by Tameem Antoniades. Dante's design was {{originally}} meant {{to be similar to}} the ones from previous games, but Capcom told the Ninja Theory staff it had to be completely different to appeal to a younger demographic. While the original Dante was design from a Japanese perspective, the new one was made from a Western perspective. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>model</b> was inspired by Christopher Nolan's film The Dark Knight as Tameem Antoniades from Ninja Theory commented they wished to make the character realistic. In an interview published by Official Xbox Magazine Jones explained that he has received numerous death threats in the form of comic books and a metal song due to the controversial decision to reboot the series. Antoniades responded to criticism stating they would not change the design as the character is supposed to fit within the game's setting. Antoniades stated that the gameplay would be similar to previous Devil May Cry games. In November 2011, an extended trailer and new concept art was released. In May 2012, Capcom announced they expect the game to ship 2 million copies by the ending of this fiscal year without giving yet a proper release date. The music for the game was composed by electronic groups Noisia and Combichrist. A playable demo was released on 20 November 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of V'Ger caused {{problems for the}} entire production. The crew was dissatisfied with the original four-foot clay model created by the Abel group, which looked like a modernized Nemo's Nautilus submarine. Industrial designer Syd Mead was hired to visualize {{a new version of}} the mammoth craft. Mead created a machine that contained organic elements based on input from Wise, Roddenberry, and the effects leads. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>model</b> was [...] long, built from the rear forward so that the camera crews could shoot footage while the next sections were still being fabricated. The model was built out of a plethora of materials—wood, foam, macramé, Styrofoam cups, incandescent, neon and strobe lights.|$|E
30|$|For <b>the</b> <b>final</b> Singaporean <b>model,</b> {{mathematics}} self-efficacy, instrumental motivation, {{and mathematics}} anxiety remained having significant effects on mathematics performance. Intrinsic motivation had negative and {{significant effect on}} mathematics performance with one standard deviation increase in intrinsic motivation associated with a decrease in mathematics performance of about 22 points. Different from <b>the</b> Malaysian <b>final</b> <b>model,</b> ESCS mean at the school level did not have significant effect on mathematics performance in <b>the</b> <b>final</b> Singaporean <b>model.</b> As such, {{it is expected that}} the between-school variance and within-school variance in Model 3 were not much different from <b>Model</b> 2. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> Singaporean <b>model</b> explained about 63 and 34  % of between-school and within-school variance, respectively. Overall, both <b>the</b> <b>final</b> Malaysian and Singaporean models contributed about 43  % of total variance explained on mathematics performance.|$|R
30|$|All {{strategies}} for the proposed method demonstrate better predictions than both the initial models and ensemble-based methods (Fig.  12 d–f). In the case of WWCT, the strategies 1 and 2 still have wide uncertainty ranges, even though the average can predict water breakthrough time and overall tendency properly. However, the predictions of <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>models</b> from <b>the</b> strategy 3 converged to the true productions with narrow bands. Also, they form a band of predictions without ensemble collapse problem, which all models become almost same after history matching. It is a natural result because <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>models</b> of <b>the</b> strategy 3 in Fig.  11 b look similar to the reference field.|$|R
30|$|The {{performances}} of the production wells are predicted from the updated models using the ensemble-based methods and <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>models</b> using <b>the</b> proposed method. WWCTs of the updated models from the ES and EnKF cannot mimic a sharp increase after water breakthrough due to a Gaussian distribution. Even if the ensemble-based methods {{take a long time}} for history matching, the predictions may lead to erroneous decisions because they give even worse predictions than the ones from initial models, which use static data only. However, <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>models</b> from <b>the</b> proposed method can provide reliable predictions with reduced uncertainty for both the existing production wells and the newly drilled production well.|$|R
500|$|In the {{foreword}} for {{a collection}} titled The Art of Halo, Bungie founder Jason Jones noted that bringing together {{the elements of}} a video game is unmistakably [...] "art". However, Jones also noted that the character designers and artists had to make a [...] "living, breathing world" [...] and populate it with interesting characters and places. The game's development which spanned four years brought numerous evolutions and revisions to the character's designs and personalities. Characters were also updated {{to take full advantage of}} new graphics technologies; for instance, the Master Chief's armor was redesigned in a lengthy conceptual process and <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>model</b> was bump mapped. Each video game offered opportunities to refine the character's appearances and design.|$|E
500|$|Four {{different}} self-propelled anti-aircraft {{vehicles were}} {{built on the}} Panzer IV hull. The Flakpanzer IV Möbelwagen was armed with a [...] anti-aircraft cannon; 240 were built between 1944 and 1945. In late 1944 a new Flakpanzer, the Wirbelwind ("Whirlwind"), was designed, with enough armor to protect the gun's crew and a rotating turret, armed with the quadruple 20mm Flakvierling anti-aircraft cannon system; at least 100 were manufactured. Sixty-five similar vehicles were built, named Ostwind ("East wind"), but with a single [...] anti-aircraft cannon instead. This vehicle was designed to replace the Wirbelwind. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>model</b> was the Flakpanzer IV Kugelblitz, of which only five pilot vehicles were built. This vehicle featured an enclosed turret armed with twin [...] Rheinmetall-Borsig MK 103 aircraft autocannon.|$|E
500|$|Matt Norris of Cinema Blend {{stated that}} most of the events portrayed in the episode were unexpected, {{including}} Dualla's suicide, Starbuck finding her own supposed body, discovering the thirteenth tribe were Cylons, and that Ellen Tigh is <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>model,</b> but still thought the episode was among the top five Battlestar Galactica episodes in its run. Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly stated that a lot had been going on in the episode, but criticised the writers' decision of having Ellen as the fifth Cylon. While Dualla's suicide was surprising for Bernardin, he was critical about the Adama scene after her suicide, stating it as [...] "some of Olmos' worst acting in the series", and that the answered questions for the episode raised more questions, but felt the episode was good overall. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger commented: [...] "What really grabs me about the show (as I discussed in today's column) is its humanity, the way its characters react to situations the way you imagine real, contemporary people might" [...] and felt that [...] "as the stakes for the characters has risen, so has the intensity of [...] performances," [...] with even the extras in character. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune praised Nankin's directing, particularly [...] "the moment in which we see Kara Thrace, silhouetted in black against a dark blue sky, preparing to burn “her” body—that’s sent a shiver down my spine. That was just such a beautifully operatic image, spot-on in tone and perfectly executed." ...|$|E
30|$|Finally, the TI 1 (the true TI) generates 200 {{new models}} {{with the soft}} data from the second {{iteration}} (Fig.  16 c) for the third iteration. The qualified models at the third iteration in Fig.  16 f originated from the TI 1, of course. As TI converges, the iteration can be stopped and the qualified <b>models</b> become <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>models.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>models</b> in Fig.  16 f are compared with the qualified models from the initial stage in Fig.  16 e, facies distribution has converged to have a specific tendency. It is a natural result because the soft data are assimilated by dynamic data and are integrated with static data given. Therefore, the mean of <b>the</b> <b>final</b> log-permeability <b>models</b> is quite similar to the true field (Fig.  14 e), and its histogram can preserve a bimodal distribution of the channelized reservoirs (Fig.  15 e).|$|R
