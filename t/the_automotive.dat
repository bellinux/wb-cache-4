5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. <b>The</b> <b>Automotive</b> Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E
40|$|In this master thesis it is {{analyzed}} how <b>the</b> Swedish <b>automotive</b> cluster will {{be affected}} by foreign acquisitions {{at the end of the}} value chain. This is a relevant topic as <b>the</b> Swedish <b>automotive</b> industry is a very important industry in Sweden. It is of interest to evaluate how the recent shifts of ownership for <b>the</b> Swedish <b>automotive</b> manufacturers will affect <b>the</b> Swedish <b>automotive</b> cluster as a whole. It is also relevant from a theoretical point of view and this thesis draws on the extensive knowledge about agglomeration and industry clusters. Further, it also exploits the national competitive advantages and selected disadvantages that can affect a national industry cluster. Based on relevant theories, a research model is selected which combines Sweden’s competitive advantages, <b>the</b> Swedish <b>automotive</b> cluster’s dynamism and its development stage into a framework which allows for conclusions about how foreign acquisitions are likely to affect <b>the</b> Swedish <b>automotive</b> cluster. By applying the research model it is shown that <b>the</b> Swedish <b>automotive</b> cluster is a dynamic and mature cluster and that this indicates that the affects of foreign ownership is believed to be positive. The foreign investments show that <b>the</b> Swedish <b>automotive</b> cluster is an attractive cluster that foreign companies want to tap into or invest in. Risks with foreign ownership in industry clusters are also pointed out based on a case study of the Swedish pharmaceutical cluster. The thesis research is mainly based on a phenomenological philosophy and the research purpose is mainly exploratory although some parts are descriptive and explanatory. The method used is qualitative but some quantitative data is used to support relevant findings...|$|R
