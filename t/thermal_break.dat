50|$|The {{effect of}} using {{different}} <b>thermal</b> <b>breaks</b> {{can be observed}} here by comparing various Uw values obtained with different <b>thermal</b> <b>breaks</b> and systems. With outstanding <b>thermal</b> <b>breaks,</b> aluminium frames are able {{to be used for}} passive houses. The geometry and material of <b>thermal</b> <b>breaks</b> are aimed to decrease heat loss because of conduction, convection and radiation. Conduction is decreased by using materials with minimum lambda values and also using profiles with hollow chambers. Convection is decreased by using flags on insulation profiles. And radiation is decreased by using low-e folio (e.g. insulbar LEF) on these flags.|$|R

50|$|One {{method of}} {{reducing}} thermal bridge effects is {{the installation of}} an insulation board (e.g. foam board EPS XPS, wood fibre board, etc.) over the exterior outside wall. Another method is using insulated lumber framing for a <b>thermal</b> <b>break</b> inside the wall.|$|E
5000|$|Foil-faced polystyrene. This laminated, {{high density}} EPS is more {{flexible}} than rigid panels, {{works as a}} vapor barrier, and works as a <b>thermal</b> <b>break.</b> Uses include the underside of roof sheathing, ceilings, and on walls.

50|$|Anyway, the {{insulation}} provided by {{double or triple}} glazing falls very short of the best. We need to further improve its performance, which {{can be done by}} selecting windows with low-e coatings, <b>thermal</b> <b>breaks</b> and argon or other similar gas between the panes; and also by selecting windows with high energy-efficient frames.|$|R

40|$|We study a cold atom-molecule {{mixture in}} {{two-dimensional}} optical lattices, in which fermionic atoms have a Dirac-type dispersion. We show that by fine-tuning the atomic and molecular interactions, such mixtures can simulate Wess-Zumino supersymmetry (SUSY) model, {{the first example}} of SUSY theories. At zero temperature, SUSY is not spontaneously broken for this simplest SUSY model, which implies identical relativistic dispersions of the atom and its superpartner, bosonic diatom molecule. This defining signature of SUSY can be probed by single particle spectroscopies. <b>Thermal</b> <b>breaking</b> of SUSY at finite temperature {{is accompanied by a}} thermal Goldstone fermion, i. e., phonino excitation.

50|$|To {{reduce heat}} flow and the U-factor, metal frames {{should have an}} {{insulating}} plastic profile placed between the {{inside and outside of}} the frame and sash. These profiles are called also <b>thermal</b> <b>break</b> and they are made from glass fibre reinforced polyamide 66. The glass fibre proportion is 25 %. The material used for this insulating bar stands out for its low thermal conductivity value = 0.30 W/mK and its good mechanical properties - even at higher temperatures.|$|E
50|$|Reflective thermal {{insulation}} is typically fabricated from aluminum foil {{with a variety}} of core materials such as low-density polyethylene foam, polyethylene bubbles, fiberglass, or similar materials. Each core material presents its own set of benefits and drawbacks based on its ability to provide a <b>thermal</b> <b>break,</b> deaden sound, absorb moisture, and resist combustion during a fire. When aluminum foil is used as the facing material, reflective {{thermal insulation}} can stop 97% of radiant heat transfer. Recently, some reflective thermal insulation manufacturers have switched to a metalized polyethylene facing. The long-term efficiency and durability of such facings are still undetermined.|$|E
50|$|The {{success of}} the <b>thermal</b> <b>break</b> profile series led to the {{creation}} of NV Erap, Reynaers' own production company for the insulation of profiles.In 1982 Reynaers started its activities in Ireland, followed by Germany in 1983 with the creation of Dynal GmbH (parent Reynaers GmbH). In 1985, a subsidiary was created in France, and in 1989 the United Kingdom followed. Exceptional export results were crowned with an “Export Oscar” presented by the Belgian Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs. In the early 1990s, Reynaers headed east. After Poland, sales activities were launched in the Czech Republic, Hungary, the Baltic States, Romania, Russia and Ukraine.|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of the singularity that is formed in a relativistically large amplitude plasma wave close to the wave breaking limit is found by using a simple waterbag electron distribution function. The electron density distribution in the breaking wave has a typical “peakon” form. The maximum value of the electric ﬁeld in a <b>thermal</b> <b>breaking</b> plasma is obtained and compared to the cold plasma limit. The results of computer simulations for different initial electron distribution functions are {{in agreement with the}} theoretical conclusions. The after-wavebreak regime is then examined, and a semi-analytical model of the density evolution is constructed.

50|$|The {{widespread}} {{construction of}} UK conservatories {{came to a}} halt with the onset of World War II. While the advent of insulated glass in the 1950s and 1960s saw the development of simple sunroom structures, {{it was not until the}} 1970s that creative architects and builders began to recreate the Victorian styling of 19th-century English conservatories in smaller domestic versions using insulated glass. In contemporary construction, a conservatory differs from an orangery in having more than 75% of its roof surface made from glass. A conservatory by definition must have more than 50% of its wall surface glazed. Contemporary conservatories use a number of technologies to ensure glass is as energy efficient as possible, ensuring it lets in the maximum light possible while maintaining a steady temperature throughout summer and winter. Technologies include argon-impregnated glass, heat reflective film, thermal ribbons or <b>thermal</b> <b>breaks</b> - hollow sections of glass that intercept heat.|$|R
50|$|Relative {{to other}} {{building}} components, aluminum {{has a high}} heat transfer coefficient, meaning that aluminum {{is a very good}} conductor of heat. This translates into high heat loss through aluminum curtain wall mullions.There are several ways to compensate for this heat loss, the most common way being the addition of thermal breaks. Thermal breaks are barriers between exterior metal and interior metal, usually made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). These breaks provide a significant decrease in the thermal conductivity of the curtain wall. However, since the <b>thermal</b> <b>break</b> interrupts the aluminum mullion, the overall moment of inertia of the mullion is reduced and must be accounted for in the structural analysis of the system.|$|E
50|$|In 1965, Jan Reynaers {{created an}} {{aluminium}} construction company in Duffel, Belgium. He produced {{windows and doors}} using the Classic System, an aluminium system he had designed. This new system was easy to process, resulting in other aluminium joiners buying from him. In 1969, Reynaers Aluminium was converted into a public limited company. The company built a new plant at Oude Liersebaan 266 in Duffel. In the same year Jan Reynaers, together with the Dutchman Harry Siroo, founded Siral BV in Schijndel, Netherlands. The first steps outside Belgian borders were made. On 20 September 1973 Jan Reynaers died. His family took over the company, developing it into a successful organisation. In 1978, Reynaers started developing a <b>thermal</b> <b>break</b> profile series Thermo System.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCantilevered {{concrete}} balcony slab in high-rise {{residential buildings}} {{that create a}} thermal bridge is under scrutiny due to an increasing demand for energy efficient and thermally comfortable occupied spaces. In North America balcony slabs with <b>thermal</b> <b>breaks</b> are uncommon among the current residential stock. The investigation reported in this article focussed {{on the impact of}} an alternate slab design with a concrete curb that was successfully used in the past. The alternate design consisted of using an insulated concrete curb at the sliding balcony door. The thermal performance of this design was carried out using THERM. Comparison of the simulation results of the alternate design were done with simulation results using non-thermally broken conventional slab, and thermally broken slab with proprietary details. The results showed that measurable increase in surface temperatures are possible with the insulated curb design. The results of the current investigation provided a framework for practical procedure that can be incorporated for cantilevered concrete slabs for better energy efficiency and thermal comfort as compared to conventional construction practices and as an alternate to thermally broken slab design...|$|R
40|$|Thermal bridge” is a {{term used}} for {{structural}} or non-structural elements that have higher heat transfer than any other elements or spots in the building envelope, reducing {{the efficiency of the}} building thermal insulation. About 20 % of the heat occurs via such thermal bridges. <b>Thermal</b> insulations (<b>thermal</b> <b>breaks)</b> are used within a steel connection to mitigate the effect of thermal bridges. In this research, connections with steel fillers studied by Dusicka (2007) were simulated using the finite element (FE) program ABAQUS. The results from the FE model were validated with those from the experimental work done by Dusicka (2007) and showed very close behavior. After validating the numerical model, the steel fillers were replaced by alternative fillers with improved thermal properties as part of a parametric study. The main objective of this research is to prove the feasibility of using alternative fillers that have improved thermal properties for steel connections. This will provide structural engineers and architects with means to design buildings with improved thermal properties, hence advance their sustainability...|$|R

Thereby such building failures as thermal bridges were identified in the connection area between balcony and floor slab. The thermal behavior of a balcony board with integrated reinforced insulating elements is investigated by means of measurement as well as numerical analysis. For this reason a specimen consisting of an externally insulated brick wall {{and a part of}} a balcony is tested under a steady state temperature gradient of 34 °C in an impermeable box. In accordance with the normative requirements temperature sensors are placed on critical sites within the construction and on its surface, prior to the pouring of cement. At the same time numerical analysis was realized using Fluent ANSYS workbench. Measured and calculated results are compared and degree of <b>thermal</b> <b>break</b> efficiency is explored...|$|E
40|$|The recent {{effect of}} the new {{technical}} standards – D. M. 14 / 01 / 2008, {{has led to a}} significant revision of the Italian approach to its precast building systems. Even more significant is the revision of the concrete panels with <b>thermal</b> <b>break,</b> which are increasingly popular after the publication of the decrees D. Lgs. 192 / 05, D. Lgs. 311 / 06, D. P. R. 59 / 09. In this contex, Ruredil S. p. A. has developed and patented a construction system that uses a balanced net of carbon fiber as reinforcement of external slab, therefore achievable thinness, to the benefit of weight, of resulting seismic actions, of insulating capacity whith the same overall thickness of the panel. The inserts used for the realization of the <b>thermal</b> <b>break,</b> and then for the hanging and connecting the external brought slab by the inner layer structure, are of the type standard version, but it was necessary to resolve issues related to the connection of these inserts whith a small slab thickness. In the article the authors describe the system and the project, give an account of experiments carried out on the real panels, of techniques and production problems, of the tests performed on prototypes in the laboratoryof the Faculty of Architecture of the IUAV University in Venice, under the guard of professor Angelo Di Tommaso. Under the structural profile, the studied and performed panel consist of an internal inner layer, insulated by sintered expanded polystyrene, characterized by a very small thickness slab, armed with a balanced net of carbon fiber, and by a careful study {{in order to reduce the}} size of the structural ribs, made possible thanks to less weight of the article, up to halff that of traditional panels, also aimed to maximize the proportion of insulation in the total area of the panel; the brought slab, external to insulating layer which constitutes the <b>thermal</b> <b>break,</b> has the same caractheristics as that of the inner layer. The so realized panel results easily developing and allows major cost savings while maintaining all the characteristics of durability, carrying capacity, workability and finishing that characterize the concrete panels. Lightness, leading to a consequent reduction of the seismic actions, also allows for economies in the structures and foundations. The panel is also to have characteristics of eco-compatibility, as it involves a general reduction in use of equipment and a reduction of transport, with consequent reductions in energy consumption and atmospheric emissions associated with production of raw materials and components for transport...|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} chemistry, {{vitrification}} is characteristic for amorphous materials or disordered systems and occurs when bonding between elementary particles (atoms, molecules, forming blocks) becomes {{higher than a}} certain threshold value. <b>Thermal</b> fluctuations <b>break</b> the bonds; therefore, the lower the temperature, the higher the degree of connectivity. Because of that amorphous materials have a characteristic threshold temperature termed glass transition temperature (Tg): below Tg amorphous materials are glassy whereas above Tg they are molten.|$|R
40|$|Heat {{exchangers}} {{that include}} slotted fins (in contradistinction to continuous fins) have been invented. The slotting of the fins provides <b>thermal</b> <b>breaks</b> that reduce <b>thermal</b> conduction along flow paths (longitudinal thermal conduction), which reduces heat-transfer efficiency. By increasing the ratio between transverse thermal conduction (the desired heat-transfer conduction) and longitudinal thermal conduction, slotting of the fins can be exploited to (1) increase heat-transfer efficiency (thereby reducing operating cost) {{for a given}} heat-exchanger length or to (2) reduce the length (thereby reducing the weight and/or cost) of the heat exchanger needed to obtain a given heat transfer efficiency. By reducing {{the length of a}} heat exchanger, one can reduce the pressure drop associated with the flow through it. In a case in which slotting enables the use of fins with thermal conductivity greater than could otherwise be tolerated on the basis of longitudinal thermal conduction, one can exploit the conductivity to make the fins longer (in the transverse direction) than they otherwise could be, thereby making it possible to make a heat exchanger that contains fewer channels and therefore, that weighs less, contains fewer potential leak paths, and can be constructed from fewer parts and, hence, reduced cost...|$|R
