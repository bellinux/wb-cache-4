5|$|Tropical Depression Ten {{formed from}} the complex {{interaction}} between an upper-level low, a tropical wave that produced Tropical Storm Ingrid, and the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a cold front. By September17, the system produced widespread thunderstorm activity over The Bahamas and western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level {{low over the}} Florida Panhandle increased convection across the area, and on September18 the system began crossing Florida. Initially very disorganized, surface pressures gradually decreased across the region, with a weak low-pressure area developing on September19.|$|E

5|$|A warm {{seclusion}} is {{the mature}} {{phase of the}} extratropical cyclone lifecycle. This was conceptualized after the ERICA field experiment of the late 1980s, which produced observations of intense marine cyclones that indicated an anomalously warm low-level thermal structure, secluded (or surrounded) by a bent-back warm front and a coincident chevron-shaped band of intense surface winds. The Norwegian Cyclone Model, as developed by the Bergen School of Meteorology, largely observed cyclones at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> their lifecycle and used the term occlusion to identify the decaying stages.|$|E
5|$|John Henry Johnson (November 24, 1929 – June 3, 2011) was a {{gridiron}} football {{running back}} {{known for his}} excellence at the fullback position as both a runner and a blocker. His first professional stint was in Canada in the Western Interprovincial Football Union (WIFU) for one season with the Calgary Stampeders. He then played in the National Football League (NFL) for the San Francisco 49ers, Detroit Lions, and Pittsburgh Steelers before spending his final season in the American Football League (AFL) with the Houston Oilers.

The tornado path width was estimated to be approximately 1/8 to 1/4mile wide. Significant damage was reported at the Wauka Valley Farms facility. Hundreds of trees were uprooted, and two barns were completely destroyed. One structure sustained room damage and a number of trees and power lines were also down along Town Creek road. Overall, in excess of 200 trees were down in the southwest part of the county.|$|E

5|$|Through {{the first}} months of 1918, the {{composition}} of Battleship Division Nine changed to reflect the lessons learned from operating in a war zone with the Grand Fleet. It soon became apparent that with only four ships, the division could not maintain the level of preparedness required by the constant need to be ready to sail at limited notice. The inevitable result was machinery breakdowns that reduced the squadron to three ships, a development considered unacceptable given the Division's important position at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the battle line. The British—faced with the same problem—responded by allocating a spare battleship to each of their squadrons. In this way, each squadron always remained at full strength even when a ship was being repaired.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Ten was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that made landfall on the Florida Panhandle in September2007. The system {{developed as a}} subtropical depression on September21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave, the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a cold front, and an upper-level low. Initially containing a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over the center. Tracking northwestward, the depression moved ashore near Fort Walton Beach early on September22 and dissipated over southeastern Alabama shortly thereafter.|$|E
50|$|SPAs {{have not}} been shown to {{directly}} modify DNA or have activity other than direct blocking of other factors or processes. However, modifying agents can be bound to the <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the hairpin structure. The specific binding of the SPA to DNA allows for site-specific targeting of the conjugated modifying agent. SPAs have been paired with the DNA-alkylating moieties cyclopropylpyrroloindole and chlorambucil that were able to damage and crosslink SV40 DNA. This effect inhibited cell cycling and growth. Chlorambucil, a chemotherapeutic agent, was more effective when conjugated to an SPA than without.|$|R

Edge rolling will induce dog-bone, width loss and fish tail at head and <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> slabs in unsteady deformation zone. A 3 D elastic-plastic FEM model for roughing stage of continuous hot strip rolling was established and research on the influences of those technical parameters such as slab width, thickness and reduction of edging roll on unsteady deformation of metal was carried out. The research work provides a scientific basis for the optimization of edge rolling schedule...|$|R
5000|$|Express trains (also {{sometimes}} referred to as fast trains, though this is a relative term, usually meaning [...] "faster than some other trains on the line in question") are a form of rail service.

In some cases, trains run express where there is overlapping local train service available, and run local at the <b>tail</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the line, where there is no supplemental local service. During overnight hours, or other times where it is practical, express trains may become local, but still running to where an express train would terminate.|$|R
5|$|Despite its {{radical and}} unusual shape, the {{airframe}} was built along traditional lines. Except {{for the most}} highly stressed parts, the whole structure was manufactured from standard grades of light alloy. The airframe was broken down {{into a number of}} major assemblies: the centre section, a rectangular box containing the bomb-bay and engine bays bounded by the front and rear spars and the wing transport joints; the intakes and centre fuselage; the front fuselage, incorporating the pressure cabin; the nose; the outer wings; the leading edges; the wing trailing edge and <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the fuselage; the wings were not sealed and used directly as fuel tankage, but carried bladders for fuel in the void spaces of the wings; and there was a single swept tail fin with a single rudder on the trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, a new fastest lap of the track ever at 1:36.006. However, he also came under investigation of the stewards as he failed to obliged the rules set for turn 2, rejoining the track earlier than allowed after running wide. After being summoned to the stewards at the end of qualifying, he walked away with a reprimand, but was not penalised. Behind Rosberg in second place, the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen were third and fourth respectively. At the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the field, three pairs of cars were eliminated: both Sauber, Manor and Renault drivers missed Q2.|$|E
5|$|These {{events are}} at the <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused {{by the collapse of}} a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
