The process of stair negotiation is divided into three phases, then the locomotion and transformation rules for reconfigurable wheelchair are presented. After the parameters affecting <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> have been put forward, the static models for each phase of stair negotiation are established, as well as the optimization results. The Simulation shows the variation of <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> for each phase of stair negotiation. Eventually, the minimal <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> for each phase is obtained.

40|$|To {{meet the}} rapid {{increasing}} demand {{of the equipment}} assisting the disabled and the old, a novel style transmuting track wheelchair robot is developed. It has the characteristic that the <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> can be determined dynamically. Compared to traditional method that keeps <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> constantly, dynamically determining tension can reduce power consumption obviously. Based {{on the fact that}} modeling <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> is complex, a fuzzy logic decision making method is developed to estimate the proportion of various factors that have effect on <b>track</b> <b>tension.</b> Combining with least square method, we get <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> optimal estimation algorithm. Considering the low speed characteristic of the wheelchair as climbing stairs and the <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> got by estimation algorithm, the paper develops a statics model of the wheelchair for the starting stage of stair-climbing.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} an {{originally designed}} wheelchair robot. This robot {{is equipped with}} a novel type of Variable Geometry Single Tracked Mechanism (VGSTM) that can actively control the robot shape and the <b>track</b> <b>tension.</b> So it becomes possible to improve the obstacle clearing capability of the robot by adapting the robot shape for the obstacle. The <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> is closely related to the performance of this original wheelchair robot, so with the aim of stair-climbing, which is the most fundamental obstacle clearing performance of the wheelchair robot, the optimization model of the <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> is established based on the geometric model and the static model of the robot.

40|$|This report {{presents}} an independent thesis corresponding 15 hp and {{was carried out}} on Högskolan in Halmstad {{during the spring of}} 2014. The thesis is the final course which ends a three-year mechanical engineering program with focus on technical design. The thesis started in an operation which electricians are exposed to every day. The operation in question is cable laying or wiring. The tool they use is called a <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> and is a long and stiff wire, usually made out of nylon or fiberglass. The <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is fed through pipes in the walls and brings the desired cables with it on the way back. The problem shows up when the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is drawn back by the electrician. The stiffness in the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> causes it to tangle itself and that causes unnecessary irritation and a waste of time. The problem gave an electrician and a good friend an idea about a product that could solve the problem in an easy and functional way. The idea started as a simple idea {{and with the help of}} several different product development methods from a production-, construction-, and design point of view a special methodology was developed, perfectly customized for the thesis. Potential customer gave the verdicts and helped create the needs and requirements for the product. The product went through a big process with creating different concepts and a lot of time was spent in CATIA for the final creation. One of the great goals of the thesis was to create a functional prototype, something that has been achieved and is now ready to be tested in a real environment. ...|$|R

30|$|An {{additional}} mechanical {{mechanism for}} a passive parallelogram-based exoskeleton arm-support is presented. It consists of several levers and joints and an attached extension coil spring. The additional mechanism has two favourable features. On {{the one hand}} it exhibits an almost iso-elastic behaviour whereby the lifting force of the mechanism is constant for a wide working range. Secondly, {{the value of the}} supporting force can be varied by a simple linear movement of a supporting joint. Furthermore a standard <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> can be used to gain the desired behavior. The additional mechanism is a 4 -link mechanism affixed to one end of the spring within the parallelogram arm-support. It has several geometrical parameters which influence the overall behaviour. A standard optimisation routine with constraints on the parameters is used to find an optimal set of geometrical parameters. Based on the optimized geometrical parameters a prototype was constructed and tested. It is a lightweight wearable system, with a weight of 1.9 kg. Detailed experiments reveal a difference between measured and calculated forces. These variations can be explained by a 60  % higher pre load force of the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> and a geometrical offset in the construction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} prolong the life of steel worm pair used in <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> adjuster, a test method was {{designed}} to evaluate the effect of hardness on the fretting wear behavior of steel worm gear on a SRV oscillating friction and wear tester. Through this method the fretting wear behavior of 40 CrNiMoA steel- 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel with different hardness matching was studied under dry sliding condition at room temperature. The results show that in the steel worm gear pair composed of 40 CrNiMoA steel and 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel, the fretting wear volume loss of 40 CrNiMoA steel decreased {{and that of the}} 18 Cr 2 Ni 4 WA steel worm material increased with the hardness of 40 CrNiMoA steel increasing. When the hardness of 40 CrNiMoA steel is about HRC 49, fretting wear volumes of the worm specimen was equal to that of the worm wheel specimen. Based on the experimental results, reasonable hardness matching for prolonging the life of steel worm pair used in <b>track</b> <b>tension</b> adjuster was proposed...|$|R

A multibody cosimulation approach is used to investigate the effects of hydropneumatic parameters on the ride safety and aid with design optimization and tuning of the suspension system.
