5|$|National {{legislation}} {{requires that}} all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia {{are made in}} Croatian language or with appropriate translations either using dubbing or subtitling. In general, all foreign programming is subtitled, except for cartoons and narrated parts of documentaries and similar programmes. An attempt to change this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when a soap opera was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned. The legislation does not provide for mutually intelligible languages. That led to formal requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding language localisation of television programmes made in Serbian language. Ultimately, that issue was resolved through subtitling using <b>teletext</b> <b>service</b> normally used for closed captioning.|$|E
5|$|The Zagreb TV centre {{became a}} member of the Yugoslav Radio Television (JRT) (an {{umbrella}} organization of television stations in Yugoslavia), acting as Eurovision Technical Centre for the JRT. In 1972 Television Zagreb began broadcasting of its second channel, and switched to airing its programming in color in 1975. The third Television Zagreb channel was introduced in 1988, and <b>teletext</b> <b>service</b> was launched in 1990. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, Television Zagreb was renamed Croatian Radiotelevision (HRT) and it {{became a member}} of the European Broadcasting Union; however, HRT suffered significant war damage to its infrastructure as 80 percent of its transmitters and 30 relay stations were damaged, destroyed or occupied. In October 1999 all three nationwide HRT channels started broadcasting around the clock, but in 2002 the third HRT channel ceased operation. Nova TV, the first privately owned television station in Croatia, began operating in 2000. It was followed by another privately owned broadcaster, RTL Televizija, on 30 April 2004. Both Nova TV and RTL Televizija aired a single analog TV channel each.|$|E

25|$|United Kingdom: {{the founder}} of the world's first <b>teletext</b> <b>service,</b> the BBC which closed its Ceefax service in 2012 when Britain adopted a fully digital {{television}} broadcast system. Elsewhere in the country the full service is no longer carried on any digital television services, although many channels on Sky still broadcast teletext subtitles and may still have a small number of active pages. Teletext ended in each region after analogue broadcasts finished. See Digital switchover dates in the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|A {{portion of}} this {{interval}} available in analogue, known as the vertical blanking interval, {{can be used for}} older forms of analogue datacasting such as <b>Teletext</b> <b>services</b> (like Ceefax and subtitling in the UK).

25|$|It {{is closely}} linked to the PAL {{broadcast}} system used in Europe. Other teletext systems have been developed to work with the SECAM and NTSC systems, but teletext failed to gain widespread acceptance in North America and other areas where NTSC is used. In contrast, teletext is nearly ubiquitous across Europe as well as some other regions, with most major broadcasters providing a <b>teletext</b> <b>service.</b> Common teletext services include TV schedules, regularly updated current affairs and sport news, simple games (such as quizzes) and subtitles (or closed captioning).|$|E
25|$|The {{rapid rise}} of Sudoku in Britain from {{relative}} obscurity to a front-page feature in national newspapers attracted commentary {{in the media}} and parody (such as when The Guardian G2 section advertised itself as the first newspaper supplement with a Sudoku grid on every page). Recognizing the different psychological appeals of easy and difficult puzzles, The Times introduced both, side by side, on June 20, 2005. From July 2005, Channel 4 included a daily Sudoku game in their <b>teletext</b> <b>service.</b> On August 2, the BBC's program guide Radio Times featured a weekly Super Sudoku with a 16×16 grid.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, Tyne Tees {{began to}} develop {{separate}} services for the Northern and Southern halves of the region. From a small two-camera studio at Corporation House in the centre of Middlesbrough, Tyne Tees developed nightly opt-out news bulletins for Teesside, County Durham and North Yorkshire {{as part of the}} flagship magazine programme Northern Life. The company also pioneered non-news programming for the two sub-regions, including the nightly Epilogues, which ended a 29-year run in September 1988 when Tyne Tees commenced 24-hour broadcasting - a field which the station had previously experimented with when it ran an on-screen Jobfinder <b>teletext</b> <b>service</b> throughout the night.|$|E

25|$|The {{impetus for}} a more complex type of {{television}} remote control came in 1973, {{with the development of}} the Ceefax <b>teletext</b> <b>service</b> by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of teletext sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select teletext pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, colour intensity, etc. Early teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of the remote control required for teletext quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977–1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.|$|E

2500|$|For live programs, spoken words {{comprising}} the television program's soundtrack are transcribed by a human operator (a speech-to-text reporter) using stenotype or stenomask type of machines, whose phonetic output is instantly translated into text {{by a computer}} and displayed on the screen. This technique {{was developed in the}} 1970s as an initiative of the BBC's Ceefax <b>teletext</b> <b>service.</b> In collaboration with the BBC, a university student took on the research project of writing the first phonetics-to-text conversion program for this purpose. Sometimes, the captions of live broadcasts, like news bulletins, sports events, live entertainment shows, and other live shows, fall behind by a few seconds. This delay is because the machine does not know what the person is going to say next, so after the person on the show says the sentence, the captions appear. Automatic computer speech recognition now works well when trained to recognize a single voice, and so since 2003, the BBC does live subtitling by having someone re-speak what is being broadcast. Live captioning is also a form of real-time text. Meanwhile, sport events on channels like ESPN are using court reporters, using a special (steno) keyboard and individually constructed [...] "dictionaries." ...|$|E
