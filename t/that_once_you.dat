At the end of 2011, Slant Magazine listed [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] as the eighth best song of the year, with Ed Gonzalez from the website commenting that the song is [...] "a study in radical contrast <b>that,</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> sift aside its deliberately dated effects {{and the legacy of}} the late Clarence Clemons, is deep down an incredibly delicate ballad. Yes, everyone expects Gaga to make her confessions on the dance floor, but who knew she could make her shouts whisper?" [...] It was placed at the same rank by Billboard, and at position seven by Rolling Stone. In September 2013, the saxophone solo ranked number two on VH1's list of the 15 Greatest Guest Solos in Rock History.|$|E
500|$|Khánh {{presided over}} their trial of Đính {{and his colleagues}} on 28 May 1964. The generals were interrogated for {{five and a half}} hours, mostly about details of their coup against Diệm, rather than the {{original}} charge of promoting neutralism. As all of the officers were involved in Diệm's overthrow, the hearings did not reveal any new information. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Khánh stated, [...] "We ask <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody". The tribunal then [...] "congratulated" [...] the generals, but found that they were of [...] "lax morality" [...] and unqualified to command due to a [...] "lack of a clear political concept". They were chastised for being [...] "inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility" [...] and of letting [...] "their subordinates take advantage of their positions". Đính's quartet were allowed to remain in Đà Lạt under surveillance.|$|E

He went into further detail on Front Row, in which he was asked if this was a shift in his beliefs: [...] "A shift in me in the sense I heard my father talk to me when I was in the garden one day. But I'm absolutely certain that what I heard was my memories of my father. An engram, or something in my head...This is not about God, but somewhere around there is where gods come from." ...|$|E

500|$|Fodor's called The Dime Store [...] "bright and hip", {{offering}} [...] "office {{workers and}} hotel guests a much-appreciated source of seasonally driven, well-prepared comfort fare". Cizmar wrote a positive {{review of the}} restaurant in August 2014, in which he paid tribute to Leo's and described his two $1 extras (an egg on his BLT and maple syrup for his pancakes) as [...] "the best two dollars [...] spent all week". That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels {{a bit like the}} diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that no one seems to touch; just quick enough service <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> start questioning whether or not you'll get another cup of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics. All-in-all it's one of the only places you can go in Downtown and feel like you're transported somewhere else entirely.|$|E
500|$|Most of the {{technical}} aspects of development—game direction, scripting, and programming—were handled by Hato alone, with fellow artist Damurushi assisting with some minor aspects of the script and art direction. Despite this, most of the roughly seven-month period Hato spent developing Hatoful from a one-off April Fools' gag to the finished product was dedicated to the construction of the narrative. Hato's approach towards the game's writing was [...] "to create something that seems ridiculous and crazy at first glance, but <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> look into the world, you would fall into the depth"; however, resolving the darker elements of the plot, particularly the Bad Boys Love scenario, with facts established in the quickly conceived and largely comedic pilot proved to be difficult for her, with inconsistencies in the overall timeline becoming a major concern. During the writing process, Hato admitted that she was critical of the scenarios she had written and constantly doubted whether the final product [...] "turned out well", later remarking in a postscript written for the game's official guidebook: ...|$|E
500|$|The generals were {{secretly}} interrogated {{for five}} and a half hours, mostly about details of their coup against Diệm, rather than the original charge of promoting neutralism. As all of the officers were involved in the plot against Diệm, this did not reveal any information new to them. The court deliberated for over nine hours, and when it reconvened for the verdict, Khánh stated, [...] "We ask <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody". The tribunal then [...] "congratulated" [...] the generals, but found that they were of [...] "lax morality" [...] and unqualified to command due to a [...] "lack of a clear political concept". They were chastised for being [...] "inadequately aware of their heavy responsibility" [...] and of letting [...] "their subordinates take advantage of their positions". Khánh also assailed Dinh, claiming that he had derogatorily compared Khánh to Gamal Abdel Nasser in a meeting with Diệm. The four imprisoned generals were allowed to remain in Da Lat under surveillance with their families. However, there were reports that the trial ended in a festive manner akin to a party, as the officers shook hands and made up with one another. All four generals were barred from commanding troops for a period; Kim was banned for six years, and Don 18 months. Offices were prepared for the quartet so that they could participate in [...] "research and planning". Worried that the group of idle officers would plot against him, Khánh made some preliminary arrangements to send them to the United States for military study, but this fell through.|$|E

2500|$|When first released, [...] "Brand New Key" [...] {{was banned}} by some radio {{stations}} because some heard sexual innuendo in the lyrics. Melanie has acknowledged {{the possibility of}} reading an unintended sexual innuendo in the song, stating, [...] "I wrote [...] in about fifteen minutes one night. I thought it was cute; a kind of old thirties tune. I guess a key and a lock have always been Freudian symbols, and pretty obvious ones at that. There was no deep serious expression behind the song, but people read things into it. They made up incredible stories {{as to what the}} lyrics said and what the song meant. In some places, it was even banned from the radio [...] My idea about songs is <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> write them, you have very little say in their life afterward [...] People will take it any way they want to take it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Khánh {{presided over}} {{the trial of the}} MRC members, which took place in May 1964. Minh was accused of misusing money before being allowed to serve as an advisor on the trial panel. The generals were interrogated for five and a half hours, and the {{military}} court deliberated for over nine hours. When it reconvened for the verdict, Khánh stated, [...] "We ask <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> begin to serve again in the army, you do not take revenge on anybody".

2500|$|The love {{triangle}} of Sharon, Nick and Phyllis garnered attention {{and was considered}} one of the genre's most titillating storylines. Soap Opera Digest named it the [...] "Best Love Triangle". Jamaica Gleaner was enthralled by the twists and turns of the love triangle and published an interview with Michelle Stafford; the newspaper asked whether Nick would end his ten-year marriage to Sharon and rather enter into an official romance with her pregnant character Phyllis. Stafford replied, [...] "In a perfect world, she'd wish [...] Nick's. But he's married; he's not going to leave Sharon. And she doesn't want him to." [...] The triangle was also a topic of debate during its run. Daniel R. Coleridge of TV Guide labeled the week Phyllis discovered she was expecting as a [...] "can't-miss week" [...] for the popular triangle. Aubrey Hammack, a writer for AuthorsDen, analysed the storyline and published an article on the matter of adultery. He cited the storyline as realistic, [...] "Men are notorious for saying; I can separate my sexual side from my emotions. [...] Well, unless you are a person without a conscience, this is impossible. [...] Most men just don’t realize <b>that</b> <b>once</b> <b>you</b> have sex with someone, that the emotions kick in not to mention the feelings of being in love and caring about that someone you are having the affair with. [...] When this happens, things spin wildly out of control." [...] With Phyllis and Nick gaining a fan following, On-Air On-Soaps referred to this as the [...] "Phick vs. Shick" [...] fan-base war.|$|E
