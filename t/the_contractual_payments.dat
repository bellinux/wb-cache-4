40|$|To {{foster the}} {{development}} of the biomasses for solid fuel it is fundamental to build up a strategy at a local level in which co-exists farms as well as industrial farms. To such aim, it is necessary to implement an effective vertical coordination between the stakeholders with the definition of a contract that prevents opportunistic behaviors and guarantees the industrial investments of constant supplies over the time. Starting from a project that foresees a biomasses power plant in the south of Italy, this study reflects on the payments to fix in an eventual contract in such a way to maintain the fidelity of the farmers. These one have a greater flexibility since they can choose the most convenient crop. Therefore, their fidelity can be obtained tying <b>the</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>payments</b> to the price of the main alternative crop to the energetic one. The results of the study seem to indicate the opportunity to fix a purchase price of the raw materials linked to the one of durum wheat that is the most widespread crop in the territory and the one that depends more on a volatile market. Using the data of the District 12 of the province of Foggia Water Consortium with an area of 11. 300 hectares (instead of the 20. 000 demanded in the proposal), it has been possible to organize approximately 600 enterprises in five cluster, each of them identified by a representative farm. With a model of linear programming, we have run different simulations taking into account the possibility to grow sorghum in different ways. Through an aggregation process, it has been calculated that farmers may find it convenient to supply the energetic crop at a price of 50 &euro;/t when the price of durum wheat is 150 &euro;/t. Anyway, this price is lower than the one offered by firm that is planning to build the power plant. Moreover, it has been identified a strong correlation between the price of the durum wheat and the price that makes convenient for the farmers to grow the sorghum. When the price of wheat goes up to 400 &euro;/t then the price that must be paid to the farmers for the energetic crop is 70 &euro;/t. Even though these results offer no definitive indications about the economic convenience of industrial firms to pay greater prices for the biomasses, they represent an important step towards the definition of contractual clauses that may prevent phenomena of hold-up and moral hazard...|$|E

The existing empirical literature on leases typically tries to explain one period’s lease payment, ignoring how fast those payments are scheduled to grow, or whether the lease contains option features. This paper bridges the gap between the two literatures by providing the first empirical investigation of an internally consistent lease pricing model.

5000|$|Research of Nöldeke & Schmidt (1995) {{argued that}} the underinvestment problem due to the hold-up problem is {{eliminated}} if parties are able to write a simple option contract.

However, such a contract is unachievable unless it is possible to enforce the payments conditional on the delivery decision of the seller. That means that the court must be able to verify delivery of the good to the buyer by the seller. [...] The possibility was ruled out in earlier research where it was assumed that when trade fails, it is not possible for the court to distinguish whether the buyer did not accept the delivery or the seller refused to supply.|$|R
40|$|In {{developed}} countries in everyday business, payment delays often present a problem. Payment delays {{have already been}} a matter of discussion in Slovenia for several years. Irrespective of some positive movements in the past years, the state of payment discipline in Slovenia is not at a satisfactory level. In this area, Slovenia could be classified among the less successful countries when compared to other countries in Europe. Our paper determines factors behind this fact. The findings are important not only for Slovenia, but also for other EU candidate countries faced with similar problems of transition. The paper has led to the following conclusions. Firstly, the more indebted companies have longer payment delays. Secondly, <b>the</b> longer <b>the</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> period, <b>the</b> shorter the payment delay. Longer payment periods are mostly received by larger companies. And thirdly, the longer the payment delays on the side of companies. buyers, the higher the incidence of late payments by the company.

40|$|We are {{now ready}} to draw {{together}} the main strands of the development so far: (i) expectations of discrete and continuous random variables defined as functions of a life-table waiting time T until death, and (ii) discounting of future payment (streams) based on interest-rate assumptions. The approach is first to define <b>the</b> <b>contractual</b> terms of and discuss relations between the major sorts of insurance, endowment and life annuity contracts, and next to use interest theory to define {{the present value of}} <b>the</b> <b>contractual</b> <b>payment</b> stream by <b>the</b> insurer as a nonrandom function of the random individual lifetime T. In each case, this leads to a formula for the expected present value of the payout by the insurer, an amount called the net single premium or net single risk premium of the contract because it is the single cash payment by the insured {{at the beginning of the}} insurance period which would exactly compensate for the average of the future payments which the insurer will have to make. The details of the further mathematical discussion fall into two parts: first, the specification of formulas in terms of cohort life-table quantities for net single premiums of insurances and annuities which pay only at whole-year intervals; and second, the application of the various survival assumptions concerning interpolation between whole years of age, to obtain the corresponding formulas for insurances and annuities which have m payment times per year. We close this Chapter with a discussion of instantaneous-payment insurance, 97 98 CHAPTER 4. EXPECTED PRESENT VALUES OF PAYMENTS continuous-payment annuity, and mean-residual-life formulas, all of which involve continuous-time expectation integrals.

Similar and parallel discussions can be found in the Life Contingencies book of Jordan (1967) and the Actuarial Mathematics book of Bowers et al. (1986). The approach here differs in unifying concepts by discussing together all of the different contracts, first in the whole-year case, next under interpolation assumptions in the m-times-per-year case, and finally in the instantaneous case...|$|R

40|$|Many {{financial}} claims specify fixed maximum payments, varying seniority, and absolute priority for more senior investors. These features are motivated {{in a model}} where a firm’s manager contracts with several investors and firm output can only be verified privately at a cost.

Using common biophysical scoring methods, in combination with economic data and simple optimization methods, an illustration is provided for how to identify a set of priority land parcels for conservation invest-ment. This study also demonstrates a way in which conservation agencies can incorporate concerns about biophysical thresholds in the identification of their priority land parcels. These methods are applied using Geographic Information System data from a New York conservation easement acqui-sition initiative for water quality protection. Key Words: conservation, spatial, threshold, water quality Concerns over the effect of private land use on the supply of environmental amenities have led to an increasing global reliance on conservation contract-ing initiatives (Ferraro and Kiss, 2002).

40|$|Concerns {{over the}} effects of private land use on the supply of {{environmental}} amenities have led to an increasing global reliance on conservation contracting initiatives (Ferraro and Kiss 2002).

Such contracts include easements and short-term conservation leases. A key issue in the design of conservation contracting initiatives, as with any conservation policy, is how to integrate information about spatially variable biophysical and economic conditions into a cost-effective plan. Much of the previous work on targeting scarce conservation funds has focused on the conservation of biological diversity. Targeting approaches favored by biological scientists and conservationists emphasize the environmental amenities that a given land unit produces, while often ignoring the costs of acquiring those amenities. For example, Dobson et al. (1997), based on their finding that endangered species in the United States were concentrated spatially, suggest that conservationists should focus their efforts on a small number of geographic areas. In response, Ando et al. (1998) assert that variability in economic factors {{is just as important as}} ecological variability in efficient species conservation, specifically noting that an approach that considers both economic and ecological variability could cost less than one-sixth the cost of an approach considering only ecological variability.
