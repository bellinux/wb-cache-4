5|$|The {{international}} US-based {{credit rating}} agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch—which {{have already been}} under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis. On one hand, the agencies {{have been accused of}} giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies have a tendency to act conservatively, and to take some <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> when a firm or country is in trouble. In the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such.|$|E

Larsson took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> to working and living in a foreign country and could only muster a modest 6 goals in 27 appearances in his first season. His goalscoring record improved in subsequent seasons, but he continued to be unsettled and frustrated by a combination of ever-changing coaches, being played in unfamiliar positions and latterly the club's player-rotation policy which saw him being substituted fifty or sixty minutes into a match even when playing well.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{throughout}} the African continent, wildlife populations have been rapidly declining due to logging, civil wars, pollution, poaching, {{and other human}} factors. A 17-year-long civil war, along with severe drought, negatively impacted Ethiopia's environmental conditions, leading to even greater habitat degradation. Habitat destruction is a factor that leads to endangerment. When changes to a habitat occur rapidly, animals do not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust.</b> Human impact threatens many species, with greater threats expected {{as a result of}} climate change induced by greenhouse gases. With carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 of 6,494,000 tonnes, Ethiopia contributes just 0.02% to the annual human-caused release of greenhouse gases.|$|E

30|$|At each {{iteration}} of {{the penalty}} method, whenever rate constraints are active, {{the solution of}} (41) cannot be smaller than that of (9 – 15) since it is a relaxation. Notice that problem (41) is quite simple since it has a single constraint for the transmit power {{but it has to}} be solved many <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> the weights of the real time users. In weight adjustment algorithms such as [13], the user weights are increased at each time slot using an increasing function of the packets delay, so the computation task is distributed over time. However, this distributed approach does not guarantee that the rate requirements are met in a given time slot which can lead to delay violations and jitter.|$|R
25|$|Any wind {{stronger}} than a light breeze {{can contribute to}} a rapid accumulation of snow on sheltered slopes downwind. Wind slab forms quickly and, if present, weaker snow below the slab may not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> to the new load. Even on a clear day, wind can quickly load a slope with snow by blowing snow {{from one place to}} another. Top-loading occurs when wind deposits snow from the top of a slope; cross-loading occurs when wind deposits snow parallel to the slope. When a wind blows over the top of a mountain, the leeward, or downwind, side of the mountain experiences top-loading, from the top to the bottom of that lee slope. When the wind blows across a ridge that leads up the mountain, the leeward side of the ridge is subject to cross-loading. Cross-loaded wind-slabs are usually difficult to identify visually.|$|E
25|$|Mandžukić {{first began}} the season slowly, having small issues {{adjusting}} to new Bayern coach Pep Guardiola's system. Guardiola changed Bayern's formation from the 4–2–3–1 {{they had used}} previously under Jupp Heynckes to a new 4–1–4–1 style. While it took a bit of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust,</b> Mandžukić regained his form nonetheless in time for league play. He opened the new season in the Bundesliga by scoring two goals in two league appearances. Mandžukić scored his first Champions League goal of the season when Bayern Munich began the defence of their Champions League title against CSKA Moscow with a 3–0 victory at the Allianz Arena. He headed the only goal as Bayern defeated a valiant FC Viktoria Plzeň in November {{to move into the}} knockout stages with a record-equalling ninth successive UEFA Champions League win. Mandžukić scored his tenth goal of the new Bundesliga season in a December match against Hamburger SV.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the target}} failed to stay {{centered}} in the sighting telescope {{when it was first}} set up. Instead, due to inaccuracies in the estimated wind speed and direction, the target would drift in the sight. To correct for this, the bombardier would use fine-tuning controls to slowly cancel out any motion through trial and error. These adjustments had the effect of updating the measured ground speed used to calculate the motion of the prisms, slowing the visible drift. Over {{a short period of time}} of continual adjustments, the drift would stop, and the bombsight would now hold an extremely accurate measurement of the exact ground speed and heading. Better yet, these measurements were being carried out on the bomb run, not before it, and helped eliminate inaccuracies due to changes in the conditions as the aircraft moved. And by eliminating the manual calculations, the bombardier was left with much more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> his measurements, and thus settle at a much more accurate result.|$|E

25|$|Pitches in New Zealand, {{like the}} ones at Eden Park, Auckland and Basin Reserve, Wellington can have a green tinge similar to their {{counterparts}} in England. These cricket grounds are amongst the most picturesque in the world. The ball swings a lot due to the proximity of most grounds to the sea, relative humidity and moisture under the surface. New Zealand pitches are often bouncy and quick in nature due to the usual grass cover left on them. The grass cover offers seam movement early on, but also maintains {{the integrity of the}} pitch which can often dampen the effect of spin bowling but allows pitches to flatten out {{over the course of a}} match. Batting can be trying early on and batsman often take <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> to the conditions. As they are often in open stadiums bowlers can frequently be assisted by winds that increase the speed the batsmen faces the ball at one end. At the other end, the wind acts as a wall and decreases the pace on the ball and as result adjusting to this is often the most trying part for a visiting team.|$|E

500|$|At the {{hospital}} of La Pitié, he studied under internal pathologist Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis, who demonstrated the ineffectiveness of bloodletting, {{which had been}} a mainstay of medical practice since antiquity. Dr. Louis {{was one of the}} fathers of the méthode expectante, a therapeutic doctrine that states the physician's role is {{to do everything possible to}} aid nature in the process of disease recovery, and to do nothing to hinder this natural process. Upon his return to Boston, Holmes became one of the country's leading proponents of the méthode expectante. Holmes was awarded his M.D. from Harvard in 1836; he wrote his dissertation on acute pericarditis. His first collection of poetry was published later that year, but Holmes, ready to begin his medical career, wrote it off as a one-time event. In the book's introduction, he mused: [...] "Already engaged in other duties, it has been with some effort that I have found <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> my own mantle; and I now willingly retire to more quiet labors, which, if less exciting, are more certain to be acknowledged as useful and received with gratitude".|$|E

500|$|Paine begins The Age of Reason {{by attacking}} revelation. Revelation, he maintains, {{can only be}} {{verified}} by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God's existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles, writing: [...] "it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it". He {{also points out that}} the Christian revelations appear to have altered over <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> for changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging and universal evidence of God's existence is the natural world. [...] "The Bible of the Deist", he contends, should not be a human invention such as the Bible, but rather a divine invention—it should be [...] "creation". Paine takes this argument even further, maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of The Age of Reason, he will do just this, pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible. For example Thomas Paine notes, [...] " [...] The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him {{to the top of a}} high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World.

After watching Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, however, Yoshimura believed Fleder would be perfect to direct [...] "Subway" [...] because he felt that Fleder could provide strong visuals to a story that took place in one location, and prevent the script from becoming too static and boring. Upon being offered the job, Fleder thought that it would be a challenge due to most of the action being confined to a single set, but accepted the director position based on the strength of Yoshimura's script:, [...] "The script was terrific. And for me, the big issue from day one was, 'How do I not screw it up?'" [...] Yoshimura said that feature directors often struggle with Homicide: Life on the Street because they are used to working at a slower and more deliberate pace than the typical eight-day filming period of a single episode. Additionally, Yoshimura said, they have little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> to the regular cast and crew, which he described as a [...] "closed community [...] used to shooting or working a certain way on this show, and then have their rhythms and their patterns and their habits".|$|E
