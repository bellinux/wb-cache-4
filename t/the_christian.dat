5|$|During the First Austrian Republic, pan-Germanists were {{represented}} by the Greater German People's Party and the agrarian Landbund. Although initially influential, these two groups soon lost most of their voters to <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Social Party and the Social Democratic Party. Both <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Socials and the Social Democrats accepted that unification between Austria and Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. A conflict would develop, however, between those who supported an Austrian national identity, such as <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Socials, and those rooted in German nationalism, such as the Social Democrats.|$|E
5|$|For example, <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Church uses musical {{instruments}} in worship (known as <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Church), whereas the Churches of Christ believe acappella singing to be proper. In addition, {{there was also}} disagreement over the appropriateness of organizational structures above the congregational level, {{such as those of}} missionary societies and funding orphanages.|$|E

The atheotatous accusation seems to be widespread among the pagan view of <b>Christians,</b> given that <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> had no temples or statues of deities and did not perform sacrifices. This made <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> comparable to other uncivilised peoples who had no gods either, such as the barbaric Scythians or nomadic Libyans. The charge had a long life and survived even into the fourth century.|$|R

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. <b>The</b> <b>Christian</b> Brothers sold the property in 1989 because of declining market shares and vineyard yields, {{and the costs of}} seismically retrofitting Greystone. The Heublein Company of Canada purchased the property and marketing rights to <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Brothers' brands in 1990, shortly after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occurred. The earthquake damaged the Greystone Cellars building, rendering the northern portion of the building unusable.|$|E

As <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> settled down in Seringapatam, they slowly reorganised themselves with the elders forming a secret group named the [...] "Council of Ten", to help keep their faith alive. According to Balthazar of Belthangadi, in the [...] "Council of Ten", <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> met {{from time to time}} to deliberate on issues concerning the community.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Christians</b> {{who left}} Goa were skilled {{cultivators}} who abandoned their irrigated fields in Goa to achieve freedom. At {{the time of}} migration, Canara was ruled by the Bednore King Shivappa Naik (1540–60). He evinced great interest {{in the development of}} agriculture in his empire and welcomed these farmers to his fertile lands. This was confirmed by Francis Buchanan, a Scottish physician, when he visited Canara in 1801. In his book, A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar (1807), he stated that [...] "The princes of the house of Ikeri had given great encouragement to <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> and had induced 80,000of them to settle in Tuluva." [...] Later, this was identified as a probable mistake and should have read [...] "8,000". However even this figure included the second emigration of <b>Christians</b> from Goa. <b>The</b> <b>Christians</b> were also recruited into the armies of the Bednore dynasty. The Hindus left <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> severely alone. <b>The</b> local Brahmins ignored <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> even those of Brahmin origin. On account of their change of religion, they refused to associate with them and did not admit them into their houses. Like the local Brahmins, the Bunts, who were largely self-sufficient in South Canara, also never associated with <b>the</b> <b>Christians.</b> A closer contact was, however, kept by <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> with Goan Hindus of the same caste who were, like <b>the</b> <b>Christians,</b> refugees from Goa. <b>The</b> <b>Christians</b> used to invite their Hindu relatives to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings and funeral feasts, and the Hindus used to [...] accept such invitations.|$|R
50|$|An {{advantage}} for <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> was their numerical superiority in guns and cannon aboard their ships, {{as well as}} the superior quality of the Spanish infantry. It is estimated that <b>the</b> <b>Christians</b> had 1,815 guns, while the Turks had only 750 with insufficient ammunition. <b>The</b> <b>Christians</b> embarked with their much improved arquebusier and musketeer forces, while the Ottomans trusted in their greatly feared composite bowmen.|$|R

While all Christian radio formats are covered by <b>the</b> <b>Christian</b> Songs chart, it is dominated by Christian adult contemporary (Christian AC) radio stations, which cater to a mostly adult audience. As opposed to Christian stations that cater to young audiences, Christian AC stations tend to play hits often and for long periods.
