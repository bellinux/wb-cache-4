50|$|<b>Triboluminescence</b> {{is often}} used as a synonym for fractoluminescence (a term {{sometimes}} used when referring only to light emitted from fractured crystals). <b>Triboluminescence</b> differs from piezoluminescence in that a piezoluminescent material emits light when it is deformed, as opposed to broken.

5000|$|Materials {{scientists}} {{have not yet}} arrived at {{a full understanding of}} the effect, but the current theory of <b>triboluminescence</b> [...] - [...] based upon crystallographic, spectroscopic, and other experimental evidence [...] - [...] is that upon fracture of asymmetrical materials, charge is separated. When the charges recombine, the electric discharge ionizes the surrounding air, causing a flash of light. Research further suggests that crystals which display <b>triboluminescence</b> must lack symmetry (thus being anisotropic in order to permit charge separation) and be poor conductors. However, there are substances which break this rule, and which do not possess asymmetry, yet display <b>triboluminescence</b> anyway, such as hexakis(antipyrine)terbium iodide. [...] It is thought that these materials contain impurities, which confer properties of asymmetry to the substance.|$|E

5000|$|Fractoluminescence {{is often}} used as a synonym for <b>triboluminescence.</b> [...] It is the {{emission}} {{of light from the}} fracture (rather than rubbing) of a crystal, but fracturing often occurs with rubbing. Depending upon the atomic and molecular composition of the crystal, when the crystal fractures a charge separation can occur making one side of the fractured crystal positively charged and the other side negatively charged. Like in <b>triboluminescence,</b> if the charge separation results in a large enough electric potential, a discharge across the gap and through the bath gas between the interfaces can occur. The potential at which this occurs depends upon the dielectric properties of the bath gas.|$|E

These crystals were formed into a large solid cone for transport and sale. This solid cone of sugar had to be broken into usable chunks using a device known as sugar nips.

5000|$|During the American Physical Society's 2014 March meeting, {{research}} was provided that gave {{a possible explanation}} for the reason why bright lights sometimes appear during an earthquake. The research stated that when two layers of the same material rub against each other, voltage is generated. The researcher, Professor Troy Shinbrot of Rutgers University, conducted lab experiments with different types of grains to mimic the crust of the earth and emulated the occurrence of earthquakes. [...] "When the grains split open, they measured a positive voltage spike, and when the split closed, a negative spike." [...] The crack allows the voltage to discharge into the air which then electrifies the air and creates a bright electrical light when it does so. According to the research provided, they have produced these voltage spikes every single time with every material tested. While the reason for such an occurrence was not provided, Professor Troy Shinbrot referenced the light to a phenomenon called <b>triboluminescence.</b> Researchers hope that by getting {{to the bottom of this}} phenomenon, it will provide more information that will allow seismologists to better predict earthquakes.|$|E
5000|$|Chlorophane, also {{sometimes}} known as pyroemerald, cobra stone, and pyrosmaragd, {{is a rare}} variety of the mineral fluorite with the unusual combined properties of thermoluminescence, thermophosphoresence, <b>triboluminescence,</b> and fluorescence: it will emit light in the visible spectrum when exposed to ultraviolet light, when heated, and when rubbed; if heated, {{it will continue to}} emit light {{for a period of time}} after a heat source is withdrawn. The small amount of heat generated by being held in the hand has been reported as enough to induce luminiscence, though this may be the result of experimental error. [...] Although chemically very similar to fluorite, chlorophane has several impurities including magnesium, aluminum, manganese, and traces of iron and sodium (none of which occur in fluorite). [...] it was still not known which if any of these impurities imparts to chlorophane the luminescent properties that distinguish it from fluorite. [...] Some samples of chlorophane, particularly those exposed to high temperatures, will only luminiscence once or will do so with only weakened intensity over time. [...] A very bright luminescence can be achieved at between 200 C and 300 C, and mineralogists once believed that it would glow indefinitely at temperatures of just 30 C, meaning that when exposed on the ground in warmer climates, the mineral would glow year-round. This effect, which was reported many times without having been observed, was eventually attributed in part to a combination of both heat and light acting on the mineral.|$|E
40|$|High time-resolved {{observation}} of <b>triboluminescence</b> {{was made for}} crystalline sucrose. A cleavage test along the plane (001) and a uniaxial compression test in which the load axis was perpendicular to the plane (001) were made. <b>Triboluminescence</b> was observed simultaneously at the time cleavage began.

In the uniaxial compression test, there are two cases. The one case is that a crack generation accompanies <b>triboluminescence</b> and acoustic emission. The other case is that a crack generation accompanies only an acoustic emission. This difference in the two cases is explained by the difference in crack mode (tensile or shear).

40|$|<b>Triboluminescence</b> at {{a failure}} of Tsukuba granite was examined. The {{intensity}} of <b>triboluminescence</b> was determined by photo-counting at a time resolution of 100 microseconds. The pattern of TL activities of each sample is classified into a sequence of the precursory activity, the burst of <b>triboluminescence</b> at failure, and the following decaying after-glow and is extremely similar to {{the pattern of the}} fore-shock-main-shock-aftershock sequences for natural eathquakes. The after-glow continues rather long time compared to the process-time of sample failure. The variation of the after-glow intensity as a function of time can be expressed by the same equation for aftershock activities of natural earthquakes; C 1 = U+D) A, where I is the intensity of <b>triboluminescence</b> at time t which is measured from a moment of failure and A, C, and D are constants. The constant A ranges from 0. 5 to 0. 82. The after-glow was shown to be sustained by consecutive generation of cracks in fragments without being subjected to any external force. Most of the samples showed tangilble precursory activities of <b>triboluminescence</b> which were observed up to twenty milliseconds prior to failure of samples.

Preliminary testing has been performed using ZnS:Mn in a specially constructed drop tower. For these tests a 0. 13 kg spherical mass was dropped from various heights in air, and the emission intensity was measured. Through the use of specific fluor material, it is believed that sensors can be developed that will indicate the occurrence of an impact and its location. To apply <b>triboluminescence</b> as a damage sensor, it would need to be incorporated into some type of smart material or coating. This combination would need to have a phosphor suspended and evenly distributed in a resin that would then cover a grid of optical fiber. The optical fibers would be used to capture the emitted light and transmit it to a series of detectors. Through the careful monitoring of the detectors, the entire exterior of a spacecraft could be a passive sensor that can locate and determine the impact velocity or energy of a debris strike. Through the development process, other uses of the system will no doubt be generated...|$|E
