25|$|The {{external}} {{design of the}} Class 87 was clearly derived {{from that of the}} Class 86; the only major detail differences were two front cab windows on the 87 instead of the three of the 86, and also the lack of headcode indicator boxes; by 1973, visual recognition of <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> numbers by signallers was no longer necessary. The power and speed of the Class 87 was increased over that of the Class 86. Power output was increased to 5000hp to deal with the more demanding gradients on the northern half of the WCML such as Shap Fell and Beattock Summit, and the top speed was raised to 110mph (180km/h). The 87s were also fitted with multiple working equipment which enabled locomotives to work {{with other members of the}} class (and some Class 86s) while controlled by one driver.|$|E
500|$|The charter <b>train,</b> <b>reporting</b> number 1Z67, was a steam-hauled {{passenger}} train, the 16:35 Cathedrals Express charter from [...] to , Essex. The {{train was}} hauled by Battle of Britain-class locomotive 34067 Tangmere (TOPS number 98767). Tangmere was hauling thirteen carriages, which were {{a mixture of}} Mk 1s and Mk 2s. The train was operated by WCRC. There were 477 passengers and 39 staff on board the train.|$|E
2500|$|The Department of the Environment {{report on}} the {{collision}} was published on 4 March 1976 and tests showed no equipment fault on the train. Postmortem evidence indicated that, {{at the time of}} impact, the driver's hand was on the [...] "dead man's handle", rather than {{in front of his face}} to protect it, implying he had made no attempt to stop. Witnesses were interviewed; some passengers on the <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> that the train accelerated when entering the station, and some witnesses standing in the station reported that the driver, 56-year-old Leslie Newson, was sitting upright in his seat and looking straight ahead as the train passed through the station. The state of the motor-control gear, as found after the accident, indicated that power had been applied to the motors until within two seconds of the impact.|$|E

50|$|Only 183 men who {{had been}} on the <b>train</b> <b>reported</b> for {{roll-call}} on the next morning of December 13. More than 100 others either died in hospitals in the region, or while being transported to them, during the next 15 days. The number of fatalities came to approximately 700.|$|R
50|$|By 1976, the {{replacement}} of the huge number of manual signal boxes with centralised power-signalling coupled with computer-based train control and more modern telecommunications systems meant that it was no longer necessary to display headcodes throughout the railway network. Outside the Southern Region blinds were set to 00 or 0000, and discs/lamps to the former express passenger code. Roller blinds were later blanked or plated over to show two dots and new trains introduced for service outside the Southern Region after this time usually had no <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> number display equipment. Many trains intended to run over Southern Region lines were designed to display the numeric route-code portion of the <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> number, which they still display, usually as a dot-matrix display.|$|E
50|$|Three {{different}} headboard {{designs were}} used. Under the GWR {{there was no}} headboard, although the three-digit GWR <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> number was carried: 016, 116 (down trains from London), 470, 473 (up trains from Bristol). When the first post-war BR Bristolian was reintroduced in 1951 {{there was still no}} headboard.|$|E
50|$|<b>Train</b> <b>reporting</b> {{numbers are}} used on Australian railway {{networks}} to help network operators coordinate train movements and by other users to identify trains. These numbers are used similarly to airline flight numbers and {{are important for}} trains {{to be able to}} identify themselves to network controllers and local railway users. These numbers are in addition to other numbers which may be used by train operators for internal train management purposes. <b>Train</b> <b>reporting</b> numbers were originated in the United Kingdom and the Australian system resembles the UK system somewhat, reflecting the descendental development of the Australian rail networks from the UK system. As with all other elements of the Australian rail network however, each state has developed its own numbering system and whilst some share similarities, they are all different numbering systems. Systems generally include an origin and/or destination, though differ in their inclusion of identifiers for operator, up/down, type of train, contents of train and other characteristics of the train.|$|E
50|$|<b>Train</b> <b>reported</b> {{for duty}} to the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, in June 1894, then in October 1894 became a naval member of the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia. In June 1896 he became a {{lighthouse}} inspector in the Fourth District, serving in that capacity until 1898.|$|R
30|$|Beyond {{the pursuit}} of a college degree, {{specific}} areas of <b>training</b> <b>reported</b> included curriculum, health and safety, Montessori training, cognitive, executive function, social/emotional. There were no significant replies that occurred as a majority. The array of replies included 60 different topics. However, use of text analyses revealed that areas relevant to either program planning or behavior were categorically present in the majority of replies. Interesting to the current project was {{the fact that there were}} no noted <b>training</b> areas <b>reported</b> that included the words ‘communication’ or ‘technology’ nor any mention of the state mandated systems for <b>reporting</b> educator <b>training.</b>|$|R
50|$|CITYFLO 650 {{signalling}} is a CBTC {{system designed}} by Bombardier Transportation. It {{makes use of}} bi-directional radio communication between trains and wayside equipment, as well as true moving block technology, to control <b>train</b> operation. <b>Trains</b> <b>report</b> their position via radio, and a wayside signalling system provides movement authorities to the trains via a radio link.|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{situation}} arose {{with the}} opening of the Channel Tunnel: many continental <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> numbers are all numeric. Eurostar trains therefore have a 9Oxx or 9Ixx reporting number in Britain and a corresponding 90xx or 91xx number on the continent, neatly utilising the similarity between the letters O and I and the numbers 0 and 1 to unite the two reporting number systems.|$|E

50|$|The driver initialises the CSR with an {{area code}} {{followed}} by the identification number of the signal {{in front of the}} train. The radio then automatically sends the stock number of the train (e.g., 455112), to the signalling system. The signaller then allocates a <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> number (e.g., 2M34) to the train. This reporting number is used by the signalling equipment to track the progress of the train as it moves through the rail network.|$|E

50|$|Historically <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> {{numbers were}} used to denote trains in the {{internal}} working timetable. These contained one or more letters or numbers to either uniquely identify a particular train, or denote its route (particularly on busier lines). Not all lines used these and the details and extent of the practice varied widely between companies. Although these numbers were in many places confined to timetables and other documentation, in some busier areas they were actually shown {{at the head of}} the train.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} railways, the {{reporting}} number was on occasion {{displayed at the}} head of the train along with the lamp headcode. This happened more often than not with special trains or other unusual trains (e.g. summer Saturday timetables), to allow signallers to identify unfamiliar trains and route them correctly. This code was sometimes either chalked onto the locomotive front or pasted as paper characters onto a headcode disc. The GWR sometimes used a three-character frame mounted on the locomotive smokebox in which the <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> number could be displayed.|$|E
50|$|The {{national}} interstate {{network is}} {{operated by the}} Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC). The ARTC uses a systemwide <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> number based on letters and numbers to identify trains operating on its network. The train operating number is different depending on the network to which the train is operating, being the Interstate Network, the Heavy Haul (Hunter Valley Coal) Network or the ARTC managed sections of lines within state boundaries (Intrastate Networks). Passenger trains are sometimes numbered differently. Other systems are used for specific circumstances, for example light running engines, maintenance trains, or heritage trains.|$|E

5000|$|The {{line was}} heavily used during World War I and World War II, with extra Air Ministry sidings {{provided}} at Dereham in 1943. [...] In {{the early days}} of the war, Dereham was used as a reception centre for the construction materials used to build the local airfields. In early 1944 Dereham was handling an average of 75 wagon loads of construction material per day. The line was also defended by an armoured <b>train,</b> <b>reporting</b> as Train G, based at Heacham and using F4 2-4-2 tank locomotive 7189 as motive power. The armoured train was frequently used on the Wells line, and once collided with some empty coaches at Wells.|$|E
50|$|A {{train describer}} is {{originally}} an additional apparatus at British railways that {{ensures that the}} identity of each train is displayed on the signalbox panel together with the indication of that train's presence, usually offering routing information. This routing information would then be passed through to the platform display for passenger information. Technically the <b>train</b> <b>reporting</b> number was pushed from one signal box to the next. A series of interconnected signal boxes form a train describer system (TDS) transferring train describer data to be shown on the respective signalbox panel in a train describer display. The electric relay interlocking boxes were later replaced by electronic control boards where the train indication is just a text element on the video display.|$|E
5000|$|This {{designation}} {{covered all}} 309 locomotives as built, but {{with such a}} large number of locomotives and with two companies involved in the building, there were several differences within this sub-class alone. The most visible external difference was that the first 119 locos had a [...] "split" [...] headcode box; for these locos the four digit <b>Train</b> <b>reporting</b> number was shown in two square boxes containing two digits and separated by a pair of doors designed to allow the train crew to be exchanged while in motion. Later locomotives had a single centrally placed headcode box, and also had the horns mounted on the roof rather than built into the nose of the locomotive. This difference was the reason for the double change in numbers when implementing the TOPS scheme described earlier.|$|E
